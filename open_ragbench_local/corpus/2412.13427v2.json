InTRODUCTION\n\nA Borel set $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with positive, finite Lebesgue measure is termed a spectral set if the space $L^{2}(\\Omega)$ admits an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. This concept, central to functional analysis, gained prominence with Fuglede's 1974 conjecture [12], which posited that $\\Omega$ is a spectral set if and only if it tiles $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ translationally, i.e., there exists $\\mathcal{J} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\{\\Omega+t: t \\in \\mathcal{J}\\}$ partitions $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. While disproven in dimensions $n \\geq 3$ by Tao, Kolountzakis and Matolcsi [31, 27, 17, 18], the conjecture remains unresolved for $n=1,2$. Recent breakthroughs by Lev and Matolcsi [20] established its validity under convexity constraints across all dimensions, revitalizing interest in restricted cases.\n\nThe development of harmonic analysis and fractal geometry has propelled spectral measures, generalizations of spectral sets, to the forefront of mathematical inquiry. Formally, a compactly supported Borel probability measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is called a\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Identifying such measures, particularly among singular fractal measures, constitutes a pivotal challenge in modern analysis. Seminal work by Jorgensen and Pedersen [16] revealed that the $\\frac{1}{n}$-Cantor measure $\\mu_{1 / n}$ is spectral if and only if $n$ is even. Subsequent advancements extended this to self-similar measures [19], where Dai, He, and Lau [8] characterized that a self-similar measure $\\mu_{\\rho}$ with a consecutive digit set $D_{N}=\\{0,1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$ is a spectral measure if and only if the reciprocal of its contraction ratio $p=\\rho^{-1}$ is an integer and $N \\mid p$. Parallel developments resolved long-standing questions on Bernoulli convolutions [14, 7], while self-affine measures and infinite convolutions were systematized through Hadamard triples $[3,11,21,22,23]$.\n\nMoran-type measures, as natural extensions of self-similar and self-affine measures, exhibit intricate infinite product structures. Strichartz [29] pioneered their spectral analysis in 2000. Later, An and He [2] concerned the Moran-type measure $\\mu_{\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\},\\left\\{D_{p_{k}}\\right\\}}$ generated by a sequence of integers $\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ with $b_{k} \\geq 2$ and a sequence of consecutive digit sets $\\left\\{D_{p_{k}}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ with $p_{k} \\geq 2$ by proving sufficiency of divisibility conditions $\\left(p_{k} \\mid b_{k}\\right)$ for spectrality. Recent work by An, Li and Zhang [5] and Deng and Li [9] established necessity, culminating in a complete characterization. Current research explores generalized Moran-type measures under varied constraints $[1,4,10,13,24,25,26,28,30,33]$, demonstrating their rich spectral properties.\n\nNotably, all preceding achievements on spectrality of fractal measures fundamentally rely on the uniformity of linear components in their defining contraction maps. A paradigm shift emerged through Wu's recent work [32], which constructed the first self-similar spectral measure $\\mu_{ \\pm \\rho}$ with staggered contraction ratios $\\pm \\rho$ and consecutive digit set $D_{2 N}$. The study established a sharp characterization: $\\mu_{ \\pm \\rho}$ is spectral if and only if the reciprocal of contraction parameter $p=\\rho^{-1}$ is an integer and satisfies $2 N \\mid p$.\n\nBuilding on this conceptual breakthrough, we systematically investigate the spectrality of a novel class of Moran-type measures on $\\mathbb{R}$ featuring hierarchically staggered contraction ratios. Our approach diverges from classical methodologies. We first rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of Moran-type measures through Moran-type iterated function systems, then study their spectral properties by revealing intrinsic arithmetic constraints in non-uniform scaling systems.\n\nDefinition 1.1. Let $\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty},\\left\\{n_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be two sequences of integer numbers with all $b_{k} \\geq n_{k} \\geq 2$ and let $\\Phi_{k}=\\left\\{\\phi_{k, i}\\right\\}_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1}$ be a family of contracting similitudes on $\\mathbb{R}$ for each $k \\geq 1$, where\n\n$$\n\\phi_{k, i}(x)=(-1)^{i} b_{k}^{-1}(x+i), \\quad \\begin{aligned}\n& x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad\\left(i=0,1, \\ldots, n_{k}-1\\right) \\\\\n& 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe call the sequence $\\left\\{\\Phi_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ a Moran-type iterated function system (IFS) with staggered contraction ratios.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let $\\left\\{\\Phi_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be the Moran-type IFS as in Definition 1.1, then the following two statements hold:\n(i) There exists a unique sequence of nonempty compact sets $\\left\\{E_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\nE_{k}=\\Phi_{k}\\left(E_{k+1}\\right):=\\bigcup_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\phi_{k, i}\\left(E_{k+1}\\right), \\quad k \\geq 1\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left|\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}(0)-\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}\\left(a_{l+1}\\right)\\right|=0\n$$\n\nuniformly for all sequences $\\left\\{j_{l}: 0 \\leq j_{l} \\leq n_{l}-1\\right\\}_{l=k}^{\\infty}$ and any $a_{l+1} \\in E_{l+1}$.\n(ii) There exists a unique sequence of probability measures $\\left\\{\\mu_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\mu_{k}=\\frac{1}{n_{k}} \\mu_{k+1} \\circ \\Phi_{k}^{-1}:=\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}} \\mu_{k+1} \\circ \\phi_{k, i}^{-1}, \\quad k \\geq 1\n$$\n\nwhere each $\\mu_{k}$ is supported on $E_{k}$.\nThe first measure $\\mu:=\\mu_{1}$ is called a Moran-type measure with staggered contraction ratios, which will be our research object throughout the paper. The supporting set $E_{1}$ is usually called a Moran-type set. The geometric fashion and Hausdorff dimension of Moran-type sets were investigated in detail by Hua et al. [15].\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let $\\left\\{\\Phi_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be the Moran-type IFS as in Definition 1.1 with assumption that the sequence $\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is bounded and $2 \\mid n_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 1$. Let $\\mu:=\\mu_{1}$ be as in (1.4). Then $\\mu$ is a spectral measure if $2\\left|b_{2}, n_{2}\\right| 2 b_{2}$ and $n_{k} \\mid b_{k}$ for $k \\geq 3$.\n\nThe necessity of this condition generally fails to hold, as demonstrated by the counterexample in Theorem 4.3 (Section 4). However, under the additional hypothesis that 4 divides all $n_{k}$, we give a complete characterization of the spectrality of $\\mu$ in the next theorem. This result unifies and extends the frameworks proposed in $[2,9,32]$, providing a generalized criterion for such measures.\n\nTheorem 1.4. Let $\\left\\{\\Phi_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be the Moran-type IFS as in Definition 1.1 with assumption that the sequence $\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is bounded and $4 \\mid n_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 1$. Let $\\mu:=\\mu_{1}$ be as in (1.4). Then $\\mu$ is a spectral measure if and only if $n_{2} \\mid 2 b_{2}$ and $n_{k} \\mid b_{k}$ for $k \\geq 3$.\n\nThe primary challenges in establishing these theorems stem from two fundamental considerations. First, unlike classical self-similar measures, the Moran-type measure $\\mu$ lacks a convolutional structure, which precludes direct analysis via the framework of infinite convolution measures. Notably, by leveraging the iterative relation (1.4),\n\nwe demonstrate that its spectrality can be equivalently characterized through an infinite convolution (Proposition 4.2). Second, in addressing the necessity condition of Theorem 1.4, we introduce a multi-stage decomposition strategy for spectrums (Remark 5.2). This approach enables the extraction of hierarchical constraints by recursively partitioning the spectrum of the spectral measure.\n\nA natural extension lies in investigating the spectral consistency across the sequence of measures $\\left\\{\\mu_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$. For some typical Moran-type measures, Liu et al. [25] recently showed that spectrality of $\\mu_{1}$ propagates inductively to all $\\mu_{k}(k \\geq 1)$. Nevertheless, the general case remains an open question, as the interplay between scaling parameters and spectral inheritance mechanisms resists straightforward generalization.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 synthesizes foundational results, including the Fourier transform of measures and some criteria for identifying spectral measures. Section 3 establishes Theorem 1.2, while Sections 4 and 5 develop the proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4, respectively.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2.

The following is a basic criterion for determining $\\Lambda$ to be a bi-zero set or spectrum of $\\mu$.\n\nTheorem 2.1 ([16]).

Then $\\Lambda$ is also a bi-zero set of $\\mu$, but it can not be a spectrum of $\\mu$ when $\\omega$ is not a Dirac measure.\n\nLemma 2.3. For any $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\}$, the measure $\\mu$ is a spectral measure if and only if $\\mu^{\\prime}:=\\mu(c \\cdot)$ is a spectral measure.\n\nProof.

Together with (3.1), we can get that the sequence $\\left\\{\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}(0)\\right\\}_{l=k}^{\\infty}$ converges uniformly for all sequences $\\left\\{j_{l}: 0 \\leq j_{l} \\leq n_{l}-1\\right\\}_{l=k}^{\\infty}$.\n\nFor each $k \\geq 1$, define\n\n$$\nE_{k}=\\left\\{\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}(0): 0 \\leq j_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1, k \\leq i \\leq l\\right\\}\n$$\n\nObviously, $\\left\\{E_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ satisfies (1.2). We just need to show the compactness of $E_{k}$.\nFrom (3.2), it follows that $E_{k} \\subset[-2,2]$ for each $k \\geq 1$, hence $\\left\\{E_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is uniformly bounded. Let $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ be a Cauchy sequence of $E_{k}$, then for every $x_{n}$, there is a sequence $\\left\\{j_{n, i}\\right\\}_{i=k}^{\\infty}$ such that\n\n$$\nx_{n}=\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{n, k}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{n, l}}(0)\n$$\n\nSince $0 \\leq j_{n, k} \\leq n_{k}-1$, there exists $\\eta_{k}$ such that the index set $\\left\\{n: j_{n, k}=\\eta_{k}\\right\\}$ is infinite. Repeating this process, there are $\\eta_{k+1}, \\eta_{k+2}, \\ldots, \\eta_{l}, \\ldots$ such that the index set $\\left\\{n: j_{n, i}=\\eta_{i}, i=k, \\ldots, l\\right\\}$ is infinite for all $l \\geq k$. Let\n\n$$\nx=\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, \\eta_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, \\eta_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, \\eta_{l}}(0)\n$$\n\nBy (3.1), for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there is an integer $N>k$ such that for any $m, n \\geq N$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{m, j_{m}}(0)-\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{n, j_{n}}(0)\\right|<\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nThat is, $E_{k}$ is contained in the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the set $\\left\\{\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ\\right.$ $\\left.\\phi_{N, j_{N}}(0): 0 \\leq j_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1, i=k, \\ldots, N\\right\\}$. Since $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $E_{k}$, there exists $N^{\\prime} \\geq N$ such that $\\left|x_{n}-x_{m}\\right|<\\varepsilon$ for all $m, n>N^{\\prime}$. Choose $n>N^{\\prime}$ such that $j_{n, i}=\\eta_{i}$ for $i=k, k+1, \\ldots, N$. Then for any $l>N^{\\prime}$, by (3.4), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|x-x_{l}\\right| \\leq & \\left|x-x_{n}\\right|+\\left|x_{n}-x_{l}\\right| \\\\\n\\leq & \\left|x-x_{n}\\right|+\\varepsilon \\\\\n\\leq & \\left|x-\\phi_{k, \\eta_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, \\eta_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{N, \\eta_{N}}(0)\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\phi_{k, \\eta_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, \\eta_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{N, \\eta_{N}}(0)-x_{n}\\right|+\\varepsilon \\\\\n\\leq & 3 \\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x_{n}=x \\in E_{k}$, and $E_{k}$ is compact. Moreover, the above argument also shows that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}\\left(E_{l+1}\\right)=\\left\\{\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}(0)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nuniformly for all sequences $\\left\\{j_{i}: 0 \\leq j_{l} \\leq n_{i}-1\\right\\}_{i=k}^{\\infty}$. Thus (1.3) follows and the existence is proved.\n\nNext we prove the uniqueness. Suppose $\\left\\{F_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is another sequence of compact sets on $\\mathbb{R}$ satisfying (1.2). Let $x \\in F_{k}$. (1.2) shows that there exist $x_{i} \\in F_{i}$ and $0 \\leq j_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1$ for $i=k+1, k+2, \\ldots$ such that\n\n$$\nx=\\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}\\left(x_{l+1}\\right), \\quad l=k, k+1, \\ldots\n$$\n\nBy (1.3), $x=\\lim _{l \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{l, j_{l}}(0)$. Then $x \\in E_{k}$. Hence $F_{k} \\subset E_{k}$. Similarly we can show $E_{k} \\subset F_{k}$. Therefore $F_{k}=E_{k}, k \\geq 1$, and the uniqueness follows.\n(ii) For each $k \\geq 1$, we denote by the symbolic space starting from the $k$-th level\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{k}:=\\left\\{j_{k} \\cdots j_{i} \\cdots: 0 \\leq j_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1, i \\geq k\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand denote by the corresponding cylinder sets of $\\Sigma_{k}$\n\n$$\n\\left[j_{k} \\cdots j_{i}\\right]:=\\left\\{j_{k} \\cdots j_{i} \\sigma: \\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{i+1}\\right\\}, \\quad \\text { where } i \\geq k\n$$\n\nDefine a metric $\\rho_{k}$ on $\\Sigma_{k}$ by\n\n$$\n\\rho_{k}\\left(j_{k} \\cdots j_{i} \\cdots, j_{k}^{\\prime} \\cdots j_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdots\\right)=2^{-\\min \\left\\{i: j_{i} \\neq j_{i}^{\\prime}\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nthen $\\left(\\Sigma_{k}, \\rho_{k}\\right)$ is a compact metric space, and the cylinder sets $\\left[j_{k} \\cdots j_{i}\\right]$ are the open sets of the space. If we put a mass on every cylinder set of $\\Sigma_{k}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{k}\\left(\\left[j_{k} \\cdots j_{i}\\right]\\right)=n_{k}^{-1} \\cdots n_{i}^{-1}, \\quad i \\geq k\n$$\n\nThe $\\omega_{k}$ constitutes the unique Borel probability measure on $\\Sigma_{k}$. Note that (3.3) defines a contiuous map $\\pi_{k}: \\Sigma_{k} \\rightarrow E_{k}$. Hence $\\mu_{k}:=\\omega_{k} \\circ \\pi_{k}^{-1}$ is a Borel probability measure on $E_{k}$.\n\nFor any Borel subset $A \\subset E_{k}$, by (3.5),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{k}(A) & =\\omega_{k} \\circ \\pi_{k}^{-1}(A) \\\\\n& =\\omega_{k}\\left(\\left\\{j_{k} j_{k+1} \\cdots j_{n} \\cdots: \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k, j_{k}} \\circ \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{n, j_{n}}(0) \\in A\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{j_{k}=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}} \\omega_{k+1}\\left(\\left\\{j_{k+1} \\cdots j_{n} \\cdots: \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi_{k+1, j_{k+1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\phi_{n, j_{n}}(0) \\in \\phi_{k, j_{k}}^{-1}(A)\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}} \\mu_{k+1} \\circ \\phi_{k, i}^{-1}(A)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence $\\mu_{k}$ satisfies (1.4) and the support of $\\mu_{k}$ is $E_{k}$.\nFinally, we show the uniqueness of the sequence of measures $\\left\\{\\mu_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$. Let $\\mathcal{P}([-2,2])$ be the set of all Borel probability measures on $[-2,2]$, equip it with a dual Lipschitz metric\n\n$$\nL\\left(\\nu, \\nu^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sup _{\\operatorname{Lip}(g) \\leq 1}\\left|\\int g d \\nu-\\int g d \\nu^{\\prime}\\right|\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Lip}(g)=\\sup _{x \\neq y} \\frac{|g(x)-g(y)|}{|x-y|}$ is the Lipschitz constant of $g$. Then $(\\mathcal{P}([-2,2]), L)$ is a compact metric space [6]. Let $g:[-2,2] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a function with $\\operatorname{Lip}(g) \\leq 1$, and let\n\n$$\nh=\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}} g \\circ \\phi_{k, i}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|h(x)-h(y)| & =\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}}\\left|g \\circ \\phi_{k, i}(x)-g \\circ \\phi_{k, i}(y)\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}}\\left|g \\circ \\phi_{k, i}(x)-g \\circ \\phi_{k, i}(y)\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{n_{k}-1} \\frac{1}{n_{k}} \\cdot b_{k}^{-1} \\cdot|x-y| \\\\\n& \\leq b_{k}^{-1} \\cdot|x-y|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThat is, $\\operatorname{Lip}(h) \\leq b_{k}^{-1}<1$.\n\nSuppose that $\\left\\{\\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ is another sequence of measures satisfying (1.4), by (3.6), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\int g d \\mu_{k}-\\int g d \\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\right| & =\\left|\\int h d \\mu_{k+1}-\\int h d \\mu_{k+1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\operatorname{Lip}(h) L\\left(\\mu_{k+1}, \\mu_{k+1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq b_{k}^{-1} L\\left(\\mu_{k+1}, \\mu_{k+1}^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence $L\\left(\\mu_{k}, \\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq b_{k}^{-1} L\\left(\\mu_{k+1}, \\mu_{k+1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq \\cdots \\leq b_{k}^{-n} L\\left(\\mu_{k+n}, \\mu_{k+n}^{\\prime}\\right)$ for any $n \\geq 1$. By letting $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, it concludes that $L\\left(\\mu_{k}, \\mu_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)=0$. Therefore, $\\mu_{k} \\equiv \\mu_{k}^{\\prime}$, proving the uniqueness.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4.

The following special case that $n_{k} \\equiv 2$ (i.e., $p_{k} \\equiv 1$ ) for $k \\geq 1$ provides a counterexample to show that the condition in Theorem 1.3 for $\\nu$ to be a spectral measure is not a necessary condition.\n\nTheorem 4.3. Assume that $p_{k} \\equiv 1$ for $k \\geq 1$. If $2 \\mid b_{k}$ for $k \\geq 2$, then $\\nu$ defined by (4.4) is a spectral measure. Conversely, if $\\nu$ is a spectral measure, $b_{k}$ is not always even for $k \\geq 2$.\nProof. Since $p_{k} \\equiv 1$ for $k \\geq 1$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{k}=\\left\\{0, \\frac{1-b_{k+1}^{-1}}{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nDefine $\\tilde{D}_{k}:=2 b_{k+1} \\mathcal{D}_{k}=\\left\\{0, b_{k+1}-1\\right\\}$, the measure $\\nu$ defined by (4.4) can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\delta_{\\left(2 b_{1} b_{2}\\right)^{-1} \\tilde{D}_{1}} * \\delta_{\\left(2 b_{1} b_{2} b_{3}\\right)^{-1} \\tilde{D}_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(2 b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} b_{4}\\right)^{-1} \\tilde{D}_{3}} * \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhich is a Moran-type Bernoulli convolution.\nIf $2 \\mid b_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 2$. We can check the condition in Theorem 2.4 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_{k+1} & =v_{2}\\left(\\frac{b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{k+1} b_{k+2}}{b_{k+2}-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =v_{2}\\left(b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{k+1} b_{k+2}\\right) \\\\\n& >v_{2}\\left(b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{k+1}\\right) \\\\\n& =v_{2}\\left(\\frac{b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =s_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $k \\geq 1$. Hence $\\nu$ is a spectral measure.\nOn the other hand, let $b_{3}=7, b_{k}=8$ for $k \\neq 3$, we can get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& s_{1}=v_{2}\\left(\\frac{b_{1} b_{2}}{b_{2}-1}\\right)=6, \\quad s_{2}=v_{2}\\left(\\frac{b_{1} b_{2} b_{3}}{b_{3}-1}\\right)=5 \\\\\n& s_{k}=v_{2}\\left(\\frac{b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}-1}\\right)=3 k, \\quad k=3,4, \\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen $s_{k}$ 's are different from each other for all $k \\geq 1$. Therefore, $\\nu$ is a spectral measure but $2 \\nmid b_{3}$.\n\nIn the rest of this section, our main concern is the general case that $p_{k} \\not \\equiv 1$. First of all, we need to modify the expression of $\\nu$ in a more appropriate way. By using (4.3), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k}} & =\\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{k}}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(p_{k}-\\frac{1+b_{k-1}^{-1}}{2}\\right) D_{2}} \\\\\n& =\\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{k}}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k} 2 b_{k+1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{k+1}\\left(2 p_{k}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen the measure $\\nu$ in (4.4) is of the following form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{1}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} b_{2}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{2}} * \\cdots \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k}} * \\cdots \\\\\n= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{p_{1}}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} 2 b_{2}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} b_{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{2}}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} b_{2} 2 b_{3}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{3}\\left(2 p_{2}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots * \\\\\n& \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{k}}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k} 2 b_{k+1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{k+1}\\left(2 p_{k}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStarting from the second term, by swapping the positions of two consecutive terms in the above expression, one can get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{p_{1}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} D_{p_{2}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{3}}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{3}}} * \\\\\n& \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{3}}{2}\\right)^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(b_{3}\\left(2 p_{2}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} b_{3}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{4}}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{4}}} * \\cdots * \\\\\n& \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} \\cdots b_{k-1}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{k}}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{k}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} \\cdots b_{k-1}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{k}}{2}\\right)^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(b_{k}\\left(2 p_{k-1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy removing the terms in which $p_{k}=1$, we can relabel the above infinite convolution to ensure that every digit set contains at least two elements in the following way:\n(i) if $p_{1}=1$ and $p_{2}=1$, let $b_{1}^{\\prime}=2 b_{1} b_{2}, D_{1}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}$;\n(ii) if $p_{1}=1$ and $p_{2} \\neq 1$, let $b_{1}^{\\prime}=b_{1} b_{2}, D_{1}^{\\prime}=D_{p_{2}}$ and $b_{2}^{\\prime}=2, D_{2}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-\\right.$ 1) $D_{2}$\n(iii) if $p_{1} \\neq 1$ and $p_{2}=1$, let $b_{1}^{\\prime}=b_{1}, D_{1}^{\\prime}=D_{p_{1}}$ and $b_{2}^{\\prime}=2 b_{2}, D_{2}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-\\right.$ 1) $D_{2}$\n(iv) if $p_{1} \\neq 1$ and $p_{2} \\neq 1$, let $b_{1}^{\\prime}=b_{1}, D_{1}^{\\prime}=D_{p_{1}}, b_{2}^{\\prime}=b_{2}, D_{2}^{\\prime}=D_{p_{2}}$ and $b_{3}^{\\prime}=2$, $D_{3}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}$.\nIn general, for $k \\geq 3$, we set\n\n$$\nm_{k}=2 k-2-\\#\\left\\{n: p_{n}=1, n<k\\right\\}\n$$\n\n(v) If $p_{k} \\neq 1$, let $b_{m_{k}}^{\\prime}=\\frac{b_{k}}{2}, D_{m_{k}}^{\\prime}=D_{p_{k}}$ and $b_{m_{k}+1}^{\\prime}=2, D_{m_{k}+1}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{k}\\left(2 p_{k-1}-1\\right)-\\right.$ 1) $D_{2}$\n(vi) if $p_{k}=1$, let $b_{m_{k}}^{\\prime}=b_{k}, D_{m_{k}}^{\\prime}=\\left(b_{k}\\left(2 p_{k-1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}$.\n\nTherefore, we get a sequence of integers $\\left\\{b_{k}^{\\prime}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ and a sequence of digit sets $\\left\\{D_{k}^{\\prime}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.

That is, $\\nu_{m_{\\kappa}}$ is a spectral measure with a spectrum $L$.\n\nOn the other hand, by (4.8),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{>m_{\\kappa}} & =\\delta_{b_{m_{\\kappa}+1}^{\\prime} D_{m_{\\kappa}+1}^{\\prime}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{m_{\\kappa}+1}^{\\prime} b_{m_{\\kappa}+2}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1} D_{m_{\\kappa}+2}^{\\prime}} * \\cdots \\\\\n& =\\delta_{b_{n+1}^{-1}\\left(b_{n+1}-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{n+1} b_{n+2}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{n+2}-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\left\\{\\left(b_{k}^{\\prime}, D_{k}^{\\prime}, L_{k}\\right)\\right\\}_{k=m_{\\kappa}+1}^{\\infty}$ are Hadamard triples with $\\# D_{k}^{\\prime}=2$ and $D_{k}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{0, b_{k}^{\\prime}-\\right.$ $1\\} \\subset\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, b_{k}^{\\prime}-1\\right\\}$ for all $k \\geq m_{\\kappa}+1$.

That is, for all $l, k \\geq 1$, there exists an integer $N(k)>k+l$, such that $p_{N(k)} \\geq 2$.

Thus the measure $\\omega_{>l}$ is generated by finitely many Hadamard triples. By Lemma 2.12 and (4.9), the integral periodic zero set $Z\\left(\\omega_{>l}\\right)=\\emptyset$ for all $l \\geq 1$.\n\n(i) If $\\left\\{\\omega_{>l}\\right\\}_{l=1}^{\\infty}$ has no weakly divergent subsequences.

Moreover, we may find a compact subset $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\omega_{>l} \\in \\mathcal{P}(K)$ for all $l \\geq 1$. Hence the family of measures $\\left\\{\\omega_{>l}\\right\\}_{l=1}^{\\infty}$ is admissible and tight. Theorem 2.9 implies that $\\nu$ is a spectral measure with a spectrum in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n(ii) If there exists a subsequence, say $\\left\\{\\omega_{>l_{j}}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{\\infty}$, which converges weakly to $\\omega$. Let $\\Psi$ be the set of all measures generated by finitely many Hadamard triples, and let $\\Psi_{0} \\subset \\Psi$ be the set of the measures where there are infinitely many $k$ 's such that $p_{k} \\geq 2$. By Lemma 2.11, we have $\\omega^{\\prime} \\in \\Psi$. If $\\omega^{\\prime} \\in \\Psi_{0}$, then $Z\\left(\\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\emptyset$. If $\\omega^{\\prime} \\in \\Psi \\backslash \\Psi_{0}$, then $\\omega^{\\prime}$ belongs to Case 1 or Case 2 . That is, there exists a sufficiently large $M>0$ such that $p_{k} \\equiv 1$ for all $k \\geq M$ in the expression of $\\omega_{>M}^{\\prime}$. The sequence $\\left\\{\\omega_{>l_{j}+M}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{\\infty}$ converges weakly to $\\omega_{>M}^{\\prime} \\in \\Psi \\backslash \\Psi_{0}$. In this situation, we may regard $\\omega_{>M}^{\\prime}$ as $\\omega_{>k}$ for some $k \\geq m_{\\kappa}$ in Case 2. The support of measure $\\omega_{>k}$ is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{spt}\\left(\\omega_{>k}\\right) \\subset\\left[0, \\sum_{l=k+1}^{\\infty}\\left(b_{k+1}^{\\prime} \\cdots b_{l}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1}\\left(b_{l}^{\\prime}-1\\right)\\right] \\subset[0,1]\n$$\n\nThat means $\\omega_{>k} \\in \\mathcal{P}([0,1])$. Since $\\omega_{>k}$ is generated by Hadamard triples, it is purely singular without atoms, $\\omega_{>k}(\\{1\\})=0$. Lemma 2.8 yields that $Z\\left(\\omega_{>k}\\right)=\\emptyset$. Therefore, $Z\\left(\\omega_{>M}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\emptyset$. Consequently, $\\nu$ is a spectral measure by Theorem 2.10.\n\nProof of Theorem 1.3. The theorem directly follows from Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 4.5.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. Proof of Theorem 1.4 \n\nIn this section, we follow the same notation as in Section 4, that is, $n_{k}=2 p_{k}, k \\geq 1$ and $\\nu$ is defined by (4.4).\n\nTo prove Theorem 1.4, we define a new Moran-type measure generated by a sequence of positive rational numbers $\\left\\{d_{k}:=\\frac{l_{k}}{t_{k}}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ and a sequence of consecutive digit sets $\\mathcal{D}_{k}=\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}-1\\right\\}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\delta_{d_{1}^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{1}} * \\delta_{\\left(d_{1} d_{2}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{2}} * \\cdots * \\delta_{\\left(d_{1} \\cdots d_{k}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k}} * \\cdots\n$$\n\nWrite\n\n$$\n\\omega_{>k}=\\delta_{\\left(d_{k+1}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k+1}} * \\delta_{\\left(d_{k+1} d_{k+2}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k+2}} * \\delta_{\\left(d_{k+1} d_{k+2} d_{k+3}\\right)^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{k+3}} * \\cdots\n$$\n\nIf $\\left\\{t_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ and $\\left\\{\\gamma_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ both are bounded, we let $c \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be the common multiple of $\\left\\{t_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ and $\\left\\{\\gamma_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$. Obviously, the zero set of $\\widehat{\\nu}$ is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}(\\widehat{\\nu})=\\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} d_{1} \\cdots d_{k}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z} \\backslash \\gamma_{k} \\mathbb{Z}}{\\gamma_{k}}\\right) \\subset \\frac{d_{1}}{c} \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nAssuming that $\\Lambda$ containing 0 is a spectrum of $\\nu$, we have $\\frac{c}{d_{1}} \\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$.

Let $\\nu$ be defined by (5.1) with bounded $\\left\\{t_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ and $\\left\\{\\gamma_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$. If $\\nu$ is a spectral measure with a spectrum $\\Lambda$ containing 0 , then $\\omega_{>1}$ as in (5.2) is a spectral measure and for any $\\left\\{j_{i}: 0 \\leq i \\leq q_{1}-1\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, \\gamma_{1}-1\\right\\}$, the set\n\n$$\n\\Gamma=\\bigcup_{i=0}^{q_{1}-1}\\left(\\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}+\\Lambda_{i+q_{1} j_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis a spectrum of $\\omega_{>1}$ if $\\Gamma \\neq \\emptyset$.\nProof. We first show that $\\Gamma$ is a bi-zero set of $\\omega_{>1}$ if $\\Gamma \\neq \\emptyset$. It is obviously true if $\\Gamma$ has only one element. We just have to consider that $\\Gamma$ has at least two elements. For any $\\lambda_{1} \\neq \\lambda_{2} \\in \\Gamma$, there exist $i_{1}, i_{2} \\in\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, q_{1}-1\\right\\}, z_{1} \\in \\Lambda_{i_{1}+q_{1} j_{i_{1}}}, z_{2} \\in \\Lambda_{i_{2}+q_{1} j_{i_{2}}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}=\\frac{i_{1}+q_{1} j_{i_{1}}}{c}+z_{1}, \\quad \\lambda_{2}=\\frac{i_{2}+q_{1} j_{i_{2}}}{c}+z_{2}\n$$\n\nBy the definitions of $\\Lambda$ and $\\Gamma$, we have $d_{1} \\Gamma \\subset \\Lambda$. Since $\\nu(\\cdot)=\\delta_{d_{1}^{-1} \\mathcal{D}_{1}}(\\cdot) * \\omega_{>1}\\left(d_{1} \\cdot\\right)$, it follows that\n\n$$\n0=\\widehat{\\nu}\\left(d_{1}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)\\right)=m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right) \\widehat{\\omega}_{>1}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}$ is a $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic function, it yields that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right) & =m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\frac{i_{1}-i_{2}+q_{1}\\left(j_{i_{1}}-j_{i_{2}}\\right)}{c}+z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\frac{i_{1}-i_{2}+q_{1}\\left(j_{i_{1}}-j_{i_{2}}\\right)}{c}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $i_{1}=i_{2}$, then $j_{i_{1}}=j_{i_{2}}, m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)=m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}(0)=1$. Hence $\\widehat{\\omega}_{>1}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)=0$.\n\nIf $i_{1} \\neq i_{2}$, since $i_{1}-i_{2} \\in\\left[1-q_{1}, q_{1}-1\\right] \\backslash\\{0\\}$, we have $i_{1}-i_{2} \\notin q_{1} \\mathbb{Z}$. Suppose that $\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}\\left(\\gamma_{1} \\mathbb{Z}\\right)}{\\gamma_{1}}$, then there exists $z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\backslash \\gamma_{1} \\mathbb{Z}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{i_{1}-i_{2}+q_{1}\\left(j_{i_{1}}-j_{i_{2}}\\right)}{c}=\\frac{z}{\\gamma_{1}}\n$$\n\nThus $c=q_{1} \\gamma_{1}$ shows that $i_{1}-i_{2}=q_{1}\\left(z-j_{i_{1}}+j_{i_{2}}\\right) \\in q_{1} \\mathbb{Z}$, which is impossible. Therefore, $m_{\\mathcal{D}_{1}}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right) \\neq 0$ and $\\widehat{\\nu}_{>1}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)=0$, proving that $\\Gamma$ is a bi-zero set of $\\omega_{>1}$.\n\nNext we show that $\\Gamma$ is a spectrum of $\\omega_{>1}$.

By Remark 5.2, we only need to prove the case that $i=1$. Let $\\Lambda$ be a spectrum of $\\nu$ with $0 \\in \\Lambda$, then Lemma 5.1 shows that\n\n$$\n\\Gamma=\\bigcup_{i=0}^{q_{1}-1}\\left(\\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}+\\Lambda_{i+q_{1} j_{i}}\\right)=\\bigcup_{i=0}^{q_{1}-1}\\left(\\frac{i}{c}+\\frac{j_{i}}{\\gamma_{1}}+\\Lambda_{i, j_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis a spectrum of $\\omega_{>1}$ if $\\Gamma \\neq \\emptyset$.\n(i) If $\\gamma_{1} \\nmid t_{2}$. We set $j_{0}=0$, and for $i \\neq 0$ we set $j_{i}=0$ if $\\frac{t_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}} \\not \\equiv t_{2} \\frac{i}{c}(\\bmod 1)$, $j_{i}=1$ if $\\frac{t_{1}}{\\gamma_{2}} \\equiv t_{2} \\frac{i}{c}(\\bmod 1)$. Then $\\gamma_{1} \\nmid t_{2}$ implies that $\\frac{t_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}} \\not \\equiv t_{2} \\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}(\\bmod 1)$ for $i \\neq 0$.\n\nUsing (5.3) for $\\omega_{>1}$, the spectrum $\\Gamma$ has the following multi-stage decomposition\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Gamma & =\\bigcup_{i=0}^{q_{1}-1}\\left(\\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}+\\Lambda_{i, j_{i}}\\right) \\\\\n& =d_{2} \\bigcup_{i^{\\prime}=0}^{q_{2}-1} \\bigcup_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{\\gamma_{2}-1}\\left(\\frac{i^{\\prime}+q_{2} j^{\\prime}}{c}+\\Gamma_{i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Gamma_{i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}}=\\mathbb{Z} \\cap\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{d_{2}}-\\frac{i^{\\prime}+q_{2} j^{\\prime}}{c}\\right)$. Since $0 \\in \\Gamma_{0,0} \\neq \\emptyset$, by (5.4), we have $\\Gamma_{0, j^{\\prime}} \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $0 \\leq j^{\\prime} \\leq \\gamma_{2}-1$. Choose an integer $z_{0}^{\\prime} \\in \\Gamma_{0,1}$, then there exists $\\left(i, j_{i}\\right) \\in$ $\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, q_{1}-1\\right\\} \\times\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, \\gamma_{1}-1\\right\\}$ and an integer $z_{0} \\in \\Lambda_{i, j_{i}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{l_{2}}{t_{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{2}}+z_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}+z_{0}\n$$\n\nThis yields that $i=j_{i}=0$ since $\\frac{l_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}} \\not \\equiv t_{2} \\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}(\\bmod 1)$ for any $1 \\leq i \\leq q_{1}-1$. Hence $\\frac{l_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}}+l_{2} z_{0}^{\\prime}=t_{2} z_{0}$, showing that $\\gamma_{2} \\mid l_{2}$.\n(ii) If $\\gamma_{1} \\nmid t_{2}, \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(l_{2}, t_{2}\\right)=1$, and $d_{3}=l_{3}$ is an integer satisfying $t_{2} \\mid l_{3}$, We set $j_{0}=0$, and for $i \\neq 0$ we set $j_{i}=0$ if $\\frac{t_{2} i}{c} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}, j_{i}=1$ if $\\frac{t_{2} i}{c} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Hence $0 \\in \\Lambda_{0,0} \\subset \\Gamma$, $\\Gamma$ is a spectrum of $\\omega_{>1}$. Since $\\gamma_{1} \\nmid t_{2}$, one can check that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{i+q_{1} j_{i}}{c}\\right) t_{2}=\\frac{t_{2} i}{c}+\\frac{t_{2}}{\\gamma_{1}} j_{i} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nfor any $i \\neq 0$. By using (5.5) and the fact that $\\Lambda_{i, j_{i}}, \\Gamma_{i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ for any $i, i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}$, we have $l_{2} \\Gamma_{0,0} \\subset t_{2} \\Lambda_{0,0}$. It follows from $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(l_{2}, t_{2}\\right)=1$ that $\\Gamma_{0,0} \\subset t_{2} \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor any $0 \\leq \\iota \\leq q_{2}-1$, choose $0 \\leq \\tau_{\\iota} \\leq \\gamma_{2}-1$ and let\n\n$$\n\\Lambda^{*}=\\bigcup_{\\iota=0}^{q_{2}-1}\\left(\\frac{\\iota+q_{2} \\tau_{\\iota}}{c}+\\Gamma_{\\iota, \\tau_{\\iota}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{\\iota}=0$ for $\\iota=0$. Then $\\Lambda^{*}$ is a spectrum of the measure $\\omega_{>2}$ by Remark 5.2.\nUsing multi-stage decomposition again, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Lambda^{*} & =\\bigcup_{\\iota=0}^{q_{2}-1}\\left(\\frac{\\iota+q_{2} \\tau_{\\iota}}{c}+\\Gamma_{\\iota, \\tau_{\\iota}}\\right) \\\\\n& =d_{3} \\bigcup_{s=0}^{q_{3}-1} \\bigcup_{t=0}^{\\gamma_{3}-1}\\left(\\frac{s+q_{3} t}{c}+\\Lambda_{s, t}^{*}\\right) \\\\\n& =l_{3} \\bigcup_{s=0}^{q_{3}-1} \\bigcup_{t=0}^{\\gamma_{3}-1}\\left(\\frac{s}{c}+\\frac{t}{\\gamma_{3}}+\\Lambda_{s, t}^{*}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Lambda_{s, t}^{*}=\\mathbb{Z} \\cap\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda^{*}}{d_{3}}-\\frac{s+q_{3} t}{c}\\right)$. That $d_{3}=l_{3}$ implies that $t_{3}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2} \\nmid t_{3}$, hence $\\gamma_{3} \\mid l_{3}$ by (i), it follows that\n\n$$\nl_{3}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\gamma_{3}}+\\Lambda_{0, t}^{*}\\right) \\subset \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nfor any $0 \\leq t \\leq \\gamma_{3}-1$. It can be seen that\n\n$$\nl_{3}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\gamma_{3}}+\\Lambda_{0, t}^{*}\\right) \\subset \\Gamma_{0,0} \\subset t_{2} \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nSince $t_{2} \\mid l_{3}$, let $l_{3}=l_{3}^{\\prime} t_{2}$, then $l_{3}^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\gamma_{3}}+\\Lambda_{0, t}^{*}\\right) \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ for any $0 \\leq t \\leq \\gamma_{3}-1$. Consequently, we have $\\gamma_{3} \\mid l_{3}^{\\prime}$ and $t_{2} \\gamma_{3} \\mid l_{3}$, completing the proof.\n\nProposition 5.4. Suppose that $2 \\mid p_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 1$. If $\\nu$ in (4.4) is a spectral measure, then $2 \\mid b_{k+1}$ for all $k \\geq 1$.\n\nProof. Since $2 \\mid p_{k}, k \\geq 1$, we get\n\n$$\nD_{p_{k}}=D_{2} \\oplus D_{\\frac{p_{k}}{2}}\n$$\n\nThe measure $\\nu$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{2}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{\\frac{p_{1}}{2}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1}\\left(p_{1}-\\frac{1+k_{1}^{-1}}{2}\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1} D_{\\frac{p_{k}}{2}}} * \\\\\n& \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(p_{k}-\\frac{1+k_{k+1}^{-1}}{2}\\right) D_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k} b_{k+1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}} * \\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{k} b_{k+1}\\right)^{-1} D_{\\frac{p_{k+1}}{2}}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf $2 \\mid b_{k+1}$ does not hold for all $k \\geq 1$, that is, there exists $n \\geq 1$ such that $b_{n+1} \\in 2 \\mathbb{Z}+1$. Then we have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\widehat{\\delta}_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{n+1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}}\\right)=\\frac{b_{1} \\cdots b_{n+1}}{2}(2 \\mathbb{Z}+1) \\subset \\frac{b_{1} \\cdots b_{n}}{2}(2 \\mathbb{Z}+1)=\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\widehat{\\delta}_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{n}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWriting $\\nu=\\delta_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{n+1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}} * \\nu^{\\prime}$. Since $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\widehat{\\delta}_{\\left(b_{1} \\cdots b_{n+1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{Z}(\\widehat{\\nu^{\\prime}})$, if $\\Lambda$ is a spectrum of $\\nu$, then $\\Lambda$ is a bi-zero set of $\\nu^{\\prime}$. But $\\Lambda$ can not be a spectrum of $\\nu$ by Lemma 2.2. That is a contradiction.\n\nFor the measure $\\nu$ as in (4.6), we may change the digit sets in each level into the consecutive digit sets by adjusting the contraction ratios as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{p_{1}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} D_{p_{2}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{2}}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{3}}} * \\\\\n& \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} \\cdot b_{2}^{-1} 2^{-1} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{b_{2}}{2}\\right)^{-1} 2^{-1}\\left(b_{3}\\left(2 p_{2}-1\\right)-1\\right) D_{2}} * \\cdots \\\\\n= & \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} D_{p_{1}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1} D_{p_{2}}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{3}}} * \\\\\n& \\delta_{b_{1}^{-1} b_{2}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{2}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nb_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}=b_{1}, & b_{2 k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{2}{b_{k+1}\\left(2 p_{k}-1\\right)-1} \\\\\nb_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}=b_{2}, & b_{2 k+2}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{b_{k+2}\\left(b_{k+1}\\left(2 p_{k}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\np_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{1}, \\quad p_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{2}, \\quad p_{2 k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}=2, \\quad p_{2 k+2}^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{k+2}\n$$\n\nThen $\\nu$ can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\delta_{b_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} D_{p_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1 D_{p_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{2}^{\\prime \\prime-1} b_{3}^{\\prime \\prime-1} D_{p_{3}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\cdots\n$$\n\nAccordingly, let\n\n$$\n\\omega_{>k}=\\delta_{b_{k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} D_{p_{k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{k+2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} D_{p_{k+2}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{k+1}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{k+2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1 b_{k+3}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} D_{p_{k+3}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\cdots\n$$\n\nTheorem 5.5. Let $2 \\mid p_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 1$ and $\\left\\{b_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ be bounded. If $\\nu$ in (5.8) is a spectral measure, then $p_{2} \\mid b_{2}$ and $2 p_{k} \\mid b_{k}$ for $k \\geq 3$.\n\nProof. Proposition 5.4 implies that $2 \\mid b_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 2$. By (5.6), (5.7) and Proposition 5.3(i), we have $p_{2} \\mid b_{2}$.\n\nFrom Lemma 5.1, it follows that $\\omega_{>1}$ as in (5.9) is a spectral measure where\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{>1} & =\\delta_{b_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} D_{p_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{3}^{\\prime \\prime-1} D_{p_{3}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\delta_{b_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}-1} b_{3}^{\\prime \\prime-1} b_{4}^{\\prime \\prime-1} D_{p_{4}^{\\prime \\prime}} * \\cdots \\\\\n& =\\delta_{b_{2}^{-1}} D_{p_{2}} * \\delta_{b_{2}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1} D_{2} * \\delta_{b_{2}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{2}{b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\\right)^{-1} D_{p_{3}} * \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $p_{2}$ is even and $\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)$ is odd, we get $p_{2} \\nmid\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(2, b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)=1$. Moreover, $b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1 \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{b_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\\right.$ (as $\\left.2 \\mid b_{3}\\right)$. Therefore, Propsition 5.3(ii) yields that $p_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right) \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{b_{3}\\left(b_{2}\\left(2 p_{1}-1\\right)-1\\right)}{2}\\right.$, and hence $p_{3} \\mid \\frac{b_{3}}{2}$.\n\nRepeating the above argument, we conclude that $p_{k} \\mid \\frac{b_{k}}{2}$ for all $k \\geq 3$, completing the proof.\n\nProof of Theorem 1.4.
