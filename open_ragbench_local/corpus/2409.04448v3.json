This definition requires clarification: there are various types of complexity (plain, prefix, and others), but even when fixed, there remains a dependency on the choice of programming language or decompressor. We will give all the definitions needed for this paper in the next section; we also refer the reader to $[8,10]$ for formal definitions and the main properties of Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nThe concept of Kolmogorov complexity allows us to define the notion of an individual random string. This can be done as follows: string $x$ is called random if its Kolmogorov complexity $\\gtrsim|x|$, where $|x|$ is the length of $x$. Of course, the formal definition again requires clarifications: in addition to the aforementioned nuances with the definition of complexity, it is necessary to formally define what $\\gtrsim$ means. Let us assume that we have clarified all the details. Define by $R$ the set of all random strings. The question arises: How powerful is the oracle $R$ ? For example, what languages belong to $\\mathbf{P}^{R}$ ?\n\nThis and other similar questions were investigated in $[2,3,6]$.\nIn these papers some lower bounds for $\\mathbf{P}^{R}, \\mathbf{P} / \\mathbf{p o l y}^{R}$ and other complexity classes were proven. These results are robust in the following sense: the results are valid for all reasonable definitions of $R$, in particular, it does not matter what type of Kolmogorov complexity we consider.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *email:almas239@gmail.com\n\nThe situation is different for upper bounds. The results in $[4,5,9]$ show some limits on the computational power of $R$ only for prefix complexity.\n\nFor example, the results in $[4,5]$ together with the lower bound obtained in $[6]$ show that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{EXP}^{\\mathrm{NP}} \\subseteq \\bigcap_{U} \\mathrm{P}^{R_{\\mathrm{K}_{U}}} \\subseteq \\text { EXPSPACE. }\n$$\n\nHere, the intersection is for all universal prefix-free decompressors $U$.\nThe lower and upper bounds are significantly different for the prefix complexity but at least we understand that the intersection does not contain undecidable languages. For the plain complexity even this is unknown. Let us introduce some notations.\n\nDenote by $H$ the halting problem:\n\n$$\nH:=\\{x \\mid \\text { program } x \\text { halts on the empty input }\\}\n$$\n\nDenote $R_{U}:=\\left\\{x \\mid \\mathrm{C}_{U}(x) \\geq|x|\\right\\}$, where $\\mathrm{C}_{U}(x)$ is the plain Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ under a universal decompressor $U$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# Open question $[1]$ \n\nIs $H \\notin \\mathrm{P}^{R_{U}}$ for some universal $U$ ?\nThere is some evidence that the answer to this question should be affirmative. Kummer[7] showed that for each universal machine $U$, there is a time-bounded disjunctive truth-table reduction from $H$ to $R_{U}$ : That is, there is a computable function that takes $x$ as input, and produces a list of strings, with the property that $x \\in H$ if and only if at least one of the strings is in $R_{U}$. However, it was shown in [2] that, no matter what computable time bound t one picks, there is some $U$ such that the disjunctive truth-table reduction from $H$ to $R_{U}$ requires more time than $t$. It should be noted that the analogue of Kummer's theorem does not hold for prefix complexity [11].\n\nLet us consider another question. How powerful can $R_{U}$ be for some universal $U$ ? It was shown in [2] that there exists a universal $U$ such that $H$ can be reduced to $R_{U}$ by disjunctive truth-table in double exponential time.\n\nOur main result is the following\nTheorem 1. There exists a universal decompressor $U$ such that $H \\in \\mathrm{P}^{R_{U}}$.\nAt the simplest level, the idea of the proof can be explained as follows.\nThe universal decompressor is optimal up to an additive constant, which allows us to construct certain exotic decompressors with specific properties. For example, there exists a decompressor $U_{\\text {even }}$ such that for every $x$ the Kolmogorov complexity $\\mathrm{C}_{U_{\\text {even }}}(x)$ is always an even number (Lemma 6). We will also construct some exotic decompressor that allows to solve the halting problem.\n\nTo explain the idea, we will first prove a simpler result: there exists a universal decompressor $U$ such that $H$ can be solved by the oracle function $F_{U}$; that is, on input $x$ the function $F_{U}$ outputs its Kolmogorov complexity $\\mathrm{C}_{U}(x)$.\n\nLet $U_{\\text {even }}$ be the decompressor mentioned above, where every minimal description has even length.\n\nThe decompressor $U$ is defined as follows for arbitrary $d \\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}$ :\n\n- if $d=00 d^{\\prime}$ then $U(d):=U_{\\text {even }}\\left(d^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n- if $d=1 d^{\\prime}$ then $U(d):=U_{\\text {even }}\\left(d^{\\prime}\\right)=x$ if $x \\in H$.\n\nNote that $U$ is computable because $H$ is enumerable. We claim that $U$ is universal and $x \\in H$ iff $\\mathrm{C}_{U}(x)$ is odd. Indeed, since $U_{\\text {even }}$ is universal then $U$ is also universal (we need only descriptions that starts with 00 ). If $x \\in H$, then the minimal description of $x$ under $U$ starts with 1 and hence has odd length. Conversely, if $\\mathrm{C}_{U}(x)$ is odd, then $x \\in H$.\n\nWe, however, need to solve $H$ using a weaker oracle that only allows to distinguish random strings from not-random. The challenge arises when the string $x$ is non-random, as the oracle $R_{U}$ distinguishes only between random and non-random strings. Now we describe some ideas that allow to get around the problem.\n\nOne useful tool is the result from [3] stating that, for any universal decompressor $U$, the complexity classes $\\mathrm{BPP}^{R_{U}}$ and $\\mathrm{P}^{R_{U}}$ are equal.\n\nAnother tool is Lemma 8 , which we state informally here: Let $x$ be a string of length $n$ with complexity $k$, and let $A$ be a random binary matrix of dimensions $k \\times n$. Then, with high probability, the string $A \\circ A x$ (where \" $\\circ$ \" denotes concatenation) is algorithmically random, i.e., its length is close to its Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nThis observation allows to construct a universal decompressor $U$ such that $H \\in \\mathrm{P}^{R_{U}}$. We use a similar approach as for oracle function but instead of string $x$ we directly look at $A \\circ A x$. This string can be considered as a \"finger print\" of $x$ (note that matrices are the family of 2-universal hash-functions) and also this string is close to random by the previously-mentioned properties of Lemma 8. We construct $U$ in such a way that $A \\circ A x$ is random iff $x \\in H$.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we recall basic definitions and properties of Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nThen in Section 3 we prove some technical lemmas that are needed to define the universal decompressor $U$ for Theorem 1 (Section 4). Then we describe a polynomial-time algorithm that solves $H$ by using oracle $R_{U}$ (Section 5) and prove its correctness (Section 6).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Definitions and some properties of Kolmogorov complexity \n\nLet us recall the definition of plain conditional and unconditional Kolmogorov complexity.\n\nLet $U$ be an algorithm whose inputs and outputs are binary strings.

Let $D(p, x)$ be a computable partial function (that we will also call decompressor) of two string arguments; its values are also binary strings. We may think of $U$ as an interpreter of some programming language. The first argument $p$ is considered as a program and the second argument is an input for this program.

We start with the following folklore fact.\n\nLemma 6. There exists a universal decompressor $V$ for the conditional Kolmogorov complexity such that for every string $x$ and $y$, the value $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x \\mid y)$ is even.\n\nProof. Let $V_{\\text {opt }}$ be an arbitrary universal decompressor for the conditional Kolmogorov complexity. Define $V(d, y)$ for arbitrary $d$ and $y$ in the following way:\n\n- if $d=0 \\circ d^{\\prime}$ for odd $\\left|d^{\\prime}\\right|$ then $V(d, y):=V_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\left(d^{\\prime}, y\\right)$;\n- if $d=11 \\circ d^{\\prime}$ for even $\\left|d^{\\prime}\\right|$ then $V(d, y):=V_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\left(d^{\\prime}, y\\right)$;\n- Otherwise $V(d, y)$ is undefined.\n\nFrom this definition it follows that for arbitrary $x$ and $y$ the value $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x \\mid y)$ is even and it holds that:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x \\mid y) \\leq \\mathrm{C}_{V_{\\mathrm{opt}}}(x \\mid y)+2\n$$\n\nTherefore, $V$ is a universal decompressor.\nAs in the previous section we define $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x)$ for arbitrary $x$ as $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x \\mid$ empty word $)$.\nThis decompressor $V$ will be instrumental in constructing a universal decompressor $U$ that enables solving the halting problem.\n\nWe now prove two lemmas and define two constants $(D$ and $G)$, which will be used in the next section to define $U$.\n\nWe will use the following simple fact about matrices.\nFact 7. Let $b_{1} \\neq b_{2}$ be two binary strings of length $n$. Let $A$ be a random under the uniform distribution binary $k \\times n$ matrix. Then the probability of the event $\\left[A b_{1}=A b_{2}\\right]$ is equal to $2^{-k}$.\n\nLemma 8. Let $y$ be a string of length $n$. Denote $k=\\mathrm{C}_{V}(y \\mid n)+5$. Assume that $n+1$ is a prime number and $k<n$.\n\nLet $A$ be a random binary $k \\times n$ matrix (under the uniform distribution).\nLet $f$ be the string $A y$. Then for some constant $D$ the following holds with probability at least $\\frac{n}{10}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ f) \\geq n k+k-D\n$$\n\nHere $A$ is viewed as a string of length $n k$.\nProof. First we claim that with probability at least $\\frac{15}{16}=1-\\frac{1}{27}$ there is no $t \\neq y$ such that $A t=f$ and $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(t \\mid n) \\leq k-5$. Indeed, the number of strings $t$ such that $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(t \\mid n) \\leq k-5$ is at most $2^{k-4}$. Now we just use Fact 7 .\n\nThe second claim is that for some constant $C_{1}$ with probability at least $\\frac{30}{100}$ it holds that\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ y) \\geq n k+k-C_{1}\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ y) \\leq n k+k-R$ for some $R$ and for 1 percent of all possible $A$. We want to show that $R=O(1)$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(y \\mid n, k, R) \\leq k-R+O(1)\n$$\n\nIndeed, the number of strings $h$ of length $n$ such that there are at least 1 percent of all matrices $A$ such that $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ y) \\leq n k+k-R$ is at most $2^{k-R+O(1)}$. We can enumerate all such strings given $n, k, R$ and describe $y$ as the corresponding number in this enumeration.\n\nBy Lemma $5 \\mathrm{C}_{V}(y \\mid n, k)=k-O(1)$. By using the same technique as in the proof of Lemma 5 we conclude that $R$ is constant.\n\nNow we prove the statement of the lemma. Let\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ f)=n k+k-D \\text { for some } D\n$$\n\nWe need to prove that $D=O(1)$ with high probability.\nFor this, we estimate the complexity of tuple $(A \\circ f, n, k)$.\nFirst, note that by Lemma 4 we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ f, n k+k-D)=n k+k-D+O(1)\n$$\n\nBy Theorem 3 we can estimate the complexity of the following triple:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ f, n k+k-D, D) \\leq n k+k-D+O(\\log D)\n$$\n\nKnowing $(n+1) k-D$ and $D$ it is simple to find $n$ and $k$ since $n+1$ is a large prime. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ f, n, k) \\leq n k+k-D+O(\\log D)\n$$\n\nWith high probability (at least $1-\\frac{1}{16}-\\frac{1}{100}>\\frac{9}{10}$ ) both claims above hold, i.e. $y$ does not have collisions among strings $t$ such that $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(t \\mid n) \\leq k-5$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{V}(A \\circ y) \\geq n k+k-O(1)\n$$\n\nTherefore, it is possible to find $y$ by $(A \\circ f, n, k)$ as the unique preimage of $A$ among strings with $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(y \\mid n) \\leq k-5$.\n\nHence, $D$ is constant.\n\nNow, we state a simple lemma that is an easy consequence of the fact that strings $x$ and $x \\circ 0^{9}$ (just appending 9 zeros to $x$ ) have the complexity up to some additive constant.\n\nWe need this lemma to define constant $G$ that we will use in the next section.\nLemma 9. For every $D$ there exists $G$ such that the following holds.\nFor every $x$ if $\\mathrm{C}_{V}(x) \\geq|x|-D$ then $\\mathrm{C}_{V}\\left(x \\circ 0^{9}\\right) \\geq(|x|+9)-G$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 4 Definition of Universal Decompressor $U$ \n\nHere we describe universal decompressor $U$ that allows to solve the halting problem in polynomial time.

The length of the description is\n\n$$\n1+k \\cdot n+k-5\n$$\n\nthat is less than\n\n$$\n\\left|A \\circ A y \\circ 0^{9}\\right|=k \\cdot n+k+9\n$$\n\nThus, we conclude that $A \\circ A y \\circ 0^{9} \\notin R_{U}$, proving correctness in this case.\nIf $x$ does not halt.\nWe claim that, in this case, for every $k$ and random $A$ the probability of the event (1) is small.\n\nMore precisely, we show that this probability is not greater than $\\frac{1}{16}$.\nThis implies that the algorithm works correctly with high probability.\nIndeed, the algorithm fails only if event (1) holds for at least half of the matrices $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{m}$. Since matrices are chosen independently and $m$ is a sufficiently large polynomial Hoeffding's inequality implies that this probability is exponentially small in $n$.\n(In more detail, define independent random variables $I_{1}, I_{2}, \\ldots, I_{m}$, where\n\n$$\nI_{j}= \\begin{cases}1, & \\text { if event (1) occurs for matrix } A_{j} \\\\ 0, & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince the expectation of each $I_{j}$ is at most $\\frac{1}{16}$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{m} I_{i}\\right] \\leq \\frac{m}{16}\n$$\n\nBy Hoeffding's inequality, the probability that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} I_{i} \\geq \\frac{m}{2}\n$$\n\nis exponentially small. )\nThus, the algorithm works correctly for all $k$ with high probability.\nIt remains to prove the claim.\nTo analyze when event (1) can happen, assume that for some $k$ and $A$, it does occur. By Lemma 11, this implies the existence of some $y^{\\prime} \\neq y$ of length $n$ such that\n\n- $\\mathrm{C}\\left(y^{\\prime} \\mid n\\right) \\leq k-5$, and\n- $A y^{\\prime}=A y$.\n(Since $y$ must also satisfy additional conditions, we only focus on these two properties.)\n\nFor a fixed $k$, there are at most $2^{k-4}$ strings $y^{\\prime}$ such that $\\mathrm{C}\\left(y^{\\prime} \\mid n\\right) \\leq k-5$. Thus, by Fact 7 , for a random matrix $A$, the probability of $A y^{\\prime}=A y$ for some such $y^{\\prime}$ is at most $\\frac{1}{16}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 7 Acknowledgments \n\nI would like to thank Eric Allender for the formulation of the question and to Bruno Bauwens for the useful discussions.\n\nThis work was funded by the European Union (ERC, HOFGA, 101041696).
