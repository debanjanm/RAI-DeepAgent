      "text": "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nA ring $R$ is said to be right Kasch if every simple right $R$-module embeds in $R$. Commutative artinian rings and Quasi-Frobenious rings are well-known examples of Kasch rings. Kasch rings were generalized to modules by several authors. For example, in [1], a right $R$ module $M$ is called a right Kasch module if every simple subfactor of $M$ can be embedded into $M$. By a subfactor of $M$, we mean a submodule of a factor module of $M$.\n\nRecall that, a ring $R$ is said to be a right $H$-ring if the injective hulls of nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules are homologically independent, that is, $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(E\\left(S_{1}\\right), E\\left(S_{2}\\right)\\right)=0$ for each nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ (see, [18]). Commutative Noetherian rings, and commutative semiartinian rings are $H$-rings (see, [8]). Thus, commutative perfect rings are $H$-rings, as left perfect rings are right semiartinian. Right artinian rings that are right $H$-ring are characterized in [19]. A ring $R$ is said to be right max-ring if every nonzero right $R$-module has a maximal submodule.\n\nIn this paper, a notion dual to Kasch modules is proposed and studied. A natural dualization of Kasch modules is obtained as follows. We call a right module $M$ right coKasch module if every simple subfactor of $M$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. Semisimple and free modules are trivial examples of co-Kasch modules. More generally, for each right $R$-module $M$, the module $M \\oplus R$ is a right co-Kasch module.\n\nThe paper consists of three sections, and is organized as follows.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13A18, 16D10, 16D90, 16P20, 16P40.\n    Key words and phrases. Kasch modules; co-Kasch modules; H-rings; max-rings.\n\nIn section 2, we give some examples, closure properties and some characterizations of co-Kasch modules. We show that, $M$ is a right co-Kasch module if and only if every simple $S$ in $\\sigma[M]$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. A projective right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if $P$ is a generator for $\\sigma[P]$. We prove that, arbitrary direct sum of co-Kasch modules is again co-Kasch. On the other hand, direct summands or homomorphic image of co-Kasch modules need not be co-Kasch. It is shown that, if $M$ is a co-Kasch right module, then $\\frac{M}{K}$ is co-Kasch for each $K \\subseteq \\operatorname{Rad}(M)$.\n\nIn section 3, mainly we focus on investigation of the rings whose right $R$-modules are co-Kasch. Over a right $V$-ring, every right module is co-Kasch. If $R$ is a local ring, then every right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is right perfect. We prove that, all right $R$-modules are co-Kasch if $R$ is right $H$-ring and right max-ring; and the converse statement is true if the injective hulls of simple right $R$-modules are locally artinian. If $R$ is right noetherian, then every right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is right artinian right $H$-ring. Note that a right $R$-module $M$ is locally artinian if every finitely generated submodule of $M$ is artinian; and $R$ is right $H$-ring if there is no nonzero homomorphism between the injective hulls of nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules.\nWe also deal with rings whose cyclic or finitely generated right modules are co-Kasch. Over a commutative ring every cyclic module is co-Kasch. If $R$ is either local or right $H$-ring, then every finitely generated right $R$-module is co-Kasch. Over a right artinian ring $R$, all right modules are right co-Kasch if and only if every finitely generated right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if $\\operatorname{Ext}_{R}(U, V)=0$ for each nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules $U$ and $V$. For a right artinian ring $R$, we prove that every finitely generated projective right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if the Cartan matrix of $R$ is a diagonal matrix. If $E(R)$ is projective, then $E(R)$ is right co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is right self-injective. For a commutative Noetherian ring $R$, we obtain that $E(R)$ is co-Kasch if and only if $R$ is a Kasch ring.\nIf $M$ is a co-Kasch right $R$-module which is either right max-projective or a right semiartinian, then $M$ is retractable. We obtain a characterization of right $H$-rings in terms of right Kasch modules. We prove that, $R$ is a right $H$-ring if and only if $E(S)$ is a right Kasch module for each simple right $R$-module $S$. The rings whose right modules are Kasch are not completely known. Some sufficient conditions for such rings are given in [5]. We give a necessary condition for such rings. Namely, we show that if every right $R$-module is right Kasch, then $R$ is a right $H$-ring and right semiartinian.\n\nIn section 4, co-Kasch modules are studied over commutative rings. For a Pr\u00fcfer domain $R$, we prove that $R$ is Dedekind if and only if every nonzero ideal of $R$ is co-Kasch. A characterization of co-Kasch modules over the ring of integers is obtained. Namely, we prove that, a nonzero torsion $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $M$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $p M \\neq M$ for each prime $p$ with $T_{p}(M) \\neq 0$, where $T_{p}(M)$ is the $p$-primary component of the torsion submodule of $M$. If $M \\neq T(M)$, then $M$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $p M \\neq M$ for each prime $p$.\n\nThroughout this paper, $R$ is a ring with unity and modules are unital right $R$-modules. As usual, we denote the radical, the socle and the injective hull of a module $M$ by $\\operatorname{Rad}(M)$,\n\n$\\operatorname{Soc}(M)$ and $E(M)$, respectively. We write $J(R)$ for the Jacobson radical of the ring $R$. We write $N \\subseteq M$ if $N$ is a submodule of $M$. We also write $M^{(I)}$ for the direct sum of $I$-copies of $M . \\Omega$ will stand for the set of maximal right ideals of a ring $R$. The torsion submodule of a module $M$ over a commutative domain is denoted by $T(M)$. We refer to [3], [12], [15] and [21] for all undefined notions in this paper.",

      "text": "# 2. Co-Kasch modules \n\nAs a dual notion to Kasch modules we investigate the following modules.\nDefinition 2.1. Let $M$ be a right $R$-module.\n(a) A module $N$ is said to be a subfactor of $M$ if $N \\subseteq \\frac{M}{K}$ for some $K \\subseteq M$. If, in addition, $N$ is a simple module, $N$ is called a simple subfactor of $M$.\n(b) A right module $M$ is said to be a co-Kasch module if every simple subfactor of $M$ is a homomorphic image of $M$.\n\nProposition 2.2. The following are equivalent for a right $R$-module $M$.\n(1) $M$ is co-Kasch.\n(2) $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$ for each simple subfactor $S$ of $M$.\n(3) If $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(m R, S) \\neq 0$ for some $m \\in M$ and simple right $R$-module $S$, then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) is clear from the definition of co-Kasch module.\n(2) $\\Rightarrow$ (3) Suppose $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(m R, S) \\neq 0$ for some $m \\in M$ and simple right $R$-module $S$. Then $\\frac{m R}{K} \\cong S$ for some $K \\subseteq m R$. Thus $S$ is isomorphic to simple subfactor of $M$, so $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$ by (2).\n(3) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) Let $\\frac{N}{K}$ be a simple subfactor of $M$, where $K \\subseteq N \\subseteq M$. Let $n$ be an element of $N$ which is not in $K$. Then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(n R, \\frac{N}{K}\\right) \\neq 0$. Thus $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(n R, \\frac{N}{K}\\right) \\neq 0$ by (3). Hence $M$ is a co-Kasch module.\n\nIn the following proposition we give some examples of modules that are co-Kasch.\nProposition 2.3. The following are hold.\n(1) The module $N \\oplus R$ is right co-Kasch module for every right $R$-module $N$.\n(2) Semisimple right $R$-modules and free right $R$-modules are co-Kasch modules.\n(3) For every right $R$-module $M$, the modules\n\n$$\nM_{1}=M \\oplus\\left(\\oplus_{P \\in \\Omega} \\frac{R}{P}\\right) \\text { and } M_{2}=M \\oplus\\left(\\prod_{P \\in \\Omega} \\frac{R}{P}\\right)\n$$\n\nare right co-Kasch modules, where $\\Omega$ is the set of all maximal right ideals of $R$.\nProof. (1) Every simple right $R$-module is a homomorphic image of $R$. Thus $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(N \\oplus$ $R, S) \\neq 0$ for each simple right $R$-module $S$. Hence $N \\oplus R$ is a right co-Kasch module.\n(2) Clearly semisimple modules are co-Kasch. On the other hand, free right modules are co-Kasch by (1).\n\n(3) It is easy to see that every simple right $R$-module is a homomorphic image of $\\oplus_{P \\in \\Omega} \\frac{R}{P}$ and $\\prod_{P \\in \\Omega} \\frac{R}{P}$. Hence, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are right co-Kasch modules.\n\nA right $R$-module $N$ is said to be $M$-generated if there exists an epimorphism $M^{(I)} \\rightarrow N$ for some index set $I$. Following Wisbauer [21], $\\sigma[M]$ denotes the full subcategory of $\\operatorname{Mod}-R$, whose objects are the submodules of $M$-generated modules, that is,\n\n$$\n\\sigma[M]=\\left\\{N \\in \\operatorname{Mod}-\\mathrm{R} \\mid N \\subseteq \\frac{M^{(I)}}{K} \\text { for some index set } I\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn [1], it is shown that a right $R$-module $M$ is a Kasch module if and only if every simple module in $\\sigma[M]$ can be embedded into $M$. Now we shall prove a corresponding result for co-Kasch modules. First, we need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.4. Every simple module in $\\sigma[M]$ is isomorphic to a subfactor of $M$.\nProof. Let $S$ be a simple module in $\\sigma[M]$. Then there is a module $N$ such that $S \\subseteq N$ and an epimorphism $f: M^{(I)} \\rightarrow N$ for some index set $I$. Let $S=a R$, where $a \\in N$. Then $a=f(b)$ for some $b \\in M^{(I)}$. Since $b \\in M^{(F)}$ for some finite subset $F$ of $I, S \\subseteq f\\left(M^{(F)}\\right)$. Therefore we can replace $N$ by $f\\left(M^{(F)}\\right)$. So we have an epimorphism $f: M_{1} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus M_{n} \\rightarrow N$ for some positive integer $n$, where each $M_{i}=M$ and $S \\subseteq N$. By induction on $n$ we will prove that $S$ is a subfactor of some $M_{i}$, that is a subfactor of $M$. The case $n=1$ is trivial. Let $n=k>1$, and assume that the statement is true for all $n<k$. Denote $M_{2} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus M_{n}$ by $L$. If $f\\left(M_{1}\\right) \\cap S \\neq 0$, then $S \\subseteq f\\left(M_{1}\\right)$, therefore $S$ is a subfactor of $M_{1}$. If $f\\left(M_{1}\\right) \\cap S=0$, then for the canonical epimorphism $\\sigma: N \\rightarrow \\frac{N}{f\\left(M_{1}\\right)}=A$ we have $\\operatorname{Ker}(\\sigma) \\cap S=f\\left(M_{1}\\right) \\cap S=0$, so $S \\cong(\\sigma f)(S) \\subseteq A$. On the other hand, for the projection $p: M_{1} \\oplus L \\rightarrow L$, we have $\\operatorname{Ker}(p)=M_{1} \\subseteq \\operatorname{Ker}(\\sigma f)$, therefore by Factor Theorem there is a homomorphism $g: L \\rightarrow A$ such that $\\sigma f=g p$. Since $g p=\\sigma f$ is an epimorphism $g$ is an epimorphism as well. So we have an epimorphism $g: M_{2} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus M_{n} \\rightarrow A$ and $S$ is isomorphic to a submodule of $A$. By the assumption of induction $S$ is a subfactor of $M_{i}$ for some $i=2, \\ldots, n$, that is a subfactor of $M$.\nProposition 2.5. The following statements are equivalent for a right module $M$ :\n(1) $M$ is a right co-Kasch module,\n(2) Every simple module in $\\sigma[M]$ is a homomorphic image of $M$,\n(3) Every simple module in $\\sigma[M]$ is generated by $M$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Let $S$ be a simple module in $\\sigma[M]$. Then $S$ is isomorphic to simple subfactor of $M$ by Lemma 2.4. Since $M$ is a co-Kasch module, $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$. That is, $S$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. This proves (2).\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(3)$ is clear. $(3) \\Rightarrow(1)$ Let $S$ be a simple subfactor of $M$. Then $S \\in \\sigma[M]$, and so there is a nonzero homomorphism $f: M \\rightarrow S$ by (3). Thus $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$, and so $M$ is a co-Kasch module.\n\nRecall that, given two right $R$-modules $P$ and $M$, the module $P$ is said to be $M$ projective if for any epimorphism $g: M \\rightarrow N$ and homomorphism $f: P \\rightarrow N$, there exists $h: P \\rightarrow M$ such that $f=g h$.\n\nProposition 2.6. Let $P$ be an $M$-projective right $R$-module. Then $P$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $P$ is a generator for the category $\\sigma[M]$.\nProof. By $[21,18.5]$, an $M$-projective right $R$-module $P$ is a generator for $\\sigma[M]$ if and only if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(P, S) \\neq 0$ for each simple module in $\\sigma[M]$. Hence the conclusion follows by Proposition 2.5.\n\nProposition 2.7. If $\\left\\{M_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ is a family of co-Kasch modules, for an index set $I$, then $\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}$ is a co-Kasch module.\nProof. Let $S$ be a simple subfactor of $\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}$. Then $S \\subseteq \\frac{\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}}{K}$ for some $K \\subseteq \\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}$. Set $N=\\frac{\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}}{K}$ and let $f: \\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i} \\rightarrow N$ be the canonical epimorphism. Now, exactly the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 2.4 shows that $S$ is isomorphic to a subfactor of $M_{i}$ for some $i \\in I$. Since $M_{i}$ is co-Kasch module, $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(M_{i}, S\\right) \\neq 0$, and so $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}, S\\right) \\neq$ 0 . Thus the module $\\oplus_{i \\in I} M_{i}$ is co-Kasch.\n\nCo-Kasch modules are not closed under direct summands or under factor modules. For example, the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}$ is co-Kasch by Proposition 2.3(1). On the other hand, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a co-Kasch $\\mathbb{Z}$-module since it has no any simple factor.\nProposition 2.8. Let $M$ be right co-Kash module. Then $\\frac{M}{K}$ is co-Kasch for every $K \\subseteq$ $\\operatorname{Rad}(M)$.\nProof. Let $S$ be a simple subfactor of $\\frac{M}{K}$. Clearly, $S$ is a simple subfactor of $M$, as well. Then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, S) \\neq 0$, so there is a nonzero epimorphism $f: M \\rightarrow S$. Since $S$ is a simple module, $\\operatorname{Ker}(f)$ is a maximal submodule of $M$. Thus $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Ker}(f)$ and so, by factor theorem, there is a nonzero homomorphism $g: \\frac{M}{K} \\rightarrow S$ such that $g \\pi=f$, where $\\pi: M \\rightarrow \\frac{M}{K}$ is the canonical epimorphism. Therefore $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(\\frac{M}{K}, S\\right) \\neq 0$, and so $\\frac{M}{K}$ is a co-Kasch module.",

The following are hold.\n(1) If $M$ is a nonzero right co-Kasch module, then $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\neq M$.\n(2) If $R$ is a local ring, then a nonzero right $R$-module $M$ is co-Kasch if and only if $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\neq M$.\n(3) If every right $R$-module is co-Kasch, then $R$ is a right max-ring.\n\nProof. (1) Let $N$ be a nonzero right $R$-module. Let $0 \\neq x \\in N$. Then, $x R$ has a maximal submodule say $K$. Then $S=\\frac{x R}{K}$ is a simple subfactor of $N$. By the hypothesis, $N$ is a co-Kasch module and so $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(N, S) \\neq 0$. Therefore $N$ has a maximal submodule, and so $\\operatorname{Rad}(N) \\neq N$.\n(2) Necessity follows from (1). Suppose that $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\neq M$. Then $M$ has a simple factor. Since $R$ is local, $\\frac{R}{J(R)}$ is the unique simple right $R$-module up to isomorphism. Then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(M, \\frac{R}{J(R)}\\right) \\neq 0$. Thus $M$ is co-Kasch.\n\n(3) Let $M$ be a nonzero right $R$-module. If $M$ is co-Kasch then $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\neq M$ by (1). Thus, every nonzero right $R$-module has a maximal submodule. Hence $R$ is a right max-ring.\n\nIn the following theorem we give some sufficient conditions for the rings whose right modules are co-Kasch.\n\nTheorem 3.2. Consider the following statements for a ring $R$.\n(1) $R$ is a right $H$-ring and a right max-ring.\n(2) Every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\n(3) Right co-Kasch modules are closed under factor modules.\n(4) Right co-Kasch modules are closed under submodules.\n(5) Right co-Kasch modules are closed under direct summands.\n\nThen $(1) \\Rightarrow(2) \\Longleftrightarrow(3) \\Longleftrightarrow(4) \\Longleftrightarrow(5)$\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Let $M$ be a right $R$-module and $S=\\frac{N}{K}$ be a simple subfactor of $M$. Then there is a nonzero homomorphism $g: \\frac{M}{K} \\rightarrow E(S)$ such that the following diagram is commutative.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nThus $g \\pi: M \\rightarrow E(S)$ is a nonzero homomorphism, where $\\pi: M \\rightarrow \\frac{M}{K}$ is the canonical epimorphism. Then for $L=\\operatorname{Ker}(g \\pi)$, we have $\\frac{M}{L} \\cong \\operatorname{Im}(g \\pi) \\subseteq E(S)$. Since $R$ is a right max-ring, $\\frac{M}{L}$ has a simple factor say $X$. Then $X \\cong S$ by the right $H$-ring assumption. Hence, $M$ has a simple factor isomorphic to $S$, and so $M$ is a right co-Kasch module. This proves (2).\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(3) \\Rightarrow(5)$ are clear. $(5) \\Rightarrow(2)$ Let $M$ be a right $R$-module. Then $M \\oplus R$ is a right co-Kasch module by Proposition 2.3. Then $M$ is a right co-Kasch module by (5). Therefore, every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(4) \\Rightarrow(5)$ are clear.\nA ring $R$ is said to be right co-noetherian if the injective hull of each simple right $R$ module is artinian. Right $V$-rings and $Q F$-rings are trivial examples of right co-noetherian rings. Commutative noetherian rings are co-noetherian (see [17]). A ring $R$ is said to satisfy the $(\\diamond)$ property if $E(S)$ is locally artinian for each simple right $R$-module $S$. Right co-noetherian and right artinian rings satisfy $(\\diamond)$. For characterizations of certain rings and algebras that satisfy the $(\\diamond)$ property we refer to [6], [9], [10], [14].\n\nWe do not know whether the statement (1) in Theorem 3.2 is necessary for the implication (2), in general. For certain rings including the rings satisfy $(\\diamond)$, right noetherian rings and local rings the assumption that all right modules are co-Kasch implies the ring is right $H$-ring and right max-ring. We begin with the following.\n\nTheorem 3.3. The following are equivalent for a ring $R$ that satisfy $(\\diamond)$.\n(1) $R$ is a right $H$-ring and right max-ring.\n(2) Every right $R$-module is co-Kasch.\n(3) Every subfactor of $E(S)$ is co-Kasch, for each simple right $R$-module $S$.\n\nProof. $(1) \\Rightarrow(2)$ By Theorem 3.2, and $(2) \\Rightarrow(3)$ is clear.\n$(3) \\Rightarrow(1)$ First, let us prove that $R$ is a right $H$-ring. Assume the contrary. Then there are two nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ with $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(E\\left(S_{1}\\right), E\\left(S_{2}\\right)\\right) \\neq 0$. Let $f: E\\left(S_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow E\\left(S_{2}\\right)$ be a nonzero homomorphism. Since $S_{2}$ is essential in $E\\left(S_{2}\\right), S_{2}$ is essential in $\\operatorname{Im}(f)$. Denote $\\operatorname{Ker}(f)$ by $K_{1}$. Let $A_{1}=f^{-1}\\left(S_{2}\\right)$. Since $S_{2}$ is cyclic, without loss of generality, we may assume that $A_{1}$ is a cyclic module as well. Since $S_{1} \\nsubseteq S_{2}$ and $S_{2}$ is essential in $E\\left(S_{2}\\right), f\\left(S_{1}\\right)=0$, so $S_{1} \\subseteq K_{1} \\subseteq A_{1}$. By (2), $K_{1}$ is a co-Kasch module, therefore there is a nonzero homomorphism $g_{1}: K_{1} \\rightarrow S_{1}$, which is clearly an epimorphism. Taking a pushout diagram we will have the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nwhere $K_{2}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(g_{1}\\right)$ and $i_{1}: K_{2} \\rightarrow K_{1}$ is the inclusion map. Since $B_{1}$ is a co-Kasch module there is a nonzero homomorphism $s: B_{1} \\rightarrow S_{1}$. If $\\operatorname{Ker}(k)=\\operatorname{Im}(h) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Ker}(s)$, then there is an epimorphism $S_{2} \\rightarrow S_{1}$ by the factor theorem, contradiction. So $\\operatorname{Im}(h) \\nsubseteq \\operatorname{Ker}(s)$, therefore $s h: S_{1} \\rightarrow S_{1}$ is an isomorphism, that is $E^{\\prime}$ is splitting. If $K_{1}=S_{1}$, then $g_{1}=1_{S_{1}}, B_{1}=A_{1}$, so $S_{1}$ is a direct summand of $A_{1}$, a contradiction. Let $K_{1} \\neq S_{1}$. From the long exact sequence\ninduced by the short exact sequence $E^{\\prime \\prime}: 0 \\longrightarrow K_{2} \\xrightarrow{i_{1}} K_{1} \\xrightarrow{g_{1}} S_{1} \\longrightarrow 0$, we obtain that $E_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(g_{1_{*}}\\right)=\\operatorname{Im}\\left(i_{1_{*}}\\right)$, therefore $E_{1}=i_{1_{*}}\\left(E_{2}\\right)$ for some\n\n$$\nE_{2}: 0 \\longrightarrow K_{2} \\longrightarrow A_{2} \\longrightarrow S_{2} \\longrightarrow 0\n$$\n\nIf $S_{1} \\nsubseteq K_{2}$ then $E^{\\prime \\prime}$ is splitting, so $K_{1}$ contains a direct summand $X$ isomorphic to $S_{1}$. Then either $X \\cap S_{1}=0$ or $X=S_{1}$. Both cases contradicts with the fact that $S_{1}$ is essential in $K_{1}$,\n\nand so $S_{1} \\subseteq K_{2}$. Since $K_{2}$ is a co-Kasch module, there is an epimorphism $g_{2}: K_{2} \\rightarrow S_{1}$. In a similar way we will have the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns, first row of which is splitting\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nContinuing in this way we will have a descending chain\n\n$$\nA_{1} \\supseteq K_{1} \\supseteq K_{2} \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq S_{1}\n$$\n\nand corresponding exact diagrams. Since $E\\left(S_{1}\\right)$ is locally artinian and $A_{1}$ is cyclic, $A_{1}$ artinian. Thus $K_{n}=S_{1}$ for some positive integer $n$, and so $S_{1}$ is a direct summand in $A_{n}$, a contradiction. Therefore, $R$ is a right $H$-ring.\n\nNow let us prove that $R$ is right max-ring as well. For this, suppose the contrary that there is a nonzero right $R$-module $M$ such that $\\operatorname{Rad}(M)=M$. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of representatives of nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules. Then $E=\\oplus_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} E(S)$ is an injective cogenerator for the category of right $R$-modules. Thus there is a monomorphism $f: M \\rightarrow E^{I}$ for some index set $I$. Since $f$ is nonzero, there is a nonzero homomorphim $g$ : $M \\rightarrow E(S)$ for some $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Then $\\frac{M}{\\operatorname{Ker}(g)} \\cong g(M) \\subseteq E(S)$ implies that, $\\operatorname{Rad}(g(M))=g(M)$. Thus, $g(M)$ is not a co-Kasch module. This contradicts the assumption (2). Therefore, $\\operatorname{Rad}(M) \\neq M$ for every right $R$-module $M$. Hence $R$ is a right max-ring.\n\nA ring $R$ is said to be right $V$-ring if every simple right $R$-module is injective.\nCorollary 3.4. Over a right $V$-ring, every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\nProof. Let $R$ be a right $V$-ring. Every simple right $R$-module is injective, so $R$ is a right $H$-ring. On the other hand, $\\operatorname{Rad}(M)=0$, for every right $R$-module $M$ (see [15]). Thus $R$ is a right max-ring. Now the proof follows by Theorem 3.3.\n\nCorollary 3.5. Let $R$ be a right noetherian ring. The following are equivalent.\n(1) Every right $R$-module is co-Kasch.\n(2) $R$ is right artinian right $H$-ring.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Suppose every right $R$-module is co-Kasch. Then $R$ is right max by Proposition 3.1. Being right noetherian and right max, $R$ is right artinian by [16]. Then $R$ is right $H$-ring by Theorem 3.3. This proves (2).\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(1)$ By Theorem 3.2 .\nLocal rings are right $H$-rings, because a local ring has a unique simple right module up to isomorphism. Semilocal right max-rings are perfect by [16], and a local ring $R$ is right perfect if and only if $R$ is right max-ring. Hence the following is clear by Proposition $3.1(2)$.\n\nCorollary 3.6. If $R$ is a local ring, then every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is right perfect.\n\nThere are local rings that are right perfect which do not satisfy the ( $\\diamond$ ) property (see, [9, Example 5.2]).\n\nProposition 3.7. The following statements are equivalent for a right artinian ring $R$.\n(1) Every right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\n(2) Every finitely generated right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\n(3) $\\operatorname{Ext}_{R}\\left(S_{1}, S_{2}\\right)=0$ for each nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules $S_{1}, S_{2}$.\n(4) $R$ is a right $H$-ring.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) is clear. (2) $\\Rightarrow$ (4) Note that right artinian rings satisfy the $(\\diamond)$ property. With same notation as in the the proof of Theorem $3.2(2) \\Rightarrow(1)$ we have $A_{1}$ is cyclic. So that by the right artinian assumption every submodule of $A_{1}$ is finitely generated. Hence similar arguments shows that $R$ is right $H$-ring.\n(3) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (4) By [19, Theorem 9] a ring $R$ is a right $H$-ring if and only if $\\operatorname{Ext}_{R}\\left(S_{1}, S_{2}\\right)=0$ for each nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules $S_{1}, S_{2}$.\n(4) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) Right artinian rings are right max. Thus (1) follows by Proposition 3.17.\n\nA nonzero idempotent $e \\in R$ is said to be primitive if $e R$ is indecomposable as a right $R$-module (see, [16, Proposition 21.8]). Such modules $e R$ are called principal indecomposable modules. Principal indecomposable right modules are local, and so each principal indecomposable module $e R$ has a unique maximal submodule which is $e J$, where $J$ denotes the Jacobson radical of $R$. Every right artinian ring can be written as a direct sum of principal indecomposable right $R$-modules.\n\nFor a right artinian ring $R$, let $e_{1} R, \\ldots, e_{r} R$ represent a complete set of isomorphism classes of principal indecomposable right $R$-modules, and let $V_{j}=\\frac{e_{j} R}{e_{j} R}$ so that $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{r}$ represent a complete set of isomorphism classes of simple right $R$-modules [16, Theorem 25.3 (1)]. Let $c_{i j} \\geq 0$ be the number of composition factors of $e_{i} R$ which are isomorphic to $V_{j}$. The matrix\n\n$$\nC=\\left(c_{i j}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{M}_{r}(\\mathbb{Z})\n$$\n\nis called the (right) Cartan matrix of $R$. Note that the diagonal elements $c_{i i}$ are $\\geq 1$, and the sum of the $i$ th row of $C$ is just the (composition) length of $e_{i} R$.\n\nProposition 3.8. Let $R$ be a right artinian ring. The following statements are equivalent.\n\n(1) Every finitely generated projective right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module;\n(2) Every principal indecomposable right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module;\n(3) The Cartan matrix of $R$ is a diagonal matrix.\n\nProof. $(1) \\Rightarrow(2)$ is clear.\n$(2) \\Leftrightarrow(3)$ Let $e_{1} R, \\cdots, e_{s} R$ be the principal indecomposable right $R$-modules. For $i \\in\\{1, \\cdots, n\\}$ let\n\n$$\n0=A_{0} \\subseteq A_{1} \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq A_{n_{i}}=e_{i} R\n$$\n\nbe a composition series of $e_{i} R$. Set $V_{t}=\\frac{A_{t}}{A_{t-i}}$ for $t=1, \\cdots n_{i}$. Since $e_{i} R$ is a local right $R$-module, $\\frac{e_{i} R}{e_{i} J}$ is the unique simple factor of $e_{i} R$. Now it is easy to see that $V_{t} \\cong \\frac{e_{i} R}{e_{i} J}$ for each $t=1, \\cdots n_{i}$ if and only if $c_{i i}=c l\\left(e_{i} R\\right)$, and $c_{i j}=0$ for each $j \\neq i$. Hence the proof follows.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(1)$ Over a right artinian ring every finitely generated projective right $R$-module $P$ is a direct sum of principal indecomposable right $R$-modules (see, [16, Theorem 25.3(2)]). Now, (1) follows by (2) and Proposition 2.7.\n\nAt this point, it is natural to ask what are the rings whose cyclic or finitely generated right modules are co-Kasch modules. It is easy to see that local rings have this property by Proposition 3.1(2).\nProposition 3.9. If $R$ is commutative, then every cyclic $R$-module is a co-Kasch module. Proof. Let $C \\cong \\frac{R}{J}$ be a cyclic $R$-module and $X$ be a simple subfactor of $\\frac{R}{J}$. Then $X \\cong \\frac{A}{J} \\subseteq$ $\\frac{R}{J}$ for some ideal $J$ with $I \\subseteq J$. Let $P=a n n_{R}\\left(\\frac{A}{J}\\right)$. Note that $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(\\frac{R}{I}, \\frac{R}{P}\\right) \\neq 0$. Then, as $X$ is a simple $R$-module, $P$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ with $J \\subseteq P$. Then $\\frac{A}{J} \\cong \\frac{R}{P}$ and so $\\frac{A}{J}$ is isomorphic to a simple factor of $\\frac{R}{I}$. Hence $\\frac{R}{I}$ is a co-Kasch module.\nProposition 3.10. If $R$ is a right $H$-ring, then every finitely generated right $R$-module is a co-Kasch module.\nProof. Suppose that $R$ is a right $H$-ring, and $M$ a finitely generated right $R$-module. Let $S=\\frac{A}{B} \\subseteq \\frac{M}{B}$ be a simple subfactor of $M$. There is a nonzero homomorphism $f: \\frac{M}{B} \\rightarrow E(S)$. Then $\\frac{M}{\\operatorname{Ker}(f)}$ is isomorphic to a nonzero submodule of $E(S)$. Since $\\frac{M}{\\operatorname{Ker}(f)}$ is finitely generated and nonzero, there is a maximal submodule $K$ of $M$ such that $\\frac{M}{K} \\cong U$, where $U$ is a simple subfactor of $E(S)$. By the hypothesis, $R$ is a right $H$-ring, thus $U \\cong S$. Therefore every simple subfactor of $M$ is isomorphic to a simple factor of $M$. Hence $M$ is a co-Kasch module.\n\nA ring $R$ is said to be right dual Kasch if every simple right $R$-module is a homomorphic image of an injective right $R$-module. Dual Kasch rings are investigated and studied in [7].\nProposition 3.11. $E(R)$ is a right co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is right dual Kasch.\nProof. Suppose $E(R)$ is a right co-Kasch module. Since $R \\subseteq E(R)$, every simple right $R$-module is a subfactor of $E(R)$. Thus every simple right $R$-module is a homomorphic image of $E(R)$, and so $R$ is right dual Kasch. This proves the necessity. Sufficiency follows by $[7$, Theorem $2.1(2)]$.\n\nCorollary 3.12. If $R$ is a right max and right $H$-ring, then $R$ is right dual Kasch.\nA commutative ring is said to be classical if every element is either a zero-divisor or a unit.\n\nCorollary 3.13. Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring. The following statements are equivalent.\n(1) $E(R)$ is a co-Kasch module.\n(2) $R$ is a classical ring.\n(3) $R$ is a dual Kasch ring.\n(4) $R$ is a Kasch ring.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (3) By Proposition 3.11. (2) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (3) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (4) By [7, Theorem 3.4.].\nProposition 3.14. If $E(R)$ is projective, then $E(R)$ is a right co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is right self-injective.\n\nProof. Suppose that $E(R)$ is a right co-Kasch module. Then every simple right $R$-module is a homomorphic image of $E(R)$. Then projectivity of $E(R)$ implies that, $E(R)$ is a generator for Mod- $R$. Thus $E(R)^{n} \\cong K \\oplus R$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Therefore $R$ is right self-injective. Sufficiency is clear.\n\nRecall that, a right $R$-module $M$ is said to be retractable if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M, N) \\neq 0$ for each nonzero submodule $N$ of $M$. A right $R$-module $M$ is said to be max-projective if for every maximal right ideal $I$ of $R$, any homomorphism $f: M \\rightarrow R / I$ can be lifted to a homomorphism $g: M \\rightarrow R$ (see, [2]).\n\nLemma 3.15. Let $M$ be a right max-projective module. If $M$ is a co-Kasch module, then $M$ is retractable.\n\nProof. Let $N$ be a nonzero submodule of $M$, and $0 \\neq x \\in N$. Let $K$ be a maximal submodule of $x R$. Since $M$ is a co-Kasch module and $\\frac{x R}{K}$ is a simple subfactor of $M$, $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(M, \\frac{x R}{K}\\right) \\neq 0$. Let $f: M \\rightarrow \\frac{x R}{K}$ be a nonzero homomorphism. By the max-projectivity assumption on $M$, there is a homomorphism $g: M \\rightarrow x R$ such that $\\pi g=f$, where $\\pi: x R \\rightarrow \\frac{x R}{K}$ is the canonical epimorphism. Then $g i: M \\rightarrow N$ is a nonzero homomorphism, where $i: x R \\rightarrow N$ is the inclusion map. Therefore, $M$ is a retractable right $R$-module, as desired.\n\nProposition 3.16. Let $M$ be a right semiartinian co-Kasch module. Then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(M, \\frac{N}{K}\\right) \\neq$ 0 for each submodules $K \\subsetneq N \\subsetneq M$. In particular, $M$ is retractable.\n\nNow we shall mention several results about Kasch modules. We observe the following characterization of right $H$-rings in terms of Kasch modules.\n\nProposition 3.17. The following statements are equivalent for a ring $R$ :\n(1) $R$ is a right $H$-ring;\n(2) every simple subfactor of $E(S)$ is isomorphic to $S$ for each simple right $R$-module $S$\n\n(3) for every simple right $R$-module $S$, each submodule of $E(S)$ is a Kasch module;\n(4) $E(S)$ is a Kasch module for each simple right $R$-module $S$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Suppose $A$ is a right $H$-ring. Let $S$ be a simple right $R$-module and $E(S)$ be its injective hull. Let $U=\\frac{X}{Y}$ be a simple subfactor of $E(S)$. We need to show that, $S \\cong U$. Assume the contrary that $U$ and $S$ are not isomorphic. Let $f: \\frac{X}{Y} \\rightarrow \\frac{E(S)}{Y}$ and $g: \\frac{X}{Y} \\rightarrow E\\left(\\frac{X}{Y}\\right)$ be the inclusion homomorphisms. Then by injectivity of $E\\left(\\frac{X}{Y}\\right)$, there is a (nonzero) homomorphism $h: \\frac{E(S)}{Y} \\rightarrow E\\left(\\frac{X}{Y}\\right)$. Therefore for the natural epimorhism $\\pi: E(S) \\rightarrow \\frac{E(S)}{Y}$, we obtain $0 \\neq h \\pi \\in \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(E(S), E\\left(\\frac{X}{Y}\\right)\\right)$. This contradicts the fact that, $R$ is right $H$-ring.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(1):$ Let $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ be nonisomorphic simple right $R$-modules. Suppose that there is a nonzero homomorphism $f: E\\left(S_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow E\\left(S_{2}\\right)$. Then $\\frac{E\\left(S_{1}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Kor}(f)} \\cong f\\left(E\\left(S_{2}\\right)\\right)$. Thus, there is a simple factor $\\frac{X}{\\operatorname{Kor}(f)} \\cong S_{2}$. This contradicts the assumption that simple subfactors of $E\\left(S_{1}\\right)$ are isomorphic to $S_{1}$. Thus, we must have $f=0$, and so $R$ is a right $H$-ring.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(3)$ Let $K$ be a nonzero submodule of $E(S)$ and $U$ be a simple subfactor of $K$. Then $U$ is also a subfactor of $E(S)$, and so $U$ is isomorphic to $S$ by (2). Since $\\operatorname{Soc}(E(S))=S$ and $K$ is nonzero, $\\operatorname{Soc}(K)=S$. Therefore $U$ embeds in $K$, and so $K$ is a Kasch module.\n$(3) \\Rightarrow(2)$ and $(3) \\Rightarrow(4)$ are clear.\nThe authors in [1], ask about the rings all whose right modules are Kasch. To the best of our knowledge, this question is not solved completely. In [5], the authors gives some sufficient conditions for the rings having this property. We observed the following necessary conditions for the rings whose right modules are Kasch.\n\nProposition 3.18. If every right $R$-module is a Kasch module, then $R$ is a right $H$-ring and right semiartinian.\n\nProof. Suppose every right $R$-module is Kasch. Then $R$ is a right $H$-ring by Theorem 3.17. Let $M$ be a nonzero right $R$-module and $0 \\neq m \\in M$. Then $m R$ has a maximal submodule $K$, and $\\frac{m R}{K}$ is a simple subfactor of $M$. Therefore $\\frac{m R}{K}$ embeds in $M$, because $M$ is a Kasch module and so $\\operatorname{Soc}(M) \\neq 0$. Thus the assumption implies that every nonzero right $R$-module contains a simple submodule. Hence $R$ is right semiartinian.\n\nThe converse of Proposition 3.18 is not true in general. That is, there are right semiartinian right $H$-rings that admit right modules that are not right Kasch. For example the ring given in [1, Remarks 3.14 (3)], is a semartinian V-ring (hence an H-ring) which has a module that is not Kasch.",

We prove that, a Pr\u00fcfer domain $R$ is Dedekind if and only if every ideal of $R$ is a co-Kasch module. We also characterize co-Kasch modules over the ring of integers.\n\nProposition 4.1. Let $R$ be a domain and $M$ be an $R$-module. If $M \\neq T(M)$, then $M$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{R}\\left(M, \\frac{R}{P}\\right) \\neq 0$ for each $P \\in \\Omega$.\n\nProof. Suppose that, $M$ is a co-Kasch module. Since $M \\neq T(M)$, there is an $m \\in M$ such that $m R \\cong R$. Thus every simple module is a homomorphic image of $M$ by the coKasch module assumption. Then for each maximal ideal $P$ of $R$, there is an epimorphism $f_{P}: M \\rightarrow \\frac{R}{P}$. This follows the necessity. Sufficiency is clear.\n\nLemma 4.2. Let $R$ be a valuation domain. Every ideal of $R$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is a DVR.\n\nProof. Sufficiency is clear. To prove the necessity, let $\\mathbf{p}$ be the unique maximal ideal of $R$. By the hypothesis $\\mathbf{p}$ is a co-Kasch module, and so $\\mathbf{p}^{2} \\neq \\mathbf{p}$, otherwise $\\mathbf{p}$ would have no simple factors. Let $p \\in \\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{p}^{2}$. Then $\\mathbf{p}=R p$, because $R$ is a valuation domain. Now consider the ideal $I=\\cap_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+} } R p^{n}$. Then by [2, Proposition 15] $I$ has no maximal submodules i.e. $\\operatorname{Rad}(I)=I$. Thus, since $I$ is co-Kasch by the assumption, $I=0$, by Proposition 3.1(1). Therefore $R$ is a DVR by [4, page 99, Exercise 4].\n\nProposition 4.3. Let $R$ be a Pr\u00fcfer domain. The following statements are equivalent.\n(1) Every ideal of $R$ is a co-Kasch module.\n(2) Every ideal of $R_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a co-Kasch module for every $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\Omega$.\n(3) $R_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a DVR for every $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\Omega$.\n(4) $R$ is Dedekind.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Let $\\mathbf{p}$ be a maximal ideal of $R$, and $B$ be a nonzero proper ideal of $R_{\\mathbf{p}}$. Then there is a proper ideal $A$ of $R$ such that $A_{\\mathbf{p}}=B$. By the hypothesis, $A$ is a co-Kasch module. Thus there is a maximal submodule $C$ of $A$ such that $\\frac{A}{C} \\cong \\frac{R}{\\mathbf{p}}$. Localizing at $\\mathbf{p}$ gives: $\\left(\\frac{A}{C}\\right)_{\\mathbf{p}} \\cong\\left(\\frac{R}{\\mathbf{p}}\\right)_{\\mathbf{p}}$, because localization preserves isomorphisms (see, [12, page 26: B)]) Then $\\frac{A_{\\mathbf{p}}}{C_{\\mathbf{p}}} \\cong \\frac{R_{\\mathbf{p}}}{P_{\\mathbf{p}}}$ by [12, page 26: C)]. Since $R_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a local ring with the unique maximal ideal $\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathbf{p}}$ and $A_{\\mathbf{p}}=B$, we get $\\frac{B}{C_{\\mathbf{p}}} \\cong \\frac{R_{\\mathbf{p}}}{\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathbf{p}}}$ is simple. Thus $C_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a maximal ideal of $B$, and so $B$ is a co-Kasch module by Proposition 3.1(b).\n(2) $\\Rightarrow$ (3) Since $R$ is Pr\u00fcfer, $R_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a valuation domain for each $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\Omega$. Thus (3) follows by Lemma 4.2.\n(3) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Every nonzero ideal of a DVR is isomorphic to $R$. Hence (2) follows.\n(3) $\\Longleftrightarrow(4)$ is clear.\n(4) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) Let $I$ be a nonzero ideal of $R$. Note that $I$ is finitely generated. Since $R$ embeds in $I, I$ has a subfactor isomorpic to every simple $R$-module. For the proof, we need to show that $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(I, \\frac{R}{J}\\right) \\neq 0$ for each maximal ideal $J$ of $R$. Assume that $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(I, \\frac{R}{J}\\right)=0$ for some maximal ideal $J$ of $R$. Then $I=J \\cdot I$. Localizing at the maximal ideal $J$, we obtain $I_{J}=J_{J} \\cdot I_{J}$. Since $R_{J}$ is a local ring with the unique maximal ideal $J_{J}$, the fact that $I_{J}$ is finitely generated and $I_{J}=J_{J} \\cdot I_{J}$ implies that $I_{J}=0$ by Nakayama's Lemma. As $R$ is a domain $I_{J}=0$ gives $I=0$. Contradiction. Therefore $I \\neq J \\cdot I$ for each maximal ideal $J$ of $R$, and so $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(I, \\frac{R}{J}\\right) \\neq 0$. Hence $I$ is a co-Kasch module, and this proves (1).\n\nNow, we shall give a characterization of co-Kasch modules over the ring of integers. For a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $M, T(M)$ is the torsion submodule of $M$. If $p$ is a prime integer the submodule $T_{p}(M)=\\left\\{m \\in M \\mid p^{n} m=0\\right.$ for some positive integer $\\left.n\\right\\}$ is said to be the $p$-primary component of $M$. It is well known that $T(M)=\\bigoplus_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} T_{p}(M)$, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the set of prime integers.\n\nProposition 4.4. The following are hold.\n(a) A nonzero torsion $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $M$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $p M \\neq M$ for each prime $p$ with $T_{p}(M) \\neq 0$.\n(b) If $T(M) \\neq M$, then $M$ is a co-Kasch module if and only if $p M \\neq M$ for each prime $p$.\n\nProof. (a) Since $M$ is torsion, $M=\\oplus_{p \\in A} T_{p}(M)$, where $T_{p}(M)$ is the (nonzero) $p$-primary component of $M$. Suppose $M$ is an $H$-module. Let $p$ be a prime such that $T_{p}(M) \\neq 0$. Then $S=\\operatorname{Soc}\\left(T_{p}(M)\\right) \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}$ is a subfactor of $M$. Since $M$ is a co-Kasch module, $\\frac{M}{L} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}$. This implies that $p M \\neq M$. This show the necessity. Conversely, let $\\frac{X}{Y} \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}$ be a simple subfactor of $M$. We have $\\frac{X}{Y} \\subseteq \\frac{M}{Y} \\cong \\oplus \\frac{T_{p}(M)}{T_{p}(Y)}$. For a prime $q \\neq p, \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}, \\frac{T_{q}(M)}{T_{q}(Y)}\\right)=0$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}, \\frac{T_{p}(M)}{T_{p}(Y)}\\right) \\neq 0$. So that $T_{p}(M) \\neq 0$. Now by the hypothesis $p M \\neq M$, and so $M$ has a simple factor isomorphic to $\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}}{p \\mathbb{Z}}$.\n(b) Sufficiency is clear. For necessity suppose $T(M) \\neq M$. Then $M$ has a submodule isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $M$ has a factor isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ for each prime $p$, by the co-Kasch module assumption. Therefore $p M \\neq M$ for each prime $p$.",

  "abstract": "In this paper we study the modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which is a\nhomomorphic image of $M$ and call them co-Kasch modules. These modules are dual\nto Kasch modules $M$ every simple subfactors of which can be embedded in $M$.\nWe show that a module is co-Kasch if and only if every simple module in\n$\\sigma[M]$ is a homomorphic image of $M$. In particular, a projective right\nmodule $P$ is co-Kasch if and only if $P$ is a generator for $\\sigma[P]$. If\n$R$ is right max and right $H$-ring, then every right $R$-module is co-Kasch;\nand the converse is true for the rings whose simple right modules have locally\nartinian injective hulls. For a right artinian ring $R$, we prove that: (1)\nevery finitely generated right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and only if every\nright $R$-module is a co-Kasch module if and only if $R$ is a right $H$-ring;\nand (2) every finitely generated projective right $R$-module is co-Kasch if and\nonly if the Cartan matrix of $R$ is a diagonal matrix. For a Pr\\\"ufer domain\n$R$, we prove that, every nonzero ideal of $R$ is co-Kasch if and only if $R$\nis Dedekind. The structure of $\\mathbb{Z}$-modules that are co-Kasch is\ncompletely characterized.",
