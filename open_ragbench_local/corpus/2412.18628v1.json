This is a classic problem that can be traced back to ancient sources, such as Aristotle and the Talmud, although its formal treatment is somewhat recent (e.g., O\u2019Neill, 1982). A sizable literature at the intersection of economics and operations research emerged afterwards (see, for instance, Thomson (2019) and the literature cited therein). Some of the efforts within that literature have been devoted to generalize claims problems to account for multiple issues (e.g., Calleja et al., 2005; Ju et al., 2007). ${ }^{1}$\n\nFrom a different vantage point, there has been a growing interest in recent years to analyze platform businesses, which have transformed the ways in which cultural content is produced and consumed (e.g., Aguiar et al., 2024). This is particularly the case with music. According to Statista, in the third quarter of 2024, Spotify (the largest music streaming platform) reached an all-time high with 640 million active users worldwide. The problem of sharing the revenue raised from paid subscriptions to streaming platforms among artists, a new form of revenue sharing problems under bundled pricing (e.g., Adams and Yellen, 1976; Ginsburgh and Zang, 2003; Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2015, 2016) is of critical importance to understand the management of music platforms. We show in this paper that such a problem can actually be approached resorting to the literature on (multi-issue) claims problems mentioned above.\n\nTraditionally, music platforms used a pro-rata method to award artists based on the relative number of total streamings they achieved in the platform. Gradually, they have been moving to a decentralized method in which the amount paid by each user is allocated among the artists that user streamed. If the latter allocation is proportional to individual streamings, we obtain the so-called user-centric method. If, instead, the allocation does not distinguish among artists that were streamed, we obtain the so-called Shapley method. Varying the allocation method, we obtain the family of probabilistic methods (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2025). And compromising between the pro-rata and user-centric methods we obtain the family of weighted methods (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2025).\n\nWe show in this paper that all the methods described above can actually be derived from existing rules to solve (multi-issue) claims problems. Key among the latter are the so-called two-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Acosta et al., $(2022,2023)$ have recently extended this multidimensional setting to allow for crossed claims.\n\nstage rules, which first divide the endowment among issues, and then divide the amount assigned to each issue among the agents. More precisely, we show that the family of probabilistic indices induces the same rewards as the family of two-stage rules where we use the classical constrained equal awards rule in the first stage, and any claims rule (satisfying two basic requirements) for the second stage. Similarly, we show that the family of user-weighted indices induces the same rewards as the family of two-stage rules where we use the classical proportional rule in the second stage, and any claims rule (satisfying a basic requirement) for the first stage.\n\nOur work can thus be interpreted as providing extension operators to convert rules to solve claims problems into rules to solve streaming problems. As such, we align with the literature dealing with operators on the space of claims rules (e.g., Thomson and Yeh, 2008; Hougaard et al., 2012; 2013a; 2013b; Moreno-Ternero and Vidal-Puga, 2021). We also align with the literature that applies the well-established framework from claims problems to solve various related allocation problems with real-life implications. Recent instances are water conflicts (e.g., Mianabadi et al., 2014), linguistic subsidies (e.g., Ginsburgh and Moreno-Ternero, 2018), broadcasting problems (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2020), $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions (e.g., Duro et al., 2020), slots allocation in sport competitions (e.g., Krumer and Moreno-Ternero, 2020), or pollution abatement (e.g., Ju et al., 2021).\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic aspects of claims problems. In Section 3, we introduce the basic aspects of streaming problems. In Section 4, we provide the bridge between both types of problems, as well as our main results. We conclude in Section 5.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Claims problems \n\nClaims problems refer to an amount of a homogeneous and infinitely divisible good (e.g., money) to be divided among a set of agents, who have claims on the good that cannot be fully honored. See, for instance, Thomson (2019) for an excellent recent survey on the topic. A well-known example is bankruptcy. But many others can also fit this framework. Formally, a claims problem is a triple $(N, c, E)$ where $N$ is the set of agents, $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ is the claims vector and $E \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$is the amount to be divided. It is assumed that $\\sum_{i \\in N} c_{i} \\geq E$.

The final amount received by each agent is the sum over all issues. Formally, let $\\psi$ and $\\left\\{\\phi^{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in K}$ be some claims rules. The two-stage rule $R^{\\psi, \\phi}$ is the rule obtained from the following two-stage procedure:\n\n1. First stage.

Let $\\mathbb{N}$ represent the set of all potential artists and $\\mathbb{M}$ the set of all potential users (of music streaming platforms). We can assume, without loss of generality, that both $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{M}$ are sufficiently large. In particular, we assume that $|\\mathbb{M}| \\geq 3$. Each specific platform involves a specific (finite) set of artists $N \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ and a specific (finite) set of users $M \\subset \\mathbb{M}$, with cardinalities $n$ and $m$, respectively. For ease of notation, we typically assume that $N=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $M=\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$. For each pair $i \\in N, j \\in M$, let $t_{i j}$ denote the times user $j$ played (via\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ See also M\u00e1rmol and Hinojosa (2020).\n\nstreaming) contents uploaded by artist $i$ in a platform (briefly, streams), during a certain period of time (e.g., month). In most of the platforms, playing a streaming unit will be equivalent to playing a song (for at least 30 seconds). Let $t=\\left(t_{i j}\\right)_{i \\in N, j \\in M}$ denote the corresponding matrix encompassing all streams. We assume that for each $j \\in M, \\sum_{i \\in N} t_{i j}>0$ (namely, each user has streamed some content).\n\nA streaming problem is a triple $P=(N, M, t)$. Following Berganti\u00f1os and MorenoTernero (2025), we normalize the amount paid by each user to 1 . Thus, the amount to be divided among artists in a problem $(N, M, t)$ is just $m$, the number of users. The set of problems so defined is denoted by $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nFor each $j \\in M$, we denote by $t^{-j}$ the matrix obtained from $t$ by removing the column corresponding to user $j$. For each artist $i \\in N, T_{i}(N, M, t)=\\sum_{j \\in M} t_{i j}$, denotes the total times $i$ was streamed. Likewise, for each user $j \\in M, T^{j}(N, M, t)=\\sum_{i \\in N} t_{i j}$, denotes the total times $j$ streamed content. Notice that, by assumption, $T^{j}(N, M, t)>0$.\n\nWe define the set of fans of each artist as the set of users who have streamed content from the artist at least once. Formally, for each $i \\in N, F_{i}(N, M, t)=\\left\\{j \\in M: t_{i j}>0\\right\\}$. Similarly, we define the list of artists of a user as those from which the user has streamed content at least once. Formally, for each $j \\in M, L^{j}(N, M, t)=\\left\\{i \\in N: t_{i j}>0\\right\\}$. The profile of user $j$ is defined as the streaming vector associated to such a user. Namely, $t_{. j}(N, M, t)=\\left(t_{i j}\\right)_{i \\in N}$. When no confusion arises we write $T_{i}$ instead of $T_{i}(N, M, t), T^{j}$ instead of $T^{j}(N, M, t), F_{i}$ instead of $F_{i}(N, M, t), L^{j}$ instead of $L^{j}(N, M, t)$, and $t_{. j}$ instead of $t_{. j}(N, M, t)$.\n\nA popularity index for streaming problems is a mapping that measures the importance of each artist in each problem. Formally, for each problem $(N, M, t) \\in \\mathcal{P}, I(N, M, t) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ and, for each pair $i, j \\in N, I_{i}(N, M, t) \\geq I_{j}(N, M, t)$ if and only if $i$ is at least as important as $j$ at problem $(N, M, t)$. We assume that $\\sum_{i \\in N} I_{i}(N, M, t)>0$.\n\nThe reward received by each artist $i \\in N$ from the revenues generated in each problem ( $m$ because the amount paid by each user has been normalized to 1 ) is based on the importance of that artist in that problem. Formally,\n\n$$\nR_{i}^{I}(N, M, t)=\\frac{I_{i}(N, M, t)}{\\sum_{k \\in N} I_{k}(N, M, t)} m\n$$\n\nNote that any positive linear transformation of a given index generates the same allocation of rewards. Formally, for each $\\lambda>0$ and each index $I, R^{\\lambda I} \\equiv R^{I}$. Thus, unless stated otherwise,\n\nwe shall slightly abuse language to identify an index with all its positive linear transformations.\nThe index used by most platforms is the so-called pro-rata index, which simply measures importance by the total number of streams. Formally, for each problem $(N, M, t) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and each artist $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nP_{i}(N, M, t)=T_{i}=\\sum_{j \\in M} t_{i j}\n$$\n\nThus, the amount received by each artist $i \\in N$ under $P$ is\n\n$$\nR_{i}^{P}(N, M, t)=\\frac{T_{i}}{\\sum_{k \\in N} T_{k}} m\n$$\n\nAnother index used in some platforms is the so-called user-centric index. The amount paid by each user is divided among the artists streamed by the user, proportionally to the total number of streams. Then, the index assigns each artist the sum of the amounts obtained across users. Formally, for each problem $(N, M, t)$ and each artist $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nU_{i}(N, M, t)=\\sum_{j \\in M} \\frac{t_{i j}}{T^{j}}\n$$\n\nIt is easy to see that $R^{U}(N, M, t)=U(N, M, t)$.\nThe above two indices have been largely studied, for instance, in Alaei et al., (2022), Meyn et al. (2023), Gon\u00e7alves-Dosantos et al., $(2024,2025)$ and Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero (2025).\n\nWe also consider the Shapley index, studied in Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero (2024) and Gon\u00e7alves-Dosantos et al., (2024). ${ }^{4}$ Formally, for each $(N, M, t) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and each $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nS h_{i}(N, M, t)=\\sum_{j \\in M} \\sum_{i \\in L^{j}} \\frac{1}{\\left|L^{j}\\right|}\n$$\n\nThus, under the Shapley index the subscription of each user $j$ is equally allocated among the artists $j$ streamed. As in the case of user-centric, the amount received by each artist from this index is precisely just what the index indicates. Namely,\n\n$$\nR^{S h}(N, M, t)=S h(N, M, t)\n$$\n\nWe compare the three indices in the following example.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ The name is due to the fact that it corresponds with the Shapley value (e.g., Shapley, 1953) of an associated cooperative game.\n\nExample 1 Let $N=\\{1,2,3\\}, M=\\{1,2\\}$, and\n\n$$\nt=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n10 & 0 \\\\\n20 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 70\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then have the following:\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nA weight system is a function $\\omega: \\mathbb{M} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that for each $j \\in \\mathbb{M}$ and each $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{n}$, $\\omega(j, x)>0$. For each weight system $\\omega$, its weighted index $I^{\\omega}$ is defined so that for each $(N, M, t) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ and each $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nI_{i}^{\\omega}(N, M, t)=\\sum_{j \\in M} \\omega\\left(j, t_{. j}\\right) t_{i j}\n$$\n\nThe value the index yields for each artist is obtained as the sum, over all users, of the streams of the user-weighteded by a factor that depends on the user and the streaming profile of the user. Both pro-rata and user-centric are weighted indices. However, the Shapley index is not a weighted index (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2024; 2025).\n\nA probability system is a function $\\rho: \\mathbb{M} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that for each $j \\in \\mathbb{M}$ and each $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{n}, 0 \\leq \\rho_{i}(j, x) \\leq 1, \\rho_{i}(j, x)=0$ when $x_{i}=0$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\rho_{i}(j, x)=1$.

Both the user-centric and the Shapley indices are probabilistic. However, the pro-rata index is not (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2024; 2025).", "tables": {"table_0": "|  | $R_{i}^{P}(N, M, t)$ | $R_{i}^{U}(N, M, t)$ | $R_{i}^{S h}(N, M, t)$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 | 0.2 | 0.33 | 0.5 |\n| 2 | 0.4 | 0.66 | 0.5 |\n| 3 | 1.4 | 1 | 1 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 A bridge between claims and streaming problems \n\nWe could first associate with each streaming problem $(N, M, t) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ a claims problem in a trivial way.

The allocation rules they induce (for streaming problems) can actually be described as two-stage (claim) rules where we first decide the importance of each user and then the importance of each artist for each user. The user-centric and Shapley indices measure the importance of all users equally (applying the $C E A$ rule) whereas pro-rata measures the importance of each user proportionally to the number of streams (applying the proportional rule). To measure the importance of each artist for each user, pro-rata and user-centric do it proportionally to the artists' streams (applying the proportional rule), whereas the Shapley index states that all artists streamed by the user have the same importance (applying the $C E A$ rule).\n\nTheorem 1 considers three possible two-stage rules arising from combining the $C E A$ and $P$ rules in different ways.

We have seen that the most well-known indices to solve streaming problems, and families generalizing them, can be seen as specific rules to solve (multi-issue) claims problems. Our work thus paves the road to consider various known rules for claims problems to solve streaming problems (in new ways that have not been considered so far). Similarly, it opens the possibility to obtain new axiomatic characterizations for the pro-rata index (which can also be seen as the two-stage proportional rule), the user-centric index (which can also be seen as the CEA-proportional two-stage rule) or the Shapley index (which can also be seen as the two-stage CEA rule) in streaming problems, inspired by existing characterizations for claims rules. Finally, it also suggests to consider well-known families of rules for claims problems (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Vidal-Puga, 2004; Moreno-Ternero, 2011; van den Brink and Moreno-Ternero, 2017) to solve streaming problems.\n\nWe conclude mentioning that the game-theoretical approach is another indirect way of solving streaming problems. There is a long tradition in economics and operations research of analyzing problems involving agents' cooperation with a game-theoretical approach. Classical instances are airport problems (e.g., Littlechild and Owen, 1973), bankruptcy problems from the Talmud (e.g., Aumann and Maschler, 1985) or cost-allocation problems (e.g., Tijs and Driessen, 1986). More recent instances are the allocation of benefits of horizontal cooperation (e.g., Lozano et al., 2013), the sharing of fish aggregating devices (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os et al., 2023) or even explainable artificial intelligence (e.g., Borgonovo et al., 2024). In our case here, this (game-theoretical) approach amounts to associate each streaming problem with a cooperative TU-game (rather than with a claims problems) in which the worth of each coalition of artists is determined by the amount paid by users that are only streaming those artists. The standard option is to take a pessimistic stance in which only users that exclusively streamed artists in a given coalition will count for the worth (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2025). Alternatively, one could consider an optimistic stance, in which all users that streamed some artist in the coalition count (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2024). It turns out that the Shapley value of both (pessimistic and optimistic) games would coincide, giving rise to the Shapley index considered in this paper (e.g., Berganti\u00f1os and Moreno-Ternero, 2024). Schlicher et al. (2024) associate another cooperative game to a streaming problem and study the core.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# References \n\n[1] Acosta, R.K., Algaba, E., S\u00e1nchez-Soriano, J., 2022.
