Within cooperative game theory, the core is considered the gold standard solution concept for \"fair\" profit sharing. It distributes the total worth of a game among the agents in such a way that the profit received by a sub-coalition is at least as large as the profit which the sub-coalition can generate all by itself. Thus a core imputation is fair to each of exponentially many sub-coalitions - a stringent requirement indeed. Additionally, it ensures stability of the grand coalition, since no sub-coalition has an incentive to secede.\n\nWe observe that in the assignment game, which forms a paradigmatic setting for studying the notion of core of a transferable utility (TU) market game ${ }^{1}$, a sub-coalition consisting of one player (or a set of players from the same side of the bipartition) can make zero profit, and therefore its profit under a core imputation can be an arbitrary amount. Hence an arbitrary core imputation makes no fairness guarantee at the level of individual agents. Can this deficiency be addressed by picking a \"good\" core imputation? We will address this question.\n\nThe prominent work of Dutta and Ray [DR89] sought a middle-ground in the tension between sub-coalitions demanding profit which is commensurate with their inherent worth and the societal norm of \"equality\" as a desirable outcome. They showed that a convex game ${ }^{2}$ admits a unique core imputation which Lorenz dominates all other core imputations; they call it the egalitarian solution. From our standpoint, [DR89] has three shortcomings: it does not apply to several key natural games, including the assignment, MST and max-flow games, since they are not convex; it is not efficiently computable for any non-trivial, natural game; and the Lorenz order is a partial, and not a total, order.\n\nAt a high level, our goal is analogous to that of Dutta and Ray; however, we wish to rectify their three shortcomings; in particular, we wish to address the assignment game, which occupies a special place in cooperative game theory. To arrive at an appropriate solution concept, we give the following criteria for picking a special core imputation:\n\n1. It should attempt to equalize the profit shares of individual agents, subject to constraints imposed by the core. In particular, for the assignment game, it should be equitable to both sides of the bipartition, unlike currently known methods; see Section 3.1.\n2. It should be computable in polynomial time via a combinatorial algorithm ${ }^{3}$. As is wellknown, such algorithms provide non-trivial insights into the structure of the problem and the solution.\nIcing on the cake: It should be computable in strongly polynomial time.\nIn Section 5 we use these criteria to undertake a detailed comparison of four solution concepts: leximin and leximax core imputations, the nucleolus, and the core imputation that maximizes Nash social welfare, see Section 5.1 for formal definitions. Leximin and leximax core imputations emerge as clear winners and we define these to be equitable core imputations. We give strongly\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ In large part due to the classic work of Shapley and Shubik [SS71].\n    ${ }^{2}$ The characteristic function of such a game is supermodular, see Definition 3.\n    ${ }^{3}$ i.e., the algorithm does not invoke an LP-solver.\n\npolynomial algorithms for computing these imputations via a novel adaptation of the classical primal-dual paradigm, see Section 1.1. It will not be surprising if our work leads to new uses of this powerful technique.\n\nA useful perspective is provided by the stable matching game of Gale and Shapley [GS62], which is a non-transferable utility (NTU) game. The core of this game is the set of all stable matchings - each ensures that no coalition formed by one agent from each side of the bipartition has an incentive to secede. It is well known that this set forms a finite distributive lattice and hence the Birkhoff Representation Theorem applies [Bir37]. The top and bottom elements of this lattice maximally favor one side and disfavor the other side of the bipartition. Furthermore, the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm of Gale and Shapley [GS62] can find only these two extreme matchings. Since several applications of this game call for stable matchings which are more equitable to both sides, the question of finding such matchings efficiently has garnered much attention, leading to efficient algorithms as well as intractability results, see [ILG87, TS98, Che10, CMS11, EIV23]. These efficient algorithms crucially use Birkhoff's Representation Theorem for finite distributive lattices [Bir37] and the notion of rotations [IL86].\n\nInterestingly enough, the assignment game shares some features with the stable matching game, even though the former is TU and the latter is NTU. Shapley and Shubik [SS71] characterized the core of the assignment game: they showed that the set of its core imputations is precisely the set of optimal solutions to the dual of the LP-relaxation of the maximum weight matching problem in the underlying bipartite graph, where the weight of this matching is the worth of the game, see Section 3.1. Observe that the worth of the assignment game is given by an optimal solution to the primal LP and its core imputations are given by optimal solutions to the dual LP. The fundamental fact connecting these two solutions is complementary slackness conditions; its implications are explored in Section 4. The design of our primal and dual update steps critically uses these insights.\n\nBy [SS71], the entire polytope of optimal dual solutions forms the core of this game. If the latter is not a singleton, it is a dense set consisting of uncountably many elements. Furthermore, this set supports the operations of meet and join, i.e., it forms a (non-finite) lattice. The top and bottom elements of this lattice form two extreme imputations, each maximally favoring one side and disfavoring the other side of the bipartition. So far efficient algorithms were known for computing only these two extreme imputations ${ }^{4}$, which in a sense are the least fair among core imputations, see Section 3.1.\n\nWe note that although the lattice of core imputations of the assignment game is distributive, it is not finite and therefore Birkhoff's Representation Theorem does not apply to it. Hence a fresh approach was required for answering our question of picking a \"more fair\" core imputation. As stated above, our quest for an answer led to defining leximin and leximax core imputations as equitable core imputations. We expect more work on computing such imputations for other natural games, in addition to the current follow-up work [GGSV24]. We also expect a deeper exploration of properties of these imputations.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Their convex combination is also a core imputation; however, it is not clear what fairness properties it possesses.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 1.1 How was the Primal-Dual Framework Adapted to our Problem? \n\nThe primal-dual method has three distinguishing features:\n\n1. It provides a malleable, high level framework whose details can be custom-designed to the specific problem at hand.\n2. It is able to find a globally acceptable (optimal or near-optimal) solution by making only local improvements.\n3. It yields efficient, combinatorial algorithms.\n\nThis method had major successes, first in combinatorial optimization [LP86, Sch86] and then in approximation algorithms [Vaz01]. These settings involved finding an integral optimal (or nearoptimal) solution to the primal LP, in tandem with an optimal (or near-optimal) solution to the dual LP. Complementary slackness conditions - or an appropriate relaxation of these conditions - helped transform the global task into a sequence of local tasks. Following these successes, researchers successfully adapted it to solve certain non-linear convex programs as well [DPSV08, JV08, Vaz12, DGM16]. Indeed, today it is appropriate to call this method the primal-dual paradigm.\n\nA common thread in all these works is that the algorithm starts off with an easily-computed, suboptimal dual solution which is modified iteratively. An iteration ends when modifications are blocked; at this point a suitable integral change is made to the current primal solution to enable further modifications. When all (relaxed) complementary slackness conditions are satisfied, the algorithm terminates.\n\nDespite its malleability, there seemed little reason to pick this method for our problem. By Lemma 3, the leximin core imputation is unique. The closest comparison will be with the maximum weight matching problem in a bipartite graph - both problems seek an optimal, rather than near-optimal, solution. As is well known, a maximum weight matching appears at a vertex of the bipartite matching polytope, i.e., the polytope defined by the constraints of the primal LP (1). Therefore, the solution lies at one of finitely - though possibly exponentially - many points and a lot is known about their combinatorial properties to help design the algorithm. In contrast, at present we do not know where in the polytope of optimal dual solutions does the leximin (and leximax) core imputation lie, see Section 9.\n\nComputing optimal solutions to our primal and dual LPs, namely a maximum weight matching and a core imputation, is straightforward. Indeed, this is the first step in our current algorithm. Then starts the main problem, of transforming the arbitrary core imputation into a leximin or leximax imputation. However, the starting primal and dual solutions already satisfy all complementary slackness conditions, so how will the global problem be broken into local steps?\n\nOur answer emerged after reducing the primal-dual method to its bare bone essentials: The method involves two processes which alternately make local improvements to two entities. Additionally, a suitable mechanism is devised which nudges these local improvements towards a global solution.\n\nOur primal-dual algorithm for leximin core imputation works as follows: The dual update steps leximin-improve the current dual solution by altering the profits of certain vertices; however, the optimality of the dual is never tampered with. This process gets blocked when an unmatched\n\nedge is just about to go under-tight, which would lead to an infeasible dual. At this point, the primal-update step takes necessary actions so dual improvement can resume. Importantly, the set of matched edges is kept unchanged throughout. Hence, complementary slackness conditions, which held at the start of the algorithm, in fact hold throughout. Clearly, a different mechanism needs to be devised that transforms local improvements into a global solution.\n\nThe answer to this question is another novel feature of our approach: in our case, the mechanism is a clock that helps synchronize all events. Indeed, the progress made by the algorithm is a direct function of time as follows: Let the given instance be $G=(U, V, E)$ with weight function $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$. For each time $t$, we can identify a vertex set $W_{t} \\subseteq(U \\cup V)$ such that in the induced subgraph $H_{t}$ of $G$, the profit shares form the unique leximin core imputation for $H_{t}$. The proof of this fact crucially depends on the correct resolution of some subtle algorithmic choices, see Sections 7.1 and 7.3.1. The set $W_{t}$ grows with time and we prove that in polynomial time $W_{t}=(U \\cup V)$, hence terminating in the required imputation.\n\nWe note that some previous primal-dual algorithms had also used the notion of time but it in a different and much less prominent manner. In [JV01] duals grow with time and this aspect is used for enforcing relaxed complementary slackness constraints; however, it is the latter which transform the global problem to a local one. [JV08] also grow duals with time. Again, it is not used for transforming the global problem to a local one, but for ensuring that the cost sharing method derived satisfies the property of cross-monotonicity.\n\nThe broad outline given above is far from sufficient for designing the entire algorithm. The latter requires a precise understanding of the way core imputations allocate the total profit to agents and teams; in particular, we need to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Do core imputations spread the profit more-or-less evenly or do they restrict profit to certain well-chosen agents? If the latter, what characterizes these \"chosen\" agents?\n2. An edge $(i, j)$ in the underlying graph is called a team. By definition, under any core imputation, the sum of profits of $i$ and $j$ is at least the weight of this edge. For which teams is the sum strictly larger?\n3. How do core imputations behave in the presence of degeneracy? An assignment game is said to be non-degenerate if it admits a unique maximum weight matching.\n\nOur answers, using complementary slackness conditions and strict complementarity, are provided in Section 4.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Related Works \n\nThe importance of \"fair\" profit-sharing has been recognized for the proper functioning of all aspects of society - from personal relationships to business collaborations. Moreover, this has been a consideration since ancient times, e.g., see the delightful and thought-provoking paper by Aumann and Maschler [AM85], which discusses problems from the 2000-year-old Babylonian Talmud on how to divide the estate of a dead man among his creditors.\n\nBelow we state results giving LP-based core imputations for natural games; these are also candidates for the study of leximin and leximax core imputations. Deng et al. [DIN99] gave LP-based\n\ncharacterization of the cores of several combinatorial optimization games, including maximum flow in unit capacity networks both directed and undirected, maximum number of edge-disjoint $s-t$ paths, maximum number of vertex-disjoint $s-t$ paths, maximum number of disjoint arborescences rooted at a vertex $r$, and general graph matching game in which the weight of optimal fractional and integral matchings are equal (such a game has a non-empty core).\n\nIn a different direction, Vande Vate [Vat89] and Rothblum [Rot92] gave linear programming formulations for stable matchings; the vertices of their underlying polytopes are integral and are stable matchings. More recently, Kiraly and Pap [KP08] showed that the linear system of Rothblum is in fact totally dual integral (TDI). Recently, [Vaz24] gave the first game for which total unimodularity does not hold and total dual integrality is needed for characterizing its core. Interestingly, this game, called the investment management game, is a game against nature rather than a cooperative game.\n\nWe next describe results for the facility location game. First, Kolen [Kol83] showed that for the unconstrained facility location problem, each optimal solution to the dual of the classical LP-relaxation is a core imputation if and only if this relaxation has no integrality gap. Later, Goemans and Skutella [GS04] showed a similar result for any kind of constrained facility location game. They also proved that in general, for facility locations games, deciding whether the core is non-empty and whether a given allocation is in the core is NP-complete.\n\nSamet and Zemel [SZ84] study games which are generated by linear programming optimization problems; these are called LP-games. For such games, It is well known that the set of optimal dual solutions is contained in the core and [SZ84] gives sufficient conditions under which equality holds. These games do not ask for integral solutions and are therefore different in character from the ones studied in this paper.\n\nGranot and Huberman [GH81, GH84] showed that the core of the minimum cost spanning tree game is non-empty and gave an algorithm for finding an imputation in it. Koh and Sanita [KS20] answer the question of efficiently determining if a spanning tree game is submodular; the core of such games is always non-empty. Nagamochi et al. [NZKI97] characterize non-emptyness of core for the minimum base game in a matroid; the minimum spanning tree game is a special case of this game. [SLJ01] gives a characterization of the Owen core [Owe75], i.e., the optimal dual solutions, of the transportation game, which is the same as the $b$-matching game\n\nTo deal with games having an empty core, the following two notions have been given. The first is that of least core, defined by Mascher et al. [MPS79]. If the core is empty, there will necessarily be sets $S \\subseteq V$ such that $v(S)<p(S)$ for any imputation $v$. The least core maximizes the minimum of $p(S)-v(S)$ over all sets $S \\subseteq V$, subject to $v(\\varnothing)=0$ and $v(V)=p(V)$.\nA more well known notion is that of nucleolus [Sch69] which is contained in the least core. After maximizing the minimum of $p(S)-v(S)$ over all sets $S \\subseteq V$, it does the same for all remaining sets and so on. A formal definition is given below. For any imputation, $p$, define $p(S)-c(S)$ to be the surplus of sub-coalition $\\varnothing \\subset S \\subset V$. The idea behind the nucleolus is to spread the surplus as evenly as possible across all sub-coalitions by picking the leximin imputation over the surplus of sub-coalitions. The nucleolus always exists for any cooperative game, even if its core is empty and is unique. Furthermore, if the core of the game is non-empty, then the nucleolus lies in the core.\n\nDefinition 1. Let $(N, c)$ be a cooperative game with non-empty core. For an imputation $p: V \\rightarrow$ $\\mathcal{R}_{+}$, let $\\theta(v)$ be the vector obtained by sorting the $2^{|V|}-2$ values $p(S)-c(S)$ for each $\\varnothing \\subset S \\subset V$ in non-decreasing order. Then the unique imputation, $p$, that lexicographically maximizes $\\theta(p)$ is called the nucleolus.\n\nSolymosi and Raghavan [SR94] gave a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the nucleolus of the assignment game. Unlike the assignment game, the core of the general graph matching game can be empty, leading to interest in computing its nucleolus and [FKFH98] stated the problem of doing so in polynomial time. Konemann et al. [KPT20] found such an algorithm; however, their algorithm makes extensive use of the ellipsoid algorithm and is therefore neither efficient nor does it give deep insights into the underlying combinatorial structure. They leave the open problem of finding a combinatorial polynomial time algorithm. Another deficiency of the nucleolus is that the difference $p(S)-v(S)$ appearing in its definition has not been upper-bounded for any standard family of games, including the general graph matching game. Furthermore, its first term, i.e., the least core, does not take into consideration the size of the sub-coalition, e.g., the least core may be attained by a sub-coalition of size 2 or of size $n / 2$ and these situations are qualitatively different.\n\nA different notion was recently proposed in [Vaz22a], namely approximate core, and was used to obtain an imputation in the $2 / 3$-approximate core for the general graph matching game. The profit allocated by this imputation to each sub-coalition is at least $2 / 3$ fraction of the profit it can generate by itself; moreover, this bound is tight as shown by a triangle with unit weight edges. Such an imputation can be computed in polynomial time, again using the power of LP-duality theory. This result was extended to $b$-matching games in general graphs by Xiaoet al.

For an extensive coverage of cooperative game theory, see the book by Moulin [Mou14]. The assignment game is widely applicable, e.g., [SS71] presented it in the context of the housing market game in which the two sides of the bipartition are buyers and sellers of houses.\n\nDefinition 2.

An imputation $p$ is said to be in the core of the game $(N, c)$ if for any sub-coalition $S \\subseteq N$, the total profit allocated to agents in $S$ is at least as large as the worth that they can generate by themselves, i.e., $p(S) \\geq c(S)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 3.1 The Results of Shapley and Shubik for the Assignment Game \n\nThe assignment game consists of a bipartite graph $G=(U, V, E)$ and a weight function for the edges $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$, where we assume that each edge has positive weight; otherwise the edge can be removed from $G$. The agents of the game are the vertices, $U \\cup V$ and the total worth of the game is the weight of a maximum weight matching in $G$; the latter needs to be distributed among the vertices.\n\nFor this game, a sub-coalition $\\left(U^{\\prime} \\cup V^{\\prime}\\right)$ consists of a subset of the agents, also called vertices, with $U^{\\prime} \\subseteq U$ and $V^{\\prime} \\subseteq V$. The worth of a sub-coalition $\\left(U^{\\prime} \\cup V^{\\prime}\\right)$ is defined to be the weight of a maximum weight matching in the graph $G$ restricted to vertices in $\\left(U^{\\prime} \\cup V^{\\prime}\\right)$ and is denoted by $c\\left(U^{\\prime} \\cup V^{\\prime}\\right)$. The characteristic function of the game is defined to be $c: 2^{U \\cup V} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$.\nAn imputation consists of two functions $u: U \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$and $v: V \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$such that $\\sum_{i \\in U} u_{i}+$ $\\sum_{j \\in V} v_{j}=c(U \\cup V)$.

In this program, variable $x_{i j}$ indicates the extent to which edge $(i, j)$ is picked in the solution.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max \\sum_{(i, j) \\in E} w_{i j} x_{i j} \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\sum_{(i, j) \\in E} x_{i j} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in U, \\\\\n& \\sum_{(i, j) \\in E} x_{i j} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall j \\in V, \\\\\n& x_{i j} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall(i, j) \\in E\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTaking $u_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ to be the dual variables for the first and second constraints of (1), we obtain the dual LP:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\min & \\sum_{i \\in U} u_{i}+\\sum_{j \\in V} v_{j} \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & u_{i}+v_{j} \\geq w_{i j} \\quad \\forall(i, j) \\in E, \\\\\n& u_{i} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in U, \\\\\n& v_{j} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall j \\in V\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe constraint matrix of LP (1) is totally unimodular, i.e., its every square sub-matrix has determinant of $0,+1$ or -1 . This fact leads to the next theorem, see [LP86].\n\nTheorem 1. The polytope defined by the constraints of LP (1) is integral; its vertices are matchings in the underlying graph.\n\nThe proof of the next theorem hinges on the key fact stated in Theorem 1.\n\nTheorem 2. (Shapley and Shubik [SS71]) The dual LP, (2) completely characterizes the core of the assignment game.\n\nBy this theorem, the core is a convex polyhedron. Shapley and Shubik further showed that the set $S$ of core imputations of the assignment game forms a lattice under the following partial order on $S$ : Given two core imputations $(u, v)$ and $\\left(u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}\\right)$, say that $(u, v) \\leq\\left(u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}\\right)$ if for each $i \\in U$, $u_{i} \\geq u_{i}^{\\prime}$; if so, it must be that for each $j \\in V, v_{j} \\leq v_{j}^{\\prime}$. This partial order supports meet and join operations: given two core imputations $(u, v)$ and $\\left(u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}\\right)$, for each $i \\in U$, the meet chooses the bigger of $u_{i}$ and $u_{i}^{\\prime}$ and the join chooses the smaller. It is easy to see that the lattice is distributive. Define $u^{h}$ and $u^{l}$ as follows: For $i \\in U$, let $u_{i}^{h}$ and $u_{i}^{l}$ denote the highest and lowest profits that $i$ accrues among all imputations in the core. Similarly, define $v^{h}$ and $v^{l}$.\n\nTheorem 3. (Shapley and Shubik [SS71]) Under the partial order defined above, the core of the assignment game forms a distributive lattice; its two extreme imputations are $\\left(u^{h}, v^{l}\\right)$ and $\\left(u^{l}, v^{h}\\right)$.\n\nThe two extreme imputations can be efficiently obtained as follows. First find a maximum weight matching in $G$; a fractional one found by solving LP (1) will suffice. Let its picked edges be $M \\subseteq E$.

Furthermore, $q$ is paid sometimes if there is at least one imputation in the core under which $q$ gets paid, and it is never paid if it is not paid under every imputation.\n\nTheorem 4. For every agent $q \\in(U \\cup V)$ :\n\n$$\nq \\text { is paid sometimes } \\Longleftrightarrow q \\text { is essential }\n$$\n\nProof. The proof follows by applying complementary slackness conditions and strict complementarity to the primal LP (1) and dual LP (2); see [Sch86] for formal statements of these facts. By Theorem 2, talking about imputations in the core of the assignment game is equivalent to talking about optimal solutions to the dual LP.\n\nLet $x$ and $y$ be optimal solutions to LP (1) and LP (2), respectively. By the Complementary Slackness Theorem, for each $q \\in(U \\cup V): y_{q} \\cdot(x(\\delta(q))-1)=0$.\n$(\\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $q$ is paid sometimes. Then, there is an optimal solution to the dual LP, say $y$, such that $y_{q}>0$. By the Complementary Slackness Theorem, for any optimal solution, $x$, to LP (1), $x(\\delta(q))=1$, i.e., $q$ is matched in $x$. Varying $x$ over all optimal primal solutions, we get that $q$ is always matched. In particular, $q$ is matched in all optimal assignments, i.e., integral optimal primal solutions, and is therefore essential. This proves the forward direction.\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Strict complementarity implies that corresponding to each agent $q$, there is a pair of optimal primal and dual solutions, say $x$ and $y$, such that either $y_{q}=0$ or $x(\\delta(q))=1$ but not both. Assume that $q$ is essential, i.e., it is matched in every integral optimal primal solution.\n\nWe will use Theorem 1, which implies that every fractional optimal primal solution to LP (1) is a convex combination of integral optimal primal solutions. Therefore $q$ is fully matched in every optimal solution, $x$, to LP (1), i.e., $x(\\delta(q))=1$, so there must be an optimal dual solution $y$ such that $y_{q}>0$. Hence $q$ is paid sometimes, proving the reverse direction.\n\nTheorem 4 is equivalent to the following. For every agent $q \\in(U \\cup V)$ :\n\n$$\nq \\text { is never paid } \\Longleftrightarrow q \\text { is not essential }\n$$\n\nThus core imputations pay only essential agents and each of them is paid in some core imputation. Since we have assumed that the weight of each edge is positive, so is the worth of the game, and all of it goes to essential agents. Hence we get:\n\nCorollary 1. In the assignment game, the set of essential agents is non-empty and in every core imputation, the entire worth of the game is distributed among essential agents; moreover, each of them is paid in some core imputation.\n\nBy Corollary 1, the leximin and leximax core imputations are only concerned with the profits of essential agents; the profits of the rest of the agents are zero.\n\nCorollary 1 raises the following question: Can't a non-essential agent, say $q$, team up with another agent, say $p$, and secede, by promising $p$ almost all of the resulting profit? The answer is \"No\", because the dual (2) has the constraint $y_{q}+y_{p} \\geq w_{q p}$. Therefore, if $y_{q}=0, y_{p} \\geq w_{q p}$, i.e., $p$ will not gain by seceding together with $q$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 4.2 The second question: Allocations made to teams by core imputations \n\nDefinition 8. By a team we mean an edge in $G$; a generic one will be denoted as $e=(u, v)$. We will say that $e$ is:\n\n1. essential if $e$ is matched in every maximum weight matching in $G$.\n2. viable if there is a maximum weight matching $M$ such that $e \\in M$, and another, $M^{\\prime}$ such that $e \\notin M^{\\prime}$.\n3. subpar if for every maximum weight matching $M$ in $G, e \\notin M$.\n\nDefinition 9. Let $y$ be an imputation in the core of the game. We will say that $e$ is fairly paid in $y$ if $y_{u}+y_{v}=w_{e}$ and it is overpaid if $y_{u}+y_{v}>w_{e}{ }^{7}$. Finally, we will say that $e$ is always paid fairly if it is fairly paid in every imputation in the core.\n\nTheorem 5. For every team $e \\in E$ :\n\n$$\n\\text { e is always paid fairly } \\Longleftrightarrow \\text { e is viable or essential }\n$$\n\nProof. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 4. Let $x$ and $y$ be optimal solutions to LP (1) and LP (2), respectively. By the Complementary Slackness Theorem, for each $e=(u, v) \\in E$ : $x_{e} \\cdot\\left(y_{u}+y_{v}-w_{e}\\right)=0$.\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ To prove the reverse direction, suppose $e$ is viable or essential. Then there is an optimal solution to the primal, say $x$, under which it is matched. Therefore, $x_{e}>0$. Let $y$ be an arbitrary optimal dual solution. Then, by the Complementary Slackness Theorem, $y_{u}+y_{v}=w_{e}$, i.e., $e$ is fairly paid in $y$. Varying $y$ over all optimal dual solutions, we get that $e$ is always paid fairly.\n$(\\Rightarrow)$ To prove the forward direction, we will use strict complementarity. It implies that corresponding to each team $e$, there is a pair of optimal primal and dual solutions $x$ and $y$ such that either $x_{e}=0$ or $y_{u}+y_{v}=w_{e}$ but not both.\n\nAssume that team $e$ is always fairly paid, i.e., under every optimal dual solution $y, y_{u}+y_{v}=w_{e}$. By strict complementarity, there must be an optimal primal solution $x$ for which $x_{e}>0$. Theorem\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Observe that by the first constraint of the dual LP (2), these are the only possibilities.\n\n1 implies that $x$ is a convex combination of optimal assignments. Therefore, there must be an optimal assignment in which $e$ is matched. Therefore $e$ is viable or essential and the forward direction also holds.\n\nCorollary 2. Let $e=(u, v)$ be a subpar team. Then at least one of $u$ and $v$ is essential.\nProof. In every maximum weight matching, at least one of $u$ and $v$ must be matched, since otherwise $e$ should get matched. By Theorem 5, there is a core imputation under which $e$ is overpaid. Therefore, under this imputation, at least one of $u$ and $v$ is paid and by Theorem 4, that vertex must be essential.\n\nNegating both sides of the implication proved in Theorem 5, we get the following implication. For every team $e \\in E$ :\n\n$$\ne \\text { is subpar } \\Longleftrightarrow e \\text { is sometimes overpaid }\n$$\n\nClearly, this statement is equivalent to the statement proved in Theorem 5 and hence contains no new information. However, it provides a new viewpoint. These two equivalent statements yield the following assertion, which at first sight seems incongruous with what we desire from the notion of the core and the just manner in which it allocates profits:\n\nWhereas viable and essential teams are always paid fairly, subpar teams are sometimes overpaid.\nHow can the core favor subpar teams over viable and essential teams? An explanation is provided in the Introduction, namely a subpar team $(i, j)$ gets overpaid because $i$ and $j$ create worth by playing in competent teams with other agents. Finally, we observe that contrary to Corollary 1, which says that the set of essential agents is non-empty, it is easy to construct examples in which the set of essential teams may be empty.\n\nBy Theorem 4, different essential agents are paid in different core imputations and by Theorem 5 , different subpar teams are overpaid in different core imputations. This raises the following question: is there a core imputation that simultaneously satisfies all these conditions? Lemma 1 gives a positive answer.\n\nLemma 1. For the assignment game, there is a core imputation satisfying:\n\n1. a agent $q \\in U \\cup V$ gets paid if and only if $q$ is essential.\n2. a team $e \\in E$ gets overpaid if and only if $e$ is subpar.\n\nProof. By Theorem 4, for each essential agent $q$, there is a core imputation under which $q$ gets paid and by Theorem 5, for each subpar team $e$, there is a core imputation under which $e$ gets overpaid. Consider a convex combination of all these imputations; it must give positive weight to each of these imputations. Clearly, this is a core imputation.\n\nWe observe that none of the core imputations pay non-essential agents or overpay non-subpar teams. Consequently, the imputation constructed above satisfies the conditions of the theorem.\n\nThe first part of Lemma 1 provides useful information about the leximin core imputation, see Corollary 3; its second part is given for completeness. Let $I$ denote the assignment game $G=$ $(U, V, E)$ with weight function $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$for edges. Let $C(I)$ denote its set of core imputations of $I$ and let $V^{\\prime} \\subseteq V$ be its set of essential players.\n\nDefinition 10. Imputation $p \\in C(I)$ is said to be a max-min fair core imputation if it satisfies:\n\n$$\np \\in \\arg \\max _{q \\in C(I)}\\left\\{\\min _{v \\in V^{\\prime}}\\{q(v)\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nCorollary 3. In the leximin core imputation, the profits of all essential agents are positive.\nProof. By the first part of Lemma 1, the profit of the minimum profit essential agent in a maxmin fair core imputation is positive. Since this is also the smallest component of the leximin core imputation, the corollary follows.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 4.3 The third question: Degeneracy \n\nThe answer to the third question is useful for pedagogical purposes, in case the reader wishes to understand the algorithm for the case of a non-degenerate game. In this case, the underlying structure is simpler: there are no viable teams or agents. This follows from Theorems 4 and 5. How do viable teams and agents behave with respect to core imputations if the given game is degenerate? The answer is provided below.\n\nCorollary 4. In the presence of degeneracy, imputations in the core of an assignment game treat:\n\n- viable agents in the same way as subpar agents, namely they are never paid.\n- viable teams in the same way as essential teams, namely they are always fairly paid.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "## 5 A Comparison of Four Solution Concepts\n\nWe will undertake a detailed comparison of the four solution concepts defined in Section 5.1 for picking a \"more fair\" core imputation for the assignment game; Section 5.2 compares them.

Among these, the use of max-min ${ }^{8}$ and min-max fairness is widespread, e.g., in game theory, networking and resource allocation. A leximin allocation maximizes the smallest component and subject to that, it maximizes the second smallest, and so on. It therefore goes much further than a max-min allocation. Similarly a leximax allocation goes much further than a min-max allocation.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ See Definition 10.\n\nLet $U_{e} \\subseteq U$ and $V_{e} \\subseteq V$ be the sets of essential players of the assignment game, $G=(U, V, E), w$ : $E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$. As stated in Theorem 4, every core imputation allocates the entire profit to players in $U_{e} \\cup V_{e}$ only.\n\nDefinition 11. For each core imputation of the assignment game $G=(U, V, E), w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$, sort the allocations made to players $U_{e} \\cup V_{e}$ in increasing order, and let $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ be two such sorted lists. Say that $L_{1}$ is lexicographically larger than $L_{2}$ if the first index at which the two lists differ, $L_{1}$ has a larger entry than $L_{2}$; note that these two entries may be profits of different players. An imputation yielding the lexicographically largest list will be called a leximin core imputation. Next, sort the allocations made to players $U_{e} \\cup V_{e}$ in decreasing order, and say that list $L_{1}$ is lexicographically larger than $L_{2}$ if the first index at which the two lists differ, $L_{1}$ has a smaller entry than $L_{2}$. An imputation yielding the lexicographically largest list will be called a leximax core imputation.\n\nMoulin [Mou91] showed that the set of leximin core imputations for a convex game is a singleton, i.e., these games have a unique leximin imputation. In Lemma 3 we show this fact for any cooperative game. The proof for leximax core imputations is analogous. We first need an elementary fact. Let $L$ be a list of numbers, $a_{1} \\leq a_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_{k}$ such that at least two of them are distinct. Consider a cycle formed by edges $\\left(a_{i}, a_{i+1}\\right)$, for $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ and $\\left(a_{k}, a_{1}\\right)$. For each of these $k$ edges, compute the average of its endpoints and let $L^{\\prime}$ denote this list of numbers.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: The graph for Example 1\n\nLemma 2. $L^{\\prime}$ is lexicographically larger than $L$.\nProof. Let $l$ be the smallest index such that $a_{l}<a_{l+1}$. Clearly, the average on the first $l-1$ edges will be $a_{1}$ and on the remaining edges, it will be strictly bigger. Therefore, after sorting $L^{\\prime}$, its first $l-1$ entries will be the same as that of $L$ and its $l^{\\text {th }}$ entry will be strictly bigger. The lemma follows.\n\nLet $(N, c)$ be a cooperative game having a non-empty core, where $N$ is a set of $n$ agents and $c$ is the characteristic function. First observe that if $p_{1}: N \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$and $p_{2}: N \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$are core imputations for this game then their convex combination is also a core imputation, since the profit given to any sub-coalition $S \\subseteq N$ is at least $c(S)$. Therefore, the core of the game $(N, c)$ is a convex set.\n\nLemma 3. A game $(N, c)$ having a non-empty core admits a unique leximin imputation.\nProof. The proof follows via a contradiction. Suppose there are two leximin imputations $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. Let $p_{3}: N \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$denote the average of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. Since the core is closed under convex combinations, $p_{3}$ is also a core imputation. We will show that it is lexicographically larger than $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, hence giving a contradiction.\n\nSince $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are both leximin imputations, the multi-set of profit shares under $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ must the same, say given by sorted list $L$. Let $L^{\\prime}$ denote the sorted list of profit shares under $p_{3}$. Let $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ denote the agents of $N$ sorted by increasing profit shares according to $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, respectively. The $i^{\\text {th }}$ agent of $S_{1}$ is denoted by $S_{1}(i)$; similarly for $S_{2}$. Since the list of profit shares of the two imputations is the same, $p_{1}\\left(S_{1}(i)\\right)=p_{2}\\left(S_{2}(i)\\right)$.\nIf $S_{1}(i)=S_{2}(i)$, we will say that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ entry of $L$ is settled, since it will carry over unchanged to $L^{\\prime}$. Next assume that $S_{1}(i) \\neq S_{2}(i)$. Then $i$ will participate in a cycle, i.e., there are indices $1 \\leq l_{1}<l_{2}<\\ldots l_{k} \\leq n$ such that $i$ is one of these indices and\n\n1. for $1 \\leq j \\leq k, l_{j}$ is not settled, i.e., $S_{1}\\left(l_{j}\\right) \\neq S_{2}\\left(l_{j}\\right)$,\n2. for $1 \\leq j<k, S_{1}\\left(l_{j}\\right)=S_{2}\\left(l_{j+1}\\right)$. Furthermore $S_{1}\\left(l_{k}\\right)=S_{2}\\left(l_{1}\\right)$.\n\nClearly, the $k$ entries $l_{1}<l_{2}<\\ldots l_{k}$ in list $L^{\\prime}$ will be given by averaging operation of Lemma 2 and therefore they will be lexicographically larger than the corresponding $k$ entries in $L$. Furthermore, this is true for each cycle formed by $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. The settled entries of $L$ carry over to $L^{\\prime}$. Hence $L^{\\prime}$ is lexicographically larger than $L$.\n\nCorollary 5. The assignment game has a unique leximin core imputation.\nThe nucleolus, which was defined by Schmeidler [Sch69], has received considerable attention in the economics community, see Definition 1. It always exists and is unique for any cooperative game, even if its core is empty; furthermore, if the core of the game is non-empty, then the nucleolus lies in the core. Solymosi and Raghavan [SR94] gave a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the nucleolus of the assignment game.\n\nThe solution of convex program (4) is a core imputation which maximizes the Nash social welfare for the assignment game. Notice that the objective function is based on profits of essential agents only; otherwise it will be undefined, since it will include the logarithm of zero ${ }^{9}$. The constraints ensure that the imputation is indeed in the core.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ It is easy to see that there is a core imputation under which all essential agents get positive profit.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max \\sum_{i \\in U_{e}} \\log \\left(u_{i}\\right)+\\sum_{j \\in V_{e}} \\log \\left(v_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\sum_{i \\in U_{e}}\\left(u_{i}\\right)+\\sum_{j \\in V_{e}}\\left(v_{i}\\right)=W_{\\max } \\\\\n& u_{i}+v_{j} \\geq w_{i j} \\quad \\forall(i, j) \\in E, \\\\\n& u_{i} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in U_{e}, \\\\\n& v_{j} \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall j \\in V_{e}, \\\\\n& u_{i}=0 \\quad \\forall i \\in\\left(U-U_{e}\\right), \\\\\n& v_{j}=0 \\quad \\forall j \\in\\left(V-V_{e}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExample 1. In the graph ${ }^{10}$ shown in Figure 1, the leximin and leximax core imputations for vertices $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$ are $(40,30,30,70)$ and $(55,45,15,55)$, respectively; the corresponding sorted orders are $30,30,40,70$ and $55,55,45,15$. The nucleolus assigns to $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$ profits of $(50,20$, $20,80)$ as can be checked by considering the $14=2^{4}-2$ relevant sub-coalitions.\n\nFor computing the core imputation that maximizes the Nash social welfare, assume that the profit share of vertex $v_{1}$ is $x$. Then it is easy to see that the profit shares of $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$ will be $(70-x, 60-x, x+40)$. The product of these four values will be maximized for an irrational $x$.

{"section_id": 12, "text": "# 5.2 Comparison of the Solution Concepts \n\nWe will compare the four solution concepts using the criteria given in the Introduction. Clearly, these solution concepts give no preference to either side of the bipartition, as required by the first criterion. The criterion also asks for equalizing the profit shares of agents, subject to constraints imposed by the core. Leximin and leximax core imputations clearly attempt this. The product of $k$ numbers having a fixed total is maximized by making them as equal as possible; hence the Nash social welfare is also attempting to satisfy the first criterion. We next provide some formal evidence of these facts for the graph studied in Example 1. Define the spread of imputation $p$ to be the difference between the largest and smallest profit given to essential players, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{spread}(p):=\\left(p_{\\max }-p_{\\min }\\right) \\\\\n\\text { where } p_{\\max }=\\max _{a \\in\\left(U_{e} \\cup V_{e}\\right)} p(a) \\text { and } p_{\\min }=\\min _{a \\in\\left(U_{e} \\cup V_{e}\\right)} p(a)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFor the graph of Example 1, the above-stated three solution concepts have a spread of 40, whereas the spread ${ }^{11}$ of the nucleolus is 60 . This is not surprising, since the nucleolus considers all exponentially many sub-coalitions, without giving any advantage to the singletons. Hence, the nucleolus loses out on the first criterion.\n\nA non-linear convex program is called a rational convex program ( $R C P$ ) if it admits a rational optimal solution for any setting of its parameters to rational numbers [Vaz12]; in a sense, it \"behaves\"\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ In the examples, essential and viable edges are represent by solid lines and subpar edges by dotted lines.\n    ${ }^{11}$ Clearly the notion of spread deserves further study, especially in the context of these four solution concepts.\n\nlike an LP. A convex program admits a combinatorial polynomial time algorithm only if it is an RCP, e.g., the Eisenberg-Gale program [EG59] admits the algorithm given in [DPSV08]. However, as shown in Example 1, convex program (4) for computing the core imputation that maximizes the Nash social welfare is not an RCP. As stated above, Solymosi and Raghavan [SR94] have given a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the nucleolus of the assignment game. However, for several natural games, computing the nucleolus is NP-hard, e.g., MST game [FKK98], maxflow game [DFS06], and $b$-matching game when an edge can be matched at most once [KTZ24]. Section 2 points out other features of the nucleolus in the context of the general graph matching game.\n\nFor leximin and leximax core imputations of the assignment game, we have given combinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithms. Furthermore, as shown in [GGSV24], leximin and leximax core imputations for the MST, max-flow and $b$-matching games can be computed in the Owen core [Owe75], i.e., the optimal dual solutions, even though they are NP-hard in general. Thus leximin and leximax core imputations win on our criteria. These two imputations achieve equality in different ways: whereas leximin tries to make poor agents more rich, leximax tries to make rich agents less rich, thereby indirectly making poor agents more rich, hence they may be better suited for different applications. For all these reasons, we define leximin and leximax core imputations to be equitable core imputations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 6 High Level Ideas \n\nLet $G=(U, V, E), w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$be the given instance of the assignment game. In this section, we will give the high level ideas for computing the leximin core imputation; the ideas for leximax core imputation are analogous. Our algorithm starts by computing an arbitrary core imputation, say (u.v). This can be done by a combinatorial algorithm for computing a maximum weight matching in a bipartite graph, e.g., see [LP86]. It maintains the following invariant throughout its run; by complementary slackness conditions, this ensures that it always has a core imputation, see Section 4.\n\nInvariant 1: Throughout the run of the algorithm, the dual satisfies:\n\n1. Every essential and viable edge is tight.\n2. Only essential vertices have positive duals.\n\nAt the start, our algorithm also computes the sets of essential, viable and subpar edges and vertices using the efficient procedures given in Section 6.1. The set of all essential and viable edges is the starting set of tight edges and is denoted by $T_{0}$. The subgraph of $G$ consisting of the edges of $T_{0}$ is called the starting tight subgraph and is denoted by $H_{0}=\\left(U, V, T_{0}\\right)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "### 6.1 Procedures for Classifying Vertices and Edges\n\nIn this section, we will give polynomial time procedures for partitioning vertices and edges according to the classification given in Definitions 6 and 8 . This is required by the algorithms given in Sections 7 and 8.\n\nLet $W_{\\max }$ be the worth of the given assignment game, $G=(U, V, E), w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$. For each edge\n\n$e$, find the worth of the game with $e$ removed. If it is less than $W_{\\max }$ then $e$ is essential. Now pick an edge $e^{\\prime}$ which is not essential and let its weight be $w$. Remove the two endpoints of $e^{\\prime}$ and compute the worth of the remaining game. If it is $\\left(W_{\\max }-w\\right)$ then $e^{\\prime}$ is matched in a maximum weight matching. Furthermore, since it is not essential, it is viable. The remaining edges are subpar.\n\nNext, for each vertex $v$, consider the game with player $v$ removed and find its worth. If it is less than $W_{\\max }$ then $v$ is essential. The endpoints of all viable edges are either essential or viable. Therefore, dropping the essential vertices from these yield viable vertices. Finally, a vertex which does not have an essential or viable edge incident at it is subpar.\n\nLemma 4. The classification of edges and vertices of the given graph can be accomplished in $O(m)$ calls to a weighted bipartite matching algorithm.\n\nUsing the current best weighted bipartite matching algorithm $\\left[\\mathrm{CKL}^{+} 22\\right]$, which takes $O\\left(m^{1+o(1)}\\right)$ time, the classification requires a total time of $O\\left(m^{2+o(1)}\\right)$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# 6.2 Characterizing the Connected Components of $H_{0}$ \n\nRecall that $H_{0}=\\left(U, V, T_{0}\\right)$ is the subgraph of $G$ consisting of all essential and viable edges; by Theorem 5, these edges are tight under every core imputation. We will partition the connected components of $H_{0}$ into the two sets defined below. In the rest of this section, we will characterize these two types of components, thereby making it easy for Algorithm 1 to distinguish them.\n\nDefinition 12. A connected component, $C$, of $H_{0}$, is called a unique imputation component if the profit shares of vertices of $C$ remain unchanged over all possible core imputations.\n\nDefinition 13. A connected component, $C$, of $H_{0}$ which is not a unique imputation component is called a fundamental component.\n\nFundamental components are the building blocks which our algorithm works with; the profit shares of their vertices get modified in the dual updates. This update gets blocked when a subpar edge goes exactly tight. Much of the algorithm is concerned with appropriately dealing with the latter event.\n\nDefinition 14. For any connected component $C$ of the tight subgraph $H, U(C)$ and $V(C)$ will denote the vertices of $C$ in $U$ and $V$, respectively. Furthermore, left $(C)$ will denote $U(C) \\cap U_{e}$ and $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ will denote $V(C) \\cap V_{e}$.\n\nFor understanding the algorithms in a simpler setting, the reader may assume that the given game is non-degenerate and therefore has no viable vertices and edges. If so, the unique imputation components are unmatched vertices and fundamental components are matched edges in the unique maximum weight matching. If the given game is non-degenerate, the rest of this subsection can be skipped.\n\nLet us start by classifying the smallest components. A subpar vertex gets zero profit in all core imputations and is therefore a unique imputation component. By Lemma 5, an essential edge is a fundamental component; clearly, its endpoints are essential vertices.\n\nLemma 5. Each essential edge is a fundamental component.\nProof. For the sake of contradiction, assume that essential edge $(i, j)$ has a unique imputation and let the profit shares of $i$ and $j$ be $a$ and $b$, respectively. Assume w.l.o.g. that $a \\geq b$; clearly, $a>0$. If $i$ does not have another edge incident at it in $G$, then changing the profit shares of $i$ and $j$ to $(0, a+b)$ will also lead to a core imputation.\n\nNext assume that $i$ has $k$ other edges incident at it. These $k$ edges must necessarily be subpar and by Theorem 5, each of these edges, there is a core imputation under which the edge is over-tight, to the extent of at least $\\epsilon>0$, say. Now the convex combination of these core imputations is also a core imputation in which each of these edges is over-tight to the extent of $\\epsilon / k>0$. Therefore, changing the profit shares of $i$ and $j$ to $(a-\\epsilon / k, b+\\epsilon / k)$ will lead to another core imputation. The contradiction establishes the lemma.\n\nLemma 6. Let $C$ be a component of $H_{0}$ consisting of viable edges. If $|\\operatorname{left}(C)| \\neq|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$ then not all vertices of $C$ are essential and $C$ is a unique imputation component.\n\nProof. Since $|\\operatorname{left}(C)| \\neq|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$, every maximum weight matching must leave an unmatched vertex in the bigger side. Therefore not all vertices of $C$ are essential.\n\nNext, for contradiction assume that $C$ admits more than one core imputation. Let $v \\in C$ get profit shares of $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha+\\beta$, with $\\beta>0$, in two of these imputations, say $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. To keep all viable edges of $C$ tight, the profit shares of neighbors of $v$ under $p_{2}$ must be smaller than the corresponding profit shares under $p_{1}$ by $\\beta$. Propagating these constraints alternately to left $(C)$ and $\\operatorname{right}(C)$, we get that in going from $p_{1}$ to $p_{2}$, the profit shares of vertices in left $(C)$ increase by $\\beta$ and those in $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ decrease by $\\beta$. Since $|\\operatorname{left}(C)| \\neq|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$, the total worth shared by the two imputations is different, leading to a contradiction.\n\nExample 2. The graph of Figure 2 satisfies $|\\operatorname{left}(C)| \\neq|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$ and has the unique imputation of $(100,0,0)$ for the vertices $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$. Of these vertices, only $u_{1}$ is essential.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: A fundamental component $C$ satisfying $|\\operatorname{left}(C)| \\neq|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$ and therefore having a unique imputation.\n\nLemma 7. Let $C$ be a component of $H_{0}$ consisting of viable edges with $|\\operatorname{left}(C)|=|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$. Then $C$ is fundamental if and only if all its vertices are essential.\n\nProof. First assume that $C$ contains a viable vertex, say $u$. Clearly, all viable vertices of $C$ must get zero profit in all core imputations. We will show that the profit of each essential vertex is forced to be unique, thereby proving that $C$ is a unique imputation component.\n\nConsider an essential vertex $v$ of $C$. Let $p$ be a path from $u$ to $v$, consisting of vertices $u=$ $v_{0}, v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{k}=v$ and let the $k$ edges on $p$ have positive weights $w_{1}, w_{2}, \\ldots, w_{k}$, respectively. We will argue that each vertex on $p$ must have a unique profit share; let us denote the profit share of $v_{i}$ by $f_{i}$. Since $v_{0}$ is viable, $f_{0}=0$. Since $\\left(v_{0}, v_{1}\\right)$ is tight, $f_{1}=w_{1}>0$. Since edge $\\left(v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$ is not allowed to be over-tight, $w_{2} \\geq f_{1}$. If $w_{2}=f_{1}$, then $v_{2}$ must have a profit share of 0 , and if $w_{2}>f_{1}$, then $f_{2}=w_{2}-f_{1}>0$. In this manner, constraints can be propagated down $p$, eventually assigning a unique profit share to $v$. Hence $C$ is a unique imputation component.\n\nNext assume that all vertices of $C$ are essential and for the sake of contradiction assume that it has a unique core imputation. By Theorem 4, each vertex of $C$ must get a positive profit. Moreover, as in the proof of Lemma 5, we can assume that all subpar edges incident at $C$ are over-tight by at least $\\epsilon>0$. Therefore, on increasing (decreasing) the profit shares of all vertices in left $(C)$ (right $(C)$ ) by $\\epsilon$, all edges of $C$ will remain tight and we get another core imputation, leading to a contradiction. Hence $C$ is a fundamental component.\n\nTheorem 6 follows from Lemmas 5, 6 and 7.\n\nTheorem 6. A component of $H_{0}$ is fundamental if and only if all its vertices are essential.\nExample 3. Figure 3 shows a component $C$ satisfying $|\\operatorname{left}(C)|=|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$ and having a unique core imputation; it is $(60,0,0,40)$ for vertices $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$. Observe that $u_{2}$ and $v_{1}$ are not essential. Next, assume that $C$ is a complete bipartite graph with unit weight edges. Then $|\\operatorname{left}(C)|=|\\operatorname{right}(C)|$ and all vertices of $C$ are essential.

At any point in the algorithm, for any connected component $C$ of $H, \\min (C)$ will denote the smallest profit share of an essential vertex in $C$. We will say that $C$ has min on both sides if there is a vertex in $\\operatorname{left}(C)$ as well as one in $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ whose profit is $\\min (C)$; if so, $C$ is said to be fully repaired. Otherwise, we will say that $C$ has min in $\\operatorname{left}(C)$ ( $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ ) if there is a vertex in $\\operatorname{left}(C)(\\operatorname{right}(C))$ whose profit is $\\min (C)$.\n\nThe nature of the leximin order dictates that in order to leximin-improve the current core imputation, we must first try to increase the profit share of essential vertices having minimum profit, see also Remark 1. Let $C$ be a fundamental component which is not a unique imputation component; we call the process repairing $C$. Suppose $C$ has min in left $(C)$, see Definition 15. Since the essential and viable edges of $C$ need to always be tight, the only way of repairing $C$ is to rotate $C$ clockwise, see Definition 16. If $C$ has min in $\\operatorname{right}(C)$, we will need to rotate $C$ anti-clockwise.\n\nDefinition 16. Let $C$ be a connected component in the tight subgraph. By rotating $C$ clockwise we mean continuously increasing the profit of left $(C)$ and decreasing the profit of $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ at unit rate, and by rotating $C$ anti-clockwise we mean continuously decreasing the profit of left $(C)$ and increasing the profit of $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ at unit rate.\n\nHow long can we carry out this repair? The answer is: until either $C$ has min on both sides or a subpar edge $e$ incident at $C$ goes exactly tight. In the first case, if we keep rotating $C$ beyond this point, the imputation of $C$ becomes lexicographically worse. Therefore we must stop repairing C; it is now fully repaired, see Definition 15. In the second case, if $C$ has min in left $(C)(\\operatorname{right}(C))$ edge $e$ will be incident at a vertex at $\\operatorname{right}(C)(\\operatorname{left}(C))$. At this point, the action to be taken depends on which component contains the other endpoint of $e$, see Section 7.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 17, "text": "### 6.4 Three Key Ideas\n\n1). Section 6.3, described how to leximin-improve a fundamental component. However, our task is to iteratively improve the entire core imputation. Is there an orderly way of accomplishing this? Towards this end, a central role is played by variable $\\Omega$ which helps synchronize all events, as mentioned in Section 1.1.\n$\\Omega$ is initialized to the minimum profit share of an essential vertex under the starting core imputation, $(u, v)$. Thereafter, $\\Omega$ is raised at unit rate until the algorithm terminates. Therefore, in effect $\\Omega$ defines a notion of time and we will call it the clock. In a real implementation, $\\Omega$ is not raised continuously; instead it is increased in spurts, since at each time, it is easy to compute the next value of $\\Omega$ at which a significant event will take place. However, the description of the algorithm becomes much simpler if we assume that $\\Omega$ is raised continuously, as is done below. A particularly succinct (and attractive) description is:\n$\\Omega$ keeps increasing and the entities of $G$ simply respond via rules given in Algorithm 1.\n$\\Omega$ provides a way of synchronizing the simultaneous repair of several components. Which components? A superficial answer is: the components in the set Active; a more in-depth answer is provided in Section 7 using Definition 18.\n\n2). Can tight subpar edges be added to $T$ when they go exactly tight? If not, why not and which tight subpar edges need to be added to $T$ and when?\n\nOur algorithm adds a tight subpar edge to the tight subgraph only if it is legitimate, see Definition 17. This rule is critical for ensuring correctness of the algorithm, as shown in Example 4.\n3). Assume that a valid component, $D$, has min on both sides. If so, both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations of $D$ will lead to a worse profit allocation for its minimum profit essential vertices. Should we declare $D$ fully repaired?\n\nIt turns out that only a sub-component of $D$ should be declared fully repaired and identifying the right one is critical for ensuring correctness of the algorithm, as shown in Example 5. Furthermore, analogous issues arise when other events happen in the algorithm, see Section 7.3.1.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 18, "text": "# 7 Algorithm for Leximin Core Imputation \n\nAlgorithm 1 starts by computing an arbitrary core imputation, say $(u, v)$, and $\\Omega$ is initialized to the minimum profit share of an essential vertex under $(u, v)$. Recall that $H_{0}=\\left(U, V, T_{0}\\right)$ is the subgraph of $G$ consisting of all essential and viable edges; by Theorem 5, these edges are tight under every core imputation. Using the characterization established in Theorem 6, the Initialization steps of Algorithm 1 move the unique imputation and fundamental components of $H_{0}$ to the sets Frozen and Bin, respectively. During the algorithm, the fundamental components move as follows: from Bin to one of the three sets, Active, Frozen and Fully-Repaired, and also back from Active to Bin. Each of these four sets has its own purpose, as described below. The algorithm terminates when $(\\operatorname{Bin} \\cup \\operatorname{Active})=\\varnothing$.\n\nThe purpose of Active is to carry out repair of fundamental components using the principle summarized in Remark 1. As $\\Omega$ increases, at some point one of three possible events may happen; they are given in Steps 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) in Algorithm 1. It is important to point out that if several events happen simultaneously, they can be executed in any order, see also Remark 2. Furthermore, as described in Remark 3, execution of one such event may lead to a cascade of more such events which all need to be executed before raising $\\Omega$.\n\nThe first event is that $\\Omega$ may become equal to $\\min (C)$, for some component $C \\in$ Bin. If so, in Step 2(a) $C$ gets moved from Bin to Active and it starts undergoing repair. The second and the third events deal with dual and primal updates and are described in detail in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, respectively. We next address the question raised in Section 6, namely which tight edges are added to $T$ and when.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 19, "text": "### 7.1 The Notion of Legitimate Tight Edges\n\nExample 4. In Figure 4, the solid edges are essential and dotted ones are subpar. Assume that the starting profit shares of the essential vertices $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$ are $(60,40,10,50)$, respectively. Since $v_{3}$ is a subpar vertex it is moved to Frozen and the two essential edges are moved to Bin. Also, $\\Omega$ is initialized to 10 . Observe that subpar edge $\\left(u_{1}, v_{3}\\right)$ is tight at the start of the algorithm. The question is what is the \"right\" rule for adding a tight subpar edge $e$ to $T$ ? We study two rules:\n\nRule 1). Subpar edge $e$ is added to $T$ exactly when it goes tight.\nIf so, during Initialization, $\\left(u_{1}, v_{3}\\right)$ is added to $T$. At $\\Omega=10,\\left(u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$ is moved from Bin to Active. $\\Omega$ is raised at unit rate and when it becomes 20 , subpar edge $\\left(u_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$ becomes exactly tight and is added to $T$ and fundamental component $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\\right)$ is moved from Bin to Active. Now, since $\\left(u_{1}, v_{3}\\right)$ is in $T$, the entire graph moves into Frozen, and the algorithm ends with the imputation $(60,40,20,40)$ for $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$.\nRule 2). Subpar edge $e$ is added to $T$ exactly when it is found to be legitimate, see Definition 17.\nUnder this rule, $\\left(u_{1}, v_{3}\\right)$ is not added to $T$ during Initialization. At $\\Omega=10,\\left(u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$ is moved from Bin to Active. When $\\Omega=20$, subpar edge $\\left(u_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$ is found to be legitimate; it is added to $T$ and fundamental component $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\\right)$ is moved from Bin to Active. Now, the valid component consisting of edges $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}\\right),\\left(u_{1}, v_{2}\\right),\\left(u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$ undergoes repair. At $\\Omega=30$, it has min on both sides and is moved into Fully-Repaired. Since (Bin $\\cup$ Active) $=\\varnothing$, the algorithm terminates with the imputation $(70,30,30,30)$ for $\\left(u_{1}, v_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}\\right)$.\nRule 2 is the correct rule; its imputation leximin dominates that of Rule 1.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: The graph for Example 4.\n\nDefinition 17. Let $(i, j)$ be a tight subpar edge, with $i \\in C$ and $j \\in C^{\\prime}$, where connected component $C \\in$ Active. We will say that $(i, j)$ is legitimate if either $C$ has min in left $(C)$ and $i \\in \\operatorname{right}(C)$ or $C$ has min in $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ and $i \\in \\operatorname{left}(C)$.\n\nBy the rule given in Definition 17, edge $(i, j)$ is declared legitimate when it is just about to go under-tight. Clearly, if the algorithm were to wait any longer, the edge would go under-tight and the dual would be infeasible.

{"section_id": 20, "text": "# 7.2 Dual Update: Repairing Valid Components \n\nEach connected component in Active is called valid and its form is described in Definition 18.\n\nDefinition 18. A valid component, $D$, consists of either a single fundamental component, $C_{0}$, or a\n\nset of fundamental components, $C_{0}, C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{k}$, connected up via legitimate tight subpar edges. Because of the way $D$ is formed, it satisfies the following properties.\n\n1. Shrink each fundamental component, $C_{i}$, to a single vertex, $w_{i}$, and if a legitimate edge runs between $C_{i}$ and $C_{j}$, then add an edge between $w_{i}$ and $w_{j}$. Then the resulting graph should form a tree, say $\\tau$, which is rooted at $w_{0}$, where $w_{0}$ is obtained by shrinking $C_{0}$; for a proof, see Lemma 10. If $w_{j}$ is a child of $w_{i}$ in $\\tau$, then we will say that component $C_{j}$ is a child of $C_{i}$. The reflexive, transitive closure of the relation child will be called descendent. Thus all fundamental components in $D$ are descendent of $C_{0}$. Let $w$ be a descendent of $w_{0}$ in $\\tau$ and let the unique path from $w_{0}$ to $w$ in $\\tau$ be $w_{0}, w-1, \\ldots, w_{l}=w$. The the fundamental components $C_{0}, C_{1}, \\ldots C_{l}$, together with the subpar edges between consecutive components, is called the path from $C_{0}$ to $C_{l}$.\n2. $\\min \\left(C_{0}\\right)=\\min _{i=0}^{k} \\min \\left(C_{i}\\right)$, and $C_{0}$ does not have min on both sides.\n3. First assume $C_{0}$ has min in left $\\left(C_{0}\\right)$. Each subpar edge of $D$ was legitimate at the time it was added to $T$. Therefore, by Definition 17, if component $C_{j}$ is a child of $C_{i}$ then the edge connecting them must run between $\\operatorname{right}\\left(C_{i}\\right)$ and left $\\left(C_{j}\\right)$.\n4. Next assume $C_{0}$ has min in $\\operatorname{right}\\left(C_{0}\\right)$. In this case, if component $C_{j}$ is a child of $C_{i}$ then the edge connecting them must run between left $\\left(C_{i}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{right}\\left(C_{j}\\right)$.\n5. The composite component $D$ does not have min on both sides. Clearly, $\\min (D)=\\min \\left(C_{0}\\right)$.\n\nThe repair of a valid component $D$ is similar to that of a fundamental component, namely if $D$ has $\\min$ in left $(D)$ then rotate $D$ clockwise and otherwise rotate $D$ anti-clockwise. When $D$ has min on both sides, it stops being a valid component and an appropriate sub-component, Min-Sub1 $(D)$ is moved into Fully-Repaired, as described in Section 7.3.1. The purpose of Fully-Repaired is to hold fully repaired components, see Definition 15. The algorithm decomposes $(D-\\operatorname{Min-Sub1}(D))$ into fundamental components and moves them back to Bin.\n\nRemark 1. The root component, $C_{0}$, of valid component, $D$, contains an essential vertex having minimum profit in $D$. Other fundamental components of $D$ may also contain essential vertices having minimum profit; however, since $D$ does not have min on both sides, these vertices will be on the same side as in $C_{0} . C_{0}$ dictates the kind of rotation, clockwise or anti-clockwise, which is applied to $D$. Observe that leximin-improving fundamental components containing minimumprofit essential vertices may require leximin-deteriorating other fundamental components of $D$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 21, "text": "# 7.3 Primal Update: Dealing with Legitimate Subpar Edges \n\nLet $e$ be a legitimate subpar tight edge which runs between components $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$, where $C \\in$ Active. The following four cases arise; the cases can be executed in any order. Let $D$ be the component obtained in Step 2(c)(v) by merging the newly tight edge $(i, j)$ together with components $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$. For the exact definition of the minimum fully repaired sub-component of $D$ for each case, i.e., Min-Sub1 $(D)$, Min-Sub2 $(D)$ and Min-Sub3 $(D)$, see Section 7.3.1.\n\n1. $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Active.

Merge $C, C^{\\prime}$ and $(i, j)$ into one component, say $D$.\niii. If $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Bin then move $D$ to Active.\niv. If $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Active then move Min-Sub2(D) to Fully-Repaired and the fundamental components of $\\left(D-\\operatorname{Min}-\\operatorname{Sub} 2(D)\\right.$ ) to Bin.\nv.

Output: Output the current imputation and HALT.\n\n$(i, j)$ goes from one side of $C$ to the other side of $C^{\\prime}$. As a result, $D$ has min on both sides. The algorithm moves the minimum fully repaired sub-component of $D$, Min-Sub2 $(D)$ to Frozen and the fundamental components of $(D-\\operatorname{Min-Sub2}(D))$ to Bin.\n2. $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Frozen. In order to prevent $(i, j)$ from going under-tight, we need to stop the repair of $C$. This is done by moving Min-Sub3 $(D)$ to Frozen and the fundamental components of $(D-\\operatorname{Min-Sub3}(D))$ to Bin.\n3. $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Fully-Repaired. If so, Min-Sub3 $(D)$ is moved to Fully-Repaired and the fundamental components of $(D-\\operatorname{Min-Sub3}(D))$ are moved to Bin.\n4. $C^{\\prime} \\in$ Bin. In order to keep repairing $C$, we will move $C^{\\prime}$ to Active, and start repairing $D$. Observe that if $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$ have min on opposite sides and $\\min \\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Omega$, then $D$ is fully repaired and before raising $\\Omega$, Step 2(b) needs to be executed.\n\nRemark 2. Note that if several edges become legitimate simultaneously, they can be handled in arbitrary order. This is true even if the edges are incident at the same component, e.g., suppose two edges, $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$, incident at component $C$ become simultaneously legitimate, with $e_{1}$ connecting into Frozen and $e_{2}$ connecting into Fully-Repaired. If so, $C$ will end up in Frozen or Fully-Repaired depending on which edge is handled first. But in both cases no more changes will be made to the profit allocation of $C$ and therefore the core imputation computed will be the same.\n\nAt the moment when there are no more components left in (Bin $\\cup$ Active), $\\Omega$ stops increasing, the current imputation is output (in Step 3) and the algorithm terminates. In Section 7.4 we will prove that this imputation is indeed the leximin core imputation.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 23, "text": "# 7.3.1 Determining the \"Right\" Sub-Component \n\nThe question of determining the \"right\" sub-component of a valid component arises at four steps; however they can be classified into three different types of situations, as described below. Example 5 illustrates the importance of determining the \"right\" sub-component for the first situation; it is easy to construct similar examples for the other situations as well.\n\nStep 2(b): A valid component $D$ has min on both sides. Let $C_{0}$ be the root fundamental component of $D$, see Definition 18. First assume that $C_{0}$ has min in left $\\left(C_{0}\\right)$. There is at least one descendent of $C_{0}$, say $C_{i}$, such that $C_{i}$ has min in $\\operatorname{right}\\left(C_{i}\\right)$ and $\\min \\left(C_{0}\\right)=\\min \\left(C_{i}\\right)$. Let $S$ be the set of all such descendents of $C_{0}$; clearly, $C_{i} \\in S$. As described in Definition 18 and proven in Lemma 10, $D$ has a tree structure with root $C_{0}$. The minimum fully repaired sub-component of $D$ is defined to be the smallest subtree of $D$ which contains $C_{0}$ and all components in $S$; we will denote it by $\\operatorname{Min-Sub1}(D)$.\n\nNext assume that $C_{0}$ has min in $\\operatorname{right}\\left(C_{0}\\right)$. If so, in $S$ we will include all descendents, $C_{i}$ of $C_{0}$, such that $C_{i}$ has min in left $\\left(C_{i}\\right)$ and $\\min \\left(C_{0}\\right)=\\min \\left(C_{i}\\right)$. The rest of the construction is same as above. Finally, if $C_{0}$ has min on both sides, $S$ will include both types of descendents defined above.\n\nThe correct action to be taken in Step 2(b) is to move Min-Sub1(D) to Fully-Repaired and\n\ndecompose $\\left(D-\\operatorname{Min}-\\operatorname{Sub1}(D)\\right.$ ) into fundamental components and move them back to Bin. See Example 5 for a detailed explanation.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The graph for Example 5.\n\nExample 5. Figure 2 shows a valid component $D$ whose root component $C_{0}=\\left\\{u_{1}, v_{1}\\right\\}$. Assume that the profit shares of its essential vertices $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}, u_{4}, v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}\\right)$ are $(20,50,60,20,40,20,40,40)$, respectively. Clearly, $D$ has min on both sides at $\\Omega=20$. Moving all of $D$ to Fully-Repaired will lead to a core imputation which is not leximin, as shown next.\n\nThe minimum fully repaired sub-component of $D$, Min-Sub1 $(D)$, consists of the graph induced on $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)$, and it is added to Fully-Repaired in Step 2(b) of the algorithm. Furthermore, the fundamental components of $\\left(D-\\operatorname{Min}-\\operatorname{Sub1}(D)\\right.$, namely $\\left(u_{3}, v_{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(u_{4}, v_{4}\\right)$ are moved them back to Bin.\n\nNext, while $\\Omega=20,\\left(u_{4}, v_{4}\\right)$ is moved back to Active in Step 2(a). Also, since $\\left(u_{4}, v_{3}\\right)$ is a legitimate edge, in Step 2(c)(iii), $\\left(u_{3}, v_{3}\\right)$ is also moved back to Active. The two together form valid component $D^{\\prime}=\\left(u_{3}, u_{4}, v_{3}, v_{4}\\right)$. At this point, $\\Omega$ starts increasing again. When $\\Omega=30$, $D^{\\prime}$ is found to have min on both sides. Furthermore, since $\\operatorname{Min}-\\operatorname{Sub1}\\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{\\prime}$, it is moved into Fully-Repaired.\n\nThe final core imputation computed for essential vertices $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}, u_{4}, v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}\\right)$ is given by $(20,50,70,30,40,20,30,30)$, respectively. This is the leximin core imputation.\n\nStep 2(c)(iv): Edge $(i, j)$ connecting valid components $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$, both in Active, has gone tight; clearly, $(i, j)$ must be incident at opposite sides of $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$. Let $R$ be the component obtained by merging $D, D^{\\prime}$ and $(i, j)$ in Step 2(c)(ii). W.l.o.g. assume that $D$ has min in left $(D)$ and $D^{\\prime}$ has min in right $\\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)$. If so, $i \\in \\operatorname{right}(D)$ and $j \\in \\operatorname{left}(D)$. Let $C_{0}$ and $C_{0}^{\\prime}$ be the root fundamental components of $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$, respectively and $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ be the fundamental components of $D$ and\n\n$D^{\\prime}$ containing $i$ and $j$, respectively.\nLet $p$ and $p^{\\prime}$ be the paths from $C_{0}$ to $C_{1}$ and from $C_{0}^{\\prime}$ to $C_{1}^{\\prime}$, in $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$, respectively, as defined in Definition 18. Then the sub-component of $R$ consisting of $p$ and $p^{\\prime}$, together with the edge $(i, j)$, is the minimum fully repaired sub-component of $R$; we will denote it by Min-Sub2 $(R)$. In Step 2(c)(iv), the algorithm moves Min-Sub2 $(R)$ to Fully-Repaired and decomposes $(R-\\operatorname{Min-Sub2}(R))$ into fundamental components and moves them back to Bin.\n\nSteps 2(c)(v) and 2(c)(vi): Edge $(i, j)$ connecting components $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$ has gone tight, where $D^{\\prime} \\in$ Active, and $D \\in$ Frozen in Step 2(c)(v) and $D \\in$ Fully-Repaired in Step 2(c)(vi); observe that $D$ need not be a valid component, as defined in Definition 18. Let $R$ be the component obtained by merging $D, D^{\\prime}$ and $(i, j)$ in Step 2(c)(ii). Let $C_{0}$ be the root fundamental component of $D^{\\prime}$ and $C_{1}$ be the fundamental component of $D^{\\prime}$ containing $i$.\n\nLet $p$ be the path from $C_{0}$ to $C_{1}$ in $D^{\\prime}$, as defined in Definition 18. Then the sub-component of $R$ consisting of $p$ together with the edge $(i, j)$, is the minimum fully repaired sub-component of $R$; we will denote it by Min-Sub3 $(R)$. In Step 2(c)(v), the algorithm moves Min-Sub3 $(R)$ to Frozen and in Step 2(c)(vi), it moves Min-Sub3 $(R)$ to Fully-Repaired. In either step, it decomposes $(R-\\operatorname{Min-Sub3}(R))$ into fundamental components and moves them back to Bin.\n\nThe Cleanup in Step 2(d): The fundamental components which have been moved from Active back to Bin may have subpar tight edges connecting them. All such edges are removed from $T$ in Step 2(d) so these components can be independently improved in the future.\n\nRemark 3. After the execution of Step 2(d) and before raising $\\Omega$, it may turn out that for some fundamental component $C$ that just got moved from Active to Bin, $\\min (C)=\\Omega$. If so, $C$ needs to be moved back to Active. This may lead to the discovery of a legitimate edge incident at $C$ and the execution of a cascade of such events. All these events need to be executed before raising $\\Omega$.\n\nLemma 8. Let $D$ be the component that is moved to (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) at time $\\Omega=t$. Then $\\min (D)=t$.\n\nProof. In all four ways of moving a component $D$ to (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired), the root component of $D$, say $C_{0}$, is a also added.

{"section_id": 24, "text": "# 7.4 Proof of Correctness of Algorithm 1 \n\nOur algorithm maintains the following second invariant:\nInvariant 2: At any time $\\Omega$ in the run of the algorithm, each fundamental component $C \\in$ (Active $\\cup$ Bin) satisfies $\\min (C) \\geq \\Omega$.\n\nLemma 9. The algorithm maintains the Invariant 2.\nProof. In Step 1(e), $\\Omega$ is initialized to the minimum profit share of an essential vertex under the starting core imputation $(u, v)$, and at this time, each fundamental component $C$ with\n\n$\\min (C)=\\Omega$ is moved from Bin to Active. Therefore Invariant 2 is satisfied at the beginning of the algorithm.\n\nAt each time $\\Omega$, each fundamental component $C \\in$ Bin satisfying $\\min (C)=\\Omega$ is moved from Bin to Active. Thereafter, the increase in $\\Omega$ and $\\min (C)$ is synchronized. Therefore Invariant 2 is maintained.\n\nAssume valid component $D \\in$ Active and at time $\\Omega, D$ has min on both sides, i.e., $D$ is fully repaired. Now, an appropriate sub-component of $D$ is moved from Active to Fully-Repaired in Step 2(c)(vi). The remaining fundamental components, say $C$, of $D$ are moved back to Bin. Since the latter satisfy $\\min (C) \\geq \\Omega$, the fundamental components in Bin still satisfy Invariant 2.\n\nAnother possibility is that at time $\\Omega$ in Step 2(c), a subpar edge $e$ from valid component $D \\in$ Active to a component in (Active $\\cup$ Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) becomes exactly tight. If so, the appropriate step in Step 2(c) is executed. This may also involve moving some fundamental components, say $C$, back to Bin. Since the latter satisfy $\\min (C) \\geq \\Omega$, the fundamental components in Bin still satisfy Invariant 2.\n\nLemma 10. At any time $\\Omega$ in the run of the algorithm, each valid component $D \\in$ Active has the tree structure described in Definition 18.\n\nProof. The proof follows by an induction on the growth of $D$, i.e., the number of fundamental components in it. $D$ starts off when a fundamental component $C_{0}$ moves from Bin to Active. Assume $C_{0}$ has min in left $\\left(C_{0}\\right)$, the other case is analogous. If so, $D$ will be rotated clockwise. Clearly, no subpar over-tight edge with both endpoints in $D$ can go tight due to this rotation. However, a subpar over-tight edge can go tight from $D$ to a fundamental component $C \\in$ Bin or a valid component $D^{\\prime} \\in$ Active. If so, the edge must go from $\\operatorname{right}(D)$ to left $(C)$ or left $\\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)$. In the first case, $C$ is added to $D$ and the tree structure is maintained. In the second case, it must be the case that $D^{\\prime}$ is being rotated anti-clockwise, i.e., it has min in right $\\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)$ and hence Step 2(c)(iv) kicks in and $D$ ceases to exist. The last possibility is that a subpar over-tight edge from $D$ to a component $D^{\\prime} \\in$ (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) goes tight. If so, Step 2(c)(v) or 2(c)(vi) kicks in and again $D$ ceases to exist.\n\nLet $S$ be a set of unique imputation components and fundamental components of $G$ and let $W_{S}$ denote the set of vertices of all these components, $W_{S} \\subseteq(U \\cup V)$. Let $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $W_{S}$. The edges of $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ inherit weights from $G$, i.e., $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}_{+}$.\n\nLemma 11. The following hold for the edge-weighted graph $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ :\n\n1. The projection of a maximum weight matching of $G$ onto $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ is a maximum weight matching in $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$. Furthermore every maximum weight matching of $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ arises in this manner.\n2. The projection, onto $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$, of the partition of vertices and edges of $G$ into essential, viable and subpar is the correct partition for $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$.\n3. The projection of a core imputation of $G$ onto $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ is a core imputation for $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$.\n\nProof. 1. The crux of the matter lies in the following fact, which also gives the importance of moving entire unique imputation and fundamental components of $G$ into the subgraph $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$. Obtain $E^{\\prime}$ from $E$ by deleting all subpar edges and let $G^{\\prime}=\\left(U, V, E^{\\prime}\\right)$. Clearly the sets of maximum weight matchings of $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$ are identical. Therefore each maximum weight matching in $G$ consists of a union of maximum weight matchings in the unique imputation and fundamental components of $G$.\nObviously the projection of a maximum weight matching of $G$ onto $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ is a matching in $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$. Suppose for contradiction $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ has a heavier maximum weight matching, say $M$. Then $M$ together with maximum weight matchings in the fundamental components of $G$ which are not in $S$ will be a heavier matching in $G$, leading to a contradiction.\n2. This is a corollary of the previous assertion.\n3. Let $p$ be a core imputation of $G$ and let $w$ and $w^{\\prime}$ be the weights of maximum weight matchings in $G$ and $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$, respectively. By definition, $p\\left(W_{S}\\right) \\geq w^{\\prime}$. By the first part, the maximum weight matching in the induced subgraph on $\\left((U \\cup V)-W_{S}\\right)$ has weight $w-w^{\\prime}$. Therefore $p\\left((U \\cup V)-W_{S}\\right) \\geq\\left(w-w^{\\prime}\\right)$. Also, the worth of the game $G$ is\n\n$$\nw=p\\left(W_{S}\\right)+p\\left((U \\cup V)-W_{S}\\right) \\geq w^{\\prime}+\\left(w-w^{\\prime}\\right)=w\n$$\n\nTherefore $p\\left(W_{S}\\right)=w^{\\prime}$.\nFinally observe that for any sub-coalition $W^{\\prime} \\subseteq W_{S}$, its worth is the same in $G$ and $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$, and by definition, $p\\left(W^{\\prime}\\right)$ is at least the worth of $W^{\\prime}$. Hence the projection of $p$ onto $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$ is a core imputation for $H\\left(W_{S}\\right)$.\n\nAt any time $\\Omega=t$ in the run of the algorithm, consider the moment when $\\Omega$ is just about to be increased, i.e, the cascade of events described in Remark 3 have all been executed. At this moment, let $W_{t}$ be the set of vertices of all components which are in (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired); clearly $W_{t} \\subseteq(U \\cup V)$. Let $H_{t}$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced on $W_{t}$.\n\nLemma 12. The profit shares of vertices of $W_{t}$ form the leximin core imputation for the graph $H_{t}$.\nProof. By the third statement of Lemma 11, the profit shares of vertices of $W_{t}$ form a core imputation for the graph $H_{t}$. Let $F$ denote the set of vertices of the unique imputation components in Frozen at the start of the algorithm. The proof follows by an induction on the growth of $W_{t}$, i.e., the number of components (which in general are unions of fundamental components and legitimate edges) that are added to (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired). Clearly the assertion holds for $F$, which proves the basis of the induction.\n\nFor the induction step, assume that the assertion holds for $W_{t}$ and we wish to prove it for $W_{t^{\\prime}}$ where $t^{\\prime}>t$ and at time $t^{\\prime}$, one more component, say $D$, is added to (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) and hence to $W_{t^{\\prime}}$. Clearly, $\\min (D)=t^{\\prime}$. By Lemma 8 each component $D^{\\prime}$ that was added to (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) until time $t$ satisfied $\\min \\left(D^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq t$.\n\nThere are two cases. If $D$ was added to Fully-Repaired because it was fully repaired, then its imputation cannot be leximin-improved and the assertion follows. If $D$ was added to (Frozen $\\cup$\n\nFully-Repaired) because a subpar edge $e$ just went tight, then the only way of leximin-improving $D$ is to leximin-deteriorate the current imputation of $W_{t}$ (since edge $e$ cannot be allowed to go under-tight). For each component $D^{\\prime}$ in $W_{t}, \\min \\left(D^{\\prime}\\right)<\\min (D)$. Therefore, this change will leximin-deteriorate the overall imputation for $W_{t^{\\prime}}$. Hence the current imputation of $W_{t^{\\prime}}$ is the leximin core imputation for the graph $H_{t^{\\prime}}$. The lemma follows.\n\nTheorem 7. Let $M$ denote the weight of a maximum weight edge in the given instance. Then, Algorithm 1 will terminate with a leximin core imputation by time $M / 2$.\n\nProof. By Lemmas 12, and 9 at each time $t$, the profit shares of vertices of $W_{t}$ form the leximin core imputation for the graph $H_{t}$ and the profit share of each vertex in $(U \\cup V)-W_{t}$ is $>t$.\n\nConsider the extreme case that there is an essential edge $e$ having weight $M$ which starts off with profit shares of 0 and $M$ on its endpoints. If $e$ does not get moved into (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) before time $M / 2$, then it will be fully-repaired at time $M / 2$. Clearly, all other fundamental components will get moved into (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired) by that time either because they are fully-repaired or have a tight edge to a component in (Frozen $\\cup$ Fully-Repaired). The theorem follows.\n\nTheorem 8. Algorithm 1 runs in strongly polynomial time; in particular, in time $O\\left(m^{2+o(1)}\\right)$.\nProof. In Section 6.1, we showed that the time required to classify vertices and edges requires a total time of $O\\left(m^{2+o(1)}\\right)$. Below we will show that the rest of the steps of Algorithm 1 require time $O(m n \\log n)$, using the data structure of Fibonacci Heap [FT87], which executes operations of insert and find-min in $O(1)$ time and delete-min and delete in $O(\\log n)$ time, amortized. Since the first term dominates the second, the theorem follows.\n\nWe will partition a run of Algorithm 1 into epochs. The first epoch starts with the start of Algorithm 1 and an epoch ends when a component gets moved to (Frozen $\\cap$ Fully-Repaired), i.e., in Step 2(b), 2(c)(iv), 2(c)(v) or 2(c)(vi). Clearly there are at most $O(n)$ epochs.\n\nThere will be at most $m+n$ entries in the Fibonacci Heap, one corresponding to each edge and each fundamental component. The key of each entry specifies the time at which it will participate in an event. For each fundamental component $C \\in \\operatorname{Bin}$, there is an entry whose key is $\\min (C)$, since $C$ will move into Active when $\\Omega=\\min (C)$. Once a fundamental component $C$ moves into Active, in Step 2(a) or 2(c)(iii), all subpar edges incident at $C$ are inserted in the Fibonacci Heap with the appropriate key.\n\nThe minimum key in the Fibonacci Heap indicates the next event that will happen. Hence there is no need to decrease $\\Omega$ continuously; it can be dropped in discrete steps. When Step 2(d) is executed, all the edges participating in the cleanup are deleted from the Fibonacci Heap. These $O(m)$ operations, which take $O(m \\log n)$ time, dominate the rest of the operations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 25, "text": "# Algorithm 2.

It differs from Algorithm 1 in the following ways:\n\n1. In Step 1(e), $\\Omega$ is initialized to the maximum profit share of an essential vertex under the initial core imputation $(u, v)$ computed in Step 1(a).\n2. Whereas in Algorithm 1, $\\Omega$ is raised at unit rate, in Algorithm 2, it is lowered at unit rate.\n3. Definition 19 plays a role analogous to that of Definition 15. Furthermore, for Algorithm 2, we will say that component $C$ is fully repaired if it has max on both sides.\n4. Repairing a Component: If component $C$ has max in left $(C)$, then $C$ needs to be rotated anti-clockwise and if it has max in right $(C)$, it needs to be rotated clockwise.\n5. The previous change will change the definition of valid component appropriately. Furthermore, the definitions of Min-Sub1, Min-Sub2 and Min-Sub3 will change appropriately and we will denote the resulting sub-components by Max-Sub1, Max-Sub2 and Max-Sub3, respectively.\n6. The proofs of correctness and running time of Algorithm 2 are analogous to that of Algorithm 1 .\n\nDefinition 19. At any point in the Algorithm, for any connected component $C$ of $H, \\max (C)$ will denote the largest profit share of an essential vertex in $C$. We will say that $C$ has max on both sides if there is a vertex in left $(C)$ as well one in $\\operatorname{right}(C)$ whose profit is $\\max (C)$. Otherwise, we will say that $C$ has max in left $(C)(\\operatorname{right}(C))$ if there is a vertex in left $(C)(\\operatorname{right}(C))$ whose profit is $\\max (C)$.\n\nTheorem 9.

Before answering this question, we consider the following problem: Find the set of essential vertices which are assigned the smallest profit in the leximin core imputation.\n\nAn LP-based algorithm will require ideas from [FRT85] - for identifying the set of always-active constraints. How about an efficient combinatorial algorithm? The only method we are aware of is to run Algorithm 1 for the first epoch (see Theorem 8 for a definition) and pick the set of essential vertices having the smallest profits in $V_{t}$. This leads us to believe that the answer to the question stated above is \"No\".\n\nInterestingly enough, the two principles underlying primal-dual algorithms also underlie algorithms for finding Nash equilibria for a two-player zero-sum game, namely:\n\n1. Finding globally optimal solutions by making only local improvements and\n2. Two processes, a minimizer and a maximizer, alternately making improvements to dual entities by responding to each other's progress.\n\nFor the Nash equilibrium problem, the two regret minimization algorithms take local improvement steps in the direction of the gradient, and the average of the strategies played converges to the set of Nash equilibria. This is a folklore fact that traces back to at least the works by Hannan [Han57] and Foster and Vohra [FV97]; see also the recent paper [APFS22].\nFinally, here are some open problems.\n\n1. Where in the polytope of optimal dual solutions to LP (2) do the leximin and leximax core imputations lie? Characterize these points; see also Section 1.1.\n2.
