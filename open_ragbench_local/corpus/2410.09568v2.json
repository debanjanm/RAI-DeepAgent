This setting covers many useful applications, including functionally constrained optimization (Xu, 2020), game theory (Von Neumann \\& Morgenstern, 1947), robust optimization (Ben-Tal et al., 2009), fairnessaware machine learning (Zhang et al., 2018), reinforcement learning (Du et al., 2017; Wang, 2017; Paternain et al., 2022; Wai et al., 2018), decentralized optimization (Kovalev et al., 2021; 2020), AUC maximization (Ying et al., 2016; Hanley \\& McNeil, 1982; Yuan et al., 2021).\nFirst-order methods are widely studied for this problem. Classical algorithms include ExtraGradient (EG) (Korpelevich, 1976; Nemirovski, 2004), Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) (Popov, 1980; Mokhtari et al., 2020a;b), Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (HPE) (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2010), and Dual Extrapolation (DE) (Nesterov \\& Scrimali, 2006; Nesterov, 2007). When the gradient of $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $L$-Lipschitz continuous, these methods achieve the rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ under the convexconcave (C-C) setting and the rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left((L / \\mu) \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$ when $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex in $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\mu$-strongly-concave in $\\boldsymbol{y}$ (SC-SC) for $\\mu>0$. They are all optimal in C-C and SC-SC settings due to the lower bounds reported by (Nemirovskij \\& Yudin, 1983; Zhang et al., 2022a).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * Equal contributions.\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ The corresponding author.\n\nSecond-order methods usually lead to faster rates than first-order methods when the Hessian of $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\rho$-Lipschitz continuous. A line of works (Nesterov \\& Scrimali, 2006; Huang et al., 2022) extended the celebrated Cubic Regularized Newton (CRN) (Nesterov \\& Polyak, 2006) method to minimax problems with local superlinear convergence rates and global convergence guarantee. However, the established global convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ by Nesterov \\& Scrimali (2006) and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(L \\rho / \\mu^{2}\\right) \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$ by Huang et al. (2022) under C-C and SC-SC conditions are no better than the optimal first-order methods. Another line of work generalizes the optimal first-order methods to higher-order methods. Monteiro \\& Svaiter (2012) proposed the Newton Proximal Extragradient (NPE) method with a global convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-2 / 3} \\log \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$ under the C-C conditions. This result nearly matches the lower bounds (Adil et al., 2022; Lin \\& Jordan, 2024), except an additional $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$ factor which is caused by the implicit binary search at each iteration. Bullins \\& Lai (2022); Adil et al. (2022); Huang \\& Zhang (2022); Lin et al. (2022) provided a simple proof of NPE motivated by the EG analysis and showed that replacing the quadratic regularized Newton step with the cubic regularized Newton (CRN) step in NPE achieves the optimal second-order oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$. Recently, Alves \\& Svaiter (2023) proposed a search-free NPE method to achieve the optimal second-order oracle complexity with pure quadratic regularized Newton step based on ideas from homotopy. Over the past decade, researchers also proposed various secondorder methods, in addition to the NPE framework, that achieve the same convergence rate, such as the second-order extensions of OGDA (Jiang \\& Mokhtari, 2022; Jiang et al., 2024) (which we refer to as OGDA-2) and DE (Lin \\& Jordan, 2024) (they name the method Persesus). The results for C-C problems can also be extended to SC-SC problems, where Jiang \\& Mokhtari (2022) proved the OGDA-2 can converge at the rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left((\\rho / \\mu)^{2 / 3}+\\log \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$, and Huang \\& Zhang (2022) proposed the ARE-restart with the rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left((\\rho / \\mu)^{2 / 3} \\log \\log \\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)\\right)$.\nAlthough the aforementioned second-order methods Adil et al. (2022); Lin \\& Jordan (2024); Lin et al. (2022); Jiang \\& Mokhtari (2022); Monteiro \\& Svaiter (2012) enjoy an improved convergence rate over the first-order methods and have achieved optimal iteration complexities, they require querying one new Hessian at each iteration and solving a matrix inversion problem at each Newton step, which leads to a $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{3}\\right)$ computational cost per iteration. This becomes the main bottleneck that limits the applicability of second-order methods. Liu \\& Luo (2022a) proposed quasi-Newton methods for saddle point problems that access one Hessian-vector product instead of the exact Hessian for each iteration. The iteration complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$ for quasi-Newton methods. However, their methods do not have a global convergence guarantee under general (S)C)-(S)C conditions. Jiang et al. (2023) proposed an online-learning guided Quasi-Newton Proximal Extragradient (QNPE) algorithm, but their method relies on more complicated subroutines than classical Newton methods. Although the oracle complexity of QNPE is strictly better than the optimal first-order method EG, their method is worse in terms of total computational complexity.\nIn this paper, we propose a computation-efficient second-order method, which we call LEN (Lazy Extra Newton method). In contrast to all existing second-order methods or quasi-Newton methods for minimax optimization problems that always access new second-order information for the coming iteration, LEN reuses the second-order information from past iterations. Specifically, LEN solves a cubic regularized sub-problem using the Hessian from the snapshot point that is updated every $m$ iteration, then conducts an extra-gradient step by the gradient from the current iteration. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of LEN to show it maintains fast global convergence rates and improves the (near)-optimal second-order methods (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012) in terms of the overall computational complexity. We summarize our contributions as follows (also see Table 1).\n\n- When the object function $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is convex in $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and concave in $\\boldsymbol{y}$, we propose LEN and prove that it finds an $\\epsilon$-saddle point in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$ iterations. Under Assumption 3.4, where the complexity of calculating $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ is $N$ and the complexity of calculating $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ is $d N$, the optimal choice is $m=\\Theta(d)$. In this case, LEN only requires a computational complexity of $\\hat{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+d^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)\\right)$, which is strictly better than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right) d \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$ for the existing optimal second-order methods by a factor of $d^{1 / 3}$.\n- When the object function $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\mu$-strongly-convex in $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\mu$-strongly-concave in $\\boldsymbol{y}$, we apply the restart strategy on LEN and propose LEN-restart. We prove the algorithm can find an $\\epsilon$-root with $\\hat{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+d^{2 / 3}(\\rho / \\mu)^{2 / 3}\\right)\\right)$ computational complexity, where $\\rho$ means the Hessian of $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\rho$ Lipschitz-continuous. Our result is strictly better than the $\\hat{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right) d(\\rho / \\mu)^{2 / 3}\\right)$ in prior works.\n\nTable 1: We compare the required computational complexity to achieve an $\\epsilon$-saddle point of the proposed LEN with the optimal choice $m=\\Theta(d)$ and other existing algorithms on both convexconcave (C-C) and strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SC-SC) problems. Here, $d=d_{x}+d_{y}$ is the dimension of the problem. We assume the gradient is $L$-Lipschitz continuous for EG and the Hessian is $\\rho$-Lipschitz continuous for others. We count each gradient oracle call with $N$ computational complexity, and each Hessian oracle with $d N$ computational complexity.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nNotations.

The idea of reusing Hessian was initially presented by Shamanskii (1967) and later incorporated into the Levenberg-Marquardt method, the Damped Newton method, and the proximal Newton method (Fan, 2013; Lampariello \\& Sciandrone, 2001; Wang et al., 2006; Adler et al., 2020). However, the explicit advantage of lazy Hessian update over ordinary Newton (-type) update was not discovered until the recent work of (Doikov et al., 2023; Chayti et al., 2023). They applied the following lazy Hessian update on cubic regularized Newton (CRN) methods (Nesterov \\& Polyak, 2006):\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}=\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\\left\\{\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right), \\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right), \\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\rangle+\\frac{M}{6}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|^{3}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $M \\geq 0$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the gradient field of a convex function. They establish the convergence rates of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{m} \\epsilon^{-3 / 2}\\right)$ for nonconvex optimization (Doikov et al., 2023), and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{m} \\epsilon^{-1 / 2}\\right)$ for convex optimization (Chayti et al., 2023) respectively. Such rates lead to the total computational cost of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+\\sqrt{d} \\epsilon^{-3 / 2}\\right)\\right)$ and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+\\sqrt{d} \\epsilon^{-1 / 2}\\right)\\right)$ by setting $m=\\Theta(d)$, which strictly improve the result by classical CRN methods by a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$ in both setups.\nWe have also observed that the idea of the \"lazy Hessian\" is widely used in practical second-order methods. KFAC (Martens \\& Grosse, 2015; Grosse \\& Martens, 2016) approximates the Fisher information matrix and uses an exponential moving average (EMA) to update the estimate of the Fisher information matrix, which can be viewed as a soft version of lazy update. Sophia (Liu et al., 2024) estimates a diagonal Hessian matrix as a pre-conditioner, which is updated in a lazy manner to reduce the complexity. C2EDEN (Liu et al., 2023) atomizes the communication of local Hessian in several consecutive iterations, which also benefits from the idea of lazy updates.\n\nChallenge of using lazy Hessian updates in minimax problems. In comparison to previous work on lazy Hessian, our LEN and LEN-restart methods demonstrate the advantage of using lazy Hessian\n\nfor a broader class of optimization problems, the minimax problems. Our analysis differs from the ones in Doikov et al. (2023); Chayti et al. (2023). Their methods only take a lazy CRN update (2) at each iteration, which makes it easy to bound the error of lazy Hessian updates using Assumption 3.1 and the triangle inequality in the following way:\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\right\\| \\leq \\rho\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\| \\leq \\rho \\sum_{i=\\pi(t)}^{t-1}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{i+1}\\right\\|\n$$\n\nOur method, on the other hand, not only takes a lazy (regularized) Newton update but also requires an extra gradient step (Line 4 in Algorithm 1). Thus, the summation of Newton progress $\\sum_{i=\\pi(t)}^{t-1}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{i+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}\\right\\|$ cannot directly bound the error term $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right\\|$ introduced by the lazy Hessian update. Moreover, for minimax problems the matrix $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)$ is no longer symmetric, which leads to different analysis and implementation of sub-problem solving (Section 4.3).

We assume the function $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\mu$-strongly-convex- $\\mu$-stronglyconcave. We denote the condition number as $\\kappa:=\\rho / \\mu$.\n\nWe let $d:=d_{x}+d_{y}$ and denote the aggregated variable $\\boldsymbol{z}:=(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.

We call $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}=(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})$ an $\\epsilon$-root if $\\left\\|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\| \\leq \\epsilon$.\n\nMost previous works only consider the complexity metric as the number of oracle calls, where an oracle takes a point $\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ as the input and returns a tuple $(\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}), \\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}))$ as the output. The existing algorithms (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012; Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022) have achieved optimal complexity regarding the number of oracle calls. In this work, we focus on the computational complexity of the oracle. More specifically, we distinguish between the different computational complexities of calculating the Hessian matrix $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ and the gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})$. Formally, we make the following assumption as Doikov et al. (2023).\nAssumption 3.4. We count the computational complexity of computing $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ as $N$ and the computational complexity of $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ as $N d$.\nRemark 3.1. Assumption 3.4 supposes the cost of computing $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ is $d$ times that of computing $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$. It holds in many practical scenarios as one Hessian oracle can be computed via d Hessianvector products on standard basis vectors $\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and one Hessian-vector product oracle is typically as expensive as one gradient oracle (Wright, 2006):\n\n1. When the computational graph of $f$ is obtainable, both $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ and $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}) \\boldsymbol{v}$ can be computed using automatic differentiation with the same cost for any $\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n2. When $f$ is a black box function, we can estimate the Hessian-vector $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}) \\boldsymbol{v}$ via the finitedifference $\\boldsymbol{u}_{\\delta}(\\boldsymbol{z} ; \\boldsymbol{v})=\\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}+\\delta \\boldsymbol{v})-\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}-\\delta \\boldsymbol{v}))$ and we have $\\lim _{\\delta \\rightarrow 0} \\boldsymbol{u}_{\\delta}(\\boldsymbol{z} ; \\boldsymbol{v})=$ $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z}) \\boldsymbol{v}$ under mild conditions on $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4 ALGORITHMS AND CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS \n\nIn this section, we present novel second-order methods for solving minimax optimization problems (1).

The only change is that we reuse the Hessian from previous iterates, as colored in blue. Each iteration of LEN contains the following two steps:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)=\\mathbf{0}, \\quad \\text { (Implicit Step) } \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}=\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}\\right)}{M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\n(Explicit Step)\nThe first step (implicit step) solves a cubic regularized sub-problem based on the $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)$ computed at the latest snapshot point and $\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)$ at the current iteration point. This step is often viewed as an oracle (Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022) as there exists efficient solvers, which will also be discussed in Section 4.3. The second one (explicit step) conducts an extra gradient step based on $\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}\\right)$.\nReusing the Hessian in the implicit step makes each iteration much cheaper, but would cause additional errors compared to previous methods (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012; Huang \\& Zhang, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022). The error resulting from the lazy Hessian updates is formally characterized by the following theorem.\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that Assumption 3.1 and 3.2 hold. For any $\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, Algorithm 1 ensures\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\gamma_{t}^{-1}\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}\\right), \\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\right\\rangle \\leq & \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\right\\|^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\right\\|^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& -\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}\\right\\|^{2}+\\frac{\\rho^{2}}{2 M^{2}}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}\\right\\|^{2}+\\underbrace{\\frac{2 \\rho^{2}}{M^{2}}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|^{2}}_{(\\star)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAbove, (*) is the error from lazy Hessian updates. Note that $\\left({ }^{*}\\right)$ vanishes when the current Hessian is used. For lazy Hessian updates, the error would accumulate in the epoch.\nThe key step in our analysis shows that we can use the negative terms in the right-hand side of the inequality in Lemma 4.1 to bound the accumulated error by choosing $M$ sufficiently large, with the help of the following technical lemma.\nLemma 4.2. For any sequence of positive numbers $\\left\\{r_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 0}$, it holds for any $m \\geq 2$ that $\\sum_{t=1}^{m-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} r_{i}\\right)^{2} \\leq \\frac{m^{2}}{2} \\sum_{t=0}^{m-1} r_{t}^{2}$.\nWhen $m=1$, the algorithm reduces to the NPE algorithm (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012; Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022) without using lazy Hessian updates. When $m \\geq 2$, we use Lemma 4.2 to upper bound the error that arises from lazy Hessian updates. Finally, we prove the following guarantee for our proposed algorithm.\nTheorem 4.1 (C-C setting). Suppose that Assumption 3.1 and 3.2 hold. Let $\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{*}, \\boldsymbol{y}^{*}\\right)$ be a saddle point and $\\beta=\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\|$. Set $M \\geq 3 \\rho m$.

Theorem 4.1 indicates that LEN requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$ calls to $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3} / m+1\\right)$ calls to $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ to find the $\\epsilon$-saddle point. Under Assumption 3.4, the computational cost to call the oracles $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ and $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ is\n\n$$\n\\text { Oracle Computational Cost }=\\mathcal{O}\\left(N \\cdot m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}+(N d) \\cdot\\left(\\epsilon^{-2 / 3} m^{-1 / 3}+1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nTaking $m=\\Theta(d)$ minimizes (5) to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d+N d^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$. Compared to state-of-the-art secondorder methods (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012; Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022), whose computational cost in terms of the oracles is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)$ since they require to query $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}(\\cdot)$ at each iteration, our methods significantly improve their results by a factor of $d^{1 / 3}$.\nIt is worth noticing that the computational cost of an algorithm includes both the computational cost of calling the oracles, which we have discussed above, and the computational cost of performing the updates (i.e. solving auxiliary problems) after accessing the required oracles. We will give an efficient implementation of LEN and analyze the total computational cost later in Section 4.3.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 4.2 THE LEN-RESTART ALGORITHM FOR STRONGLY-CONVEX-STRONGLY-CONCAVE PROBLEMS \n\nWe generalize LEN to solve the strongly-convex-strongly-concave minimax optimization by incorporating the restart strategy introduced by Huang \\& Zhang (2022); Lin \\& Jordan (2024). We propose the LEN-restart in Algorithm 2, which works in epochs. Each epoch of LEN-restart invokes LEN (Algorithm 1), which gets $z^{(s)}$ as inputs and outputs $z^{(s+1)}$.\nThe following theorem shows that the sequence $\\left\\{z^{(s)}\\right\\}$ enjoys a superlinear convergence in epochs. Furthermore, the required number of iterations in each epoch to achieve such a superlinear rate is only a constant.\nTheorem 4.2 (SC-SC setting). Suppose that Assumptions 3.1 and 3.3 hold.

Regarding the update computational cost, the Schur decomposition with an computational complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{3}\\right)$ is required once every $m$ iterations. After Schur's decomposition has been given at the snapshot point, the dominant part of the update computational complexity is solving the upper-triangular linear system (8) with the back substitution algorithm within the computational complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{2}\\right)$. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\text { Update Computational Cost }=\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(d^{2} \\cdot m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}+d^{3} \\cdot\\left(\\epsilon^{-2 / 3} m^{-1 / 3}+1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nand the total computational cost of LEN is\n\n$$\n\\text { Computational Cost } \\stackrel{(5)}{=}\\left(d^{2}+N\\right) \\cdot m^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}+\\left(d^{3}+N d\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\epsilon^{-2 / 3} m^{-1 / 3}+1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy taking $m=\\Theta(d)$, we obtain the best computational complexity in (10) of LEN, which is formally stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.3 (C-C setting). Under the same setting of Theorem 4.1, Algorithm 3 with $m=\\Theta(d)$ finds an $\\epsilon$-saddle point with computational complexity $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+d^{2 / 3} \\epsilon^{-2 / 3}\\right)\\right.$.\n\nWe also present the total computational complexity of LEN-restart for SC-SC setting.\nCorollary 4.1 (SC-SC setting). Under the same setting as in Theorem 4.2, Algorithm 2 implemented in the same way as Algorithm 3 with $m=\\Theta(d)$ finds an $\\epsilon$-root with computational complexity $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(N+d^{2}\\right)\\left(d+d^{2 / 3} \\kappa^{2 / 3}\\right)\\right.$.\n\nIn both cases, our proposed algorithms improve the total computational cost of the optimal secondorder methods (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012; Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022) by a factor of $d^{1 / 3}$.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: We demonstrate running time v.s. gradient norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\|$ for Problem (11) with different sizes: $n \\in\\{10,100,200\\}$.\n\nRemark 4.1. In the main text, we assume the use of the classical algorithm for matrix inversion/decomposition, which has a computational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d^{3}\\right)$. The fast matrix multiplication proposed by researchers in the field of theoretical computer science only requires a complexity of $d^{\\omega}$, where the best known $\\omega$ is currently around 2.371552 (Williams et al., 2024). This also implies faster standard linear algebra operators including Schur decomposition and matrix inversion (Demmel et al., 2007). However, the large hidden constant factors in these fast matrix multiplication algorithms mean that the matrix dimensions necessary for these algorithms to be superior to classical algorithms are much larger than what current computers can effectively handle. Consequently, these algorithms are not always used in practice. We present the computational complexity of using fast matrix operations in Appendix G.\n\nIn Appendix H, we extend our algorithms to allow inexact auxiliary CRN sub-problem solving and analyze the total complexity. Specifically, we design an efficient sub-procedure (Algorithm 5) to solve the CRN sub-problem to desired accuracy in only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log (1 / \\epsilon))$ number of linear system solving. It tightens the $\\mathcal{O}(\\log (1 / \\epsilon))$ iteration complexity in (Bullins \\& Lai, 2022; Adil et al., 2022).

{"section_id": 11, "text": "# 5.2 Fairness-Aware Machine Learning \n\nWe then examine our algorithm for the task of fairness-aware machine learning. Let $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{a}_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the training set, where $\\boldsymbol{a}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$ denotes the features of the $i$-th sample, $b_{i} \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ is the corresponding label, and $c_{i} \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ is an additional feature that is required to be protected and debiased. For example, $c_{i}$ can denote gender. Zhang et al. (2018) proposed to solve the following minimax problem to mitigate unwanted bias of $c_{i}$ by adversarial learning:\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}} \\max _{y \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell\\left(b_{i} \\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)-\\beta \\ell\\left(c_{i} y \\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)+\\lambda\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|^{2}-\\gamma y^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ell$ is the logit function such that $\\ell(t)=\\log (1+\\exp (-t))$. We set $\\lambda=\\gamma=10^{-4}$ and $\\beta=0.5$. We conduct the experiments on datasets \"heart\" $\\left(n=270, d_{x}=13\\right.$ ) (Chang \\& Lin, 2011), \"adult\" ( $n=32,561, d_{x}=123$ ) (Chang \\& Lin, 2011) and \"law school\" ( $n=20,798, d_{x}=380$ ) (Le Quy et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022). For all the datasets, we choose \"gender\" as the protected feature. For EG, we tune the stepsize in $\\{0.1,0.01,0.001\\}$. For second-order methods (NPE and LEN), as we do not know the value of $\\rho$ in advance, we view it as a hyperparameter and tune it in $\\{1,10,100\\}$. We set $m=10$ for LEN and we find that this simple choice performs well in all the datasets we test. We show the results of the running time against the gradient norm $\\|\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{z})\\|$ in Figure 2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "## 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\n\nIn this paper, we propose LEN and LEN-restart for C-C and SC-SC minimax problems, respectively. Using lazy Hessian updates, our methods improve the computational complexity of the current bestknown second-order methods by a factor of $d^{1 / 3}$. Numerical experiments on both real and synthetic datasets also verify the efficiency of our method.\n\nFor future work, it will be interesting to extend our idea to adaptive second-order methods (Wang et al., 2024a; Doikov et al., 2024; Carmon et al., 2022; Antonakopoulos et al., 2022; Liu \\& Luo, 2022b) and stochastic problems with sub-sampled Newton methods (Lin et al., 2022; Chayti et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2019; Tripuraneni et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Besides, our methods only focus on the convex-concave case, it is also possible to reduce the Hessian oracle for nonconvex-(strongly)-concave problems (Luo et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2024b) or study structured nonconvex-nonconcave problems (Zheng et al., 2024; Diakonikolas et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020; Lee \\& Kim, 2021; Chen \\& Luo, 2024).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nLesi Chen and Jingzhao Zhang are supported by the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute Innovation Program.

To make our result more rigorous, we analyze the inexact LEN (Algorithm 1), which allows inexact sub-problem solving with a parameter $\\alpha \\geq 1$. Note that this algorithm reduces to the exact version (Algorithm 1) when $\\alpha=1$.\n\nBelow, we present the following theorem as the inexact version of Theorem 4.1.\nTheorem H.1.

Therefore, the main goal of this section is to design a sub-procedure that can determine the stepsize $\\eta$ that satisfies (21).\n\nA similar sub-procedure without using lazy Hessian updates has been proposed in (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012). Below, we show that we can use a similar sub-procedure for our algorithm. We recall some useful lemmas in (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012), which holds for any monotone operators A. Below, we state their results when $\\boldsymbol{A}=\\boldsymbol{A}_{t}$.\n\nLemma H. 1 (Lemma 4.3 and Lemma 4.4 (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012)). Recall the definition of $\\phi_{t}$ right after (21). For any $\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the following statements hold:\n\n1. For any $\\eta>0$, we have $\\phi_{t}(\\eta ; \\boldsymbol{z})>0$.\n2.

For any $0<\\beta^{-}<\\beta^{+}$, the set of all scalars $\\eta>0$ satisfying $\\beta^{-} \\leq \\phi_{t}(\\eta ; \\boldsymbol{z}) \\leq \\beta^{+}$is a closed interval $\\left[\\eta^{-}, \\eta^{+}\\right]$such that $\\eta^{+} / \\eta^{-} \\geq \\sqrt{\\beta^{+} / \\beta^{-}}$.\n\nAlgorithm 5 presents our sub-procedure to output the tuple $\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}, \\gamma_{t}\\right)$ satisfying (21). Similar to (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012), the procedure consists of two stages. The first one is a bracketing stage, which either outputs an acceptable solution or an initial interval $\\left[c_{t}^{-}, c_{t}^{+}\\right]$that contains all the $\\eta$ satisfying (21). The second one is a bisection stage, which uses binary search in the logarithmic scale to find a stepsize $\\eta$ satisfying (21). Note that the log-scale binary search would finally lead to a $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log (1 / \\epsilon))$ iteration complexity, which improves the $\\mathcal{O}(\\log (1 / \\epsilon))$ iteration complexity using naive binary search in (Adil et al., 2022; Bullins \\& Lai, 2022).\nOur first result of Algorithm 5 is the correctness of the bracketing stage, stated as follows.\n\n```\nAlgorithm 5 Bracketing/Bisection Procedure \\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}, M, \\alpha, \\eta_{t}^{0}\\right)\\)\n    (Bracketing Stage) Compute \\(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{I}_{d}+\\eta_{t}^{0} \\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\) with one Newton step.\n    (1a) if \\(\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\| \\in\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha M}, \\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\), then let \\(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}=\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}, \\eta_{t}=\\eta_{t}^{0}\\) and go to Line 3.\n    (1b) if \\(\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|<\\frac{1}{\\alpha M}\\), then set \\(c_{t}^{-}=\\eta_{t}^{0}\\) and \\(c_{t}^{+}=\\frac{1}{M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}\\);\n    (1c) if \\(\\eta_{0}^{t}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|>\\frac{1}{M}\\), then set \\(c_{t}^{-}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}\\) and \\(c_{t}^{+}=\\eta_{t}^{0}\\);\n    (Bisection Stage)\n    (2a) set \\(\\eta_{t}=\\sqrt{c_{t}^{-} c_{t}^{+}}\\)and compute \\(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{I}_{d}+\\eta_{t} \\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\) with one Newton step;\n    (2b) if \\(\\eta_{t}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\| \\in\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha M}, \\frac{1}{M}\\right)\\), then go to Line 3;\n    (2c) if \\(\\eta_{t}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|>\\frac{1}{M}\\), then set \\(c_{t}^{+}=\\eta_{t} ;\\) else set \\(c_{t}^{-}=\\eta_{t}\\);\n    (2d) go to step (2a).\n    return \\(\\left(z_{t+1 / 2}, \\gamma_{t}\\right)\\) that meets the requirement of Line 2 in Algorithm 4, where \\(\\gamma_{t}=1 / \\eta_{t} \\).\n```\n\nLemma H.2. Let $\\left[\\eta_{t}^{-}, \\eta_{t}^{+}\\right]$be the interval that contains all the stepsizes satisfying (21). Compute $\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{I}_{d}+\\eta_{t}^{0} \\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)$ with one Newton step as Algorithm 5. The following statements hold:\n\n1. if $\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|<\\frac{1}{\\alpha M}$, then $\\eta_{t}^{0}<\\eta_{t}^{-}$and $\\eta_{t}^{+} \\leq \\frac{1}{M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}$;\n2. if $\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|>\\frac{1}{M}$, then $\\eta_{t}^{+}<\\eta_{t}^{0}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\alpha M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|} \\leq \\eta_{t}^{-}$.\n\nProof. We only prove the first claim since the proof of the second claim follows in a similar manner. Recall the definition of $\\phi_{t}$ right after (21). The condition $\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|<\\frac{1}{\\alpha M}$ is equivalent to $\\phi_{t}\\left(\\eta_{t}^{0} ; \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)<\\phi_{t}\\left(\\eta_{t}^{-} ; \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)$. Firstly. the fact that $\\phi_{t}\\left(\\eta_{t}^{-} ; \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)$ is a strictly increasing function according to the second statement in Lemma H.1, we know that $\\eta_{t}^{0}<\\eta_{t}^{-}$.\n\nSecondly, using the inequality in the second statement of Lemma H.1, we know that\n\n$$\n\\eta_{t}^{+}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|=\\frac{\\eta_{t}^{+}}{\\eta_{t}^{0}} \\phi_{t}\\left(\\eta_{t}^{0} ; \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t}\\left(\\eta_{t}^{+} ; \\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)=\\frac{1}{M}\n$$\n\nwhich implies $\\eta_{t}^{+} \\leq \\frac{1}{M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}$ by rearranging.\n\nTherefore, the bracketing stage can always output an interval that contains the acceptable stepsizes $\\eta$ satisfying (21). Given such a valid initial interval, the bisection stage always find an acceptable stepsize, stated as follows.\nLemma H.3. Consider Algorithm 5. If the bracketing stage outputs an interval $\\left[c_{t}^{-}, c_{t}^{+}\\right]$containing all the stepsizes $\\eta$ satisfying (21), which is then input to the bisection stage, then the number of Newton step during the bisection stage is bounded by $1+\\log \\left(\\log \\left(h_{t}\\right) / \\log \\alpha\\right)$ ), where\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\max \\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\eta_{t}^{0} M\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|}, \\alpha M \\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis the maximal ratio of $c_{t}^{+} / c_{t}^{-}$.\nProof. After $j$ steps of bisection iterations, we have that $\\log \\frac{c_{t}^{+}}{c_{t}^{-}}=\\frac{1}{2^{j}} \\log h_{t}$. In view of the third statement in Lemma H.1, we know that $c_{t}^{+} / c_{t}^{-} \\geq \\sqrt{\\alpha}$. These two inequalities immediately imply that the bisection stage would terminates in $j \\leq 1+\\log \\left(\\log \\left(h_{t}\\right) / \\log \\alpha\\right)$ ) iterations.\n\nOur goal from now on would be giving a uniform upper bound of $h_{t}$ all for $t$, which can imply the total complexity of our algorithm. From the definition of $h_{t}$ in (22), we need to give both lower and upper bounds of $\\eta_{t}^{0}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|$. We recall some technical lemmas in (Monteiro \\& Svaiter, 2012).\n\nLemma H. 4 (Proposition 4.5 Monteiro \\& Svaiter (2012)). Let $\\boldsymbol{A}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be a monotone operator. For a point $\\boldsymbol{z}^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that $\\boldsymbol{A}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right)=0$, for any $\\eta>0$ and $\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ it holds that\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{I}_{d}+\\eta \\boldsymbol{A}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\|,\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{I}_{d}+\\eta \\boldsymbol{A}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\right\\|\\right\\} \\leq\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\|\n$$\n\nFrom now on, we will fix all the $\\eta_{t}^{0}$ in all the iterations such that $\\eta_{t}^{0}=\\bar{\\eta}$ and analyze Algorithm 4. The following lemma shows a uniform upper bound of $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|$.\nLemma H. 5 (Upper bound of $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|$ ). Suppose that Assumption 3.1 and 3.2 hold. Let $\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{*}, \\boldsymbol{y}^{*}\\right)$ be a saddle point. Set $M=3 \\rho m$ as in Theorem 4.1.

Recall the definition of $\\boldsymbol{A}_{t}$ in (19), we know that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{t} & =\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+\\left(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}$ is $\\rho$-Lipschitz continuous.

Therefore, we have that $\\left\\|r_{t}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{5}{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\|^{2}$. Finally, we plug into (25) to obtain the desired upper bound in (23).\n\nNext, we give a uniform lower bound of $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|$.\nLemma H. 6 (Lower bound of $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\|$ ).

We show a contradiction if (26) does not hold. Firstly, if $\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}, \\boldsymbol{y}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)$ is not an $\\epsilon$-solution to the problem, then by Lemma A. 1 and A. 2 we know that $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)\\right\\|$ must be large:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon \\leq \\operatorname{Gap}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}, \\boldsymbol{y}_{t+1 / 2}^{0} ; 3 \\beta\\right) \\leq \\max _{\\boldsymbol{z} \\in \\mathbb{B}_{3 \\sqrt{2} \\beta}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right)}\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right), \\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\right\\rangle \\leq 8 \\beta\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)\\right\\|\n$$\n\nwhere the last step uses that $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right\\| \\leq 2 \\beta$ if (26) does not hold, $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}^{*}\\right\\| \\leq \\beta$ and the triangle inequality. Therefore, we can conclude that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)\\right\\| \\geq \\frac{\\epsilon}{8 \\beta}\n$$\n\nSecondly, from the update of the algorithm, we have that\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}=\\bar{\\eta}\\left(\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThen we further know that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}-z_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right) & \\\\\n=\\bar{\\eta}\\left(\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)\\right) & \\\\\n=\\bar{\\eta}\\left(\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)+\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}\\right)\\right) & \\\\\n+\\bar{\\eta}\\left(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right)-\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{\\pi(t)}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{t+1 / 2}^{0}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{F}$ is $\\rho$-Lipschitz continuous.

Finally, we obtain the following theorem by combining Theorem H. 1 and Theorem H.3.\nTheorem H.2. Suppose that Assumption 3.1 and 3.2 hold.
