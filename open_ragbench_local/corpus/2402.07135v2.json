InTRODUCTION\n\nIn [Art69] and [Art74], Artin established algebraicity criteria of functors and stacks over schemes and these criteria play a central role in moduli problems over schemes. However, recent development in arithmetic geometry shows that certain arithmetically important spaces admit moduli interpretation only in perfect schemes or perfectoid spaces (e.g. [Zhu17], [SW20]). In those cases, moduli problems are formulated as $v$-sheaves. Especially for the construction of integral models, it is important to know whether $v$-sheaf theoretic moduli problems are representable in formal schemes. In this paper, we will tackle this problem and establish a representability criterion in the style of [Art70].\n\nIn [Art70], Artin proved that every formal modification of the completion of a locally Noetherian algebraic space is uniquely algebraizable to its algebraic modification. Our first observation is that the conditions of formal modifications can be roughly translated to the $v$-sheaf theory using the language of [Gle24]. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. As\n\na $v$-sheaf theoretic modification of $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$, we consider a thick prekimberlite $Y$ formally adic over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ with $Y^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ (see Proposition 2.18 for the relation with formal modifications). Here, we say that $Y$ is thick if the specialization map $\\mathrm{sp}_{Y^{\\text {an }}}$ is surjective. Since we do not have control over deperfections of $Y^{\\text {red }}-\\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\mathrm{sp}_{Y^{\\text {an }}}\\right)$, this assumption on $Y$ is essential.\n\nWe prove the representability of $Y$ by additionally assuming the existence of a nice equivariant profinite perfectoid cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ of $R$ and the representability of $Y$ over the perfectoid colimit $R_{\\infty}$. In Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, we introduce the axioms of $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ and simply call $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ a (very) good cover of $R$. The construction of good covers is inspired by [BS22, Remark 3.11], but the notable difference is the existence of a profinite group action of $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ on $R_{\\infty}$. Identifying the complicated axioms of good covers is one essential part of the proof of our representability criterion. The main source of formal schemes admitting good covers is the completion of smooth schemes (see Remark 5.10). In Section 5.5, we discuss how wide the class of $p$-adic formal schemes admitting good covers is. The difficulty in obtaining examples other than $p$-adic smooth formal schemes lies in the condition (unifsec) in Section 5.2. This question is strongly related to how wide the class of sousperfectoid affinoids is (see [HK22]).\n\nIn Section 4, we extend the definition of $p$-adic perfectoid formal schemes introduced in [RC21] and study the basic properties of perfectoid formal schemes. The affine building block of perfectoid formal schemes is a perfectoid ring with a complete linear topology of a finitely generated ideal containing $p$. This notion is equivalent to perfectoid rings in the sense of Gabber-Romero (see [GR18, Definition 16.3.1]), but we call it a complete adic perfectoid ring to clarify the terminology. By construction, $R_{\\infty}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring, and the representability of $Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is way easier to verify than that of $Y$.\n\nNow, we state a form of our representability criterion.\nTheorem 1. (Corollary 5.43) Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring admitting a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$. Let $Y$ be a thick prekimberlite formally adic over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ with $Y^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong$ $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. Suppose that $Y^{\\text {red }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{\\text {red }}$ and $Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is representable by a perfectoid formal scheme adic over $R_{\\infty}$. Then, $Y$ is representable by a unique proper formal $R$-scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover with $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\n\nThe notion of maximal good covers is introduced in Section 5.4. The existence of maximal good covers ensures the uniqueness of $\\mathfrak{Y}$ (see Lemma 5.33) and $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is automatically reduced and distinguished (in the sense of [FK18]). The proof is essentially reduced to the affine case proved in Theorem 5.19. The construction of (affine open formal subschemes of) $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is easy to describe as in Corollary 5.28, and the essential difficulties lie in verifying the desired properties of $\\mathfrak{Y}$. In Proposition 2.11, we prove a finiteness criterion needed to prove the finiteness of $\\mathfrak{Y}$. In Section 3.3, we study geometric quotients of $v$-sheaves by (pro)finite groups, and we use the theory to show that $\\mathfrak{Y}$ represents $Y$.\n\nAnother form of our representability criterion is Proposition 5.44, which deals with the case where $R$ is $p$-adic and $Y^{\\text {an }}$ is finite \u00e9tale over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. As an arithmetic application, we expect that this criterion enables us to study moduli spaces of level structures on local shtukas. In this paper, we only deal with parahoric level structures on local shtukas. In our forthcoming work, we will study depth-zero integral models of local Shimura varieties by studying depth-zero level structures using Proposition 5.44.\n\nLet $F$ be a non-archimedean local field over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ and let $O_{F}$ be the ring of integers of $F$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$ and let $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$ be a morphism of parahoric group schemes of $G$ over $O_{F}$. Let $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}$ (resp. $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}}$ ) be the $v$-stack over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$ of local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtukas (resp. local $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-shtukas). For a $v$-sheaf $X$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$, we say that a map $X \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$ is a local shtuka over $X_{/ O_{F}}$. As an application of Proposition 5.44, we obtain the following representability of moduli spaces of parahoric level structures.\n\nTheorem 2. (Theorem 6.13) Let $R$ be a reduced excellent $p$-adically complete $O_{F}$-algebra admitting a good cover and let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)_{/ O_{F}}$. The $v$-closure of the generic fiber in $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is representable by a unique proper $p$-adic formal $R$-scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover with $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\eta}$ finite \u00e9tale over $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)_{\\eta}$.\n\nThanks to the characterization by Scholze-Weinstein and Pappas-Rapoport, it has direct applications to integral models of local and global Shimura varieties. For local Shimura varieties, we can show the local representability of integral models of local Shimura varieties under hyperspecial levels (see Theorem 6.15) by using the result at hyperspecial levels (see [Bar22], [Ito22]). As a byproduct, we show the representability of $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagrams, modified from [PR24, Section 4.9.3], under hyperspecial levels, but this approach does not enable us to prove the basic properties of local model diagrams (see Proposition 6.19). For global Shimura varieties, we can construct integral models of Shimura varieties under hyperspecial levels as algebraic spaces from those at hyperspecial levels (see Theorem 6.20). We verify that they satisfy the axiom of canonicality in [PR24] and are equal to canonical integral models if they exist.\n1.1. The structure of the paper. In Section 2, we explain the basic properties of (reduced excellent) adic spaces and prove a finiteness criterion needed in the proof of Theorem 5.19. In Section 3, we review the $v$-sheaf theory and study geometric quotients of $v$-sheaves. In Section 4, we introduce perfectoid formal schemes and show the basic properties. In Section 5, we introduce (very) good covers and establish our main representability criterion. In Section 6, we study moduli spaces of parahoric level structures on local shtukas as an application of our representability criterion.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Preliminaries on adic spaces \n\n2.1. General properties. In this section, we introduce our notation and explain the basic properties of adic spaces.\n\nAn adic ring $R$ is a topological ring endowed with a linear topology of a finitely generated ideal $I \\subset R$. When $R$ is complete, we say that $R$ is a complete adic ring. If we like to emphasize the topology on $R$, we say that $R$ is a (complete) $I$-adic ring. The set of topologically nilpotent elements in $R$ is denoted by $R^{\\infty}$ and $R / R^{\\infty}$ is denoted by $R_{\\text {red }}$.\n\nFor an affinoid pair $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$, which is usually called a Huber pair, we have a topological space $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$and a structural presheaf $\\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}$with a subpresheaf $\\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}^{+} \\subset$ $\\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}$introduced in [Hub93] and [Hub94]. When $\\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}$is a sheaf, we say that $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is an adic space. For every open subset $U \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right), \\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}(U)$ (resp. $\\left.\\mathcal{O}_{\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)}^{+} \\right)$is simply denoted by $\\mathcal{O}(U)$ (resp. $\\left.\\mathcal{O}^{+}(U)\\right)$. The set of topologically nilpotent elements in $\\mathcal{O}(U)$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}(U)$.\n\nA rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is defined for every elements $s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\in$ $A$ such that $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}$ generate an open ideal of $A$. The set of rational subdomains forms an open basis of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$. There is a universal affinoid pair $\\left(A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$such that $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is homeomorphic to $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right)$. When $s$ is topologically nilpotent, $\\left(A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is Tate. In this paper, a rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right)$ is called Tate if $s$ is topologically nilpotent.\n\nWhen $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)=(R, R)$ for a complete adic ring $R, \\operatorname{Spa}(R, R)$ is simply denoted by $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)$. The set of analytic points in $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)$ is a quasicompact open subset of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)$ and denoted by $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. The analytic locus $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is empty if and only if $R$ is discrete (see e.g. [Wed12, Proposition 7.49 (2)]).\n\nLemma 2.1. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring and let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in R$ be topologically nilpotent elements. If for every $|\\cdot| \\in \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$, we have $\\left|f_{i}\\right| \\neq 0$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq r$, then $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$ generate an ideal of definition of $R$.\n\nProof. Let $I=\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right) \\subset R$ and let $\\bar{I}$ be the closure of $I$. Then, $R / \\bar{I}$ is a complete adic ring. By assumption, $\\operatorname{Spa}(R / \\bar{I})^{\\text {an }}$ is empty, so $R / \\bar{I}$ is discrete and $\\bar{I}$ is open. Since $R$ has a finitely generated ideal of definition, it follows from a standard argument that $I$ is open.\nLemma 2.2. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring. Every Tate rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right) \\subset$ $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ can be taken so that $s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\in R$ generate an ideal of definition.\nProof. Since $\\left(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right) \\subset R$ is open, we can take a finitely generated ideal of definition $I \\subset\\left(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right)^{2}$ of $R$. It is easy to see that $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right)=R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{s}, s T_{1}, \\ldots, s T_{s}}{s^{2}}\\right)$ for any finite set of generators $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{s} \\in I$. The claim follows since $s$ is topologically nilpotent.\nLemma 2.3. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring and let $U \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ be a quasicompact open subset. There is a generator $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ of an ideal of definition of $R$ such that $U=$ $\\bigcup_{1 \\leq i \\leq r} R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right)$ for some $1 \\leq r \\leq n$.\nProof. This can be proved in the same way as [Bos14, \u00a78.4, Lemma 5]. Since $U$ is quasicompact, we can take a finite covering of $U$ by Tate rational subdomains $R\\left(\\frac{T_{i, 1}, \\ldots, T_{i, r_{i}}}{s_{i}}\\right)$ indexed by $i \\in I$. We may assume that $s_{i}, T_{i, 1}, \\ldots, T_{i, r_{i}} \\in R$ generate an ideal of definition for all $i \\in I$. Then, for every $i \\in I, \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is covered by $R\\left(\\frac{s_{i}, T_{i, 1}, \\ldots, T_{i, r_{i}}}{s_{i}}\\right)$ with $a_{i} \\in\\left\\{s_{i}, T_{i, 1}, \\ldots, T_{i, r_{i}}\\right\\}$.\n\nConsider the intersection of these coverings of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. Let $F \\subset R$ be the collection of elements of $R$ of the form $\\prod_{i \\in I} a_{i}$ with $a_{i} \\in\\left\\{s_{i}, T_{i, 1}, \\ldots, T_{i, r_{i}}\\right\\}$. Let $F_{0} \\subset F$ be the subset consisting of elements $\\prod_{i \\in I} a_{i}$ with $a_{i}=s_{i}$ for some $i \\in I$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is covered by $R\\left(\\frac{F}{I}\\right)$ with $f \\in F$ and $U$ is covered by $R\\left(\\frac{F}{I}\\right)$ with $f \\in F_{0}$. Thus, we obtain the claim.\n2.2. Adic spectra of reduced excellent complete adic rings. In this section, we explain the basic properties of adic spectra of reduced excellent complete adic rings.\n\nLet $R$ be a Noetherian complete adic ring. By [Hub94], Spa $(R)$ is an adic space. For every Tate rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$, the rational localization $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right)$ admits a Noetherian ring of definition, such as the $s$-adic completion of $R\\left[\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right]$. In particular, $R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right\\rangle$ is a strongly Noetherian Tate ring. If we assume in addition that $R$ is reduced and excellent, we can prove more properties of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$.\nLemma 2.4. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring. For every Tate rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right\\rangle$ is reduced and uniform. In particular, $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is stably uniform.\nProof. Since $R$ is excellent, $R\\left[\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right]$ is excellent and its integral closure $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right)^{+}$in the reduced ring $R\\left[\\frac{1}{s}\\right]$ is finite over $R\\left[\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right]$ (see [Mat80, Theorem 78], [Stacks, Tag 03GH]). In particular, $R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$is equal to the $s$-adic completion of $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}}{s}\\right)^{+}$, so it is reduced and bounded (see [Mat80, Theorem 79]).\nProposition 2.5. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. The topological ring $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is $I$-adic and finite over $R$.\n\nProof. Let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ be a generator of $I$. Let $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ be the blowup along $V(I)$. The morphism $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(I) \\rightarrow Y$ is affine. Let $Y^{+} \\rightarrow Y$ be the normalization of $Y$ in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(I)$. Since $R$ is reduced and excellent, $Y^{+} \\rightarrow Y$ is finite. For each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, let $V_{i} \\subset Y$ be the open subset where $f_{i}$ divides $f_{j}$ for every $1 \\leq j \\leq n$ and let $V_{i}^{+}$be the inverse image of $V_{i}$ in $Y^{+}$. Now, $V_{i}$ and $V_{i}^{+}$is affine and the proof of Lemma 2.4 shows that the $I$-adic completion of $V_{i}^{+}$is isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1}, \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$. In particular, $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong \\lim _{k \\geq 0} \\Gamma\\left(Y^{+} \\otimes_{R}\\left(R / I^{k}\\right), \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ as topological rings. Since $Y^{+}$is proper over $R$, it follows from the formal function theorem (see e.g. [EGA3-1, Corollaire 4.1.7]) that $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is $I$-adic and finite over $R$.\n\nLemma 2.6. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. Let $f \\in R$ be an arbitrary element and let $R^{\\prime}=R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$. If $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is a homeomorphism onto the image and the image contains $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right)$, then the same properties hold for $R^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. We keep the notation in the proof of Proposition 2.5. We have $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong$ $\\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$. Let $Y^{+}$,red be the reduction of $Y^{+} \\otimes_{R}(R / I)$. Then, $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right)$ is isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\operatorname{red}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)\\right)$. Since Zariski localization preserves normalization, it follows from the same argument that $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong \\lim _{k \\geq 0} \\Gamma\\left(Y^{+} \\otimes_{R}\\left(R^{\\prime} / I^{k}\\right), \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ as topological rings. By the formal function theorem, we have $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong \\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ where $(-)^{\\wedge}$ denotes the $I$-adic completion. Since $R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]$ is Noetherian and $\\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ is finite over $R, \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\otimes_{R} R^{\\prime}$. Since $R \\rightarrow R^{\\prime}$ is flat, we see that $R^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is injective.\n\nIt is enough to show that the image contains $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right)$. Since $R^{\\prime}=R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$, $Y^{+}$,red $\\otimes_{R} R^{\\prime}$ is reduced. Thus, we see that $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\otimes_{R} R^{\\prime} \\rightarrow\\right.$ $\\left.\\Gamma\\left(Y^{+}, \\operatorname{red} \\otimes_{R} R^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right) \\otimes_{R} R^{\\prime}$ as $R^{\\prime}$ is flat over $R$. Thus, the claim follows since the image of $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$contains $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nNext, we explain the normality of reduced excellent analytic adic spaces.\nDefinition 2.7. A Tate affinoid pair $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is reduced and excellent if $A^{+}$is reduced, excellent and bounded. If $A$ is moreover normal, $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is normal and excellent.\n\nNote that $A^{+}$is also normal if $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is normal and excellent.\nLemma 2.8. Let $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$be a reduced excellent Tate affinoid pair. Any rational localization $\\left(B, B^{+}\\right)$of $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is reduced and excellent.\nProof. We may write $\\left(B, B^{+}\\right)=\\left(A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$for $s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\in A^{\\infty}$. As in Lemma 2.4, let $A\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right)^{+}$be the integral closure of $A^{+}\\left[\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]$ in $A\\left[\\frac{1}{s}\\right]$. Since $A^{+}$is excellent and $A\\left[\\frac{1}{s}\\right]$ is reduced and of finite type over $A^{+}, A\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right)^{+}$is finite over $A^{+}\\left[\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]$. As in Lemma 2.4, we see that $B^{+}$is reduced, excellent and bounded.\n\nLemma 2.9. Let $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$be a reduced excellent Tate affinoid pair. Let $\\left\\{\\left(B_{i}, B_{i}^{+}\\right)\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ be a finite set of rational localizations of $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$such that $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)=\\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(B_{i}, B_{i}^{+}\\right)$. Then, $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$is normal if and only if $\\left(B_{i}, B_{i}^{+}\\right)$is normal for every $i \\in I$.\n\nProof. By [Hub96, Lemma 1.7.6], $A \\rightarrow \\prod_{i \\in I} B_{i}$ is faithfully flat, so $A$ is normal if $B_{i}$ is normal for every $i \\in I$ by [Mat80, Corollary 21.3]. On the other hand, suppose that $A$ is normal and let $\\left(B_{i}, B_{i}^{+}\\right)=\\left(A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$for $s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\in A^{\\infty}$. Since $A\\left[\\frac{1}{s}\\right]$ is normal, $A\\left(\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right)^{+}$is normal and excellent. Thus, $A\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}, \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$is normal by [Mat80, Theorem 79], so $B_{i}$ is normal.\n\nCorollary 2.10. Let $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$be a reduced excellent Tate affinoid pair. Let $\\left(B, B^{+}\\right)$be a Tate affinoid pair \u00e9tale over $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$. Then, $B$ is reduced, and $B$ is normal if $A$ is normal.\nProof. By Lemma 2.9, we may localize $\\left(B, B^{+}\\right)$so that $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(B, B^{+}\\right)$is decomposed into a finite \u00e9tale homomorphism and a rational localization. By [SGA1, Expose I, Theorem 9.5 (i)], \u00e9tale homomorphisms preserve reducedness and normality, so the claim follows.\n\nWe say that an analytic adic space is reduced (resp. normal) and excellent if it is analytic locally isomorphic to the adic spectrum of a reduced (resp. normal) and excellent Tate affinoid pair. By the proof of Lemma 2.4, $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is reduced and excellent for every reduced excellent complete adic ring $R$.\n2.3. Finiteness criterion. The aim of this section is to prove the following finiteness criterion. It is a key ingredient in our affine representability criterion (see Theorem 5.19).\n\nFor a complete adic ring $R$ with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$, we say that a complete $I$-adic $R$-algebra $S$ is topologically of finite type if $S / I S$ is of finite type over $R / I$.\n\nProposition 2.11. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$. Let $U \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ be a quasicompact open subset and let $S \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}(U)$ be an $R$-subalgebra. Suppose that the following conditions hold.\n(1) The subspace topology on $S$ from $\\mathcal{O}^{+}(U)$ is the I-adic topology.\n(2) $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is a homeomorphism onto $U$.\n(3) $\\left(S_{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$.\n\nThen, $S$ is reduced, excellent and topologically of finite type over $R$, and $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow U$ is an isomorphism of adic spaces.\n\nNote that the condition (1) is necessary by Proposition 2.5 and the conditions (2) and (3) can be checked after the $v$-sheafification.\n\nBy Lemma 2.3, we can take a generator $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ of an ideal of definition such that $U$ is the union of $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}, \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right)$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq r$ for some $1 \\leq r \\leq n$. We may assume that $I=\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right)$. We keep the notation from the proof of Proposition 2.5. Let $Y_{0} \\subset Y$ (resp. $Y_{0}^{+} \\subset Y^{+}$) be the union of $V_{i}$ (resp. $V_{i}^{+}$) with $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. Then, the $I$-adic completion of $Y_{0}^{+}$ is a formal model of $U$.\n\nBy the condition (2), we have $\\left|f_{i}\\right| \\neq 0$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq r$ for every $\\left|-\\right| \\in \\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$. Thus, $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$ generate an ideal of definition of $S$ by Lemma 2.1. Let $Z \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(S)$ be the blowup along $V\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right)$ and let $Z^{+} \\rightarrow Z$ be the normalization in $\\operatorname{Spec}(S)-V\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right) \\rightarrow Z$. For each $1 \\leq i \\leq r$, let $W_{i} \\subset Z$ be the open subset where $f_{i}$ divides $f_{j}$ for every $1 \\leq j \\leq r$ and let $W_{i}^{+}$be the inverse image of $W_{i}$ in $Z^{+}$.\nLemma 2.12. There is a natural morphism $W_{i}^{+} \\rightarrow V_{i}^{+}$for every $1 \\leq i \\leq r$.\nProof. By construction, $W_{i}$ and $W_{i}^{+}$is the spectrum of $S\\left[\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{r}}{f_{i}}\\right]$ and $S\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{r}}{f_{i}}\\right)^{+}$, respectively. It is enough to show that $f_{j} / f_{i} \\in S\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{r}}{f_{i}}\\right)^{+}$for every $1 \\leq j \\leq n$. Since the rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{r}}{f_{i}}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$ maps to $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ by the condition (2), we have a continuous homomorphism $R\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right\\rangle \\rightarrow S\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right\\rangle$. Thus, $f_{j} / f_{i} \\in S\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right\\rangle^{+}$. Since $S\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right\\rangle^{+}$is the completion of $S\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{r}}{f_{i}}\\right)^{+}$, we have $f_{j} / f_{i} \\in S\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots . f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right)^{+}$.\n\nBy gluing these morphisms, we get an affine morphism $Z^{+} \\rightarrow Y_{0}^{+}$. Let $Z_{0}^{+}$be the schemetheoretic image of $Z^{+} \\rightarrow Z \\times Y_{0}^{+}$. Since $Z^{+}$is integral over $Z$ and $Y^{+}$is of finite type over $R, Z_{0}^{+}$is finite over $Z$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}$(resp. $\\mathfrak{Z}_{0}^{+}$) be the $\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right)$-adic completion of $Y_{0}^{+}$(resp. $Z_{0}^{+}$). Since $S \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}(U)$, we have a morphism $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(S)$. We have the following commutative diagram.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nLemma 2.13. The underlying map $\\left|\\mathfrak{Z}_{0}^{+}\\right| \\rightarrow\\left|\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}\\right|$is surjective.\nProof. By construction, $Y_{0}^{+}$is $I$-torsion free, so the specialization map of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}$is surjective (see [FK18, Proposition 3.1.5]). Since the specialization map is functorial, it is enough to show that $\\left(\\mathfrak{Z}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is surjective (see Section 3.2 for the specialization maps of formal schemes over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ ). Since $Y_{0}^{+}$(resp. $Z_{0}^{+}$) is finite over $Y_{0}$ (resp. $Z$ ), it follows from the construction that $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{\\text {an }} \\cong U$ and $\\left(\\mathfrak{Z}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$. Thus, the claim follows from the condition (2).\n\nSince $Z_{0}^{+}$is proper over $\\operatorname{Spec}(S)$, we see that $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(S)$ is universally closed.\nNow, since $\\left(S_{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$, we can take a homomorphism $P=R\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{m}\\right] \\rightarrow S$ such that $\\operatorname{Spec}(S / I S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(P / I P)$ is universally closed. Then, for every $k \\geq 0$, the composition $Y_{0}^{+} \\otimes_{R}\\left(R / I^{k}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(S / I^{k} S\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(P / I^{k} P\\right)$ is proper. Since $R$ is Noetherian, it follows that $\\Gamma\\left(Y_{0}^{+} \\otimes_{R}\\left(R / I^{k}\\right), \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ is finite over $P$.\n\nLet $S_{k} \\subset \\Gamma\\left(Y_{0}^{+} \\otimes_{R}\\left(R / I^{k}\\right), \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ be the image of $S$. Since $P$ is Noetherian, $S_{k}$ is also finite over $P$. Let $I_{k}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(S \\rightarrow S_{k}\\right)$. The condition (1) means that the subspace topology on $S$, which is defined by the system $\\left\\{I_{k}\\right\\}$, is equal to the $I$-adic topology. Thus, for sufficiently\n\nlarge $k$, we have $I_{k} \\subset I S$, so $S / I S$ is finite over $P$. In particular, $S$ is topologically of finite type over $R$.\n\nBy Lemma 2.4, $\\mathcal{O}^{+}(U)$ is reduced, so $S$ is reduced and excellent. In particular, $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$ is an adic space. Since $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong U$, the analytification of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{+} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(S)$ gives a right inverse to $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow U$. Since $\\left(\\mathfrak{Z}_{0}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$, it is also a left inverse. Thus, we get $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\cong U$.\n2.4. Formal modifications. In this section, we explain an interpretation of formal modifications (see [Stacks, Tag 0GDK]) of reduced excellent formal schemes in terms of adic spaces.\n\nThe axiom of formal modifications consists of properness, rig-\u00e9taleness (see [Stacks, Tag 0ALP]) and rig-surjectivity (see [Stacks, Tag 0AQQ]). First, we treat properness and rigsurjectivity. Recall that a morphism of formal schemes is proper if it is topologically of finite type, separated and universally closed. We say that a formal scheme is thick if its specialization map is surjective (see Section 3.2).\n\nLemma 2.14. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a thick separated formal scheme topologically of finite type over $R$. If $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is an isomorphism, $\\mathfrak{X}$ is proper and rig-surjective over $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ and $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{X} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)} \\mathfrak{X}$ is rig-surjective.\n\nProof. Let $\\left\\{\\mathfrak{U}_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ be a finite affine covering of $\\mathfrak{X}$. As in Lemma 2.3, we can take a set of generators $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ of an ideal of definition such that for every $1 \\leq j \\leq n, R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{j}}\\right)$ is contained in $\\mathfrak{U}_{i}^{\\text {an }}$ for some $i \\in I$.\n\nWe repeat the construction in the proof of Proposition 2.5 for this choice of $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$. For each $1 \\leq j \\leq n$, let $i_{j} \\in I$ be an element such that $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{j}}\\right) \\subset \\mathfrak{U}_{i_{j}}^{\\text {an }}$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}^{+}$(resp. $\\mathfrak{V}_{j}^{+}$) be the $I$-adic completion of $Y^{+}$(resp. $V_{j}^{+}$). By the property of $\\mathfrak{V}_{j}^{+}$, this inclusion extends to $\\mathfrak{V}_{j}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{U}_{i_{j}}$ and the composition $\\mathfrak{V}_{j}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{U}_{i_{j}} \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$ is independent of the choice of $i_{j}$. Thus, by gluing the morphisms for all $1 \\leq j \\leq n$, we get a morphism $\\mathfrak{Y}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$. Since $\\mathfrak{X}$ is thick and $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}^{+}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$, we see by looking at the specialization maps that $\\left|\\mathfrak{Y}^{+}\\right| \\rightarrow|\\mathfrak{X}|$ is surjective. Since $Y^{+}$is proper over $R$, it follows that $\\mathfrak{X}$ is proper.\n\nNext, we prove rig-surjectivity. It is enough to show that for every adic morphism $x_{0}: \\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $V$ a complete discrete valuation ring, there is a unique lift $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$. Let $K=\\operatorname{Frac}(V)$. Since $x_{0}$ is adic, we have $x_{0}^{\\text {an }}: \\operatorname{Spa}(K, V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }} \\cong$ $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$. Thus, $x_{0}^{\\text {an }}$ factors through $\\mathfrak{U}_{i}^{\\text {an }}$ for some $i \\in I$. Since $\\mathfrak{U}_{i}$ is affine, $x_{0}^{\\text {an }}$ uniquely lifts to $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{U}_{i}$ and we get a desired lift of $x_{0}$. It is easy to see that such a lift is independent of the choice of $\\mathfrak{U}_{i}$, so we get the uniqueness of a lift of $x_{0}$.\n\nNext, we treat rig-\u00e9taleness. Here, we can only deal with the monogeneous case due to essential technical difficulty.\n\nLemma 2.15. Let $R$ be a Noetherian complete adic ring with the $\\varpi$-adic topology for $\\varpi \\in$ $R$. Let $S$ be a $\\varpi$-torsion free complete adic $R$-algebra topologically of finite type. Then, $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is \u00e9tale if and only if $R \\rightarrow S$ is rig-\u00e9tale.\n\nProof. First, suppose that $R \\rightarrow S$ is rig-\u00e9tale. By [Stacks, Tag 0AKG], there is a finite type $R$-algebra $S_{0}$ such that $S_{0}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$ is \u00e9tale over $R\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$ and $\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge} \\cong S$. It follows from [Hub96, Corollary 1.7.3 (iii)] that $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is \u00e9tale.\n\nNext, suppose that $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is \u00e9tale. By [Hub96, Corollary 1.7.3 (iii)], there is a finite type $R$-algebra $S_{0}$ such that $S_{0}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$ is \u00e9tale over $R\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$ and $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is isomorphic to the integral closure of $\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ in $\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$. Since $S$ is topologically of finite type over $R$ and is a subring of $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$as $S$ is $\\varpi$-torsion free, we may enlarge $S_{0}$ in $S_{0}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$ so that $\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ contains $S$. We will show that there is a finite type $R$-subalgebra $S_{1} \\subset S_{0}$ such that $\\left(S_{1}\\right)^{\\wedge} \\cong S$.\n\nSince $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is also the integral closure of $S$ in $S\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right],\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ is finite over $S$. In particular, for sufficiently large $n \\geq 0$, we have $\\varpi^{n}\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge} \\subset S$. Let $A \\subset S_{0} / \\varpi^{n} S_{0}$ be the image of $S \\rightarrow\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow S_{0} / \\varpi^{n} S_{0}$ and let $S_{1} \\subset S_{0}$ be the inverse image of $A$. Then, $S_{0} / \\varpi^{n} S_{0}$ is finite over $A$, so $S_{0}$ is finite over $S_{1}$. Since $S_{0}$ is of finite type over $R$ and $R$ is Noetherian, $S_{1}$ is of finite type over $R$. By construction, we see that $\\left(S_{1}\\right)^{\\wedge} \\subset\\left(S_{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ is equal to $S$. Thus, $R \\rightarrow S$ is rig-\u00e9tale by [Stacks, Tag 0AKG].\n\nThe following lemmas are needed to compare conditions on rig-points with those on analytic points.\n\nLemma 2.16. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a Noetherian formal scheme. For every nonempty open subset $U \\subset \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$, there is a complete discrete valuation ring $V$ with an adic morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$ such that $\\operatorname{Spa}(K, V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$ factors through $U$ where $K=\\operatorname{Frac}(V)$.\nProof. We may assume that $\\mathfrak{X}$ is affine. Let $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$. Since $U$ is nonempty, there is a set of generators $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ of an ideal of definition such that $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{1}}\\right)$ is nonempty and contained in $U$ (cf. Lemma 2.3). By replacing $R$ by $R\\left[\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{1}}\\right]^{\\wedge}$, we may assume that $U=\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. It is enough to show that there is an adic morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $V$ a complete discrete valuation ring.\n\nSince $R$ is $I$-adically complete, there is a point $x \\in V(I) \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ that lies in the closure of $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(I) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. By applying [Stacks, Tag 0CM2] to $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(I) \\hookrightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$, we see that there is a discrete valuation $R$-algebra $V$ such that $\\operatorname{Spec}(V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ sends the closed point to $x$ and the generic point to a point outside $V(I)$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(V^{\\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is an adic morphism where $V^{\\wedge}$ is the completion of $V$.\n\nLemma 2.17. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a Noetherian formal scheme. For every quasicompact open immersion $U \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$ with $U \\neq \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$, there is a complete discrete valuation ring $V$ with an adic morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$ such that $\\operatorname{Spa}(K, V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}$ does not factor through $U$ where $K=\\operatorname{Frac}(V)$.\n\nProof. We may assume that $\\mathfrak{X}$ is affine. Let $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$. By Lemma 2.3, there is a set of generators $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R$ of an ideal of definition such that $U$ is the union of $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right)$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq r$ for some $1 \\leq r \\leq n$. Let $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ be the blowup along $V\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right)$ and let $V_{i} \\subset Y$ be the open subset where $f_{i}$ divides $f_{j}$ for every $1 \\leq j \\leq n$. Let $Y_{0} \\subset Y$ be the union of $V_{i}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ (resp. $\\mathfrak{Y}_{0}, \\mathfrak{V}_{i}$ ) be the $\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right)$-adic completion of $Y$ (resp. $\\left.Y_{0}, V_{i}\\right)$. We have $\\mathfrak{V}_{i}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong R\\left(\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{n}}{f_{i}}\\right)$ and $U \\cong \\mathfrak{Y}_{0}^{\\mathrm{an}}$. Since $U \\neq \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}, Y_{0} \\neq Y$. Since $Y$ is proper over $R$, the image of $Y-Y_{0} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is a nonempty closed subset, so there is a point $y \\in Y-Y_{0}$ whose image in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ lies in $V\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right)$. As in the proof of Lemma 2.16, there is an adic morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}$ such that the closed point maps to $y$. By looking at the specialization map, we see that $\\operatorname{Spa}(K, V) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ does not factor through $U$.\n\nProposition 2.18. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with the $\\varpi$-adic topology for $\\varpi \\in R$. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a thick separated formal scheme topologically of finite type over $R$. Then, $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is a formal modification if and only if $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nProof. First, suppose that $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an isomorphism. Then, $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is proper, rig-\u00e9tale and rig-surjective by Lemma 2.14 and Lemma 2.15. Moreover, $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)} \\mathfrak{X}$ is rig-surjective by Lemma 2.14. Thus, $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is a formal modification.\n\nNext, suppose that $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is a formal modification. By Lemma 2.15, $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is \u00e9tale. By [Hub96, Proposition 1.6.8], the diagonal $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}} \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an open immersion. Since $\\mathfrak{X}$ is separated, $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ is separated (see [Glc24, Proposition 4.17]) and $\\left|\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}\\right| \\rightarrow$ $\\left|\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}} \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}\\right|$ is a closed immersion by [Sch17, Lemma 15.6]. Thus, $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}}$ $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a closed and open immersion. By Lemma 2.16, the rig-surjectivity of $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)} \\mathfrak{X}$ implies $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}} \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an isomorphism. Since $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is \u00e9tale, it follows that $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an open immersion. Moreover, since $\\mathfrak{X}$ is topologically of finite type over $R, \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a quasicompact open immersion.

THE THEORY OF $v$-SHEAVES AND KIMBERLITES \n\n3.1. Basic facts on $v$-sheaves. In this section, we review the theory of $v$-sheaves developed in [Sch17] and [AGLR22].\n\nLet Perf be the category of perfectoid spaces over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. The $v$-topology is a Grothendieck topology on Perf introduced in [Sch17, Definition 8.1]. A sheaf (resp. stack) on Perf with the $v$-topology is called a $v$-sheaf (resp. $v$-stack). Via the Yoneda embedding, perfectoid spaces can be regarded as $v$-sheaves.\n\nA $v$-sheaf $X$ is small if there is a surjection $Y \\rightarrow X$ of $v$-sheaves from a perfectoid space $Y$. Moreover, $X$ is quasicompact if we can take $Y$ to be quasicompact. Then, quasicompact maps and quasiseparated maps of $v$-sheaves can be defined (see [Sch17, Section 8]).\n\nA map of $v$-sheaves is said to be qcqs if it is quasicompact and quasiseparated. An important property of $v$-sheaves is that injectivity and surjectivity of qcqs maps can be checked on geometric points (see [Sch17, Lemma 12.11, Proposition 12.15]). The underlying space of a $v$-sheaf $X$ is denoted by $|X|$ ([Sch17, Proposition 12.7]). For a topological space $T$, the functor sending $S \\in \\operatorname{Perf}$ to the set of continuous maps from $|S|$ to $T$ is a $v$-sheaf and denoted by $\\underline{T}$ ([Sch17, p.53]). For example, these properties are used in the following way.\n\nLemma 3.1. Let $S$ be a $v$-sheaf and let $X$ and $Y$ be $v$-sheaves over $S$. Let $f, g: X \\rightarrow Y$ be two maps of $v$-sheaves over $S$. If $X$ is small, $Y$ is quasiseparated over $S$, and $f(x)=g(x)$ for every $x \\in X\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$with $C$ an algebraically closed perfectoid field with an open and bounded valuation subring $C^{+} \\subset C$, we have $f=g$.\n\nProof. The diagonal $\\Delta_{Y / S}: Y \\rightarrow Y \\times_{S} Y$ is a quasicompact injection. It is enough to show that $f \\times g: X \\rightarrow Y \\times_{S} Y$ factors through $\\Delta_{Y / S}$. Let $Z=X \\times_{Y \\times_{S} Y, \\Delta_{Y / S}} Y$. Since the map $Z \\rightarrow X$ is quasicompact and $X$ is small, $Z$ is small. For every $x \\in X\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$as above, we have $f(x)=g(x)$, so $x$ lies in $Z$. In particular, $|Z| \\rightarrow|X|$ is surjective, so the claim follows from [Sch17, Lemma 12.11].\n\nLet $X$ be a small $v$-sheaf and let $Y$ be a subsheaf of $X$. The intersection of all closed subsheaves of $X$ containing $Y$ is called the $v$-closure of $Y$ in $X$ and denoted by $Y^{\\text {cl }}$ (see [AGLR22, Definition 2.2]). Every closed subsheaf of a small $v$-sheaf $X$ is of the form $\\underline{S} \\times_{\\underline{|X|}} X$ with $S \\subset|X|$ a weakly generalizing closed subspace (see [AGLR22, Definition 2.3, Lemma 2.7]). Moreover, for a subsheaf $Y \\subset X$, we have $Y^{\\text {cl }}=\\underline{|Y|}^{\\text {wge }} \\times_{\\underline{|X|}} X$ with $|Y|^{\\text {wge }}$ the weakly generalizing closure of $|Y|$ in $|X|$ (see [AGLR22, Proposition 2.8]).\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The functor taking $S \\in \\operatorname{Perf}$ to the set of pairs $\\left(\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right), f: S^{\\sharp} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {ad }}\\right)$ with $\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right)$ an untilt of $S$ is a $v$-sheaf and denoted by $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\diamond}$. For an adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, \\operatorname{Spf}(R)^{\\diamond}$ is denoted by $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$.\n\nIn general, the functor $\\mathfrak{X} \\mapsto \\mathfrak{X}^{\\diamond}$ from formal schemes over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ to small $v$-sheaves over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)$ is not fully faithful. However, the $v$-sheafification is fully faithful if we suitably restrict the category of formal schemes (cf. Proposition 4.27, Lemma 5.33).\n\nIt is useful that $\\operatorname{Spd}(f): \\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is qcqs for an adic homomorphism $f: R \\rightarrow S$ of adic rings over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (see [Gle24, Lemma 2.26]). This implies that $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\diamond}$ is qcqs over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ for a qcqs adic formal $R$-scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$.\n\nThere is a $v$-sheaf attached to a scheme $X$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ that is often denoted by $X^{\\diamond}$ (see [AGLR22, Section 2.2]). It is a $v$-sheafification of the functor taking an affinoid perfectoid pair $\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$ to the set of pairs $\\left(\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right), x\\right)$ with $\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right)$ an untilt of $S$ and $x \\in X\\left(S^{\\sharp}\\right)$. The following lemma exhibits a certain relation between $X^{\\diamond}$ and $X^{\\diamond}$.\n\nLemma 3.2. Let $R$ be a $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebra and let $X$ be a proper $R$-scheme. There is a natural isomorphism $X^{\\diamond} \\cong X^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}(R)^{\\diamond}} \\operatorname{Spec}(R)^{\\diamond}$.\n\nProof. It follows from the same reason as in the comment after [AGLR22, Remark 2.11]. There is a natural inclusion $X^{\\diamond} \\rightarrow X^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}(R)^{\\diamond}} \\operatorname{Spec}(R)^{\\diamond}$, and it is surjective by the valuative criterion for properness.\n\nHere, we record the following basic lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Let $R \\rightarrow S$ be an adic integral homomorphism of adic rings. Then, $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is proper. Moreover, if $R \\rightarrow S$ is injective, $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective.\n\nProof. We use a valuative criterion for properness ([Sch17, Proposition 18.3]) to the qcqs map $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$. Let $K$ be a perfectoid field in characteristic $p$ with an open and bounded valuation subring $K^{+} \\subset K$ and consider the following diagram.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nLet $\\left(K^{\\sharp}, K^{+ \\sharp}\\right)$ be the untilt of $\\left(K, K^{+}\\right)$with an identification $\\iota:\\left(K^{\\sharp}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\cong K$ and let $S \\rightarrow O_{K^{\\sharp}}$ be the corresponding homomorphism. Since it maps $R$ to $K^{+ \\sharp}$ and $K^{+ \\sharp}$ is integrally closed in $K^{\\sharp}$, we see that the map factors through $K^{+ \\sharp}$. Thus, we obtain a valuative criterion.\n\nNext, suppose that $R \\rightarrow S$ is injective. Take an arbitrary map $R \\rightarrow C^{+}$with $C$ an algebraically closed perfectoid field with an open and bounded valuation subring $C^{+} \\subset C$. Since $R \\rightarrow S$ is injective, the map $\\operatorname{Spec}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is surjective. Since $C$ is algebraically closed, the map $R \\rightarrow C$ has a lift $S \\rightarrow C$. Since $S$ is integral over $R$, it maps $S$ to $C^{+}$. Thus, the map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(C, C^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ admits a lift to $\\operatorname{Spd}(S)$.\n3.2. Kimberlites and thick closures. In this section, we review the theory of kimberlites developed in [Gle24], [AGLR22] and [Gle].\n\nLet SchPerf be the category of perfect schemes. It is equipped with the $v$-topology (see [BS17, Definition 2.1]) and a sheaf on SchPerf with the $v$-topology is called a scheme-theoretic $v$-sheaf.\n\nLet $X$ be a $v$-sheaf. The functor taking $S \\in \\operatorname{SchPerf}$ to the set $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(S^{\\diamond}, X\\right)$ is a schemetheoretic $v$-sheaf and denoted by $X^{\\text {red }}$ (see [Gle24, Lemma 2.26]). If $X$ is small, $X^{\\text {red }}$ is also small. Then, formally adic morphisms can be defined as in [Gle24, Definition 3.20]. A map $Y \\rightarrow X$ of $v$-sheaves is formally adic if $\\left(Y^{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\cong\\left(X^{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\times_{X} Y$.\n\nWe explain several terminology to review the definition of kimberlites. A small $v$-sheaf $X$ is formally separated if the diagonal $\\Delta_{X}: X \\rightarrow X \\times X$ is a formally adic closed immersion (see [Gle24, Definition 3.27]). A small $v$-sheaf $X$ is $v$-formalizing if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions (see [Gle24, Definition 4.5, 4.6, Lemma 4.7], [AGLR22, Proposition 2.22]).\n\n(1) There is a surjection of $v$-sheaves from a disjoint union of $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{+}\\right)$with $\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$a perfectoid affinoid pair to $X$.\n(2) For every map $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow X$ from an affinoid perfectoid space, there is a $v$-cover $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$that admits an extension $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow X$.\nIf $X$ is formally separated, $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow X$ admits at most one extension $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow X$ (see [Gle24, Proposition 4.9]). Now, a small $v$-sheaf $X$ is a prekimberlite if\n(1) $X$ is formally separated and $v$-formalizing, and\n(2) $X^{\\text {red }}$ is represented by a perfect scheme and $\\left(X^{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow X$ is a closed immersion.\n\nFor a prekimberlite $X$, the open subsheaf $X \\backslash\\left(X^{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is called the analytic locus of $X$ and denoted by $X^{\\text {an }}$. The $v$-sheaf $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ is a prekimberlite for a separated formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ (see [Gle24, Proposition 4.17]) and we have $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ, \\text { red }}=\\left(\\mathfrak{X}_{\\text {red }}^{\\text {perf }}\\right)^{\\circ}$.\n\nOne important property is that a prekimberlite $X$ admits a specialization map $\\mathrm{sp}_{X}:|X| \\rightarrow$ $\\left|X^{\\text {red }}\\right|$ (see [Gle24, Definition 4.12]). The restriction of $\\mathrm{sp}_{X}$ to $X^{\\text {an }}$ is denoted by $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}$. When $\\mathfrak{X}$ is a separated Noetherian formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, \\mathrm{sp}_{\\left(\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}\\right)^{\\circ}}$ coincides with the usual specialization map of $\\mathfrak{X}$ (see e.g. [FK18, Section 3.1]).\n\nFor an open subspace $U \\subset X^{\\text {red }}$, the open subsheaf of $X$ corresponding to $\\mathrm{sp}_{X}^{-1}(U)$ is denoted by $\\widehat{X}_{/ U}$. When $X$ is represented by a separated formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, \\widehat{X}_{/ U}$ is represented by the open formal subscheme of $\\mathfrak{X}$ whose underlying space is $U$ (see the proof of [AGLR22, Theorem 2.16]).\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a Noetherian formal scheme. The specialization map of $\\mathfrak{X}$ is quasicompact and closed (see [FK18, Theorem 3.1.2]), and surjective if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is distinguished in the sense of [FK18, Definition 2.1.8] (see [FK18, Proposition 3.1.5]). However, we need to put more assumptions on a prekimberlite $X$ so that $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}$ behaves similarly.\n\nFor a perfect scheme $Y$, let $Y^{\\circ / \\circ}$ be the analytic sheafification of the functor taking $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{Perf}$ to $Y\\left(R_{\\text {red }}^{+}\\right)$. For a prekimberlite $X$, there is a map $\\mathrm{SP}_{X}: X \\rightarrow\\left(X^{\\text {red }}\\right)^{\\circ / \\circ}$ introduced in [Gle24, Section 4.4]. We say that $X$ is valuative if $\\mathrm{SP}_{X}$ is partially proper. A valuative prekimberlite $X$ is a kimberlite if $X^{\\text {an }}$ is a quasiseparated locally spatial diamond and $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}$ is quasicompact (see [Gle24, Definition 4.35]). For a separated formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}, \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ is a kimberlite and the specialization map of $\\mathfrak{X}$ refers to the map $\\mathrm{sp}_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ, \\text { an }}}$.\n\nThe specialization map $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}$ of a kimberlite $X$ becomes a spectral closed map (see [Gle24, Theorem 4.40]). Following [Gle, Definition 4.7], we say that a prekimberlite $X$ is thick if $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}$ is surjective.\n\nDefinition 3.4. Let $X$ be a kimberlite and let $Z \\subset X^{\\text {an }}$ be a closed subsheaf. The closed subsheaf of $X$ corresponding to $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}(Z)^{\\circ} \\cup Z$ is called the thick closure of $Z$ in $X$.\n\nNote that $\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}(Z) \\subset\\left|X^{\\text {red }}\\right|$ is closed when $X$ is a kimberlite. The union $\\left|\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}(Z)^{\\circ}\\right| \\cup|Z|$ is closed because its complement is a union of $\\left|X^{\\text {an }}\\right|-|Z|$ and $\\mathrm{sp}_{X}^{-1}\\left(\\left|X^{\\text {red }}\\right|-\\mathrm{sp}_{X^{\\text {an }}}(Z)\\right)$. It is easy to see that the closed subset is weakly generalizing.\n\nFollowing these notions, we say that a separated formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is thick if the specialization map of $\\mathfrak{X}$ is surjective. We say that an adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is thick if $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is thick.\nLemma 3.5. A complete adic ring $R$ with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$ is thick if and only if for every $f \\in R$ such that $f^{n} \\cdot I^{n} \\subset I^{n+1}$ for some $n \\geq 1$, we have $f \\in R^{\\infty}$.\nProof. First, $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is not thick if and only if for some $f \\in R-R^{\\infty}, \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right], R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]\\right)$ contains only discrete points. It is equivalent to the condition that the $I$-adic completion $R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ is discrete (see e.g. [Wed12, Proposition 7.49 (2)]). It is equivalent to $I^{n} \\cdot R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]=I^{n+1} \\cdot R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]$ for some $n \\geq 1$. Since $I$ is finitely generated, it is equivalent to $f^{n} \\cdot I^{n} \\subset I^{n+1}$ for some $n \\geq 1$.\n\nFollowing [FK18, Chapter II, Definition 2.1.8], we say that a complete adic ring $R$ is distinguished if $R$ is $I$-torsion free for some ideal of definition $I \\subset R$, and a formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ is distinguished if it is Zariski locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a distinguished complete adic ring. By [FK18, Proposition 3.1.5], a distinguished separated Noetherian formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is thick. Here, we verify that this holds without Noetherian assumption.\nLemma 3.6. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. If $R$ is distinguished, $R$ is thick.\nProof. First, suppose that $R$ is $\\varpi$-adic for some non-zero-divisor $\\varpi \\in R$. Then, the claim can be checked by Lemma 3.5. Let $f \\in R$ be an element such that $f^{n} \\cdot\\left(\\varpi^{n}\\right) \\subset\\left(\\varpi^{n+1}\\right)$ for some $n \\geq 1$. We can write $f^{n} \\varpi^{n}=\\varpi^{n+1} x$ for some $x \\in R$. Since $\\varpi$ is a non-zero-divisor, we have $f^{n}=\\varpi x$. Thus, we have $f \\in R^{\\infty}$.\n\nThe general case can be reduced to the above case. Let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition and let $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ be the blowup along $V(I)$. Since $R$ is $I$-torsion free, $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)-V(I)$ is dense in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ and $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is surjective. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ be the $I$-adic completion of $Y$. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is locally monogeneous and distinguished, $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is thick. Since the specialization maps are functorial and $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is surjective, $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is thick.\n\nThough thick closures and $v$-closures may differ in general (see [AGLR22, footnote 10, Lemma 2.37]), they will coincide under suitable Noetherian assumptions.\nLemma 3.7. Let $R$ be a Noetherian adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. If $R$ is I-torsion free, $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is dense in $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$.\nProof. This can be proved in the same way as [Lou20, Lemma 4.4]. Let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in I$ be a set of generators and let $\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)=\\left(R \\sharp s \\sharp\\left\\langle\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R \\sharp s \\sharp\\left\\langle\\frac{f_{1} \\ldots f_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)\\right.$, which is a rational localization of $\\left.R \\sharp s \\sharp\\right]$. Since $R$ is Noetherian and $I$-torsion free, $\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$is strongly Noetherian and $I$-torsion free. Then, for any rational localization $\\left(T, T^{+}\\right)$of $\\left(S, S^{+}\\right), T$ is flat over $S$, so $T$ is $I$-torsion free. In particular, the inverse image of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ in $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$is dense. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective and $\\left|\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)\\right| \\cong\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)\\right|$by [Sch17, Proposition 15.4], we see that $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is dense in $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$.\n\n3.3. Geometric quotients. In this section, we introduce geometric quotients of $v$-sheaves by group actions. The theory of $v$-sheaves is quite topological and the theory of geometric quotients works well.\nDefinition 3.8. Let $\\Gamma$ be a group and let $X$ be a $v$-sheaf with a $\\Gamma$-action. A map $\\pi: X \\rightarrow Y$ of $v$-sheaves is a geometric quotient of $X$ by $\\Gamma$ if $\\pi$ is surjective, and for every geometric point $x \\in X\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$with $C$ an algebraically closed perfectoid field with an open and bounded valuation subring $C^{+} \\subset C$, we have $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(x))=\\{\\gamma \\cdot x \\mid \\gamma \\in \\Gamma\\}$.\nLemma 3.9. Let $X$ be a $v$-sheaf with an action of a group $\\Gamma$. Let $\\pi: X \\rightarrow Y$ be a geometric quotient of $X$ by $\\Gamma$. For every map $Z \\rightarrow Y$ of $v$-sheaves, the base change $X \\times_{Y} Z \\rightarrow Z$ is a geometric quotient of $X \\times_{Y} Z$ by the natural $\\Gamma$-action.\nProof. It is immediate from the definition.\nWe need some assumptions to show the uniqueness of geometric quotients. For this, we fix a $v$-sheaf $S$ that plays the role of a base and consider small $v$-sheaves over $S$.\nProposition 3.10. Let $X$ be a small $v$-sheaf with an action of a group $\\Gamma$ over $S$. Let $\\pi: X \\rightarrow Y$ be a geometric quotient of $X$ by $\\Gamma$ over $S$. Suppose that $Y$ is quasiseparated over $S$.\n(1) For every $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, we have $\\gamma \\cdot \\pi=\\pi$.\n(2) For every small $v$-sheaf $Z$ quasiseparated over $S$, a map $f: X \\rightarrow Z$ over $S$ factors through $Y$ if and only if $\\gamma \\cdot f=f$ for every $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$.\nProof. For (1), we can check the equality $\\gamma \\cdot \\pi=\\pi$ at each geometric point of $X$ by Lemma 3.1, so the claim follows. For (2), it is enough to show that $f$ factors through $Y$ if $\\gamma \\cdot f=f$ for every $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$. It is enough to check the equality of two maps $f \\circ \\mathrm{pr}_{i}: X \\times_{Y} X \\rightrightarrows Z$ $(i=1,2)$. Again, we can check the equality at each geometric point by Lemma 3.1. Since any geometric point of $X \\times_{Y} X$ is of the form $(x, \\gamma \\cdot x)$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, we get the claim.\n\nThe main source of geometric quotients by finite groups is as follows.\nProposition 3.11. Let $R \\rightarrow S$ be an injective adic homomorphism of complete adic rings. Suppose that a finite group $\\Gamma$ acts on $S$ so that $R=S^{\\Gamma}$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma$.\nProof. Since $R=S^{\\Gamma}, R \\rightarrow S$ is injective and integral. Thus, $\\pi: \\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective by Lemma 3.3. Take a geometric point $x \\in \\operatorname{Spd}(S)\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$with $C$ an algebraically closed perfectoid field with an open and bounded valuation subring $C^{+} \\subset$ $C$. It corresponds to an untilt $\\left(C^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right)$ and a continuous homomorphism $S \\rightarrow C^{+}{ }^{\\sharp}$. Set $\\pi^{\\text {sch }}: \\operatorname{Spec}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ and let $x_{C^{\\sharp}}: \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(C^{\\sharp}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(S)$ be the geometric point corresponding to $R \\rightarrow C^{\\sharp}$. Since $[\\operatorname{Spec}(S) / \\Gamma] \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is a coarse moduli space (see [Con05, Theorem 3.1]), $\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}\\left(x_{C^{\\sharp}}\\right)\\right)$ is the $\\Gamma$-orbit of $x_{C^{\\sharp}}$. Thus, for every $y \\in \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(x))$, we have $y_{C^{\\sharp}}=\\gamma \\cdot x_{C^{\\sharp}}$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, and $y=\\gamma \\cdot x$ in $\\pi^{-1}(\\pi(x))$ for such $\\gamma$.\n\nThe condition in this example can be slightly relaxed in the following way. A merit of using the following condition is the compatibility with base change.\nLemma 3.12. Let $R$ be a ring and let $S$ be an $R$-algebra with a group action of a finite group $\\Gamma$ over $R$. The following conditions are equivalent.\n(1) For every $R$-algebra $A$ and every element $a \\in A \\otimes_{R} S, \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ lies in the image of $A \\rightarrow A \\otimes_{R} S$.\n(2) For every element $a \\in S[T], \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ lies in the image of $R[T] \\rightarrow S[T]$.\n\nMoreover, this condition is satisfied if $R=S^{\\Gamma}$.\nProof. We show $(2) \\Rightarrow(1)$. Let $A$ be an arbitrary $R$-algebra and let $a \\in A \\otimes_{R} S$. We may write $a=\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} a_{i} \\otimes s_{i}$ with $a_{i} \\in A$ and $s_{i} \\in S$. Then, $a$ is equal to the image of $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} T_{i} \\otimes s_{i}$ through $S\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{n}\\right] \\rightarrow A \\otimes_{R} S$ sending $T_{i}$ to $a_{i}$. Thus, we may assume that $A=R\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots T_{n}\\right]$ and $a=\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq n} T_{i} \\otimes s_{i}$. We like to show that every coefficient of $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ lies in the image of $R \\rightarrow S$. Take a positive integer $N>\\# \\Gamma$ and let $a^{\\prime} \\in S[T]$ be the image of $a$ through $S\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{n}\\right] \\rightarrow S[T]$ sending $T_{i}$ to $T^{N^{\\prime}}$. Then, every coefficient of $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ lies in the image of $R \\rightarrow S$ if and only if every coefficient of $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a^{\\prime}$ lies in the image of $R \\rightarrow S$. The latter follows from the assumption (2).\n\nSince every coefficient of $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ is stable under the action of $\\Gamma$ for every $a \\in S[T]$, the condition (2) is satisfied when $R=S^{\\Gamma}$.\n\nAs we show in the following, the condition in Lemma 3.12 is transitive and stable under restricting to subalgebras.\nLemma 3.13. Let $R \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow S$ be a homomorphism of rings and let $\\Gamma$ be a finite group acting on $S$ over $R$. Let $H \\subset \\Gamma$ be a normal subgroup such that $H$ acts on $S$ over $M$ and there is an action of $\\Gamma / H$ on $M$ over $R$ that is compatible with the action of $\\Gamma$ on $S$. If the action of $\\Gamma / H$ on $M$ over $R$ and the action of $H$ on $S$ over $M$ satisfy the condition in Lemma 3.12, the action of $\\Gamma$ on $S$ over $R$ satisfies that condition.\nProof. It is enough to check the condition (2) in Lemma 3.12. Let $a \\in S[T]$. Since the action of $H$ on $S$ over $M$ satisfies that condition, $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in H} \\gamma \\cdot a$ is in the image of $M[T] \\rightarrow S[T]$. Take an element $b \\in M[T]$ mapping to $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in H} \\gamma \\cdot a$ in $S[T]$. Then, $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ is the image of $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma / H} \\gamma \\cdot b$ in $S[T]$, so it lies in the image of $R[T] \\rightarrow S[T]$ since the action of $\\Gamma / H$ on $M$ over $R$ satisfies the condition (2) in Lemma 3.12.\nLemma 3.14. Let $f: R \\rightarrow S$ be a homomorphism of rings and let $\\Gamma$ be a finite group acting on $S$ over $R$. Let $S^{\\prime} \\subset S$ be a subring stable under $\\Gamma$ and let $R^{\\prime}=f^{-1}\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$. If the action of $\\Gamma$ on $S$ over $R$ satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12, the action of $\\Gamma$ on $S^{\\prime}$ over $R^{\\prime}$ also satisfies that condition.\nProof. For every element $a \\in S^{\\prime}[T], \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a$ lies in the intersection of the image of $R[T] \\rightarrow$ $S[T]$ with $S^{\\prime}[T]$. That intersection is equal to the image of $R^{\\prime}[T] \\rightarrow S^{\\prime}[T]$ as $R^{\\prime}=f^{-1}\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nProposition 3.15. Let $R$ be an adic ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$. Let $S$ be an I-adic R-algebra with an action of a finite group $\\Gamma$ over $R$. If $R \\rightarrow S$ is injective and satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12, $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma$.\n\nProof. By the condition in Lemma 3.12, for every element $a \\in S, \\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma}(T-\\gamma \\cdot a)$ is a polynomial with coefficients in $R$. Thus, $S$ is integral over $R$ and $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective by Lemma 3.3. Let $\\pi^{\\text {sch }}: \\operatorname{Spec}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. As in the proof of Proposition 3.11, it suffices to show that for every geometric point $x: \\operatorname{Spec}(C) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(S)$ with $C$ an algebraically closed field, $\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}(x)\\right)$ is equal to the $\\Gamma$-orbit of $x$. Let $S_{C}=S \\otimes_{R, \\pi^{\\text {sch }}(x)} \\cdot C$. Since $R \\rightarrow S$ is injective, $\\pi^{\\text {sch }}$ is surjective and $S_{C} \\neq 0$. By the condition in Lemma 3.12, for every $a \\in S_{C}$, we have $\\prod_{\\gamma \\in \\Gamma} \\gamma \\cdot a \\in C$. Then, we see that $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(S_{C}\\right)^{\\Gamma} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(C)$ is bijective. Moreover, $C \\rightarrow\\left(S_{C}\\right)^{\\Gamma}$ is integral and $C$ is algebraically closed, so the reduction of $\\left(S_{C}\\right)^{\\Gamma}$ is isomorphic to $C$. Since $\\left[\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(S_{C}\\right) / \\Gamma\\right] \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(S_{C}\\right)^{\\Gamma}$ is a coarse moduli space, $\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\pi^{\\text {sch }}(x)\\right)$ is equal to the $\\Gamma$-orbit of $x$.\n\nA typical way of constructing a geometric quotient by a profinite group is as follows.\nProposition 3.16. Let $\\left\\{\\Gamma_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\geq 0}$ be a sequence of groups with surjective transition maps $\\Gamma_{i+1} \\nrightarrow \\Gamma_{i}$ such that $\\Gamma_{0}=\\{1\\}$. Let $\\left\\{X_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\geq 0}$ be a sequence of $v$-sheaves with transition maps $X_{i+1} \\rightarrow X_{i}$ such that each $X_{i}$ is equipped with a $\\Gamma_{i}$-action compatible with transition maps. Let $\\Gamma_{\\infty}=\\lim _{i \\geq 0} \\Gamma_{i}$ and let $X_{\\infty}=\\lim _{i \\geq 0} X_{i}$. Let $\\Gamma_{i+1}^{i}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\Gamma_{i+1} \\nrightarrow \\Gamma_{i}\\right)$. If $X_{i+1} \\rightarrow X_{i}$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{i+1}^{i}$ for every $i \\geq 0$, then $X_{\\infty} \\rightarrow X_{0}$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$.\n\nProof. Let $\\pi_{\\infty}: X_{\\infty} \\rightarrow X_{0}$. Since the $v$-site Perf is replete (by the same proof as in [Heu21, Lemma 2.6]) and each transition map is surjective, $\\pi_{\\infty}$ is surjective. Let $C$ be an algebraically closed perfectoid field with an open and bounded valuation subring $C^{+} \\subset C$. Let $x \\in$ $X_{\\infty}\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$and let $y \\in \\pi_{\\infty}^{-1}\\left(\\pi_{\\infty}(x)\\right)$. Let $\\pi_{\\infty}^{i}: X_{\\infty} \\rightarrow X_{i}$. We construct a convergent sequence $\\left\\{\\gamma_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\geq 0}$ of $\\Gamma$ so that $\\pi_{\\infty}^{i}\\left(\\gamma_{j} \\cdot y\\right)=\\pi_{\\infty}^{i}(x)$ for every $i \\leq j$. We do this by induction. If $i=0$, we can take $\\gamma_{0}=1$. Suppose that we construct the $i$-th term $\\gamma_{i}$. Then, $\\pi_{\\infty}^{i+1}\\left(\\gamma_{i} \\cdot y\\right)$ is an element of $X_{i+1}\\left(C, C^{+}\\right)$which maps to $\\pi_{\\infty}^{i}(x)$ through the transition map $X_{i+1} \\rightarrow X_{i}$. Thus, there is an element $\\delta \\in \\Gamma_{i+1}^{i}$ such that $\\delta \\cdot \\pi_{\\infty}^{i+1}\\left(\\gamma_{i} \\cdot y\\right)=\\pi_{\\infty}^{i+1}(x)$. We can take $\\gamma_{i+1}$ to be the product of a lift of $\\delta$ and $\\gamma_{i}$. If we let $\\gamma=\\lim \\gamma_{i} \\in \\Gamma$, we have $\\gamma \\cdot y=x$.\n\nAnother way to construct geometric quotients is to pass to closed subsheaves.\nLemma 3.17. Let $\\pi: X \\rightarrow Y$ be a proper map of small $v$-sheaves that is a geometric quotient by a group $\\Gamma$. Let $Z \\subset X$ be a $\\Gamma$-stable closed subsheaf and let $Z_{Y} \\subset Y$ be the image of $Z$ under $\\pi$. Then, we have $Z \\cong X \\times_{Y} Z_{Y}$ and $Z \\rightarrow Z_{Y}$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma$.\n\nProof. Since $\\pi$ is proper, $Z_{Y} \\subset Y$ is a closed subsheaf. For every geometric point $y$ of $X \\times_{Y} Z_{Y}$, there is a geometric point $x$ of $Z$ such that $\\pi(x)=\\pi(y)$. Since $\\pi$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma$, there is some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$ such that $y=\\gamma \\cdot x$. Since $Z$ is stable under $\\Gamma, y$\n\nis a geometric point of $Z$.

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. PERFECTOID FORMAL SCHEMES \n\nThe notion of $p$-adic perfectoid formal schemes is introduced in [RC21]. It is constructed from formal spectra of perfectoid rings introduced in [BMS18]. Here, we introduce not necessarily $p$-adic perfectoid formal schemes and establish some basic properties.\n4.1. $F$-standard ideals. In this section, we recall $F$-standard ideals introduced in [Tak25, Section 2.1] and explain the basic properties.\n\nAn ideal $I$ of a perfect ring $A$ is $F$-standard if $I^{p}=\\operatorname{Frob}(I)$. An $F$-standard ideal $I \\subset A$ defines an ideal $[I] \\subset W(A)$ consisting of elements $\\sum_{n \\geq 0}\\left[a_{n}\\right] p^{n}$ with $a_{n} \\in I$. For $n=m / p^{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]_{\\geq 0}$ with $m, k \\geq 0$, we set $I^{n}=\\operatorname{Frob}\\left(I^{m}\\right)^{-k}$. This is independent of the choice of $m$ and $k$ since $I$ is $F$-standard, and $I^{n}$ is also $F$-standard.\n\nWhen a perfect ring $A$ is equipped with a linear topology of a finitely generated ideal, we say that $A$ is an adic perfect ring. By [Tak25, Lemma 2.5], every adic perfect ring admits an $F$-standard ideal of definition. Note that such an ideal of definition is not necessarily finitely generated.\n\nLemma 4.1. Let $A$ be a perfect ring and let $I \\subset A$ be an $F$-standard ideal. The ideal $[I] \\subset W(A)$ is $p$-adically closed and $W(A) /[I]$ is $p$-torsion free and $p$-adically complete.\nProof. Since $[I] \\cap\\left(p^{n}\\right)=p^{n}[I]$ and $[I]$ is $p$-adically complete, we see that $[I] \\subset W(A)$ is a closed ideal and $W(A) /[I]$ is $p$-adically complete. Moreover, $W(A) /[I]$ is $p$-torsion free as $[I] \\cap(p)=p[I]$.\n\nLemma 4.2. Let $A$ be a perfect ring. For $F$-standard ideals $I, J \\subset A$, the ideals $I \\cap J, I J$ are $F$-standard. Moreover, $[I \\cap J]=[I] \\cap[J]$ and $[I J]$ is the $p$-adic closure of $[I][J]$ in $W(A)$.\nProof. Since we have $\\operatorname{Frob}(I \\cap J) \\subset(I \\cap J)^{p} \\subset I^{p} \\cap J^{p}=\\operatorname{Frob}(I) \\cap \\operatorname{Frob}(J), I \\cap J$ is $F$ standard. By definition, we have $[I \\cap J]=[I] \\cap[J]$. On the other hand, since $(I J)^{p}=$ $I^{p} J^{p}=\\operatorname{Frob}(I) \\operatorname{Frob}(J)=\\operatorname{Frob}(I J), I J$ is $F$-standard. Next, we show $[I][J] \\subset[I J]$. Let $a=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left[a_{n}\\right] p^{n} \\in I$ and $b=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left[b_{n}\\right] p^{n} \\in J$. Then, $a b=\\sum_{n, m=0}^{\\infty}\\left[a_{n} b_{m}\\right] p^{n+m}$, so $a b \\in[I J]$ as $a_{n} b_{m} \\in I J$. To prove the claim, it is enough to show that $[I J]=[I][J]+p[I J]$ since $[I J] \\subset W(A)$ is closed. Let $x=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left[a_{n}\\right] p^{n}$ be an element of $[I J]$. Then, $a_{0} \\in I J$, so we may write $a_{0}=\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq m} b_{i} c_{i}$ with $b_{i} \\in I$ and $c_{i} \\in J$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq m$. Then, $x-\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq m}\\left[b_{m}\\right]\\left[c_{m}\\right] \\in$ $[I J] \\cap(p)=p[I J]$, so we obtain $x \\in[I][J]+p[I J]$.\n\nFrom this lemma, we have $\\left(p^{n},[I]^{m}\\right)=\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{m}\\right]\\right)$ for every $n, m \\geq 0$.\n\nLemma 4.3. Let $A$ be a perfect ring and let $I \\subset A$ be an $F$-standard ideal. Let $A^{\\wedge}$ be the $I$-adic completion of $A$. The $(p,[I])$-adic completion of $W(A)$ is isomorphic to $W\\left(A^{\\wedge}\\right)$. In particular, $W(A)$ is $(p,[I])$-adically complete if $A$ is $I$-adically complete.\nProof. It is enough to show that the $[I]$-adic completion of $W_{n}(A)$ is isomorphic to $W_{n}\\left(A^{\\wedge}\\right)$ for every $n \\geq 0$. For every $m \\geq 0$, there are natural maps $W_{n}\\left(A / I^{p^{m}} m\\right) \\rightarrow W_{n}(A) /\\left[I^{m}\\right] \\rightarrow$ $W_{n}\\left(A / I^{m}\\right)$ since we have $\\sum\\left[a_{n}\\right] p^{n}=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}^{p}, a_{2}^{p^{2}}, \\ldots\\right)$ in $W(A)$. Thus, $\\left\\{W_{n}\\left(A / I^{m}\\right)\\right\\}_{m \\geq 0}$ and $\\left\\{W_{n}(A) /\\left[I^{m}\\right]\\right\\}_{m \\geq 0}$ are isomorphic as pro-systems. Thus, we have $\\lim _{m \\geq 0} W_{n}(A) /[I]^{m}=$ $\\lim _{m \\geq 0} W_{n}\\left(A / I^{m}\\right)=W_{n}\\left(A^{\\wedge}\\right)$.\n4.2. Adic perfectoid rings. In this section, we introduce affine building blocks of perfectoid formal schemes, which we call complete adic perfectoid rings. This notion is equivalent to perfectoid rings in the sense of Gabber-Romero (see [GR18, Definition 16.3.1]), but we use another term in order to clarify the terminology.\n\nDefinition 4.4. An adic ring $R$ on which $p$ is topologically nilpotent is said to be an adic perfectoid ring if the underlying $p$-adic ring $R$ is a perfectoid ring. Moreover, if $R$ is a complete adic ring, we say that $R$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring.\n\nWhen we simply say that $R$ is a perfectoid ring, $R$ is endowed with the $p$-adic topology. We will consider tilting from adic perfectoid rings to adic perfect rings. For a perfectoid ring $R$ and $f \\in R^{\\flat}$, the image of the Teichm\u00fcller lift $[f] \\in W\\left(R^{\\natural}\\right)$ in $R$ is denoted by $f^{\\sharp}$. The map $W\\left(R^{\\natural}\\right) \\rightarrow R$ is denoted by $\\theta_{R}$ and a generator of $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{R}\\right)$ is denoted by $\\xi_{R}$. The image of $\\xi_{R}$ along $W\\left(R^{\\natural}\\right) \\rightarrow R^{\\natural}$ is denoted by $\\xi_{R, 0}$.\nLemma 4.5. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring. There is an ideal of definition of $R$ generated by $p$ and $f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{n}^{\\sharp}$ for some $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in R^{\\natural}$. Moreover, the adic topology on $R^{\\natural}$ generated by $\\xi_{R, 0}, f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$ is independent of the choice of $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$.\nProof. Let $I$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition of $R$ such that $p \\in I$. Since the image of the map $f \\mapsto f^{\\sharp}$ is $p$-adically dense in $R$, we can take a set of generators of $I$ consisting of $p$ and $f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{n}^{\\sharp}$. It is enough to show that the adic topology on $R^{\\natural}$ generated by $\\xi_{R, 0}, f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$ is independent of the choice of $I$ and $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$.\n\nLet $I^{\\natural}=\\left(\\xi_{R, 0}, f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right)$. The ideal $I^{\\natural}$ is independent of the choice of $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}$ since $I^{\\natural}$ is the inverse image of the ideal $I / p R$ along $R^{\\natural} \\rightarrow R^{\\natural} / \\xi_{R, 0} R^{\\natural} \\cong R / p R$. From this description, we see that $J^{\\natural} \\subset I^{\\natural}$ for any finitely generated ideal of definition $J$ of $R$ such that $p \\in J \\subset I$. Let $J$ be another finitely generated ideal of definition of $R$ such that $p \\in J$. For sufficiently large $N \\geq 0$, we have $(p)+J^{N} \\subset I$ and $(p)+I^{N} \\subset J$, so it implies that $\\left(\\xi_{R, 0}\\right)+J^{\\natural, N} \\subset I^{\\natural}$ and $\\left(\\xi_{R, 0}\\right)+I^{\\natural, N} \\subset J^{\\natural}$. Thus, the two adic topologies on $R^{\\natural}$ given by $I^{\\natural}$ and $J^{\\natural}$ are equal.\n\nLet $I$ be an ideal of $R$ such that $p \\in I$. As in the above proof, the inverse image of the ideal $I / p R$ along $R^{\\natural} \\rightarrow R^{\\natural} / \\xi_{R, 0} R^{\\natural} \\cong R / p R$ is denoted by $I^{\\natural}$. Note that since $\\xi_{R}$ is distinguished,\n\n$p$ and $\\xi_{R, 0}^{\\sharp}$ generate the same ideal in $R$, so $I$ is generated by $\\xi_{R, 0}^{\\sharp}, f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{n}^{\\sharp}$. For an ideal $J \\subset R^{b}$, the ideal of $R$ generated by $f^{\\sharp}$ for all $f \\in J$ is denoted by $J^{\\sharp}$. The above argument shows that for an ideal $p \\in I \\subset R$, we have $I=\\left(I^{\\natural}\\right)^{\\sharp}$.\n\nDefinition 4.6. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring and let $I$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition of $R$ such that $p \\in I$. The adic perfect ring $R^{b}$ with the $I^{\\natural}$-adic topology is said to be the tilting of $R$, which is independent of the choice of $I$.\n\nLemma 4.7. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring and let $J \\subset R^{b}$ be an open $F$-standard ideal. The ideal $J^{\\sharp}$ is equal to the image of $[J] \\subset W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ under $\\theta_{R}$.\n\nProof. Since $J$ is open, $\\xi_{R, 0}^{n} \\in J$ for some $n \\geq 0$, so we have $p^{n} \\in J^{\\sharp}$ since $\\xi_{R}$ is distinguished. Then, the claim follows from the fact that $[J] \\subset W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ is the $p$-adic closure of the ideal generated by $[f]$ for all $f \\in J$.\n\nWe will prove that the completeness of adic perfectoid rings is preserved under tilting.\nLemma 4.8. Let $A$ be a perfect ring and let $\\xi \\in W(A)$ be a distinguished element. Let $\\xi_{0}$ be the image of $\\xi$ along $W(A) \\rightarrow A$ and let $I \\subset A$ be an $F$-standard ideal such that $\\xi_{0} \\in I$. If we endow $W(A)$ with the $(p,[I])$-adic topology, the map $W(A) \\rightarrow W(A)$ given by the multiplication by $\\xi$ is a homeomorphism onto the image.\n\nProof. It is easy to see that the multiplication by $\\xi$ is continuous. We show that it is a homeomorphism onto its image.\n\nLet $n \\geq 1$ be an integer. We show that if $x \\in W(A)$ satisfies $\\xi x \\in\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{n}\\right]\\right)$, we have $x \\in\\left(p^{s},\\left[I^{t}\\right]\\right)$ for every $s, t \\geq 0$ with $s+t<n$. Suppose that $x$ is not contained in $\\left(p^{s},\\left[I^{t}\\right]\\right)$ and let $x=\\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\left[a_{m}\\right] p^{m}$. Then, there exists $0 \\leq k<s$ such that $a_{k} \\notin I^{t}$. Take the minimal $k$ such that $a_{k} \\notin I^{t}$. Then, we are in the situation $(*)$ that $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{k-1} \\in I^{\\ell}$ and $a_{k} \\notin I^{\\ell}$, but $\\xi x \\in\\left(p^{k+2},\\left[I^{\\ell}\\right]\\right)$ for $k \\leq s-1 \\leq n-2$ and $\\ell=t \\geq 0$.\n\nSuppose that we are in the above situation for some $k$ and $\\ell \\geq 1$. We may suppose that $a_{k} \\in I^{\\ell-1}$. Let $\\xi=\\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\left[\\xi_{m}\\right] p^{m}$. Since $\\xi$ is distinguished, $\\xi_{1}$ is a unit and we may assume that $\\xi_{1}=1$. Then, $\\xi x$ is congruent to $\\sum_{m_{1}+m_{2} \\leq k+1}\\left[a_{m_{1}} \\xi_{m_{2}}\\right] p^{m_{1}+m_{2}}$ modulo $p^{k+2}$. It lies in $\\left(p^{k+2},\\left[I^{\\ell}\\right]\\right)$, so we have $\\left[\\xi_{0} a_{k}\\right] p^{k}+\\left(\\left[\\xi_{0} a_{k+1}\\right]+\\left[a_{k}\\right]\\right) p^{k+1} \\in\\left(p^{k+2},\\left[I^{\\ell}\\right]\\right)$. Then, we have $\\xi_{0} a_{k}, \\xi_{0} a_{k+1}+a_{k} \\in I^{\\ell}$. Since $\\xi_{0} \\in I$ and $a_{k} \\notin I^{\\ell}$, we have $a_{k+1} \\notin I^{\\ell-1}$. Thus, if $k+1 \\leq n-2$, the hypothesis $(*)$ holds for $k+1$ and $\\ell-1$.\n\nIf we continue this procedure until $\\ell=0$, we see that the hypothesis $(*)$ holds for some $k \\leq s+t-1 \\leq n-2$ and $\\ell=0$. This is a contradiction because $a_{k} \\in A=I^{0}$. Thus, we see that $x \\in\\left(p^{s},\\left[I^{t}\\right]\\right)$ and we obtain the claim.\n\nProposition 4.9. Let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal such that $p \\in I$ and $I^{\\natural} \\subset R^{b}$ is $F$-standard. Then, $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ is $\\left(p,\\left[I^{\\natural}\\right]\\right)$-adically complete if and only if $R$ is I-adically complete.\n\nProof. First, suppose that $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is $\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)$-adically complete. By Lemma 4.8, $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{R}\\right)$ is a closed ideal, so the quotient $R=W\\left(R^{s}\\right) / \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{R}\\right)$ is complete with respect to the quotient topology. The claim follows since $I$ is the image of $\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)$ along $\\theta_{R}$.\n\nNext, suppose that $R$ is $I$-adically complete. First, we show that $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is separated. Suppose that we have $a \\in \\bigcap_{n \\geq 0}\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right)$. Then, $\\theta_{R}(a) \\in \\bigcap_{n \\geq 0} I^{n}$, so $\\theta_{R}(a)=0$. If we write $a=\\xi a^{\\prime}$, then we also have $a^{\\prime} \\in \\bigcap_{n \\geq 0}\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right)$ by Lemma 4.8. Thus, we have $\\bigcap_{n \\geq 0}\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right) \\subset \\xi^{m} W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ for every $m \\geq 0$. Since $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is $\\xi$-adically complete by Lemma 4.3, we have $\\bigcap_{n \\geq 0}\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right)=0$. Next, we show that $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is complete. Let $\\left(a_{n}\\right)_{n \\geq 0}$ be a sequence in $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ such that $a_{n+1}-a_{n} \\in\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right)$. Since $R$ is $I$-adically complete, $\\left(\\theta_{R}\\left(a_{n}\\right)\\right)$ converges to an element $\\bar{b} \\in R$. Let $b$ be a lift of $\\bar{b}$ in $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ and let $a_{n}^{\\prime}=a_{n}-b$. Then, $\\theta_{R}\\left(a_{n}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in\\left(p^{n},\\left(I^{s, n}\\right)^{\\sharp}\\right)$, so by replacing $a_{n}$ with an element of $a_{n}+\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{s, n}\\right]\\right)$, we may assume that $a_{n}^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{R}\\right)$. By Lemma 4.8, the sequence $\\left(a_{n}^{\\prime} / \\xi\\right)$ is convergent, so we may repeat this procedure to $\\left(a_{n}^{\\prime} / \\xi\\right)$. After all, we see that there is a sequence $\\left(b_{m}\\right)_{m \\geq 0}$ such that for every $k \\geq 0, a_{n}-\\sum_{0 \\leq m<k} b_{m} \\xi^{m}$ modulo $\\xi^{k}$ is convergent to 0 in $W\\left(R^{s}\\right) /\\left(\\xi^{k}\\right)$. Since $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is $\\xi$-adically complete, $\\sum_{m \\geq 0} b_{m} \\xi^{m}$ is a limit of $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$.\n\nCorollary 4.10. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring. Then, $R$ is complete if and only if $R^{s}$ is complete.\n\nProof. Let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition such that $p \\in I$. By Proposition 4.9, $R$ is complete if and only if $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is $\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)$-adically complete, and $R^{s}$ is complete if and only if $W\\left(R^{s}\\right)$ is $\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)$-adically complete. Thus, the claim follows.\n\nCorollary 4.11. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition such that $p \\in I$. The $I$-adic completion $R^{\\wedge}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring. Its tilt $R^{\\wedge, \\text {,s }}$ is isomorphic to the $I^{s}$-adic completion of $R^{s}$.\n\nProof. Let $J_{n}=\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)^{n} \\cap\\left(\\xi_{R}\\right)$. The short exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow\\left(\\xi_{R}\\right) \\rightarrow W\\left(R^{s}\\right) \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow 0$ gives rise to a short exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow\\left(\\xi_{R}\\right) / J_{n} \\rightarrow W\\left(R^{s}\\right) /\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)^{n} \\rightarrow R / I^{n} \\rightarrow 0$. By Lemma 4.8, the limit of $\\left(\\xi_{R}\\right) / J_{n}$ is isomorphic to the $\\left(p,\\left[I^{s}\\right]\\right)$-adic completion of $\\left(\\xi_{R}\\right)$. Let $R^{s, \\wedge}$ be the $I^{s}$-adic completion of $R^{s}$. By taking the limit of the above sequences, we obtain a short exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow \\xi_{R} \\cdot W\\left(R^{s, \\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow W\\left(R^{s, \\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow R^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow 0$ by Lemma 4.3. As $\\xi_{R}$ is distinguished, we see that $R^{\\wedge}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring with tilt $R^{s, \\wedge}$.\n\nThe tilting equivalence holds in our setting as well. For an adic perfectoid ring $R$, an adic (resp. complete adic) perfectoid $R$-algebra refers to an adic (resp. complete adic) perfectoid ring $S$ with a continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow S$.\n\nProposition 4.12. Let $R$ be an adic perfectoid ring. The category of adic (resp. complete adic) perfectoid $R$-algebras is equivalent to the category of adic (resp. complete adic) perfect $R^{s}$-algebras.\n\nProof. Let $R$ and $S$ be adic perfectoid rings. By the tilting equivalence of perfectoid rings (see [BS22, Theorem 3.10]), it is enough to show that a homomorphism $f: R \\rightarrow S$ is continuous if and only if $f^{s}: R^{s} \\rightarrow S^{s}$ is continuous. Since $R$ and $S$ are $p$-adic, $f$ is continuous if and only if $f / p: R / p R \\rightarrow S / p S$ is continuous. Since $R^{b}$ and $S^{b}$ is $\\xi_{R, 0}$-adic, $f^{b}$ is continuous if and only if $f / \\xi_{R, 0}: R^{b} / \\xi_{R, 0} R^{b} \\rightarrow S^{b} / \\xi_{R, 0} S^{b}$ is continuous. Thus, the claim follows from the isomorphism $R / p R \\cong R^{b} / \\xi_{R, 0} R^{b}$.\n\nFor a continuous homomorphism $f: R \\rightarrow S$ of adic perfectoid rings, the homomorphism $R^{b} \\rightarrow S^{b}$ between the tiltings is denoted by $f^{b}$.\nLemma 4.13. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$ and let $S$ be an I-adically complete I-completely \u00e9tale $R$-algebra. Then, $S$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring.\nProof. We may assume that $I^{b}$ is $F$-standard. By the topological invariance of \u00e9tale sites, there is a unique \u00e9tale $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) /\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{b}\\right]^{n}\\right)$-algebra $S_{n}^{\\prime}$ such that $S_{n}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{W\\left(R^{b}\\right) /\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{b}\\right]^{n}\\right)}(R / I) \\cong$ $S / I S$ for every $n \\geq 0$. Then, $S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}=\\lim _{n \\geq 0} S_{n}^{\\prime}$ is $\\left(p,\\left[I^{b}\\right]\\right)$-completely \u00e9tale over $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ and we have $S \\cong S_{\\infty}^{\\prime} / \\xi_{R} S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$. By [BS22, Lemma 2.18], $S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$ is equipped with the unique $\\delta$-structure compatible with that of $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$. Now, the Frobenius on $S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$ induces a homomorphism $S_{\\infty}^{\\prime} /\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{b, 1 / p}\\right]^{n}\\right) \\rightarrow S_{n}^{\\prime}$ after the base change to $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) /\\left(p^{n},\\left[I^{b}\\right]^{n}\\right)$. It induces a universally homeomorphic \u00e9tale morphism, so it is an isomorphism. Thus, the Frobenius on $S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$ is an isomorphism, so $S \\cong S_{\\infty}^{\\prime} / \\xi_{R} S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring.\n4.3. Continuous arc-topology. In this section, we introduce continuous arc-topology on complete adic perfectoid rings and establish continuous arc-descent following [BM21], [BS22, Section 8.2] and [Ito22].\nDefinition 4.14. An adic homomorphism $R \\rightarrow S$ of complete adic perfectoid rings is a continuous arc-cover if for every continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V$ to a valuation ring of rank 1 , there is an extension $V \\rightarrow W$ of valuation rings of rank 1 and a continuous homomorphism $S \\rightarrow W$ lifting the composition $R \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow W$.\n\nAs in [BS22, Remark 8.9], a continuous arc-cover can be constructed as a product of valuation rings of rank 1 as follows.\nExample 4.15. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition. Let $X_{R}$ be a set of representatives of rank 1 continuous valuations on $R$ and let $S=\\prod_{x \\in X_{R}} V_{x}$ be the product of $V_{x}$ with the $I$-adic topology. We can take each $V_{x}$ so that $V_{x}$ is $p$-complete and $\\operatorname{Frac}\\left(V_{x}\\right)$ is algebraically closed. Then, $S$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring and $R \\rightarrow S$ is a continuous arc-cover.\n\nAs usual, the continuous arc-site satisfies tilting equivalence.\nLemma 4.16. Let $f: R \\rightarrow S$ be a continuous homomorphism of complete adic perfectoid rings. Then, $f$ is a continuous arc-cover if and only if $f^{b}$ is a continuous arc-cover.\n\nProof. Note that a $p$-adically complete valuation ring $V$ with an algebraically closed fraction field is perfectoid and $V^{b}$ is a perfect valuation ring with an algebraically closed fraction field. By Proposition 4.12, we see that for every continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V$, the existence of a lift $S \\rightarrow W$ to an extension $V \\rightarrow W$ is equivalent to the existence of a lift $S^{b} \\rightarrow W^{b}$ to an extension $V^{b} \\rightarrow W^{b}$. As in Proposition 4.12, $f$ is adic if and only if $f^{b}$ is adic.\n\nThe argument of [Ito22] for $\\varpi$-complete arc-hyperdescent works in our setting as well. As in [Ito22, Definition 2.1], hyperdescent for the continuous arc-topology is referred to as continuous arc-hyperdescent.\n\nProposition 4.17. The functors\n\n$$\nR \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}\\left(R^{b}\\right), \\quad R \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}\\left(W\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\right), \\quad R \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}(R)\n$$\n\nfrom the category of complete adic perfectoid rings to the $\\infty$-category of small $\\infty$-categories satisfy continuous arc-hyperdescent.\n\nProof. As in the proof of [Ito22, Theorem 3.1], it is enough to show that the bounded analogues of the given functors (where Perf is replaced by $\\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}$ for some $a \\leq b$ ) satisfy arc-descent.\n\nLet $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring. Let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition such that $p \\in I$ and let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in I^{b}$ be a finite set of generators. Let $R \\rightarrow S$ be a continuous arc-cover of complete adic perfectoid rings and let $R \\rightarrow S^{\\bullet}$ be the \u010cech nerve of the continuous arc-cover.\n\nFirst, we show the continuous arc-descent along $R \\rightarrow S^{\\bullet}$ of the functor $S^{\\bullet} \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}\\left(S^{\\bullet, b}\\right)$. By [Ito22, Proposition 2.9 (2)], it is enough to show that the arc-descent holds for the functor $S^{\\bullet} \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}\\left(S^{\\bullet, b} /{ }^{b}\\left(f_{1}^{n}, f_{2}^{n}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{n}\\right)\\right)$ for every $n \\geq 0$. Since $R^{b} \\rightarrow S^{b}$ is a continuous arcoover by Lemma $4.16, R^{b} \\rightarrow S^{b} \\times R^{b}\\left[\\frac{1}{f_{1}}\\right] \\times \\cdots \\times R^{b}\\left[\\frac{1}{f_{r}}\\right]$ is an arc-cover of perfect rings. Thus, the claim follows from [Ito22, Theorem 3.1].\n\nThe continuous arc-descent of the functor $S^{\\bullet} \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}\\left(W\\left(S^{\\bullet, b}\\right)\\right)$ follows from the same argument as in [Ito22, Section 4.1]. Moreover, the continuous arc-descent of the functor $S^{\\bullet} \\mapsto$ $\\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}\\left(S^{\\bullet} /{ }^{b}\\left(f_{1}^{2, n}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{2, n}\\right)\\right)$ also follows from the same argument for every $n \\geq 0$. Thus, the continuous arc-descent of the functor $S^{\\bullet} \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}_{[a, b]}\\left(S^{\\bullet}\\right)$ follows from [Ito22, Proposition 2.9 $(2)]$.\n\nThe following corollary follows formally from the continuous arc-descent of $R \\mapsto \\operatorname{Perf}(R)$ by looking at the space of endomorphisms of $R \\in \\operatorname{Perf}(R)$.\n\nCorollary 4.18. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset$ $R$. Let $R \\rightarrow S$ be a continuous arc-cover of complete adic perfectoid rings. The complex $0 \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S \\rightarrow \\cdots$ is acyclic. Here, $\\widehat{\\otimes}_{R}$ denotes the I-adically completed tensor product.\n\nHowever, this descent is sometimes insufficient as it ignores the descent of topologies. We will show that the above descent holds as topological rings.\n\nLet $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition with $p \\in I$. We regard $R$ as a Banach ring with a norm $|x|_{I}=p^{-n}$ with $n=\\sup \\left\\{m \\geq 0 \\mid x \\in I^{m}\\right\\}$ for $x \\in R$. Then, we get the spectral seminorm $|x|_{I}^{\\text {sp }}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left|x^{n}\\right|_{I}^{1 / n}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$ be the set of bounded multiplicative norms on $R$. Then, $|\\cdot|_{I}^{\\text {sp }}$ is equal to the supremum over $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$ (see e.g. [Ked19, Lemma 1.5.22]). First, we compare $|\\cdot|_{I}$ with $|\\cdot|_{I}^{\\text {sp }}$.\nProposition 4.19. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition with $p \\in I$. The topology defined by $|\\cdot|_{\\text {I }}^{\\text {sp }}$ equals the $I$-adic topology on $R$.\nProof. First, suppose that $R$ is in characteristic $p$. Let $J$ be the minimum $F$-standard ideal containing $I$. Since $|x|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left|x^{p^{n}}\\right|_{I}^{p^{-n}}$ and $J=\\bigcup_{n \\geq 0} \\operatorname{Frob}^{-n}\\left(I^{p^{n}}\\right)$, we see that for every $m \\geq 1, x \\in J^{m}$ implies $|x|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq p^{-m}$, and $|x|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq p^{-m-1}$ implies $x \\in J^{m}$. Thus, the topology defined by $|\\cdot|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }}$ is equal to the $J$-adic topology on $R$. Thus, the claim follows from [Tak25, Lemma 2.5].\n\nNext, let $R$ be an arbitrary complete adic perfectoid ring. It is obvious that the $I$-adic topology is finer than or equal to the topology defined by $|\\cdot|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }}$. We show the converse direction. Let $m \\geq 1$ and let $J_{m} \\subset R$ be the ideal consisting of elements $x \\in R$ with $|x|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq p^{-m}$. Since $p^{m} \\in J_{m}$ and the set of elements $f^{\\sharp}$ with $f \\in R^{\\mathrm{s}}$ is $p$-adically dense in $R$, it is enough to determine the set of $f \\in R^{\\mathrm{s}}$ with $f^{\\sharp} \\in J_{m}$. Recall that $|\\cdot|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }}$ is equal to the supremum over $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$. Each $x \\in \\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$ corresponds to a continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ to a $p$-complete valuation ring $V_{x}$ of rank 1 with an algebraically closed fraction field. Through the tilting equivalence, it corresponds to a continuous homomorphism $R^{\\mathrm{s}} \\rightarrow V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}$. Here, the norms on $V_{x}$ and $V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}$ correspond under the equation $|a|_{V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}}=|a^{\\sharp}|_{V_{x}}$ for every $a \\in V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}$. Since $I$ is generated by $\\left(I^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)^{\\sharp}, R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ is bounded if and only if for every $f \\in I^{\\mathrm{s}},|f^{\\sharp}|_{V_{x}} \\leq p^{-1}$. This is equivalent to $|f|_{V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}} \\leq p^{-1}$, so $R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ is bounded if and only if $R^{\\mathrm{s}} \\rightarrow V_{x}^{\\mathrm{s}}$ is bounded. This means that the tilting equivalence induces $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R) \\cong \\mathcal{M}_{I^{s}}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$ and for $f \\in R^{\\mathrm{s}}, f^{\\sharp} \\in J_{m}$ if and only if $|f|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq p^{-m}$. Let $J_{m}^{\\mathrm{s}} \\subset R^{\\mathrm{s}}$ be the ideal consisting of elements $x \\in R^{\\mathrm{s}}$ with $|x|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq p^{-m}$. Since $|\\cdot|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }}$ is power-multiplicative, $J_{m}^{\\mathrm{s}}$ is $F$-standard. The above argument shows that $J_{m}=\\left(p^{m},\\left(J_{m}^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)^{\\sharp}\\right)$ and the argument in characteristic $p$ shows that the linear topology given by $\\left\\{J_{m}^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right\\}$ is equal to the $I^{s}$-adic topology. Thus, we see that the linear topology given by $\\left\\{J_{m}\\right\\}_{m \\geq 0}$ is equal to the $\\left(p,\\left(I^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)^{\\sharp}\\right)$-adic topology.\nCorollary 4.20. Let $R \\rightarrow S$ be a continuous arc-cover of complete adic perfectoid rings. The topology on $R$ equals the subspace topology induced by the topology on $S$.\nProof. Let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition with $p \\in I$. Since $R \\rightarrow S$ is adic, $I S \\subset S$ is an ideal of definition. Since $I^{n} \\subset(I S)^{n} \\cap R$ for every $n \\geq 0$, we have $|f|_{\\mid}^{\\text {sp }} \\geq|f|_{\\mid S}^{\\text {sp }}$ for every $f \\in R$. By Proposition 4.19, it is enough to prove the converse inequality. Each $x \\in \\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$ corresponds to a continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ to a $p$-complete valuation ring $V_{x}$ of\n\nrank 1 with an algebraically closed fraction field. Since $R \\rightarrow S$ is a continuous arc-cover, we may assume by replacing $V_{x}$ that it admits a lift $S \\rightarrow V_{x}$. The map $S \\rightarrow V_{x}$ is bounded with respect to $|\\cdot|_{I S}$ if and only if $R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ is bounded with respect to $|\\cdot|_{I}$, so by taking the supremum over $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$, we have $|f|_{\\text {I }}^{\\text {sp }} \\leq|f|_{\\text {IS }}^{\\text {sp }}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 4.4. Perfectoid formal schemes. \n\nDefinition 4.21. A perfectoid formal scheme is a formal scheme Zariski locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a complete adic perfectoid ring. A perfectoid formal scheme in characteristic $p$ is called a perfect formal scheme.\n\nProposition 4.22. A formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ is perfectoid if and only if every affine open formal subscheme of $\\mathfrak{X}$ is the formal spectrum of a complete adic perfectoid ring.\n\nProof. It is enough to show that if $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $R$ a complete adic ring is perfectoid, then $R$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring. Let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition such that $p \\in I$. Since $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is perfectoid, $\\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)$ is Zariski locally semiperfect, so $R / I$ is semiperfect. Let $R^{b}=\\lim _{x \\mapsto x^{p}}(R / I)$ and let $I^{b}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(R^{b} \\rightarrow R / I\\right)$. Then, $R^{b}$ is perfect and complete with respect to the linear topology given by $\\left\\{\\operatorname{Frob}^{n}\\left(I^{b}\\right)\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0}$.\n\nThe quotient $R^{b} / \\operatorname{Frob}\\left(I^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow R^{b} / I^{b}$ is isomorphic to the Frobenius map $R / I \\rightarrow R / I$. For each affine open formal subscheme $\\operatorname{Spf}(S) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $S$ a complete adic perfectoid ring, we have $S / I S \\cong S^{b} /(I S)^{b}$ and the kernel of the Frobenius map on $S^{b} /(I S)^{b}$ is finitely generated since $(I S)^{b}$ is finitely generated. Thus, $\\operatorname{Ker}(\\operatorname{Frob}: R / I \\rightarrow R / I)$ is Zariski locally finitely generated, so it is finitely generated. In particular, there is a finitely generated ideal $J \\subset R^{b}$ such that $I^{b}=J+\\operatorname{Frob}\\left(I^{b}\\right)$. By the completeness of $R^{b}$, we have $I^{b}=J$ and we see that $I^{b}$ is finitely generated. In particular, $R^{b}$ is $I^{b}$-adically complete.\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Spf}(S) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ be a distinguished open formal subscheme with $S$ a complete adic perfectoid ring. Note that we can take an open covering of $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ consisting of such $\\operatorname{Spf}(S)$. Let us write $\\operatorname{Spf}(S)=D_{f^{b}}(\\operatorname{Spf}(R))$ with some $f \\in R^{b}$. By construction, we have $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S^{b}\\right)=D_{f}\\left(\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\right)$. In particular, we have $(I S)^{b}=I^{b} S^{b}$ and $S^{b}$ is a complete $I^{b}$-adic perfect ring. Take a Zariski finite covering $\\coprod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{\\lambda}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with each $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{\\lambda}\\right)$ as above. Then, $R^{b} \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} S_{\\lambda}^{b}$ is a continuous arc-cover of complete adic perfect rings. By Proposition 4.17, the homomorphism $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{S_{\\lambda}}\\right) \\rightarrow W\\left(S_{\\lambda}^{b}\\right)$ of invertible $W\\left(S_{\\lambda}^{b}\\right)$-modules descends to a homomorphism $K \\rightarrow W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ with $K$ an invertible $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$-module.\n\nNow, we have a surjection $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow R$. The following diagram commutes for each $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ by the functoriality of the construction.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nNow, $K \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{S_{\\lambda}}\\right)$ and $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} W\\left(S_{\\lambda}^{b}\\right)$ are injective by Proposition 4.17, and $R \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} S_{\\lambda}$ is also injective by the sheaf condition. Moreover, the images of these maps can be described by gluing conditions. Thus, we see that $K$ maps isomorphically to $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(W\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow R\\right)$ in $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$. It is enough to show that $K$ is generated by a distinguished element of $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$.\n\nWe proceed as in [BS22, Lemma 3.6]. Let $J \\subset R^{b}$ be an $F$-standard ideal of definition and let $M=W\\left(R^{b}\\right) /\\left(K^{p}+\\varphi(K) \\cdot W\\left(R^{b}\\right)+\\left(p^{2},[J]\\right)\\right)$. Since $R^{b} \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} S_{\\lambda}^{b}$ is $I^{b}$-completely faithfully flat, $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} W\\left(S_{\\lambda}^{b}\\right)$ is $(p,[J])$-completely faithfully flat. In particular, $M \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} M \\otimes_{W\\left(R^{b}\\right)} W\\left(S^{b}\\right)$ is faithfully flat. Since $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{S_{\\lambda}}\\right)$ is generated by a distinguished element, $p=0$ in $M \\otimes_{W\\left(R^{b}\\right)} W\\left(S^{b}\\right)$ for every $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ by [BS22, Theorem 3.10]. Thus, we have $p=0$ in $M$. Let $p=a+\\varphi(b) c+p^{2} d+e$ with $a \\in K^{p}, b \\in K, c, d \\in W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ and $e \\in[J]$. We have $p(1-p d-\\delta(b) c)+e \\in K^{p}$. We show that $\\delta(b)$ is a unit. If $\\delta(b)$ is not a unit, there is a maximal ideal $J \\subset \\mathfrak{m} \\in R^{b}$ such that $\\delta(b) \\in(p,|\\mathfrak{m}|)$. The map $R^{b} \\rightarrow R^{b} / \\mathfrak{m}$ factors through $S_{\\lambda}^{b}$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$, so the image of $K$ in $W\\left(R^{b} / \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ is generated by $p$. Since $\\delta(b)$ maps to $p \\cdot W\\left(R^{b} / \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ and $e$ maps to 0 in $W\\left(R^{b} / \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$, we have $p(1-p d) \\in\\left(p^{2}\\right)$ in $W\\left(R^{b} / \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$, but this is a contradiction. Thus, $\\delta(b)$ is a unit and $b \\in K$ is a distinguished element. Then, $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{S_{\\lambda}}\\right)$ is generated by $b$ for every $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$, and we see that $K$ is generated by $b$.\n\nThe above proof also justifies the following construction.\nDefinition 4.23. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a perfectoid formal scheme. The tilting of $\\mathfrak{X}$ is a perfect formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}^{b}$ such that $\\left|\\mathfrak{X}^{b}\\right|=|\\mathfrak{X}|$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}^{b}}(U)=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}(U)^{b}$ for every affine open subspace $U \\subset|\\mathfrak{X}|$.\n\nThe tilting equivalence naturally extends to the category of perfectoid formal schemes.\nProposition 4.24. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring. The category of perfectoid formal schemes over $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is equivalent to the category of perfect formal schemes over $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R^{b}\\right)$. For a perfectoid formal scheme $\\mathfrak{X}$ over $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with a tilting $\\mathfrak{X}^{b}$ over $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R^{b}\\right)$, there is an isomorphism $\\mathfrak{X} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)} \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I) \\cong \\mathfrak{X}^{b} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R^{b}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R^{b} / I^{b}\\right)$ for every ideal of definition $I \\subset R$ with $p \\in I$. Moreover, there is an isomorphism $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ} \\cong\\left(\\mathfrak{X}^{b}\\right)^{\\circ}$.\n\nProof. The first claim follows since the functor $\\mathfrak{X} \\mapsto \\mathfrak{X}^{b}$ is an equivalence by Proposition 4.12. For the remaining claims, we may assume that $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(S)$. Since $\\mathfrak{X}^{b}=\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S^{b}\\right)$ and $S / I S \\cong S^{b} /(I S)^{b}$, we have $\\mathfrak{X} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}(R)} \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I) \\cong \\mathfrak{X}^{b} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(R^{b}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R^{b} / I^{b}\\right)$. We have an isomorphism $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{b}\\right)$ by Proposition 4.12.\n\nIn the above situation, we say that $\\mathfrak{X}$ is the untilt of $\\mathfrak{X}^{b}$ over $R$. Since $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ} \\cong\\left(\\mathfrak{X}^{b}\\right)^{\\circ}, \\mathfrak{X}$ is thick if and only if $\\mathfrak{X}^{b}$ is thick.\n4.5. Fully faithfulness of $v$-sheafification. In this section, we study the fully faithfulness of the $v$-sheafification functor. First, we recall the following result.\n\nProposition 4.25. ([SW20, Proposition 18.3.1]) The functor $X \\mapsto X^{\\circ}$ from perfect schemes of characteristic $p$ to small $v$-sheaves on Perf is fully faithful.\n\nWe extend this result to the category of perfectoid formal schemes. For this, we apply continuous arc-descent (Proposition 4.17).\nLemma 4.26. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring and let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition. There exists a set of continuous homomorphisms $\\left\\{R \\rightarrow V_{\\lambda}\\right\\}_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda}$ with $V_{\\lambda}$ a p-complete discrete valuation ring with an algebraically closed fraction field such that the complete I-adic ring $S=\\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} V_{\\lambda}$ satisfies that $R \\rightarrow S$ is a continuous arc-cover and $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is a v-cover.\nProof. For each point $x \\in|\\operatorname{Spd}(R)|$, take a continuous homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V_{x}$ with $V_{x}$ a $p$ complete discrete valuation ring with an algebraically closed fraction field such that $x$ is the image of the closed point along $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(V_{x}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right], V_{x}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ with $\\varpi \\in V_{x}$ a pseudo-uniformizer. Let $S=\\prod_{x \\in|\\operatorname{Spd}(R)|} V_{x}$. The map $|\\operatorname{Spd}(S)| \\rightarrow|\\operatorname{Spd}(R)|$ is surjective, so $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective by [Gle24, Lemma 2.26] and [Sch17, Lemma 12.11]. Note that $R \\rightarrow S$ is automatically a continuous arc-cover since each homomorphism $R \\rightarrow V$ to a valuation ring $V$ of rank 1 corresponds to a point $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(V\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right], V\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ with $\\varpi \\in V$ a pseudo-uniformizer.\n\nProposition 4.27. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a perfectoid formal scheme and let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ be a formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The map $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)}(\\mathfrak{X}, \\mathfrak{Y}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)}\\left(\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}, \\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}\\right)$ is bijective.\nProof. By following the argument given in the proof of [AGLR22, Theorem 2.16], we may assume that $\\mathfrak{X}$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}$ are affine. Let $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}=\\operatorname{Spf}(A)$ with $R$ a complete adic perfectoid ring. Let $f: \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ be an arbitrary map. Let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition and take a continuous arc-cover $R \\rightarrow S=\\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} V_{\\lambda}$ as in Lemma 4.26. For each $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda,\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\lambda}$ denotes the continuous valuation on $R$ corresponding to $V_{\\lambda}$. Let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in R$ be a finite set of generators of $I$. Take a decomposition $\\Lambda=\\prod_{0 \\leq i \\leq r} \\Lambda_{i}$ so that $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\lambda}$ is discrete for $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda_{0}$ and $\\left|f_{j}\\right|_{\\lambda} \\leq\\left|f_{i}\\right|_{\\lambda} \\neq 0$ for $1 \\leq i, j \\leq r$ and $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda_{i}$. Let $S_{i}=\\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda_{i}} V_{\\lambda}$. First, the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{0}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is represented by a unique homomorphism $f_{0}: A \\rightarrow A_{\\text {red }}^{\\text {perf }} \\rightarrow R_{\\text {red }} \\rightarrow S_{0}$ by [SW20, Proposition 18.3.1]. For $1 \\leq i \\leq r$, the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{i}\\left[\\frac{1}{f_{i}}\\right], S_{i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is represented by a unique continuous homomorphism $f_{i}: A \\rightarrow S_{i}$. By [Gle24, Proposition 4.9], $f_{i}$ represents the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$. The product $\\left(f_{i}\\right)_{0 \\leq i \\leq r}: A \\rightarrow \\prod_{0 \\leq i \\leq r} S_{i}=S$ represents the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$. Thus, we see that $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is represented by a unique continuous homomorphism $A \\rightarrow S$.\n\nTake a continuous arc-cover $g: S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S \\rightarrow S^{\\prime}$ as in Lemma 4.26. Let $i_{1}, i_{2}: S \\rightarrow S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S$ be homomorphisms such that $i_{1}(s)=s \\otimes 1$ and $i_{2}(s)=1 \\otimes s$ for $s \\in S$. Since the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is represented by a unique continuous homomorphism $A \\rightarrow S^{\\prime}$, we have $g \\circ i_{1} \\circ\\left(f_{i}\\right)=g \\circ i_{2} \\circ\\left(f_{i}\\right)$. Since $g$ is injective and the equalizer of $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ is $R$\n\nby Corollary 4.18, we see that the product $\\left(f_{i}\\right)$ factors through $R \\subset S$. By Corollary 4.20, $\\left(f_{i}\\right)$ induces a continuous homomorphism $A \\rightarrow R$ and we see that it represents $f$ by the surjectivity of $\\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$.\n4.6. Analytic locus. In this section, we study analytic loci of perfectoid formal schemes and prove a perfectoid analogue of [Lou17, Proposition 3].\n\nLemma 4.28. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring and let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$ be elements of $R^{b}$ such that $\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right) \\subset R^{b}$ is open and $\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right) \\subset R$ is open. Let $J \\subset R^{b}$ be the minimum $F$-standard ideal containing $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$. We have $\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{r} \\cdot\\left(J^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n} \\subset\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n}$ for every $n \\geq 0$.\n\nProof. As in [Tak25, Definition 2.3], an element of $J$ can be written as a linear combination of elements $f_{1}^{a_{1}} \\cdots f_{r}^{a_{r}}$ with $a_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq r} a_{i}=1$. Thus, as in Lemma 4.2, $[J]$ is the $p$-adic closure of the ideal of $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ generated by $\\left[f_{1}\\right]^{a_{1}} \\cdots\\left[f_{r}\\right]^{a_{r}}$ with $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{r}$ as above. By Lemma 4.7, $J^{\\sharp}$ is generated by elements $\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{a_{1}} \\cdots\\left(f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{a_{r}}$ with $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{r}$ as above. Thus, $\\left(J^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n}$ is generated by elements $\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{a_{1}} \\cdots\\left(f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{a_{r}}$ with $a_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq r} a_{i}=n$. Since we have $\\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq r}\\left[a_{i}\\right] \\geq n-r$, we see that $\\left(J^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n} \\subset\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{r}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n-r}$ and the claim holds.\n\nProposition 4.29. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring. For every Tate rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R),\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is a perfectoid affinoid pair.\nProof. By [Hub93, Lemma 3.10], we may assume that $s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}$ lie in the image of $(-)^{\\sharp}: R^{b} \\rightarrow R$. Let $s^{s}, T_{1}^{s}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{s}$ be elements of $R^{b}$ such that $s=\\left(s^{s}\\right)^{\\sharp}$ and $T_{i}=\\left(T_{i}^{s}\\right)^{\\sharp}$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. Let $I \\subset R$ be a finitely generated ideal of definition of $R$ with $p \\in I$. We may take a finite set of generators $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{s}$ of $I^{b}$ such that $f_{1}^{\\sharp}, \\ldots, f_{s}^{\\sharp}$ generate $I$. By adding $\\left(f_{1}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{N}, \\ldots,\\left(f_{s}^{\\sharp}\\right)^{N}$ to $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}$ for sufficiently large $N \\geq 0$, we may assume that $T_{1}^{s}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{s}$ generate an open ideal.\n\nFirst, we show that $\\left(R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle, R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is a complete perfect Tate affinoid pair. By Proposition 4.19, the inverse of the Frobenius on $R^{b}$ is continuous, so $R^{b} \\xrightarrow{x \\mapsto x^{1 / p}} R^{b} \\rightarrow$ $R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$ factors through $R^{b} \\rightarrow R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$ by the universality of $R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$. It gives the inverse to the Frobenius on $R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$ and we see that $R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$ is perfect. In particular, $\\left(R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle, R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{s} \\ldots T_{r}^{s}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is uniform by [SW20, Proposition 6.1.6].\n\nNext, we show that $\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is uniform. Let $a \\in R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$be an arbitrary element. The $s$-adic completion $R\\left[\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ of $R\\left[\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]$ is a ring of definition of $R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle$. It is enough to show that $s^{k} a \\in R\\left[\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ for some $k \\geq 0$ independent of $a$. Since $R[1 / s]$ is dense in $R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle$, we may replace $a$ by an element of $R[1 / s]$. Moreover, the image of $(-)^{\\sharp}: R^{b} \\rightarrow R$ is dense, so we may assume that $a=b^{\\sharp} / s^{n}$ for some $b \\in R^{b}$ and $n \\geq 1$. Now, since $a \\in R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$, we have $\\left|b^{\\sharp}\\right| \\leq\\left|s^{n}\\right|$ for every $|\\cdot| \\in R\\left(\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$.\n\nBy the tilting equivalence between $R$ and $R^{b}$ (see the proof of Proposition 4.19), we have $|b| \\leq\\left|\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{n}\\right|$ for every $|\\cdot| \\in R^{b}\\left(\\frac{T_{1}^{a} \\ldots T_{r}^{b}}{s^{b}}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{b}\\right)$. Then, we have $b /\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{n} \\in R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{a} \\ldots T_{r}^{b}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle^{+}$and since $R^{b}\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1}^{a} \\ldots T_{r}^{b}}{s^{b}}\\right\\rangle$ is uniform, we have $\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{k} b /\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{n} \\in R^{b}\\left[\\frac{T_{1}^{a} \\ldots T_{r}^{b}}{s^{b}}\\right]$ for some $k \\geq 0$ independent of $a$. Thus, by replacing $b$ and $n$, we may assume that $\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{k} b \\in\\left(s^{b}, T_{1}^{a}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{b}\\right)^{n}$. Let $J \\subset R^{b}$ be the minimum $F$-standard ideal containing $\\left(s^{b}, T_{1}^{a}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{b}\\right)$. By Lemma 4.2, $\\left[\\left(s^{b}\\right)^{k} b\\right]$ lies in the $p$-adic closure of $[J]^{n}$ in $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)$. It follows that $s^{k} b^{\\sharp} \\in\\left(J^{\\sharp}\\right)^{n}$. By Lemma 4.28, we have $s^{k+r+1} b^{\\sharp} \\in\\left(s, T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right)^{n}$. It follows that $s^{k+r+1} b^{\\sharp} / s^{n} \\in R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right]$.\n\nFinally, we show that $\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is a perfectoid affinoid pair. Let $J \\subset R^{b}$ be the minimum $F$-standard ideal containing $s^{b}, T_{1}^{a}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{b}$. Then, $R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right] \\subset R^{b}\\left[1 / s^{b}\\right]$ is perfect and its $s^{b}$-adic completion $R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ is a ring of definition of $R^{b}\\left(\\frac{T_{1}^{a} \\ldots T_{r}^{b}}{s^{b}}\\right)$. Moreover, $W\\left(R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right]\\right) \\subset W\\left(R^{b}\\left[1 / s^{b}\\right]\\right)$ is the $p$-adic completion of $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\left[\\left[J J /\\left[s^{b}\\right]\\right] \\subset W\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\left[1 /\\left[s^{b}\\right]\\right]$. By Lemma 4.3, $W\\left(R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right]^{\\wedge}\\right)$ is the $\\left(p,\\left[s^{b}\\right]\\right)$-adic completion of $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\left[\\left[J J /\\left[s^{b}\\right]\\right]\\right.$. We see from the tilting equivalence between $R$ and $R^{b}$ that the composition $W\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle$ induces $W\\left(R^{b}\\right)\\left[[J J /\\left[s^{b}\\right]\\right] \\rightarrow R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$. Since $\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$is uniform, it induces a continuous homomorphism $W\\left(R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right]^{\\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$.\n\nLet $S$ be the untilt of $R^{b}\\left[J / s^{b}\\right]^{\\wedge}$ over $R$. From the previous homomorphism, we have $S \\rightarrow R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}$. Since $s^{b}$ is a topologically nilpotent non-zero-divisor of $S^{b}, s$ is a topologically nilpotent non-zero-divisor of $S$. Let $S^{+} \\subset S[1 / s]$ be the integral closure of $S$. Then, $\\left(S[1 / s], S^{+}\\right)$is a perfectoid affinoid pair and we have a continuous homomorphism $\\left(S[1 / s], S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right)$. It is enough to show that this map is an isomorphism. By the tilting equivalence between $R$ and $R^{b}$, the composition $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S[1 / s], S^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spa}(S) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$ factors through the rational subdomain $R\\left(\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$. From the universality, we get a continuous homomorphism $\\left(R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle, R\\left\\langle\\frac{T_{1} \\ldots T_{r}}{s}\\right\\rangle^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(S[1 / s], S^{+}\\right)$. It is easy to see that this is the inverse to the previous map by looking at the image of elements of the form $b^{\\sharp} / s^{n} \\in S$ with $b \\in J^{n}$.\n\nIn particular, the analytic locus of a perfectoid formal scheme is a perfectoid space.\nProposition 4.30. Let $R$ be a thick complete adic perfectoid ring. The homomorphism $R=\\Gamma(\\operatorname{Spf}(R), \\mathcal{O}) \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is a homeomorphism onto the image and the image contains $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nProof. First, we show that $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is injective. Suppose that $a \\in R$ maps to 0 . We take a continuous arc-cover $R \\rightarrow S=\\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} V_{\\lambda}$ as in Lemma 4.26. It is enough to show that the image of $a$ in $V_{\\lambda}$ is zero for every $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. Let $K_{\\lambda}=\\operatorname{Frac}\\left(V_{\\lambda}\\right)$ and consider the map $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$. If it factors through $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$, the claim follows from our assumption on $a$. Otherwise, $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)$ factors through $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)$. It is enough to show that the restriction of $a$ to $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ is zero. Now, since $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is thick, the specialization map of $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is surjective. Thus, for every point $x \\in \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)$,\n\nthere is a point $\\operatorname{Spa}(K, V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ specializing to $x$. Since the pullback of $a$ along $\\operatorname{Spf}(V) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is zero, we see that $a$ is zero at $x$. Since $R_{\\text {red }}$ is reduced, the restriction of $a$ to $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ is zero and we get the claim.\n\nNext, we show that the image of $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$contains $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\right)$. For each $a \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\right)$, we define $a_{\\lambda} \\in V_{\\lambda}^{\\infty}$ for every $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$ so that $a_{\\lambda}$ is the pullback of $a$ along $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ if $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right)$ is an analytic point of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)$, and $a_{\\lambda}=0$ otherwise. The collection $\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda}$ defines an element of $S$. We show that it descends to $R$.\n\nLet $i_{1}, i_{2}: S \\rightarrow S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S$ be homomorphisms such that $i_{1}(s)=s \\otimes 1$ and $i_{2}(s)=1 \\otimes s$ for $s \\in S$. Let $b=i_{1}\\left(\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)-i_{2}\\left(\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) \\in S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S$. The restriction of $\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)$ to $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }}$ is equal to the pullback of $a$ along $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$, so the restriction of $b$ to $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is zero. Moreover, the restriction of $\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)$ to $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(S_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ is zero since $a \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\right)$ and $a_{\\lambda}=0$ when $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right)$ is a discrete point of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)$. Thus, the restriction of $b$ to $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\left(S \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S\\right)_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ is zero. By the same argument as in the proof of injectivity, we see that $b=0$. Thus, the element $\\left(a_{\\lambda}\\right)$ descends to $R$. It follows from [Sch17, Theorem 8.7] that it maps to $a$ under $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$since $\\operatorname{Spa}(S)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is a $v$-cover of perfectoid spaces.\n\nFinally, we prove that $R \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is a homeomorphism onto the image. Since $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is a perfectoid space, and in particular uniform, $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda^{\\text {an }}} V_{\\lambda}$ is a homeomorphism onto the image with $\\Lambda^{\\text {an }} \\subset \\Lambda$ consisting of indices of analytic points $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(K_{\\lambda}, V_{\\lambda}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ (see e.g. [SW20, Theorem 5.2.1]). It suffices to show that the composition $R \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} V_{\\lambda} \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda^{\\text {an }}} V_{\\lambda}$ is a homeomorphism onto the image. This follows from Proposition 4.19 since discrete valuations on $R$ do not contribute to the supremum over $\\mathcal{M}_{I}(R)$ for an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$.\n\nCorollary 4.31. Let $R$ be a complete adic perfectoid ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. Then, $R$ is thick if and only if $R$ is distinguished.\n\nProof. Since $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is $I$-torsion free, the claim follows from Lemma 3.6 and Proposition 4.30 .\n\nRemark 4.32.

Dilatation THEORY OF $v$-SHEAVES \n\n5.1. Very good covers. In this section, we introduce very good covers of complete adic rings as preliminaries to good covers.\n\nLet $R$ be a complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$. Let $R_{\\bullet}=(R=$ $\\left.R_{0} \\hookrightarrow R_{1} \\hookrightarrow \\cdots\\right)$ be a sequence of rings with injective transition maps and let $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}=(\\{1\\}=$ $\\left.\\Gamma_{0} \\leftarrow \\Gamma_{1} \\leftarrow \\cdots\\right)$ be a sequence of finite groups with surjective transition maps. We set $\\Gamma_{\\infty}=\\lim _{n \\geq 0} \\Gamma_{n}$ and $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\Gamma_{m} \\rightarrow \\Gamma_{n}\\right)$ for every $0 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq \\infty$.\n\nDefinition 5.1. An action of $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$ on $R_{\\bullet}$ is a family of an action of $\\Gamma_{n}$ on $R_{n}$ for each $n \\geq 0$ such that the action of $\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}$ on $R_{n+1}$ is an action as an $R_{n}$-algebra for every $n \\geq 0$.\n\nIn particular, an action of $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$ on $R_{\\bullet}$ induces an action of $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ on $R_{m}$ over $R_{n}$ for every $0 \\leq n \\leq m<\\infty$.\n\nDefinition 5.2. A pair $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ with an action of $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$ on $R_{\\bullet}$ is a very good cover of a complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ if\n(1) the action of $\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}$ on $R_{n+1}$ over $R_{n}$ satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12,\n(2) $R_{n+1} / R_{n}$ is a finite projective $R_{n}$-module for every $n \\geq 0$, and\n(3) the $I$-completed colimit $R_{\\infty}=\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0}^{\\wedge} R_{n}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring.\n\nWe list some basic properties of very good covers.\nLemma 5.3. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a very good cover of a complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$.\n(1) $R_{m}$ is finite projective over $R_{n}$ and the action of $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ on $R_{m}$ over $R_{n}$ satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12 for every $0 \\leq n \\leq m<\\infty$.\n(2) $R_{n}$ is I-adically complete and is a direct summand of $R_{\\infty}$ as an $R_{n}$-module for every $n \\geq 0$.\n\nProof. Let $S_{0}=R_{0}=R$ and $S_{n}=R_{n} / R_{n-1}$ for $n \\geq 1$. Since $S_{n}$ is finite projective over $R_{n}$, we can take a decomposition $R_{n+1}=R_{n} \\oplus S_{n+1}$ and we have $R_{n}=S_{0} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus S_{n}$. In particular, $R_{m}=R_{n} \\oplus S_{n+1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus S_{m}$ and $R_{m}$ is finite projective over $R_{n}$. Then, (1) follows from Lemma 3.13. Moreover, $R_{n}$ is finite projective over $R$ and $R_{n}$ is $I$-adically complete. Then, we have $R_{\\infty}=\\operatorname{colim}_{m \\geq n}^{\\wedge}\\left(R_{n} \\oplus S_{n+1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus S_{m}\\right)=R_{n} \\oplus\\left(\\widehat{\\oplus}_{m>n} S_{m}\\right)$, so $R_{n}$ is a direct summand of $R_{\\infty}$ as an $R_{n}$-module.\n\nLemma 5.4. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a very good cover of a complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. The map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is proper and a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ for every $0 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq \\infty$.\n\nProof. As in the proof of Proposition 3.15, $R_{m}$ is integral over $R_{n}$ and we have the claim for $m<\\infty$ by Lemma 3.3 and Proposition 3.15. Since properness and geometric quotients are preserved under limits (apply [Sch17, Proposition 18.3] for the former, and see Proposition 3.16 for the latter), we have the claim for $m=\\infty$.\n\nThe main source of complete adic rings admitting very good covers is as follows.\nProposition 5.5. Let $E$ be a complete discrete valuation field over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with perfect residue field and let $O_{E}$ be the ring of integers of $E$. For every $r \\geq 0, O_{E}\\left\\langle T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right\\rangle$ admits a very good cover.\n\nProof. Let $\\pi \\in O_{E}$ be a uniformizer of $E$. For $n \\geq 0$, we set $E_{n}=E\\left[\\pi^{1 / p^{n}}, \\zeta_{p^{n}}\\right]$ with $\\zeta_{p^{n}}$ a $p^{n}$-th root of unity. We take the family $\\left\\{\\zeta_{p^{n}}\\right\\}$ so that $\\zeta_{p^{n+1}}^{p}=\\zeta_{p^{n}}$. Then, $E_{n}$ is a finite Galois extension of $E$. Let $O_{E_{n}}$ be the ring of integers of $E_{n}$ and let $R_{n}=O_{E_{n}}\\left\\langle T_{1}^{1 / p^{n}}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{1 / p^{n}}\\right\\rangle$,\n\n$\\Gamma_{n}=\\operatorname{Gal}\\left(E_{n} / E\\right) \\times\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / p^{n}\\right)^{\\oplus r}$. There is a natural inclusion $R_{n} \\hookrightarrow R_{n+1}$ and a natural surjection $\\Gamma_{n+1} \\nrightarrow \\Gamma_{n}$ for every $n \\geq 0$. Moreover, there is an action of $\\Gamma_{n}$ on $R_{n}$ such that the action of $\\left(\\sigma, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{r}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{Gal}\\left(E_{n} / E\\right) \\times\\left(\\mathbb{Z} / p^{n}\\right)^{\\oplus r}$ sends $x \\in O_{E_{n}}$ to $\\sigma(x)$, and sends $T_{i}^{1 / p^{\\sigma}}$ to $\\zeta_{p^{n}}^{a_{i}} T_{i . .}^{1 / p^{\\sigma}}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. This defines an action of $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$ on $R_{\\bullet}$. It is easy to see that $R_{n}=R_{n+1}^{\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}}$ and $R_{n+1} / R_{n}$ is finite free over $R_{n}$ (since $O_{E_{n+1}} / O_{E_{n}}$ is finite free over $O_{E_{n}}$ ). It is enough to show that $R_{\\infty}$ is a perfectoid ring. Consider the $p$-completed colimit $O_{E_{\\infty}}=\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0}^{\\wedge} O_{E_{n}}$ and let $E_{\\infty}=O_{E_{\\infty}}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$. Then, $E_{\\infty}$ is a perfectoid field and $O_{E_{\\infty}}$ is a perfectoid ring. Since $R_{\\infty}$ is $\\pi$-torsion free, it is enough by [BMS18, Lemma 3.10] to check that the Frobenius $R_{\\infty} / \\pi^{1 / p} R_{\\infty} \\rightarrow R_{\\infty} / \\pi R_{\\infty}$ is an isomorphism. Since $O_{E_{\\infty}}$ is a perfectoid ring, it follows from the description $R_{\\infty} / \\pi R_{\\infty}=\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0}\\left(O_{E_{n}} / \\pi O_{E_{n}}\\right)\\left[T_{1}^{1 / p^{r}}, \\ldots, T_{r}^{1 / p^{r}}\\right]$.\n\nThe class of complete adic rings admitting very good covers is closed under \u00e9tale localization and completion.\nLemma 5.6. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$. Let $S$ be an I-adically complete I-completely \u00e9tale $R$-algebra. If $R$ admits a very good cover, $S$ admits a very good cover.\nProof. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a very good cover of $R$. Let $S_{\\bullet}=R_{\\bullet} \\otimes_{R} S$. The condition in Lemma 3.12 is stable under base change, so the action of $\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}$ on $S_{n+1}$ over $S_{n}$ satisfies that condition. By construction, $S_{n+1} / S_{n}$ is finite projective over $S_{n}$. Moreover, $S_{\\infty}=R_{\\infty} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring by Lemma 4.13.\nLemma 5.7. Let $R$ be a complete adic ring over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and let $J \\subset R$ be a finitely generated open ideal. If $R$ admits a very good cover, the $J$-adic completion $R^{\\wedge}$ admits a very good cover. Moreover, $R^{\\wedge}$ admits a very good cover as a p-adic ring if $R$ is p-torsion free, p-adic and Noetherian and $R / p R$ is $F$-finite.\nProof. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a very good cover of $R$. Let $R_{\\bullet}^{\\wedge}=R_{\\bullet} \\otimes_{R} R^{\\wedge}$. The condition in Lemma 3.12 is stable under base change, so the action of $\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}$ on $R_{n+1}^{\\wedge}$ over $R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ satisfies that condition. By construction, $R_{n+1}^{\\wedge} / R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ is finite projective over $R_{n}^{\\wedge}$. Moreover, $R_{\\infty}^{\\wedge}$ is isomorphic to the $J$-adic completion of $R_{\\infty}$, so $R_{\\infty}^{\\wedge}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring by Corollary 4.11. Thus, $\\left(R_{\\bullet}^{\\wedge}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a very good cover of the $J$-adic ring $R^{\\wedge}$.\n\nWe show the second claim. It is enough to show that the $p$-adic completion $\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0}^{\\wedge} R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ is perfectoid. Since $R_{\\infty}$ is perfectoid, we can take an element $\\pi \\in R_{\\infty}$ such that $\\pi^{p}=p u$ for some $u \\in R_{\\infty}^{\\times}$. We may approximate $\\pi$ by an element of $R_{n}$ for sufficiently large $n$ and replace $R$ with $R_{n}$ to assume that $\\pi \\in R$.\n\nSince $R$ is Noetherian, $R \\rightarrow R^{\\wedge}$ is flat, so $R_{\\bullet}^{\\wedge}$ is $p$-torsion free. By [BMS18, Lemma 3.10 (ii)], it is enough to show that the Frobenius $\\operatorname{colim} R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi R_{n}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{colim} R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ is an isomorphism. Since $R_{\\infty}$ is perfectoid, $\\operatorname{colim} R_{n} / \\pi R_{n} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{colim} R_{n} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}$ is an isomorphism. Since $R_{n}$ is a direct summand of $R_{\\infty}, R_{n} / \\pi R_{n} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{colim}_{m \\geq n} R_{m} / \\pi R_{m}$ is injective, so the Frobenius $R_{n} / \\pi R_{n} \\rightarrow R_{n} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}$ is injective. Since $R \\rightarrow R^{\\wedge}$ is flat, $R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi R_{n}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ is\n\ninjective, so $\\operatorname{colim} R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi R_{n}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{colim} R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}^{\\wedge}$ is injective. On the other hand, since $R / p R$ is $F$-finite, the composition $R \\rightarrow R / \\pi R \\rightarrow R / \\pi^{p} R \\rightarrow R_{n} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}$ is finite. Thus, for every $n \\geq 0$, there is $m \\geq n$ such that the image of the Frobenius $R_{m} / \\pi R_{m} \\rightarrow R_{m} / \\pi^{p} R_{m}$ contains $R_{n} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}$. By passing to the $J$-adic completion, we see that the image of the Frobenius $R_{m}^{\\wedge} / \\pi R_{m}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow R_{m}^{\\wedge} / \\pi^{p} R_{m}^{\\wedge}$ contains $R_{n}^{\\wedge} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}^{\\wedge}$. In particular, $\\operatorname{colim} R_{n} / \\pi R_{n} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{colim} R_{n} / \\pi^{p} R_{n}$ is surjective.\n\nThanks to Lemma 5.6, the following notion is purely local in the Zariski topology.\nDefinition 5.8. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. We say that $\\mathfrak{X}$ admits a very good cover if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is Zariski locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a complete adic ring admitting a very good cover.\n\nThe main source of formal schemes admitting very good covers is as follows.\nProposition 5.9. Let $E$ be a complete discrete valuation field over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with perfect residue field and let $O_{E}$ be the ring of integers of $E$. Every p-adic smooth formal $O_{E}$-scheme admits a very good cover.\nProof. After Zariski localization, every $p$-completely smooth $O_{E}$-algebra is $p$-completely \u00e9tale over $O_{E}\\left\\langle T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right\\rangle$ for some $r \\geq 0$ (by the topological invariance of \u00e9tale sites). Thus, the claim follows from Proposition 5.5 and Lemma 5.6.\nRemark 5.10. By Lemma 5.7 and Proposition 5.9, formal schemes admitting very good covers arise as the completion of smooth schemes. Here are arithmetically important examples: the $p$-adic completion of integral models of Shimura varieties at hyperspecial levels, and Rapoport-Zink spaces at hyperspecial levels with the $p$-adic uniformization (see [Mic20, Corollary 4.9]).\n5.2. Good covers. In this section, we introduce good covers of reduced excellent complete adic rings, which are refinements of very good covers modeled on analytic loci. They satisfy a minimal set of properties of very good covers needed in the proof of our representability criterion.\n\nLet $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $p \\in I \\subset R$. Let $R_{\\bullet}=\\left(R=R_{0} \\rightarrow R_{1} \\rightarrow \\cdots\\right)$ be a sequence of reduced finite $R$-algebras. Let $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}=(\\{1\\}=$ $\\left.\\Gamma_{0} \\leftarrow \\Gamma_{1} \\leftarrow \\cdots\\right)$ be a sequence of finite groups with surjective transition maps that acts on $R_{\\bullet}$ in the sense of Definition 5.1. To simplify the notation, for every $n \\geq 0$ and every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$, the pullback of $U_{n}$ in $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{m}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is denoted by $U_{m}$ for every $m \\geq n$. Later, this notation is also used for $m=\\infty$.\n\nAs a refinement of the condition (1) in Definition 5.2, we first put the following condition: (quot) for every $n \\geq 0, \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n+1}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{n+1}^{n}$, and for every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$, the pullback $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ is injective and satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12 with respect to the $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$-action.\n\nThe latter condition of (quot) is analytically local on $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$.\nLemma 5.11. If there is a covering $\\left\\{V_{n, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ by Tate rational subdomains such that $\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{m, i}\\right)$ is injective and satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12, then every Tate rational domain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ satisfies the same conditions.\nProof. Since $R_{m}$ is finite over $R_{n}$, we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\otimes_{R_{n}} R_{m}$. First, suppose that $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$ for some $i \\in I$. Then, we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\otimes_{\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{m, i}\\right)$. Since $V_{n, i}$ is strongly Noetherian, $\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ is flat (see [Hub96, Lemma 1.7.6]). Thus, $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ is injective. It also satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12 since that condition is stable under base change. Thus, the case where $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$ is done.\n\nNow, by refining the covering $\\left\\{V_{n, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$, we may suppose that $U_{n}$ is covered by a collection $\\left\\{V_{n, j}\\right\\}_{j \\in J}$ for some $J \\subset I$. Since $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, j}\\right)$ is injective and the same holds for $U_{m}, \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ is injective. Moreover, we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right) \\cap \\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, j}\\right)$ in $\\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{m, j}\\right)$, so the condition in Lemma 3.12 is satisfied by Lemma 3.14.\n\nAs a refinement of the condition (3) in Definition 5.2, we next put the following condition: (perfd) $\\lim _{n \\geq 0} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is represented by a complete $I$-adic perfectoid $R$ algebra $R_{\\infty}$.\nBy Proposition 4.27, we get a homomorphism $R_{n} \\rightarrow R_{\\infty}$ for every $n \\geq 0$. Since $R_{n}$ is reduced and excellent, and $R_{\\infty}$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring, we have a sequence of stably uniform analytic adic spaces (see Lemma 2.4 and Proposition 4.29)\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{1}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{0}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}}=\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nBy construction, the $v$-sheafification of this sequence is a limit sequence. We will impose that this is a limit sequence of analytic adic spaces. First, we put a density condition:\n(density) for every $n \\geq 0$ and every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$, the image of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\leq m<\\infty} \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is dense.\nAnother condition on the sequence is the existence of functorial and uniform sections. It is one of the essential conditions and is a refinement of the condition (2) in Definition 5.2.\n(unifsec) for every $n \\geq 0$ and every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$, we have a continuous $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$-linear section $s_{n, U_{n}}: \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ of the pullback. The family $\\left\\{s_{n, U_{n}}\\right\\}$ is functorial in $U_{n}$ for fixed $n$, and uniform in $n$ for fixed $U_{n}$ in a sense that there is an open ideal $\\mathcal{J} \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ that maps to $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ under $s_{m, U_{m}}$ for every $m \\geq n$.\nFrom now on, a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}$ of the pullback is always assumed to be $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ linear. We will show that the above two conditions are analytically local.\nLemma 5.12. Let $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ be a Tate rational subdomain with a uniform family of continuous sections $\\left\\{s_{m, U_{m}}\\right\\}$ for $m \\geq n$. Then, the image of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\leq m<\\infty} \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is dense if and only if $\\left\\{s_{m, U_{m}}(a)\\right\\}_{m \\geq n}$ converges to $a$ in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ for every $a \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nProof. The if direction is obvious. We show the only if direction. Let $a \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ be an arbitrary element. By assumption, there is a sequence $\\left\\{b_{m}\\right\\}_{m \\geq n}$ with $b_{m} \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ that converges to $a$ in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$. Let $\\mathcal{J} \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ be an open ideal that maps to $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ under $s_{m, U_{m}}$ for every $m \\geq n$. For every $N \\geq 0$, there is $k \\geq 0$ such that for every $m \\geq k$, we have $a-b_{m} \\in I^{N} \\cdot \\mathcal{J}$. Then, we have $s_{m, U_{m}}(a)-b_{m} \\in I^{N} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ and $a-s_{m, U_{m}}(a) \\in I^{N} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ for $m \\geq k$. Since $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is $I$-adic, $\\left\\{s_{m, U_{m}}(a)\\right\\}$ converges to $a$.\nLemma 5.13. The conditions (density) and (unifsec) hold if and only if there is a covering $\\left\\{V_{0, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ with a family of continuous sections $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, i}}\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0, i \\in I}$ such that\n(1) the family $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, i}}\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0}$ is uniform in $n$ for each $i \\in I$,\n(2) $s_{n, V_{n, i}}$ and $s_{n, V_{n, j}}$ induce the same continuous section $\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{\\infty, i} \\cap V_{\\infty, j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, i} \\cap V_{n, j}\\right)$ for every $i, j \\in I$, and\n(3) $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, i}}(a)\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0}$ converges to a in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{\\infty, i}\\right)$ for every $a \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{\\infty, i}\\right)$ and $i \\in I$.\n\nBefore going to the proof, we explain the condition (2) more precisely. For each $i \\in I$, we define $s_{n, U_{n}}$ for every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$. Let $\\varpi \\in \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)$ be a topologically nilpotent unit. By the universality and uniformity of rational localization, we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong\\left(\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{\\infty, i}\\right) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) /\\overline{(\\varpi \\text {-torsion })}\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$. Take an open ideal $\\mathcal{J}_{i} \\subset$ $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{\\infty, i}\\right)$ as in (unifsec). Then, the base change $\\mathcal{J} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ of $s_{n, V_{n, i}}$ induces a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}$. The condition (2) says that this construction gives the same continuous section $s_{n, V_{n, i} \\cap V_{n, j}}$ for different $i, j \\in I$. In this case, we see that $s_{n, U_{n}}$ is independent of the choice of $i \\in I$ such that $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$.\nProof. The only if direction follows from Lemma 5.12. We will prove the converse direction.\nBy the above remark, the condition (2) enables us to define a functorial family of continuous sections $s_{n, U_{n}}$ for $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$ for some $i \\in I$. For every $m \\geq n$, the image of $\\mathcal{J} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{m, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ contains the image of $\\mathcal{J} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ in $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$, so the family $\\left\\{s_{n, U_{n}}\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0}$ is uniform in $n$. Moreover, (density) holds for $U_{n}$ since we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong$ $\\left(\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{\\infty, i}\\right) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(V_{n, i}\\right)} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) /\\overline{(\\varpi \\text {-torsion })}\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$. Thus, (density) and (unifsec) hold for $U_{n} \\subset V_{n, i}$ for some $i \\in I$.\n\nBy refining the covering $\\left\\{V_{n, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$, it is enough to treat the case where $U_{n}$ can be covered by $V_{n, j}$ for some $J \\subset I$. Since the family $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, j}}\\right\\}_{j \\in J}$ is functorial in $V_{n, j}$, we can glue it to a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}$. Moreover, the uniformity of $s_{n, U_{n}}$ in $n$ follows from that of $s_{n, V_{n, j}}$ for every $j \\in J$. Since $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is equipped with the subspace topology of $\\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{\\infty, j}\\right)$, the condition (3) for $U_{n}$ follows from the condition (3) for all $V_{n, j}$. Thus, (density) and (unifsec) hold for $U_{n}$.\nDefinition 5.14. A pair $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a good cover of a reduced excellent complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ if it satisfies (quot), (perfd), (density) and (unifsec).\nLemma 5.15. A very good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ of a reduced excellent complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is a good cover of $R$.\n\nProof. The condition (3) in Definition 5.2 implies that the limit $\\lim _{n \\geq 0} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is represented by $R_{\\infty}=\\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0}^{\\wedge} R_{n}$. Thus, $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (perfd). For every $n \\geq 0$ and every Tate rational subdomain $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, R_{n} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ is flat by [Hub96, Lemma 1.7.6] and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{m}\\right)$ is the base change of $R_{n} \\rightarrow R_{m}$ for every $n \\leq m<\\infty$. Thus, (quot) holds by the condition (1) in Definition 5.2 .\n\nWe will verify (density) and (unifsec). By Lemma 5.3 (2), there is a continuous section $s_{n}: R_{\\infty} \\rightarrow R_{n}$ of the natural inclusion. Let $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ be a Tate rational subdomain and let $\\varpi \\in \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ be a topologically nilpotent unit. Since we have $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong$ $\\left.\\left(R_{\\infty} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R_{n}} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) /\\left(\\varpi\\right.\\right.\\right.$-torsion $\\left.\\left.)\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{\\varpi}\\right]$, (density) holds for $U_{n}$ and $s_{n}$ induces a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}: \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$. As the image of $R_{\\infty} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R_{n}} \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ in $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ maps to $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ under $s_{n, U_{n}}$, we see that $\\left\\{s_{n, U_{n}}\\right\\}_{n \\geq 0}$ is uniform in $n$. Thus, $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (unifsec).\n\nLemma 5.16. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. Let $S$ be an I-adically complete I-completely \u00e9tale R-algebra. If $R$ admits a good cover, $S$ admits a good cover.\n\nProof. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a good cover of $R$. Let $S_{\\bullet}=R_{\\bullet} \\otimes_{R} S$. By Elkik's algebraization theorem (see [Elk73]), $S_{n}$ is isomorphic to the $I$-adic completion of an \u00e9tale $R_{n}$-algebra. For every $0 \\leq n<\\infty, S_{n}$ is a reduced finite $S$-algebra.\n\nNow, $S_{\\infty}=R_{\\bullet} \\widehat{\\otimes}_{R} S$ is a complete adic perfectoid ring by Lemma 4.13 and represents $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}(S)=\\lim _{n \\geq 0} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$. Since the conditions (quot), (density) and (unifsec ) are local by Lemma 5.11 and Lemma 5.13, it is enough to check these conditions for sufficiently small Tate rational subdomains $U_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. In particular, we may assume that $U_{n} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ factors through a Tate rational subdomain $V_{n} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ and is a composition of a finite \u00e9tale morphism to $V_{n}$ and a rational localization. Then, $U_{\\infty} \\cong V_{\\infty} \\times_{V_{n}} U_{n}$ and $s_{n, V_{n}}$ induces a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}$ as in Lemma 5.13. It is easy to see that this construction is functorial and satisfies the density condition as in Lemma 5.13. Moreover, the latter condition of (quot) follows from the fact that $\\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ is flat.\n\nLemma 5.17. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring with an ideal of definition $I \\subset R$. Let $S$ be a reduced finite $R$-algebra that is finite \u00e9tale over $R$ outside $V(I) \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. If $R$ admits a good cover, $S$ admits a good cover.\n\nProof. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a good cover of $R$. Let $S_{n}$ be the reduction of $R_{n} \\otimes_{R} S$ for every $0 \\leq n<\\infty$ and let $S_{\\infty}^{0}$ be the perfectoidization of $R_{\\infty} \\otimes_{R} S$. By [BS22, Theorem 10.9], $S_{\\infty}^{0}$ is a perfectoid ring and $R_{\\infty} \\otimes_{R} S \\rightarrow S_{\\infty}^{0}$ is an isomorphism outside $V(I)$. Let $S_{\\infty}=\\left(S_{\\infty}^{0}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ be the $I$-adic completion. By construction, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}(S)$ and $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (perfd). By the same argument as in Lemma 5.16, we see that $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (quot), (density) and (perfd).\n\nThanks to Lemma 5.16, the following notion is purely local in the Zariski topology.\n\nDefinition 5.18. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. We say that $\\mathfrak{X}$ admits a good cover if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is Zariski locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a reduced excellent complete adic ring admitting a good cover.\n5.3. Affine representability. The aim of this section is to prove the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 5.19. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring admitting a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ and let $I \\subset R$ be an ideal of definition. Let $S_{\\infty}$ be a distinguished complete I-adic perfectoid $R_{\\infty}$-algebra. Suppose that the following conditions hold.\n(1) $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ acts on $S_{\\infty}$ compatibly with the action on $R_{\\infty}$.\n(2) $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an open immersion.\n(3) $S_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$.\n\nThen, there is a good cover $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ of a reduced excellent distinguished complete I-adic ring $S$ with the following conditions.\n(1) There is a $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$-equivariant homomorphism $R_{\\bullet} \\rightarrow S_{\\bullet}$ such that for every $n \\geq 0, S_{n}$ is topologically of finite type over $R_{n}$ and $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is an open immersion.\n(2) There is a $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$-equivariant isomorphism $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\lim _{n \\geq 0} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$ such that the induced map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is represented by the given map $R_{\\infty} \\rightarrow S_{\\infty}$.\n\nFor every $0 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq \\infty$, the map $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is denoted by $\\pi_{m}^{n}$. First, we construct the open subspace of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ that should be equal to $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Let $U_{n} \\subset$ $\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\right|$ be the image of $\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\right| \\subset\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\right|$ under $\\pi_{\\infty}^{n}$.\nLemma 5.20. The subset $U_{n} \\subset\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\right|$ is open and $\\left(\\pi_{m}^{n}\\right)^{-1}\\left(U_{n}\\right)=U_{m}$ for every $m \\geq n$.\nProof. By the condition (quot), $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is a geometric quotient of $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$. Since $U_{\\infty} \\subset\\left|\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)\\right|$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$, we see that $\\left(\\pi_{m}^{n}\\right)^{-1}\\left(U_{n}\\right)=U_{m}$ for every $m \\geq n$. Since $\\pi_{\\infty}^{n}$ is surjective and $U_{\\infty}$ is open, it follows from [Sch17, Proposition 12.9] that $U_{n}$ is open.\n\nFrom now on, $U_{n}$ is identified with the open subspace of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Since $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is quasicompact, $U_{n}$ is quasicompact. Thus, we can take a finite covering $\\left\\{V_{0, j}\\right\\}_{j \\in J}$ of $U_{0}$ by Tate rational subdomains of $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. Its pullback $\\left\\{V_{n, j}\\right\\}_{j \\in J}$ to $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is a finite covering of $U_{n}$ by Tate rational subdomains of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Since the family of continuous sections $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, j}}\\right\\}$ is functorial, we get a continuous section $s_{n, U_{n}}: \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$. Moreover, since the family of continuous sections $\\left\\{s_{n, V_{n, j}}\\right\\}$ is uniform, there is an open ideal $\\mathcal{J} \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ such that $s_{n, U_{n}}(\\mathcal{J}) \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ for every $n \\geq 0$.\n\nLemma 5.21. The image of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is dense.\nProof. The proof of Lemma 5.12 works since $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is $I$-adic by Proposition 4.30.\nNote that the existence of a continuous section implies that $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is a closed embedding. Moreover, $S_{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$ is an open embedding by Proposition 4.30.\n\nLet $S_{n}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\cap S_{\\infty}$ where the intersection is taken inside $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$. Since $\\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right) \\subset$ $S_{\\infty} \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$, we have $\\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\subset S_{n} \\subset \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$. By Lemma 5.21, $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n} \\rightarrow S_{\\infty}$ has a dense image. In particular, the completion of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n}$ with respect to the subspace topology from $S_{\\infty}$ is isomorphic to $S_{\\infty}$. This subspace topology can be identified as follows.\nLemma 5.22. The subspace topology on $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n}$ is the I-adic topology. Moreover, the subspace topology on $S_{n}$ is the I-adic topology for every $n \\geq 0$.\nProof. For every $n, m \\geq 0$, we have $\\left(I^{m} \\cdot \\mathcal{J}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\subset I^{m} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\subset\\left(I^{m} \\cdot \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cap$ $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$. The first inclusion follows from the property of $s_{n, U_{n}}$. Thus, the subspace topology on $S_{n}$ is the $I$-adic topology as $S_{n} \\supset \\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$. The claim for $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n}$ follows by the same argument.\n\nAs a consequence, we can verify the condition (perfd) on $S_{\\bullet}$.\nCorollary 5.23. $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\lim _{n<\\infty} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$.\nProof. For every perfectoid affinoid pair $\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$in characteristic $p$, a map from $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right)$ to $\\lim _{n<\\infty} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$ corresponds to an untilt $\\left(A^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right)$ and a compatible family of continuous homomorphisms $S_{n} \\rightarrow A^{\\sharp+}$. Since $A^{\\sharp+}$ is complete, this family corresponds to a map from the $I$-adic completion of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n}$ to $A^{\\sharp+}$. Thus, we have $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\lim _{n<\\infty} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$.\n\nSince $U_{\\infty}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}, U_{n}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{n}$. Thus, $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ acts on $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$ factoring through $\\Gamma_{n}$. Since $S_{\\infty}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}, \\Gamma_{\\infty}$ acts on $S_{n}$ factoring through $\\Gamma_{n}$. It means that $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$ acts on $S_{\\bullet}$. By construction, we have a $\\Gamma_{\\bullet}$-equivariant homomorphism $R_{\\bullet} \\rightarrow S_{\\bullet}$. We next verify the condition (quot) on $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$.\nLemma 5.24. For every $0 \\leq n \\leq m<\\infty, S_{n} \\rightarrow S_{m}$ is injective and satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12 with respect to the $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$-action.\nProof. By construction, $S_{n} \\rightarrow S_{m}$ is injective. It is enough to show the latter claim. By the condition (quot), $\\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{m, j}\\right)$ satisfies the condition in Lemma 3.12 with respect to the $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$-action. Since we have $\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{m}\\right) \\cap \\prod_{j \\in J} \\mathcal{O}\\left(V_{n, j}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}^{+}\\left(U_{n}\\right)$, the claim follows from Lemma 3.14.\n\nThus, we verify the first condition of (quot) on $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ by Proposition 3.15. In particular, we see from Proposition 3.16 that $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$ is a geometric quotient of $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right)$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$.\nCorollary 5.25. For every $0 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq \\infty, \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ is surjective.\nProof. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ is qcqs by [Gle24, Lemma 2.26], it is enough to show that it is surjective on points. By Lemma 3.9, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$. Thus, for every geometric point $x \\in \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$, both fibers of $x$ in $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{m}\\right)$ and in $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ consist of a single $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$-orbit. The claim follows since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ is $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$-equivariant.\n\nCorollary 5.26. The map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ is an isomorphism onto $U_{n}$.\nProof. By Lemma 5.20, $U_{n}$ is a geometric quotient of $U_{\\infty}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ factors through $U_{n}$. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ is qcqs by [Gle24, Lemma 2.26], $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow U_{n}$ is qcqs. Since both spaces are geometric quotients of $U_{\\infty}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$, it is an isomorphism by Proposition 3.10.\n\nNext, we will verify that $S_{n}$ is topologically of finite type over $R_{n}$. For this, we apply Proposition 2.11 to $S_{n}$. The first condition is verified in Lemma 5.22 and the second condition follows from Corollary 5.26 by [Sch17, Proposition 15.4]. It is enough to verify the last condition.\n\nLemma 5.27. $\\left(S_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$.\nProof. Since $S_{\\infty}$ is isomorphic to the $I$-adic completion of $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n}$, we have $S_{\\infty, \\text { red }} \\cong$ $\\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty} S_{n, \\text { red }}$. Moreover, by the condition (perfd) and [SW20, Proposition 18.3.1], we have $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }} \\cong \\operatorname{colim}_{n<\\infty}\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)^{\\text {perf }}$. Since $S_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$, for some $m \\geq 0$, there is a homomorphism $P_{m}=R_{m, \\text { red }}\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right] \\rightarrow S_{m, \\text { red }}$ such that if we set $P_{n}=R_{n, \\text { red }}\\left[T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right] \\rightarrow S_{n, \\text { red }}$ as the base change of the map for $n \\geq m$, $P_{\\infty}^{\\text {perf }} \\rightarrow S_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ is surjective. Then, the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n, \\text { red }}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)}$ $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(P_{n}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(P_{\\infty}\\right)$ is a closed immersion for $n \\geq$ $m$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n, \\text { red }}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right)$ is injective and surjective by Corollary 5.25 , so it is an isomorphism. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n, \\text { red }}\\right)$ is a $v$-cover, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(P_{n}^{\\text {perf }}\\right)$ is a closed immersion by [Sch17, Proposition 10.11]. By [Gle24, Lemma 3.31], $P_{n}^{\\text {perf }} \\rightarrow S_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ is surjective. Thus, $S_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ for $n \\geq m$.\n\nWe treat the case with $n<m$. Since $R_{m}$ is finite over $R_{n}, S_{m, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$. Since $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ is finite, we can take a finitely generated $R_{n, \\text { red }}$-subalgebra $S^{0} \\subset S_{m, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ stable under $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ so that $S_{0}^{\\text {perf }} \\cong S_{m, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$. Since $R_{n, \\text { red }}$ is Noetherian, $\\left(S^{0}\\right)^{\\Gamma_{m}^{n}}$ is of finite type over $R_{n, \\text { red }}$, so $\\left(S^{0}\\right)^{\\Gamma_{m}^{n}, \\text { perf }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$. Since it represents a geometric quotient of $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{m, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}\\right)$ by $\\Gamma_{m}^{n}$ by Proposition 3.11, $S_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ is isomorphic to $\\left(S^{0}\\right)^{\\Gamma_{m}^{n}, \\text { perf }}$ by [Gle24, Lemma 2.26], Proposition 3.10 and [SW20, Proposition 18.3.1]. Thus, we get the claim.\n\nNow, it follows from Proposition 2.11 that $S_{n}$ is reduced and excellent, topologically of finite type over $R_{n}$ and $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow U_{n}$ is an isomorphism. Since $S_{\\infty}$ is distinguished, $S_{n}$ is distinguished by construction. Let $S=S_{0}$. By Lemma $5.24, S_{n}$ is integral over $S$. Since $R_{n}$ is a finite $R$-algebra, $S_{n}$ is topologically of finite type over $R$, so $S_{n}$ is finite over $S$.\n\nBy Lemma 5.11 and Lemma 5.13, we see that $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (quot), (density) and (unifsec). Thus, we see that $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a good cover.\n\nHere, we record an explicit construction of $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ for a reference.\n\nCorollary 5.28. In Theorem 5.19, $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ can be taken so that $S_{n}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{n}\\right) \\cap S_{\\infty}$ in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(U_{\\infty}\\right)$.\n5.4. Maximal good covers. In this section, we study the properties of good covers satisfying the condition in Corollary 5.28. Here, we repeat the condition.\n(maximal) $R_{\\infty}$ is distinguished and $R_{n} \\rightarrow R_{\\infty} \\cap \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is an isomorphism for every $n \\geq 0$.\nThe intersection is taken inside $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$. Note that $R_{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$ is an open immersion by Proposition 4.30 and $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is a closed immersion by the condition (unifsec).\n\nDefinition 5.29. A pair $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a maximal good cover of a reduced excellent distinguished complete adic ring $R$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ if it is a good cover satisfying (maximal).\n\nWe say that a subring $A$ of a ring $B$ in characteristic $p$ is purely inseparably integrally closed in $B$ if $x^{p} \\in A$ implies $x \\in A$ for every $x \\in B$.\n\nLemma 5.30. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a maximal good cover of a reduced excellent distinguished complete adic ring $R$. For every $n \\geq 0$, we have $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right) \\subset R_{n} \\subset \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$, $R_{n}$ is distinguished, and $R_{n, \\text { red }}$ is purely inseparably integrally closed in $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$.\n\nProof. The first claim follows from Proposition 4.30, and since $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$is $I$-torsion free, $R_{n}$ is $I$-torsion free. We prove the second claim. Let $x \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$ be an element such that $x^{p} \\in R_{n, \\text { red }}$. Take an arbitrary lift $y \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$of $x$. Then, $y^{p} \\in R_{n}$, so in particular, $y^{p} \\in R_{\\infty}$. Since $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ is perfect, we have $y \\in R_{\\infty}$. Thus, $y \\in R_{\\infty} \\cap \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)=R_{n}$ and $x \\in R_{n, \\text { red }}$.\n\nLemma 5.31. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a maximal good cover of a reduced excellent distinguished complete adic ring $R$. For every element $f \\in R,\\left(R_{\\bullet}\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a maximal good cover of $R\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$. Here, $(-)^{\\wedge}$ denotes the I-adic completion with $I \\subset R$ an ideal of definition.\n\nProof. Let $R_{n}^{\\prime}=R_{n}\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]^{\\wedge}$. Since $R_{\\infty}$ is thick, $R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$ is thick. Let $R_{n}^{\\prime \\prime}=R_{\\infty}^{\\prime} \\cap \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$. By applying Corollary 5.28 to $R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$, we see that $\\left(R_{\\bullet}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a maximal good cover. It is enough to show that a natural homomorphism $R_{n}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow R_{n}^{\\prime \\prime}$ is an isomorphism. By Lemma 5.30 and Lemma 2.6, we have $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\infty}\\right) \\subset R_{n}^{\\prime} \\subset R_{n}^{\\prime \\prime} \\subset \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ are both geometric quotients of $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}\\right)$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$ that are qcqs over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$, we have $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)$ by Proposition 3.10. In particular, $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime} \\hookrightarrow R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime \\prime}$ is an isomorphism up to perfection. Since we have $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime} \\hookrightarrow R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime \\prime} \\hookrightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$, it is enough to show that $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime}$ is purely inseparably integrally closed in $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$.\n\nBy the proof of Lemma 2.6, $R_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\prime} \\hookrightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$ is isomorphic to $R_{n, \\text { red }}\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right] \\hookrightarrow$ $\\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)_{\\text {red }}\\left[\\frac{1}{f}\\right]$. Thus, the claim follows from Lemma 5.30.\n\nThanks to Lemma 5.31, the following notion is purely local in the Zariski topology.\n\nDefinition 5.32. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent distinguished formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. We say that $\\mathfrak{X}$ admits a maximal good cover if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is Zariski locally isomorphic to the formal spectrum of a reduced excellent distinguished complete adic ring admitting a maximal good cover.\n\nLemma 5.33. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent distinguished formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ admitting a maximal good cover. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ be a Noetherian formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and let $f: \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}$ be a map over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $\\left(\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is represented by a morphism $g: \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{ad}}$ of adic spaces. Then, $f$ is represented by a unique morphism $\\mathfrak{X} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}$ and its restriction to $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is equal to $g$.\n\nProof. By following the argument given in the proof of [AGLR22, Theorem 2.16], we may assume that $\\mathfrak{X}$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}$ are affine. Let $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}=\\operatorname{Spf}(A)$ with $R$ a reduced excellent distinguished complete adic ring admitting a maximal good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$. By Proposition 4.27, the composition $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\xrightarrow{f} \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is represented by a continuous homomorphism $A \\rightarrow R_{\\infty}$. The induced morphism $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(A)$ is equal to the composition $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }} \\xrightarrow{g} \\operatorname{Spa}(A)$ since $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(A)$ is uniquely represented by a morphism $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}(A)$ as $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is a perfectoid space. In particular, $A$ maps to $R_{\\infty} \\cap \\Gamma\\left(\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right)=R$. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is surjective, this homomorphism $A \\rightarrow R$ represents $f$. Since $R \\rightarrow R_{\\infty}$ is injective, the uniqueness of $f$ follows from Proposition 4.27. By construction, the restriction of $f$ to $\\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is equal to $g$.\n\nAs a corollary, we obtain a certain uniqueness of the representability of $v$-sheaves.\nCorollary 5.34. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a Noetherian formal scheme and let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ and $\\mathfrak{Z}$ be reduced excellent distinguished formal schemes over $\\mathfrak{X}$ admitting maximal good covers. Suppose that $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {ad }}$ and $\\mathfrak{Z}^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {ad }}$ are open immersions of adic spaces and isomorphic to each other. Then, any isomorphism $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\circ}$ over $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ is representable by a unique isomorphism $\\mathfrak{Y} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}$ over $\\mathfrak{X}$.\n\nProof. Let $f: \\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\circ}$ be an isomorphism over $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$. Since the restriction of $f$ to $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\text {an }}$ is represented by $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\mathrm{ad}}, f$ is uniquely represented by a morphism $f_{0}: \\mathfrak{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Z}$ lifting $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ by Lemma 5.33. Moreover, $f_{0}$ is a morphism over $\\mathfrak{X}$ again by Lemma 5.33. By applying the same argument to the inverse of $f$, we obtain the inverse of $f_{0}$ over $\\mathfrak{X}$ and we see that $f_{0}$ is an isomorphism.\n5.5. Examples of $p$-adic formal schemes with maximal good covers. In this section, we present an example of $p$-adically complete rings admitting maximal good covers other than Proposition 5.9. The result of this section will not be used in the rest of the paper. In this section, the $p$-adic completion is denoted by $(-)^{\\wedge}$.\n\nProposition 5.35. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent p-adically complete ring. Let $S$ be a ptorsion free finite type $R$-algebra that is integrally closed in $S\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ and $S\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is standard \u00e9tale over $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$. If $R$ admits a good cover, $S^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n\nProof. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a good cover of $R$. For each $n \\geq 0$, let $S_{n}$ be the integral closure of $S \\otimes_{R} R_{n}$ in $\\left(S \\otimes_{R} R_{n}\\right)_{\\{p\\}}^{[\\underline{1}]}$. Since $S_{n}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is \u00e9tale over $R_{n}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S_{n}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is reduced, so $S_{n}$ is a reduced finite $S$-algebra. We will show that $\\left(S_{\\bullet}^{\\wedge}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a maximal good cover of $S^{\\wedge}$.\n\nSine $S\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is standard \u00e9tale over $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$, we may write as $S\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]=R[x]_{(p h)} /(g)$ with $g$ a monic polynomial in $R[x]$ and $h \\in R[x]$ such that $g^{\\prime}$ is invertible in $R[x]_{(p h)}$. We may assume that $x \\in S$. Let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in S$ be a generator of $S$ as an $R$-algebra. For some $N \\geq 0$, we have $(p h)^{N} f_{i} \\in R[x] /(g)$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. Since $(p h)^{-N} \\in S\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$, we may assume that $(p h)^{N} f_{1}$ is a power of $p$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S^{\\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R[x]_{(p)} /(g), R[x] /(g)\\right)$ is isomorphic to a rational localization $R\\left(\\frac{(p h)^{N} f_{1}, \\ldots(p h)^{N} f_{r}}{(p h)^{N}}\\right)$.\n\nBy [BS22, Theorem 10.11], $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\times{ }_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}(R[x] /(g))$ is represented by a perfectoid ring $R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}$. Then, $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S^{\\wedge}\\right) \\times{ }_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R[x] /(g))} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is represented by an affinoid perfectoid pair $\\left(S_{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S_{\\infty}\\right)$ obtained as a rational localization $R_{\\infty}^{\\prime}\\left\\langle\\frac{(p h)^{N} f_{1}, \\ldots(p h)^{N} f_{r}}{(p h)^{S}}\\right\\rangle$. In particular, the pullback of an \u00e9tale morphism $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S^{\\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], R\\right)$ to $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is represented by an affinoid perfectoid pair $\\left(S_{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S_{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nSince (density) and (unifsec) are local by Lemma 5.13, we may argue as in Lemma 5.16 to show that we have a functorial and uniform family of continuous sections $\\left\\{s_{n, U_{n}}\\right\\}$ with the density condition. By setting $U_{n}=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{n}^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S_{n}^{\\wedge}\\right)$, the density condition for $\\left\\{s_{n, U_{n}}\\right\\}$ implies that $S_{\\infty}=\\operatorname{colim}^{\\wedge} S_{n}^{\\wedge}$. In particular, we have the condition (perfd). The condition (quot) can be verified as in Lemma 5.16. By construction, $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ satisfies (maximal).\n\nLet $E$ be a complete discrete valuation field over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with perfect residue field and let $O_{E}$ be the ring of integers of $E$.\n\nCorollary 5.36. Let $R$ be a p-torsion free normal finite type $O_{E}$-algebra. If $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is standard \u00e9tale over a polynomial algebra over $E, R^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n\nProof. By assumption, there is a homomorphism $P \\rightarrow R$ from a polynomial algebra $P$ over $O_{E}$ such that $P\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\rightarrow R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is standard \u00e9tale. Thus, the claim follows from Proposition 5.5 and Proposition 5.35 .\n\nFor applications to integral models of Shimura varieties, it is natural to hope for a generalization to the case where $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is smooth over $E$. The main technical difficulty lies in the condition (unifsec). It implies that $\\left(R^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], R^{\\wedge}\\right)$ is sousperfectoid in the sense of [HK22], but it is not known yet whether every smooth affinoid $E$-algebra is sousperfectoid. Here, we record some weaker results.\n\nCorollary 5.37. Let $R$ be a p-torsion free normal finite type $O_{E}$-algebra. If $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is smooth over $E$, there is a proper morphism $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ such that $Y\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\cong \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]\\right)$ and $Y^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n\nProof. We can take a set of elements $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r} \\in p R$ so that $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]\\right)$ is covered by $D\\left(f_{i}\\right)$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq r$ and each $D\\left(f_{i}\\right)$ is standard \u00e9tale over a polynomial algebra over $E$. Let $Y \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ be the blowup along $V\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right)$ and let $Y^{+}$be the normalization of $Y$ in $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]\\right)$. Let $V_{i}^{+} \\subset Y^{+}$be the locus where $f_{i}$ divides $f_{j}$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq r$. We have $V_{i}^{+}[\\frac{1}{p}]=D\\left(f_{i}\\right)$, so $\\left(V_{i}^{+}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover by Corollary 5.36. Thus, $\\left(Y^{+}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n\nCorollary 5.38. Let $R$ be a p-torsion free normal domain of finite type over $O_{E}$. If $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is smooth over $E$, and $R / p R$ and $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ are of the same dimension, there is a nonempty open subset $U \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}(R / p R)$ such that $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)_{/ U}^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n\nProof. We can take an affine open subset $V \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]\\right)$ that is standard \u00e9tale over an affine space over $E$. Let $Z$ be the Zariski closure of $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]\\right)-V$ in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. Since $R / p R$ is of the same dimension as $R\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], Z \\otimes_{O_{E}}\\left(O_{E} / p O_{E}\\right)$ has a strictly smaller dimension than $\\operatorname{Spec}(R / p R)$. In particular, $\\operatorname{Spec}(R / p R)-Z$ is nonempty. Thus, we can take a distinguished open subset $D_{f} \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}(R)-Z$ such that $D_{f} \\cap \\operatorname{Spec}(R / p R)$ is nonempty. By construction, $D_{f}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is standard \u00e9tale over an affine space over $E$, so $D_{f}^{\\wedge}$ admits a maximal good cover.\n5.6. Relative representablity. The aim of this section is to prove our main representability criterion by showing that the construction in Corollary 5.28 can be glued in the Zariski topology.\n\nWe say that a perfect scheme $X$ over an affine perfect scheme $\\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is perfectly quasiprojective over $A$ if $X$ is perfectly of finite type over $A$ and admits an ample line bundle.\n\nProposition 5.39. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent formal scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ admitting a good cover. Let $Y \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ be a quasiseparated map of small $v$-sheaves. Let $U \\subset \\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ be a quasicompact open immersion with a lift $U^{\\circ} \\rightarrow Y$. Suppose that the following condition holds.\n\nFor every complete adic perfectoid ring $R$ with an adic morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$, there is a unique distinguished perfectoid formal $R$-scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ over $Y$ such that $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ is adic over $R, \\mathfrak{Y}_{R}^{\\text {red }}$ is perfectly quasi-projective over $R_{\\text {red }}, \\mathfrak{Y}_{R}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow$ $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is a closed immersion and there is an isomorphism $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong$ $U \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ that represents the base change of $U^{\\circ} \\rightarrow Y$ to $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\nThen, the $v$-closure of $U^{\\circ}$ in $Y$ is representable by a unique reduced excellent distinguished formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover with $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong U$. Moreover, $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is separated and topologically of finite type over $\\mathfrak{X}$.\n\nRemark 5.40. The uniqueness of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ is a mild condition. For example, if $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is a kimberlite, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ represents the thick closure of $U \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\mathrm{an}}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ in $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ and the uniqueness follows from Proposition 4.27.\n\nProof. First, suppose that $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ where $R$ admits a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$ be the unique perfectoid formal $R_{\\infty}$-formal scheme over $Y$ satisfying the given condition. For every $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_{\\infty}, \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty} \\otimes_{R_{\\infty}, \\gamma} R_{\\infty}$ also satisfies the given condition, so there is a unique isomorphism $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty} \\otimes_{R_{\\infty}, \\gamma} R_{\\infty} \\cong \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$. Thus, we have an action of $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ on $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$.\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\text {red }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$, we can take a finite cover $\\left\\{\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$. Let $U_{n}=U \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{m}} \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ and $V_{\\infty, i}=\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}^{\\text {an }} \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Then, $\\left\\{V_{\\infty, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ is a finite cover of $U_{\\infty}$. By [Sch17, Lemma 12.17], that cover can be defined over $U_{m}$ for sufficiently large $m \\geq 0$. In particular, $V_{\\infty, i}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{m}$ for every $i \\in I$. Since $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}$ is distinguished, we see by looking at the specialization map that $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}$ is also stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{m}$. Thus, we may apply Theorem 5.19 to $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}$ and obtain a maximal good cover $\\left(S_{\\bullet, i}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}^{m}\\right)_{\\bullet \\geq m}$ by Corollary 5.28 .\n\nWe show that the collection $\\left\\{\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{m, i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ can be glued to a formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$. For every $i, j \\in I, \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{m}$. Since $\\left(S_{m, i}\\right)_{\\text {red }}^{\\text {perf }} \\rightarrow\\left(S_{\\infty, i}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$ is integral, $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{\\infty, i}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{m, i}\\right)$ is closed, so there is an open subspace $W_{m, i}^{j} \\subset \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{m, i}\\right)$ whose pullback $W_{\\infty, i}^{j} \\subset \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}$ equals $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$. Similarly, there is an open subspace $W_{m, j}^{i} \\subset$ $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{m, j}\\right)$ whose pullback $W_{\\infty, j}^{i} \\subset \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$ equals $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$. By construction, $W_{m, i}^{j}$ and $W_{m, j}^{i}$ admit maximal good covers, and $W_{m, i}^{j, \\text { an }} \\cong W_{m, j}^{i, \\text { an }}$ as open subspaces of $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R_{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Moreover, $\\left(W_{m, i}^{j}\\right)^{\\circ}$ and $\\left(W_{m, j}^{i}\\right)^{\\circ}$ are geometric quotients of $\\left(\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}\\right)^{\\circ}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{m}$ that are qcqs over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$, so we have $\\left(W_{m, i}^{j}\\right)^{\\circ} \\cong\\left(W_{m, j}^{i}\\right)^{\\circ}$ by Proposition 3.10. It follows from Corollary 5.34 that there is a unique isomorphism $W_{m, i}^{j} \\cong W_{m, j}^{i}$ of formal schemes compatible with the isomorphisms on the analytic loci and the $v$-sheafifications. Thus, we obtain a formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$ by gluing the affine formal schemes $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{m, i}\\right)$ for $i \\in I$.\n\nBy construction, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ}$ is a geometric quotient of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\circ}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{m}$ that is qcqs over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$. Since $Y$ is quasiseparated over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$, we obtain a map $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ by Proposition 3.10. By Corollary $5.25, \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is surjective. It is also injective since $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ factors through $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$. Thus, the base change of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ to $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is a closed immersion, so it is a closed immersion itself by [Sch17, Proposition 10.11]. By construction, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\text {an }} \\cong U_{m}$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$ is distinguished, so $U_{m}^{\\circ}$ is dense in $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}^{\\circ}$ by Lemma 3.7. Thus, the $v$-closure of $U_{m}$ in $Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{m}\\right)$ is representable by $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$. By Theorem $5.19, \\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$ admits a maximal good cover and is topologically of finite type over $R_{m}$. Moreover, since $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$ is quasi-projective over $R_{\\text {red }}$, and in particular, separated, $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$ is affine. By applying Theorem 5.19 to $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i} \\cap \\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, j}$, we see that $W_{m, i}^{j}$ is affine for every $i, j \\in I$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$ is separated. The uniqueness of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{m}$ follows from Corollary 5.34 .\n\nNow, we will show that we can take $m=0$ if we choose a suitable finite cover $\\left\\{\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$. It is enough to choose so that each $\\mathfrak{V}_{\\infty, i}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ is perfectly quasiprojective over $R_{\\infty, \\text { red }}, \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty, \\text { red }}$ admits an ample line bundle. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty, \\text { red }}=\\lim _{n \\geq m} \\mathfrak{Y}_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$,\n\nthat line bundle can be defined over $\\mathfrak{Y}_{n, \\text { red }}^{\\text {perf }}$ for sufficiently large $n \\geq m$. Then, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{n, \\text { red }}$ is quasiprojective over $R_{\\text {red }}$, so any $\\Gamma_{n}$-orbit of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{n, \\text { red }}$ admits a $\\Gamma_{n}$-stable affine open neighborhood. In particular, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{n}$ admits a $\\Gamma_{n}$-stable finite affine covering. Its pullback to $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$ yields a desired $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$-stable finite affine covering.\n\nFinally, we treat the general case. Take an affine covering of $\\mathfrak{X}$ by $\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $R$ admitting a good cover. The $v$-closure of $U^{\\circ} \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{0}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ in $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{0}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is representable by a unique reduced excellent distinguished formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ admitting a maximal good cover with $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}^{\\text {an }} \\cong U \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}} \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. By the uniqueness of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$, the collection $\\left\\{\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}\\right\\}$ can be glued to a formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ over $\\mathfrak{X}$. It is easy to see that $\\mathfrak{Y}$ satisfies the desired condition.\n\nRemark 5.41. If $U=\\mathfrak{X}^{\\text {an }}, \\mathfrak{Y}$ is automatically proper by Lemma 2.14. In addition, if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is locally monogeneous, e.g. if $\\mathfrak{X}$ is $p$-adic, $\\mathfrak{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$ is a formal modification by Proposition 2.18.\n\nRemark 5.42. As seen from the proof, when $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ where $R$ admits a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$, we only need the existence of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}}$ to show the existence of $\\mathfrak{Y}$. Moreover, if $Y^{\\text {red }}$ is representable by a separated perfectly finite type perfect $R_{\\text {red }}$-scheme, we do not need the quasi-projectivity assumption since an affine covering of $Y^{\\text {red }}$ yields a $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$-stable affine covering of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$.\n\nThe following corollary shows the representability of $v$-sheaf theoretic modifications.\nCorollary 5.43. Let $R$ be a reduced excellent complete adic ring admitting a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$. Let $Y$ be a thick prekimberlite formally adic over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ with $Y^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$. Suppose that $Y^{\\text {red }}$ is perfectly of finite type over $R_{\\text {red }}$ and $Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is representable by a perfectoid formal scheme adic over $R_{\\infty}$. Then, $Y$ is representable by a unique proper formal $R$-scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover with $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\cong \\operatorname{Spa}(R)^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\n\nProof. Since $Y$ is formally separated, $Y^{\\text {red }}$ is separated. By Remark 5.42, it is enough to check the condition for $R_{\\infty}$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$ be the perfectoid formal scheme representing $Y \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)}$ $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$. It is enough to show that $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$ is thick. By Proposition 4.27, $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ acts on $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}$. The open subspace $V=\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\text {red }}-\\operatorname{sp}_{\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}}\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\text {an }}\\right) \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\text {red }}$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$. By construction, $V^{\\circ} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\circ}$ is open and stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$. Let $V_{0} \\subset|Y|$ be the image of $V^{\\circ}$. By [Sch17, Proposition 12.9], $\\left|\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\right| \\rightarrow|Y|$ is a quotient map, so $V_{0}$ is open. By construction, $V_{0}^{\\text {red }} \\cap \\operatorname{sp}_{Y}\\left(Y^{\\text {an }}\\right)=\\phi$, so $V_{0}^{\\text {red }}$ is empty as $Y$ is thick. Since there is a map $V \\rightarrow V_{0}^{\\text {red }}$, we see that $V$ is empty.\n5.7. Variant. In this section, we provide another form of our relative representability criterion that is suitable for application. Here, we only deal with $p$-adic formal schemes. For a $v$ sheaf $X$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right), X_{\\eta}$ denotes $X \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Q}_{p}, \\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)$ and $X_{s}$ denotes $X \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{p}\\right)$. Recall the notation in Section 3.1 and Section 4.2.\n\nProposition 5.44. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent $p$-adic formal scheme admitting a good cover. Let $Y \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ be a quasiseparated map of small $v$-sheaves. Let $Z \\subset Y_{\\eta}$ be a closed subsheaf that is finite \u00e9tale over $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}$. Suppose that the following condition holds.\n\nFor every perfectoid ring $R$ with $\\operatorname{Spf}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$, there is a perfectly proper $R^{\\circ}$ scheme $Y_{R^{\\circ}}$ and a finite \u00e9tale $R^{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]$-scheme $Z_{R^{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]}$ with a morphism $Z_{R^{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]} \\rightarrow Y_{R^{\\mathrm{e}}}$ such that we have the following commutative diagram\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nthat is compatible with tilting equivalence $\\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{e}}\\right)$.\nThen, $Z^{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is representable by a unique reduced excellent distinguished p-adic formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover that is proper over $\\mathfrak{X}$ with $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\eta}$ finite \u00e9tale over $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}$.\n\nProof. First, suppose that $\\mathfrak{X}=\\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ with $R$ admitting a good cover $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$. Let $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ be the scheme-theoretic image of $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}\\right]} \\rightarrow Y_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ (resp. $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ ) be the $\\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}$-adic completion of $Y_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ (resp. $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ ). Since $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ is $\\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}$-torsion free, $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ is distinguished. Thus, $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ is thick by Lemma 3.6. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}}$ (resp. $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}$ ) be the untilt of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ (resp. $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}$ ) over $R_{\\infty}$ (see Proposition 4.24). Then, $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}}$ represents $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ and $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\circ} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\circ}$ is a thick closed subsheaf. We will show that $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}, \\eta}$ represents $Z \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$.\n\nBy Lemma 3.2, we have $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}^{\\diamond, \\text { an }} \\cong Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\right)^{\\diamond}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\diamond}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\right)^{\\diamond}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\diamond}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong$ $\\left(Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}\\right]\\right)^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]\\right)^{\\diamond}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}^{\\diamond}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$. Since $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]} \\rightarrow Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}\\right]^{\\diamond}$ is finite and surjective, $Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]}^{\\diamond} \\rightarrow Z_{R_{\\infty}^{\\circ}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R_{\\infty}, 0}\\right]^{\\diamond}$ is surjective on geometric points. In particular, $Z \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}, \\eta}^{\\diamond}$ is surjective on geometric points. Since $Z \\subset Y_{\\eta}$, it is also injective, so $Z \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }} \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}, \\eta}^{\\diamond}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}$ represents the thick closure of $Z \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$ in $Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nBy the uniqueness of thick closures, $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\diamond} \\subset Y \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ is stable under $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$. Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ is proper (as in Lemma 5.4), the image $Z^{\\text {int }} \\subset Y$ of $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\diamond}$ under the projection to $Y$ is closed. By Lemma 3.17, we have $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\diamond} \\cong Z^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right)$ and $Z^{\\text {int }}$ is a geometric quotient of $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\diamond}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$.\n\nLet $R^{+} \\subset R_{(\\underline{p})}^{[\\underline{1}]}$ be the integral closure of $R$. Since $Z$ is finite \u00e9tale over $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\diamond}$, there is a unique finite \u00e9tale homomorphism $\\left(R_{p}^{[\\underline{1}]} ; R^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(S^{+}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S^{+}\\right)$such that $Z \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S^{+}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S^{+}\\right)$ by [Sch17, Lemma 15.6]. Let $\\left(R_{\\infty}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], R_{\\infty}^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(S_{\\infty}^{+}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right], S_{\\infty}^{+}\\right)$be the base change of the finite \u00e9tale homomorphism. By Proposition 4.30, we have $\\left(S_{\\infty}^{+}\\right)^{\\diamond \\circ} \\subset \\Gamma\\left(\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\subset S_{\\infty}^{+}$. Let $S_{0}=R+\\left(S^{+}\\right)^{\\diamond \\circ} \\subset S^{+}$. Since $R$ is reduced and excellent, $S^{+}$is finite over $R$ and $S_{0}$ is finite over $R$. Moreover, we have a $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$-invariant morphism $\\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{0}\\right)$, so by Proposition 3.10, we get a morphism $Z^{\\text {int }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{0}\\right)$. By the proof of Lemma 5.17, the reduction of $\\left(S_{0} \\otimes_{R} R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a good cover and let $S_{\\infty}$ be as in the condition (perfd). Since $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{\\infty}\\right) \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{0}\\right)$, we have $Z^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{0}\\right)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\mathfrak{Z}_{R_{\\infty}}^{\\diamond}$. By\n\nRemark 5.42, the proof of Proposition 5.39 applies to $Z^{\\text {int }} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{0}\\right)$ and we obtain the desired representability.\n\nAs in Corollary 5.34, the uniqueness of $\\mathfrak{Y}$ follows from Lemma 5.33 thanks to [Sch17, Lemma 15.6]. Thus, in the general case, we can glue $\\mathfrak{Y}_{R}$ for each $\\operatorname{Spf}(R) \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak{X}$ as above and the claim follows.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-3.jpeg":

APPLICATIONS TO LOCAL SHTUKAS \n\n6.1. Local shtukas. In this section, we set up some notation and recall the definition of local shtukas introduced in [SW20].\n\nLet $F$ be a non-archimedean local field over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ and let $O_{F}$ be the ring of integers of $F$ with a residue field $k$. Let $\\pi$ be a uniformizer of $F$ and let $q$ be the number of elements of $k$. For a perfect $k$-algebra $R$, we set $W_{O_{F}}(R)=W(R) \\otimes_{W(k)} O_{F}$.\n\nLet $S=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$be an affinoid perfectoid space over $k$ and let $\\varpi \\in R^{+}$be a pseudouniformizer. We set $\\mathcal{Y}_{S}=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{+}\\right)\\right)-V([\\varpi])$. It is an analytic adic space (see [FS21, Proposition II.1.1]). Let $\\mathcal{Y}_{S,[0, n]} \\subset \\mathcal{Y}_{S}$ be the locus $\\left\\{\\left|\\pi^{n}\\right| \\leq|[\\varpi]| \\neq 0\\right\\}$ for a positive integer $n$. By the proof of [SW20, Proposition II.1.1], $\\mathcal{Y}_{S,[0, n]}=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(B_{S,[0, n]}, B_{S,[0, n]}^{+}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{Y}_{S}$ is an affinoid open subspace and the $p$-adic completion $B_{S,[0, n]}^{\\wedge}$ of $B_{S,[0, n]}$ is isomorphic to $W_{O_{F}}(R)$. By [FS21, Proposition II.1.3], we can glue this construction analytic locally and obtain an analytic adic space $\\mathcal{Y}_{S}$ for every perfectoid space $S$ over $k$.\n\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$ and let $\\mathcal{G}$ be a parahoric group scheme of $G$ over $O_{F}$.\n\nDefinition 6.1. ([SW20, Section 23.1]) Let $S$ be a perfectoid space over $k$. A local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $S$ is a tuple $\\left(\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right), \\mathcal{P}, \\varphi_{\\mathcal{P}}\\right)$ such that $\\left(S^{\\sharp}, \\iota\\right) \\in \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)(S)$ is an untilt of $S$ over $O_{F}, \\mathcal{P}$ is a $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor over $\\mathcal{Y}_{S}$ and $\\varphi_{\\mathcal{P}}: \\varphi^{*} \\mathcal{P}\\left|_{\\mathcal{Y}_{S} \\backslash S^{\\sharp}} \\cong \\mathcal{P}\\right|_{\\mathcal{Y}_{S} \\backslash S^{\\sharp}}$ is an isomorphism of $\\mathcal{G}$-torsors meromorphic along $S^{\\sharp}$.\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ be the $v$-site of perfectoid spaces over $k$. The functor taking a perfectoid space $S$ over $k$ to the groupoid of local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtukas over $S$ is a $v$-stack on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ by [SW20, Proposition 19.5.3] and denoted by $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}$ (cf. [SW20, Definition 23.1.1]). There is a natural map $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$ of $v$-stacks on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$. Note that a $v$-stack on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ is identified with a $v$-stack on Perf with a map to $\\operatorname{Spd}(k)$. For a $v$-stack $X$ on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$, we say that a map $X \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}$ of $v$-stacks on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ is a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $X$. For a $v$-stack $X$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$, we say that a map $X \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}$ of $v$-stacks over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$ is a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $X_{/ O_{F}}$.\nProposition 6.2. Let $\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}$ be the functor taking an affinoid perfectoid space $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$ over $k$ to the group $\\mathcal{G}\\left(W_{O_{F}}(R)\\right)$. It is a small $v$-sheaf on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ and there is a natural map $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ of $v$-stacks on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$. Here, $*$ denotes the $v$-sheaf $\\operatorname{Spd}(k)$.\nProof. Since $\\mathcal{G}$ is affine, $\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}$ is a small $v$-sheaf on $\\operatorname{Perf}_{k}$ by [Sch17, Theorem 8.7]. The quotient $v$-stack $\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ classifies the set of $\\mathcal{G}$-torsors on $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(W_{O_{F}}(R)\\right)$ over an affinoid\n\nperfectoid space $S=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$over $k$ since $\\mathcal{G}$-torsors on $W_{O_{F}}(R)$ satisfy $v$-descent by [SW20, Corollary 17.1.9]. As in [SW20, Section 20.3], we obtain a map $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ by pulling back $\\mathcal{G}$-torsors on $\\mathcal{Y}_{S,[0, n]}$ to $W_{O_{F}}(R)$.\n\nLet $R$ be a perfectoid ring over $O_{F}$. The Frobenius map on $W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$ is denoted by $\\varphi_{R}$. By [Ito23b, Lemma 2.4.2], the kernel of the surjection $\\theta_{R}: W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\rightarrow R$ is principal. By an abuse of notation, a generator of $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\theta_{R}\\right)$ is also denoted by $\\xi_{R}$. The image of $\\xi_{R}$ under the projection $W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\rightarrow R^{\\mathrm{s}}$ is denoted by $\\xi_{R, 0}$.\nDefinition 6.3. A $\\mathcal{G}$-Breuil-Kisin-Fargues ( $\\mathcal{G}$-BKF) module over a perfectoid ring $R$ over $O_{F}$ is a pair $\\left(P, \\varphi_{P}\\right)$ such that $P$ is a $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor over $W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$ and $\\varphi_{P}$ is an isomorphism $\\left(\\varphi_{R}^{*} P\\right)\\left[1 / \\xi_{R}\\right] \\cong P\\left[1 / \\xi_{R}\\right]$\nProposition 6.4. ([G\u00fc23], [GI23]) For a perfectoid ring $R$ over $O_{F}$, the category of local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtukas over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)_{/ O_{F}}$ is equivalent to the category of $\\mathcal{G}$-BKF modules over $R$.\n6.2. Level structures. In this section, we introduce parahoric level structures on local shtukas. Let $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ be another parahoric group scheme of $G$ over $O_{F}$ with a morphism $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$ over $O_{F}$. It corresponds to a parahoric subgroup $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\left(O_{F}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{G}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$.\nLemma 6.5. For a p-torsion free $O_{F}$-algebra $A$, we have $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathcal{G}(A) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}(A / \\pi A)\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}(A)$.\nProof. Let $\\mathcal{G}_{1}$ be the first congruence group scheme of $\\mathcal{G}$ as in [KP23, Definition A.5.12]. Since $A$ is $p$-torsion free, we have $\\mathcal{G}_{1}(A)=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathcal{G}(A) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}(A / \\pi A)\\right)$. We show that there is a morphism $\\mathcal{G}_{1} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ over $O_{F}$. Let $\\bar{F}$ be the completion of the maximal unramified extension of $F$ and let $O_{\\bar{F}}$ be the ring of integers in $\\bar{F}$. By [KP23, Corollary 2.10.10], it is enough to show that $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathcal{G}\\left(O_{\\bar{F}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}\\left(O_{\\bar{F}} / \\pi O_{\\bar{F}}\\right)\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\left(O_{\\bar{F}}\\right)$. The claim follows from [KP23, Corollary 8.4.12, Corollary 8.4.13].\n\nDefinition 6.6. Let $H_{1} \\rightarrow H_{2}$ be a homomorphism of group schemes over a scheme $S$ and let $P_{2}$ be an $H_{2}$-torsor over $S$. An $H_{1}$-subtorsor of $P_{2}$ over $S$ is a pair $\\left(P_{1}, \\iota\\right)$ such that $P_{1}$ is an $H_{1}$-torsor over $S$ and $\\iota$ is an isomorphism $P_{1} \\times{ }^{H_{1}} H_{2} \\cong P_{2}$ of $H_{2}$-torsors.\n\nFor a section $s: S \\rightarrow P_{2}$, we say that the $H_{1}$-subtorsor $\\left(H_{1}, s \\cdot(-): H_{2} \\cong P_{2}\\right)$ is the $H_{1}$-subtorsor generated by $s$. For any $h_{1} \\in H_{1}(S)$, the $H_{1}$-subtorsor generated by $s \\cdot h_{1}$ is isomorphic to the $H_{1}$-subtorsor generated by $s$.\n\nBy [KP23, Theorem 8.4.19 (2)], the image of $\\mathcal{G}_{k}^{\\prime}$ in $\\mathcal{G}_{k}$ is a parabolic subgroup of $\\mathcal{G}_{k}$. Let $\\mathcal{H} \\subset \\mathcal{G}_{k}$ be the parabolic subgroup.\nLemma 6.7. Let $A$ be a p-torsion free and p-complete $O_{F}$-algebra and let $P$ be a $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor over $A$. There is a natural bijection between the set of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsors of $P$ and the set of $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsors of $P_{A / \\pi A}$.\n\nProof. The one direction is clear by taking the base change to $A / \\pi A$. Suppose that we have an $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsor of $P_{A / \\pi A}$. Since $A$ is $p$-torsion free, there are no nontrivial automorphisms of\n\n$\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsors of $P$, so we may $p$-completely \u00e9tale locally localize $A$. Thus, we may assume that $P$ is trivial and the $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsor of $P_{A / \\pi A}$ is generated by the reduction of an element $x \\in P(A)$. It is enough to show that the $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor generated by $x$ is independent of the choice of $x$. Let $x^{\\prime} \\in P(A)$ be another choice. The reduction of $x^{-1} x^{\\prime}$ to $A / \\pi A$ lies in $\\mathcal{H}(A / \\pi A)$. Now, the map $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}(A) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}(A / \\pi A)$ is surjective because $\\mathcal{G}(A) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}(A / \\pi A)$ is surjective and $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ is the dilatation (see [KP23, Section A.5]) of $\\mathcal{G}$ along $\\mathcal{H}$ by [KP23, Corollary 2.10.10] and [KP23, Theorem 8.4.19 (3)]. Thus, we may assume that the reduction of $x^{-1} x^{\\prime}$ is trivial. Then, we have $x^{-1} x^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}(A)$ by Lemma 6.5.\n\nThe following lemma is the basis of the representability of the moduli of subtorsors.\nLemma 6.8. Let $k$ be a field. Let $G$ be a connected linear algebraic group over $k$ and let $H$ be a parabolic subgroup of $G$. Let $R$ be a $k$-algebra and let $P$ be a $G$-torsor over $R$. The quotient fpqc sheaf $P / H$ is representable by a projective $R$-scheme.\n\nProof. Since the unipotent radical of $G$ is contained in $H$, we may assume that $G$ is reductive. A regular dominant cocharacter $\\lambda$ of $H$ defines a $G$-equivariant ample line bundle $O(\\lambda)$ on $G / H$. Take an \u00e9tale $R$-algebra $R^{\\prime}$ so that $P_{R^{\\prime}} \\cong G_{R^{\\prime}}$. It gives a 1-cocycle valued in $G$ and it induces an \u00e9tale descent datum $\\left((G / H)_{R^{\\prime}}, O(\\lambda)\\right)$ corresponding to $P / H$. Since $O(\\lambda)$ is ample, it is effective (see [BLR90, Theorem 7]).\n\nDefinition 6.9. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka on a $v$-stack $X$. A $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure on $\\mathcal{P}$ is a commutative diagram\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nIn other words, it consists of a local $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-shtuka $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ with an isomorphism $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime} \\times{ }^{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\mathcal{G} \\cong \\mathcal{P}$.\nWe have the following commutative diagram by Proposition 6.2.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nLemma 6.10. The following holds in the above diagram.\n(1) $\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right] \\rightarrow\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ is separated.\n(2) $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta}$ is finite \u00e9tale over $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}$ and locally isomorphic to the set $\\mathcal{G}\\left(O_{F}\\right) / \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$.\n(3) $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, s}$ is isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, s} \\times_{\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]}\\left[*/\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$.\n\nProof. By Lemma 6.7 and Lemma 6.8, the fiber $* \\times_{\\left[\\star /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]}\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ is represented by the projective $k$-scheme $\\mathcal{G}_{k} / \\mathcal{H}$. The claim (1) follows from the $v$-descent of separatedness in [Sch17, Proposition 10.11].\n\nLet $S$ be a perfectoid space over $F$ and let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $S_{/ O_{F}}$. By [SW20, Proposition 22.6.1], there is a pro-\u00e9tale $\\mathcal{G}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$-torsor $\\mathbb{P}$ over $S$ corresponding to $\\mathcal{P}$. The fiber product $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}} S$ is represented by the finite \u00e9tale covering $\\mathbb{P} / \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\left(O_{F}\\right)$ of $S$. This proves (2).\n\nOn the other hand, let $S=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$be an affinoid perfectoid space over $k$ and let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $S$. For every $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ on $\\mathcal{Y}_{S}$, the Frobenius of $\\mathcal{P}$ gives the structure of a local $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-sthuka on $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. Since the map $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}$ is an isomorphism after inverting $p$, we see by applying the Beuville-Laszlo lemma (in the form of [SW20, Lemma 5.2.9]) to $B_{S,[0, n]}$ that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is determined by the restriction to $W_{O_{F}}(R)$. Thus, we have (3).\n\nProposition 6.11. The $v$-stack $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}}$ is a closed substack of $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\times_{\\left[\\star /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]}\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$.\nProof. Let $S=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$be an affinoid perfectoid space over $k$ with an untilt $S^{\\sharp}=$ $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(R^{\\sharp}, R^{+}\\sharp\\right)$ over $O_{F}$. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $S_{/ O_{F}}^{\\sharp}$. A $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ on $\\mathcal{P}$ is determined by the corresponding $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor on $\\mathcal{Y}_{S,[0, n]}$. By the same argument as in Lemma 6.10, we see that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is determined by the restriction to $W_{O_{F}}(R)$ and $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}}$ is a substack of $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\times_{\\left[\\star /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]}\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$. We show that it is a closed substack.\n\nA section of $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}} \\times_{\\left[\\star /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]}\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right]$ over $S^{\\sharp}$ corresponds to a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ by the Beuville-Laszlo lemma. We determine when its pullback along a map $T=\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(A, A^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $S$ factors through $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}}$. Since $\\varphi_{\\mathcal{P}}$ is meromorphic along $S^{\\sharp}$, its pullback to $\\mathcal{Y}_{T,[0, n]}$ is given by an isomorphism $\\left.\\left(\\varphi^{*} \\mathcal{P}\\right)\\right|_{B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]} \\cong \\mathcal{P}\\left|{ }_{B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right.}\\right|$. The $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ defines a local $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-shtuka over $T$ if and only if $\\left.\\varphi_{\\mathcal{P}}\\right|_{B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]}$ induces an isomorphism $\\left.\\left(\\varphi^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|_{B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]} \\cong$ $\\left.\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right|_{B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]}$. By applying the Beauville-Laszlo lemma to $B_{T,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]$, it can be written as a condition that two $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsors of $\\mathcal{P}$ are equal over the $p$-adic completion of $W_{O_{F}}(A)\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]$. Now, we have $W_{O_{F}}(A)\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right] /(\\pi) \\cong A\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. Let $P$ be a $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor over $R$ corresponding to $\\left.\\mathcal{P}\\right|_{S}$. By Lemma 6.7, $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsors of $\\mathcal{P}$ over the $p$-adic completion of $W_{O_{F}}(A)\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]$ correspond to $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsors of $P \\otimes_{R} A\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. By Lemma 6.8, they correspond to sections of $P / \\mathcal{H}$ over $A\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. Now, through the isomorphism $\\left.\\left(\\varphi^{*} \\mathcal{P}\\right)\\right|_{B_{S,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]} \\cong$ $\\left.\\mathcal{P}\\right|_{B_{S,[0, n]}\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}}\\right]}$, each of $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ and $\\varphi^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ corresponds to a section of $P / \\mathcal{H}$ over $R\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. Since $P / \\mathcal{H}$ is separated, the equalizer locus of the two sections is the zero locus of an ideal $I \\subset R\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. Let $J \\subset R$ be an ideal such that $I=J\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$. Since $A$ is perfect, the composition $R \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow A\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right]$ factors through $R\\left[1 / \\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0}\\right] / I$ if and only if $\\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0} \\cdot J \\subset \\operatorname{Ker}(R \\rightarrow A)$. Thus, the locus where $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ defines a local $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-shtuka is a Zariski closed subset of $S$ given by the ideal $\\xi_{S^{\\sharp}, 0} \\cdot J$.\n\nWe can check that the condition in Proposition 5.44 holds in the following situation.\n\nProposition 6.12. Let $R$ be a perfectoid ring and let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)_{/ O_{F}}$. There is a perfectly projective $R^{e}$-scheme $Y$ and a finite \u00e9tale $R^{b}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]$-scheme $Z$ with a morphism $Z \\rightarrow Y$ such that we have the following commutative diagram\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\nthat is compatible with tilting equivalence $\\operatorname{Spd}(R) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{b}\\right)$.\nProof. By Proposition 6.4, $\\mathcal{P}$ is given by a $\\mathcal{G}$-BKF module $P$ over $R$. Let $Y=\\left(P \\otimes_{W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{b}\\right)}\\right.$ $\\left.R^{b}\\right) / \\mathcal{H}$. By Lemma 6.8, $Y$ is projective over $R^{b}$. For each perfect $R^{b}$-algebra $A, Y(A)$ classifies the set of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsors of $P \\otimes_{W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{b}\\right)} W_{O_{F}}(A)$ by Lemma 6.7. Thus, we see from Lemma 3.2 that $Y^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R^{b}\\right)^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{b}\\right) \\cong Y^{\\diamond} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(R^{b}\\right)^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{b}\\right)$ is isomorphic to $\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right] \\times_{\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right], \\mathcal{P}}$ $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$.\n\nBy Lemma 6.10, $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\eta}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ is finite \u00e9tale over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$. Let $R^{b,+} \\subset$ $R^{b}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]$ be the integral closure of $R^{b}$ inside $R^{b}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right]$. By [Sch17, Lemma 15.6], there is a unique finite \u00e9tale homomorphism $\\left(R^{b}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R, 0}\\right], R^{b,+}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$such that $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right) \\cong$ $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\eta}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)^{\\text {an }}$ under tilting equivalence. Let $Z=\\operatorname{Spec}(S)$. By construction, we have a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$. By restricting to $W_{O_{F}}(S), \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ gives a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor of $P \\otimes_{W_{O_{F}}\\left(R^{b}\\right)} W_{O_{F}}(S)$. By the above argument, it corresponds to a morphism $Z \\rightarrow Y$ and this morphism makes the given diagram commute by construction.\n\nNow, we can define the flat moduli space of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtukas over reduced excellent $p$-adic formal schemes admitting good covers.\nTheorem 6.13. Let $\\mathfrak{X}$ be a reduced excellent $p$-adic formal $O_{F}$-scheme admitting a good cover. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $\\mathfrak{X}_{/ O_{F}}^{\\circ}$. The $v$-closure of the generic fiber in $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}}$ $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ is representable by a unique reduced excellent distinguished $p$-adic formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ admitting a maximal good cover that is proper over $\\mathfrak{X}$ with $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\eta}$ finite \u00e9tale over $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}$.\n\nWe say that $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is the flat moduli space of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on $\\mathcal{P}$.\nProof. Let $Y=\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right] \\times_{\\left[* /\\left(L_{W}^{+} \\mathcal{G}\\right)^{\\diamond}\\right], \\mathcal{P}} \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$ and $Z=\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\eta}} \\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}$. By Lemma 6.10, $Y$ is separated over $\\mathfrak{X}^{\\diamond}$ and $Z$ is finite \u00e9tale over $\\mathfrak{X}_{\\eta}^{\\circ}$. By Proposition 6.12, we may apply Proposition 5.44 to $Z \\hookrightarrow Y$ to see the representability of the $v$-closure of $Z$ in $Y$. By Proposition 6.11, the $v$-closure of $Z$ in $Y$ lies in $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}} \\mathfrak{X}^{\\circ}$, so the claim follows.\n6.3. Integral models of local Shimura varieties. In this section, we prove the local representability of integral models of local Shimura varieties and the representability of the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagrams under hyperspecial levels.\n\nFrom now on, we suppose that $\\mathcal{G}$ is reductive over $O_{F}$. Fix an algebraic closure $\\bar{k}$ of $k$ and let $O_{\\bar{F}}=W_{O_{F}}(\\bar{k})$ and $\\bar{F}=O_{\\bar{F}}\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)$. Let $b \\in G(\\bar{F})$ and let $\\mu: \\mathbb{G}_{m} \\rightarrow G_{\\bar{F}}$ be a minuscule cocharacter. The triple $(\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu)$ is called a local Shimura datum at hyperspecial level. In [SW20, Lecture 24, 25], the local Shimura variety $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}$ and its integral model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ is defined for each triple $(\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu)$. They are constructed as small $v$-sheaves with moduli interpretation. It is known that $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}$ is uniquely represented by a smooth rigid analytic variety over $\\bar{F}$. It is still not known whether $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ is representable by a suitable formal scheme over $O_{\\bar{F}}$, outside the cases of abelian type (see [PR22]).\n\nWhat is known in general is the local representability of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ (see [Bar22], [SW20]). Let $r$ be the dimension of the local Shimura variety $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}$ and set $R=O_{\\bar{F}} \\llbracket T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\rrbracket$. Let $\\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $R$. We regard $R$ as a complete $p$-adic ring and $R^{\\wedge}$ denotes the $\\mathfrak{m}$-adic ring whose underlying ring is $R$.\nTheorem 6.14. ([Ito23a]) For every $x \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$, the formal completion $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is represented by $R^{\\wedge}$. The universal local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka on $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is induced by the universal $\\left(\\mathcal{G}, \\mu^{-1}\\right)$-display on the absolute prismatic site $(R)_{\\mathbb{A}}$.\n\nIn particular, the universal local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka on $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is defined over the $p$-adic ring $R$.\nNow, we will consider integral models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ at the parahoric level $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$. By Proposition 5.5 and Lemma 5.7, $R$ admits a very good cover. Thus, we may apply Theorem 6.13 to the local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka $\\mathcal{P}$ over the $p$-adic ring $R$. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ be the flat moduli space of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on $\\mathcal{P}$ and let $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge}$ be the $\\mathfrak{m}$-adic completion of $\\mathfrak{Y}$. Let $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ be the $v$-sheaf local model introduced in [SW20] and let $M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ be the $O_{\\bar{F}}$-scheme representing $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ that is constructed in [AGLR22].\nTheorem 6.15. The fiber product $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times{ }_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is represented by $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge}$. In particular, for every $y \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$, the formal completion $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$ is representable by a unibranch $p$-torsion free complete local Noetherian ring.\nProof. Let $Z=\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ and let $Z^{\\text {bdd }} \\subset Z$ be the closed subsheaf parametrizing $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$-bounded $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}$ represents the $v$-closure of $Z_{\\eta}$ in $Z$, there is an inclusion $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge} \\hookrightarrow Z^{\\text {bdd }}$.\n\nFirst, we show that $Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd }}$ is represented by a perfect scheme. By Lemma 6.10 and Proposition 6.12, $Z_{s}$ is represented by a perfect scheme $Z_{s}^{\\text {red }}$. The $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure over $Z_{s}$ is represented by an $F$-crystal with $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-structure $P_{s}^{\\prime}$ on $Z_{s}^{\\text {red }}$. By [Zhu17, Lemma 1.22], the locus $Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd,red }} \\subset Z_{s}^{\\text {red }}$ where the Frobenius of $P_{s}^{\\prime}$ is bounded by $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ is closed. For each geometric point $x: \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(C, C^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow Z_{s}$, the $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure is bounded by $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ at $x$ if and only if the corresponding morphism $\\operatorname{Spec}(C) \\rightarrow Z_{s}$ factors through $Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd,red }}$. Thus, $Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd }}$ is represented by $Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd,red }}$. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is proper over $\\operatorname{Spf}(R), \\mathfrak{Y}_{s}^{\\text {perf }} \\hookrightarrow Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd }}$ is a closed immersion.\n\nBy definition of integral models of local Shimura varieties, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is isomorphic to $Z^{\\text {bdd }} \\times_{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{\\wedge}\\right)$. For every closed point $y \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k}),\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$\n\nis topologically flat by [PR24, Proposition 3.4.1 (1)], so $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{Q^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$ is contained in $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ as we have $Z_{q}^{\\text {bdd }}=\\mathfrak{Y}_{q}^{\\circ}$. Thus, we may apply Lemma 6.16 to the m-adic completion of $\\mathfrak{Y}_{s}^{\\text {perf }} \\hookrightarrow Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd }}$ and we see that $\\mathfrak{Y}_{s}^{\\text {perf }} \\hookrightarrow Z_{s}^{\\text {bdd }}$ is an isomorphism after the m -adic completion. Thus, $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{Q^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\mathcal{M}_{Q, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{Q, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x}^{\\wedge}$ is an isomorphism on each fiber over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)$, so it is an isomorphism by [Sch17, Lemma 12.11].\n\nNext, we prove the second claim. Let $y \\in \\mathcal{M}_{Q^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$ and take $x \\in \\mathcal{M}_{Q, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$ to be the image of $y$. Let $\\operatorname{Spf}(S) \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$ be an affine open neighborhood of $y$ and let $S^{+} \\subset S_{[p]}^{[1]}$ be the integral closure of $S$. Since $R$ is normal and $\\left(S, S^{+}\\right)$is \u00e9tale over $\\left(R_{[p]}^{[1]}, R\\right), S^{+}$is normal by Corollary 2.10. Since $S$ is $p$-torsion free, reduced and excellent, $S \\subset S^{+}$is a finite extension. Let $\\mathfrak{n} \\subset S$ be the maximal ideal corresponding to $y$ and let $S^{\\wedge}$ (resp. $S^{+, \\wedge}$ ) be the $\\mathfrak{n}$-adic completion of $S$ (resp. $S^{+}$). By [Mat80, Theorem 79], $S^{+, \\wedge}$ is normal. Since $S_{[p]}^{[1]}=S^{+[1]}$ and $S \\subset S^{+}$is a finite extension, $S^{\\wedge}$ is $p$-torsion free and $S^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]=S^{+, \\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$. By construction, $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{Q^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$ is represented by $S^{\\wedge}$, so it is enough to show that $S^{\\wedge}$ is unibranch.\n\nBy [EGA4-4, Proposition 18.6.12], it is enough to show that $S^{\\wedge}$ has a unique minimal prime. Since $S^{\\wedge}$ is $p$-torsion free, the set of minimal primes of $S^{\\wedge}$ is bijective to that of $S^{\\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\cong S^{+, \\wedge}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$. Let $S^{+, \\wedge}=\\prod_{i \\in I} S_{i}^{+}$be the decomposition into normal domains. Since $S^{+, \\wedge}$ is finite over $S^{\\wedge}, S_{i}^{+}$is a $p$-torsion free complete local Noetherian ring. Now, we have $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta} \\cong \\prod_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{i}^{+}\\right)_{\\eta}$. Since $\\operatorname{Spa}\\left(S_{i}^{+}\\right)_{\\eta}$ is nonempty for every $i \\in I$, it follows from [PR24, Proposition 3.4.1(2)] that $I$ is a singleton. Thus, $S^{+, \\wedge}$ is a normal domain and the claim follows.\n\nThe following lemma is needed in the above proof. We say that a perfect formal scheme over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}$ is formally of finite type if it is Zariski locally isomorphic to $\\operatorname{Spf}(A)$ with $A=\\left(A_{0}^{\\text {perf }}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ for some formally finite type $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}$-algebra $A_{0}$. Note that such $A_{0}$ is an adic $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}$-algebra obtained as the completion of a finite type $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}$-algebra.\n\nLemma 6.16. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}$ be a perfect formal scheme perfectly formally of finite type over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}$ and let $\\mathfrak{Z} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$ be a closed perfect formal subscheme. If $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge} \\subset \\mathfrak{Z}^{\\circ}$ as subsheaves of $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}$ for every $y \\in \\mathfrak{Y}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{p}\\right)$, we have $\\mathfrak{Y}=\\mathfrak{Z}$.\n\nProof. We may assume that $\\mathfrak{Y}$ is affine. Let $\\mathfrak{Y}=\\operatorname{Spf}(A)$ and $\\mathfrak{Z}=\\operatorname{Spf}(A / I)$. Suppose that $I \\neq 0$ and let $a \\in I$ be a nonzero element. Since $a$ vanishes at every closed point of $\\mathfrak{Y}$, we see that $a$ is topologically nilpotent. Let $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n} \\in A$ be a generator of an ideal of definition of $A$. By Proposition 4.27, $\\operatorname{Spa}(A / a A) \\subset \\operatorname{Spa}(A)$ is a proper closed subspace and its complement is the union of $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}^{k} \\ldots f_{n}^{k}}{a}\\right)$ for $k \\geq 0$. Thus, there is some $k \\geq 0$ such that $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}^{k} \\ldots f_{n}^{k}}{a}\\right) \\neq \\phi$. The closure of $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}^{k} \\ldots f_{n}^{k}}{a}\\right)$ in $\\operatorname{Spa}(A)^{\\text {an }}$ is contained in $R\\left(\\frac{f_{1}^{k+1} \\ldots f_{n}^{k+1}}{a}\\right)$, so in particular, it is away from $\\operatorname{Spd}(A / a A)$. However, since the specialization map is closed, the image of the closure under the specialization map of $\\operatorname{Spa}(A)$ is a closed subset of $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(A_{\\text {red }}\\right)$.\n\nIn particular, it contains a closed point $y \\in \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(A_{\\text {red }}\\right)$. Then, we see that $\\left(\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$ contains a point in $R\\left(\\frac{f^{k+1} \\ldots f^{k+1}}{a}\\right)$, and we get a contradiction.\n\nRemark 6.17. We find several obstacles in running a similar argument to establish the repsentability of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ from that of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ is representable and let $\\operatorname{Spf}(R) \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ be an affine open subspace. Let $R_{0}$ be the underlying $p$-adic ring of $R$. First, we need to extend the universal local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over $\\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ to $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R_{0}\\right)$ and then we need to show that $R_{0}$ admits a good cover. We think that the first property can be checked if the local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka comes from a $p$-divisible group, and the second property follows from Lemma 5.7 if the $p$-adic uniformization is available (cf. [Mie20, Corollary 4.9]).\n\nThough we show the local representability of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$, it is hard to study the singularities of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ in this way. One way to study the singularities is to construct a local model diagram. For this reason, we reconstruct the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagram following [PR24, Section 4.9.3] with some modification, and show that the diagram can be represented by formal schemes. Note that the representability alone is insufficient for the study of singularities.\n\nFirst, we will construct a refinement of the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagram in [PR24, Section 4.9.3]. Let $\\mathfrak{U} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$ be an affine formal open subscheme. For every map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R, R^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{U}^{\\circ}$ over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(O_{\\tilde{F}}\\right)$, it uniquely formalizes to a map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{U}^{\\circ}$ and the $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{+}\\right)$corresponds to a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-BKF module $P_{R^{+}}^{\\prime}$ by Proposition 6.4. The functor taking such a pair $\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$to the set of the trivializations of $\\varphi^{*} P_{R^{+}}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{W_{\\left.O_{F}\\right)}\\left(R^{+5}\\right)} R^{+}$is a $v$-sheaf over $\\mathfrak{U}^{\\circ}$ by [Sch17, Theorem 8.7]. Let $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{U}}^{\\circ}$ denote that $v$-sheaf. By construction, we can glue $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{U}}^{\\circ}$ for all $\\mathfrak{U} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$, and we obtain a $v$-sheaf $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{Y}}^{\\circ}$ over $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ be the $v$-sheaf local model introduced in [SW20]. Let $M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ be the $O_{\\tilde{F}}$-scheme representing $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ that is constructed in [AGLR22]. By the same construction as in [PR24, Section 4.9.1], there is a natural map $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{Y}}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$. Here, we briefly recall the construction.\n\nLet $\\left(R, R^{+}\\right)$be as above and let $t: \\mathcal{G}_{R^{+}} \\cong \\varphi^{*} P_{R^{+}} \\otimes_{W_{\\left.O_{F}\\right)}\\left(R^{+5}\\right)} R^{+}$be a trivialization. By the smoothness of $\\mathcal{G}, t$ can be lifted to a trivialization $\\widetilde{t}: \\mathcal{G}_{W_{\\left.O_{F}\\right)}\\left(R^{+5}\\right)} \\cong \\varphi^{*} P_{R^{+}}$. The composition of $\\widetilde{t}$ with the Frobenius $\\varphi^{*} P_{R^{+}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R^{+}}\\right] \\cong P_{R^{+}}\\left[1 / \\xi_{R^{+}}\\right]$gives rise to a map $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(R^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{G}_{\\mathcal{G}}^{\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{GR}}^{+}}$. It factors through $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ by the boundedness condition on $\\mathcal{P}$. Thus, we get a morphism $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{Y}}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$.\n\nFrom now on, we will prove the representability of the diagram\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nin the category of $p$-adic formal schemes. First, we prove the case where $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{G}$.\nLemma 6.18. There is a $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor $Q$ over $R$ with a $\\mathcal{G}$-equivariant morphism $Q \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ that represents the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagram for $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{G}$.\nProof. This can be proved by following the descent theory of prismatic $(\\mathcal{G}, \\mu)$-displays developed in [Ito23b, Section 6]. We use the notation in [Ito23b] without explanation. See e.g. [Ito23b, Definition 4.3.4, Definition 5.2.1]. We refer to [Ito23b] for details.\n\nLet $(A, I)$ be a Breuil-Kisin $O_{E}$-prism of $R$ and let $\\left(A^{(2)}, I^{(2)}\\right)$ be the coproduct $(A, I) \\times$ $(A, I)$ in $(R)_{\\mathbb{A}}$. Let $p_{i}:(A, I) \\rightarrow\\left(A^{(2)}, I^{(2)}\\right)(i=1,2)$ be the natural inclusion and let $m:\\left(A^{(2)}, I^{(2)}\\right) \\rightarrow(A, I)$ be the multiplication map such that $m \\circ p_{1}=m \\circ p_{2}=\\operatorname{id}_{(A, I)}$.\n\nThe structure map of $(B, J) \\in(R)_{\\mathbb{A}}$ is denoted by $g_{(B, J)}: R \\rightarrow B / J$. Let $\\mathfrak{Q}^{\\text {univ }}$ be the universal $\\left(\\mathcal{G}, \\mu^{-1}\\right)$-display over $(R)_{\\mathbb{A}}$. The $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor $\\mathfrak{Q}_{(B, J)}^{\\text {univ }} \\times{ }^{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mu}, B, J} \\mathcal{G}_{B}$ over $B$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{Q}_{(B, J)}$ and its pullback to $B / J$ is denoted by $Q_{B / J}$.\n\nFor a morphism $f:(B, J) \\rightarrow\\left(B^{\\prime}, J^{\\prime}\\right)$ in $(R)_{\\mathbb{A}}$, let $\\bar{f}: B / J \\rightarrow B^{\\prime} / J^{\\prime}$ be the quotient map and let $\\psi_{f}: Q_{B^{\\prime} / J^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\bar{f}^{*} Q_{B / J}$ be the map induced by the functoriality of $\\mathfrak{Q}^{\\text {univ }}$.\n\nBy [Ito23b, Proposition 6.4.1], there is a unique isomorphism $\\iota: p_{1}^{*} \\mathfrak{Q}_{(A, I)}^{\\text {univ }} \\cong p_{2}^{*} \\mathfrak{Q}_{(A, I)}^{\\text {univ }}$ such that $m^{*} \\iota=\\operatorname{id}_{\\mathfrak{Q}_{(A, I)}^{\\text {univ }}}$. If we write $\\mathfrak{Q}_{(A, I)}^{\\text {univ }}=\\mathfrak{Q}_{Y}$ with $Y \\in \\mathcal{G}(A)_{I}$, the proof of [Ito23b, Proposition 6.4.1] shows that $\\iota$ is given by an element $g \\in \\mathcal{G}(I K)$ (corresponding to the claim $\\beta \\in G(d K)$ in the cited proof). It implies that the map $\\left(\\overline{p_{1}}\\right)^{*} Q_{A / I} \\cong\\left(\\overline{p_{2}}\\right)^{*} Q_{A / I}$ induced by $\\iota$ is equal to $g_{(A^{(2)}, J^{(2)})}^{*} \\operatorname{id}_{Q_{A / I}}$. This means that $\\psi_{p_{1}}=\\psi_{p_{2}}$.\n\nNow, let $(B, J)$ be a perfect $O_{E}$-prism over $R$. The $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor $\\mathcal{Q}_{(B, J)}$ is canonically isomorphic to $\\varphi^{*} P_{B / J}$ where $P_{B / J}$ is the corresponding $\\mathcal{G}$-BKF module over $B / J$ (see the construction in [Ito23b, Definition 5.5.2]). By Andr\u00e9's flatness lemma (see [BS22, Theorem 7.14]), there exists a faithfully flat cover $(B, J) \\rightarrow\\left(B^{\\prime}, J^{\\prime}\\right)$ that admits a morphism $f:(A, I) \\rightarrow\\left(B^{\\prime}, J^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nWe show that $\\psi_{f}$ is independent of the choice of $f$. Let $f^{\\prime}:(A, I) \\rightarrow\\left(B^{\\prime}, J^{\\prime}\\right)$ be another map and let $f \\times f^{\\prime}:\\left(A^{(2)}, I^{(2)}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(B^{\\prime}, J^{\\prime}\\right)$ be the product map. Then, we have\n\n$$\n\\psi_{f}=\\psi_{f \\times f^{\\prime}} \\circ\\left(\\overline{f \\times f^{\\prime}}\\right)^{*} \\psi_{p_{1}}=\\psi_{f \\times f^{\\prime}} \\circ\\left(\\overline{f \\times f^{\\prime}}\\right)^{*} \\psi_{p_{2}}=\\psi_{f^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nThus, we see that $\\psi_{f}$ is independent of $f$. This implies that $\\psi_{f}$ descends to an isomorphism $\\psi_{(B, J)}: Q_{B / J} \\cong g_{(B, J)}^{*} Q_{A / I}$. This isomorphism is compatible with any transition map, so $Q_{A / I}$ represents $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)}$ in the above diagram. It is easy to see from construction that $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Spd}(R)} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ is represented by the Hodge filtration $Q_{A / I} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ of $\\mathfrak{Q}_{(A, I)}^{\\text {univ }}$ (see [Ito23b, Section 5.4]).\nProposition 6.19. For every affine open formal subscheme $\\operatorname{Spf}(S) \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$, there is a finite type affine $S$-scheme $Q_{S}^{\\prime}$ with a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-action and a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-equivariant morphism $Q_{S}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ that represents the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagram over $\\operatorname{Spd}(A)$. Moreover, the $v$-sheaf theoretic local model diagram is representable in the category of p-adic formal schemes.\n\nNote that the proof does not show that $Q_{S}^{\\prime}$ is a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-torsor, nor that $Q_{S}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ is formally smooth after completion (Grothendieck-Messing theory).\n\nProof. We follow the notation in Proposition 5.39. Let $\\left(R_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ be a good cover of $R$ (see Proposition 5.5). Let $\\mathfrak{U} \\subset \\mathfrak{Y}$ be an affine open formal subscheme. Since $\\mathfrak{U}_{\\infty}$ is an affine perfectoid formal scheme, $\\mathfrak{U}$ admits a maximal good cover $\\left(S_{\\bullet}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ constructed as in Corollary 5.28 .\n\nFirst, we will construct $Q_{S}^{\\prime}$. The $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure over $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right)$ corresponds to a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-BKF module $P_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\circ}$ by Proposition 6.4. Let $Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}=\\varphi^{*} P_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{W_{O_{F}}\\left(S_{\\infty}^{\\prime}\\right)} S_{\\infty}$. By construction, we have $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\times \\mathfrak{P}^{\\circ} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{\\infty}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}\\right)$. Now, we have a natual $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-equivariant map $Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow Q \\otimes_{R} S_{\\infty}$. By Lemma 6.7, this map corresponds to an $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsor of $Q \\otimes_{R}\\left(S_{\\infty} / \\pi S_{\\infty}\\right)$. By Lemma 5.21, $S_{\\infty} / \\pi S_{\\infty} \\cong \\operatorname{colim}_{n \\geq 0} S_{n} / \\pi S_{n}$. Thus, the $\\mathcal{H}$-subtorsor of $Q$ can be defined over $S_{n} / \\pi S_{n}$ for some sufficiently large $n \\geq 0$. Again by Lemma 6.7, it corresponds to a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-subtorsor $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}$ of $Q \\otimes_{R} S_{n}$ and we have $Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime} \\cong Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{S_{n}} S_{\\infty}$. Let $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\wedge}$ be the $p$-adic completion of $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}$. By Lemma 3.9, $\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is a geometric quotient of $\\left(Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ by $\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{n}$, so we see that $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\times \\mathfrak{P}^{\\circ} \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(S_{n}\\right) \\cong\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$.\n\nNow, we have a natural map $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow Q \\otimes_{R} S_{n}$ and it is an isomorphism outside $V(p)$. In particular, we have $\\Gamma(Q, \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{n} \\hookrightarrow \\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\Gamma\\left(Q_{[p]}^{[\\underline{1}]}\\right], \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{n}$. Since $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}$ is flat over $S_{n}$ and $S_{\\infty} / S_{n}$ is $p$-torsion free, we have $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)=\\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\cap \\Gamma\\left(Q_{[p]}^{[\\underline{1}]}\\right], \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{n}$ inside $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{[p]}^{[\\underline{1}]}\\right], \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{\\infty}$. Since $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ acts on $P_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}, \\Gamma_{\\infty}$ also acts on $Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}$ and the action is compatible with the natural action on $Q \\otimes_{R} S_{\\infty}$. Thus, $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{\\infty}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ is $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$-stable in $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{[p]}^{[\\underline{1}]}\\right], \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{\\infty}$, so $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ is $\\Gamma_{n}$-stable in $\\Gamma\\left(Q_{[p]}^{[\\underline{1}]}\\right], \\mathcal{O}) \\otimes_{R} S_{n}$. Let $A_{S}=\\Gamma\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)^{\\Gamma_{n}}$. By Proposition 3.11, $\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(A_{S}\\right)$ is a geometric quotient by $\\Gamma_{n}$, so we see that $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\times \\mathfrak{P}^{\\circ} \\operatorname{Spd}(S) \\cong \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(A_{S}\\right)$. Since $S_{n}$ is finite over $S$ and $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}$ is of finite type over $S_{n}, A_{S}$ is of finite type over $S$.\n\nLet $A_{S}^{\\wedge}$ be the $p$-adic completion of $A_{S}$. We will show that $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(A_{S}^{\\wedge}\\right)$ can be glued to a $p$-adic fomal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$ over $\\mathfrak{Y}$. Let $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}(S)$ be a distinguished affine formal open subscheme. Let $S_{n}^{\\prime}=S_{n} \\otimes_{S} S^{\\prime}$. Since $S_{n}$ is finite over $S, S_{n}^{\\prime}$ is $p$-adically complete, and $\\left(S_{\\bullet}^{\\prime}, \\Gamma_{\\bullet}\\right)$ is a maximal good cover of $S^{\\prime}$ by Lemma 5.31. By construction, we have $Q_{S_{n}^{\\prime}}^{\\prime} \\cong Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{S_{n}} S_{n}^{\\prime}$. Since $S \\rightarrow S^{\\prime}$ is flat, we see that $A_{S^{\\prime}} \\cong A_{S} \\otimes_{S} S^{\\prime}$. In particular, $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(A_{S^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(A_{S}^{\\wedge}\\right)$ is a disguised open immersion. Thus, we can glue $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(A_{S}^{\\wedge}\\right)$ for all $\\operatorname{Spf}(S) \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak{Y}$ to get a $p$-adic formal scheme $\\mathfrak{Y}$. By construction, $\\mathfrak{Y}$ represents the $v$-sheaef $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}$.\n\nNext, we show that $\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ is representable by a morphism $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$. Since $R$ is a complete local ring with an algebraically closed residue field, $Q$ is a trivial $\\mathcal{G}$-torsor. Since $\\mathcal{G}_{\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}_{\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}} / \\mathcal{H}_{\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}}$ is Zariski locally split, for every sufficiently small affine open subset $\\operatorname{Spf}(B) \\subset$ $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$, we can lift the element of $(Q / \\mathcal{H})(B / \\pi B)$ corresponding to $Q_{B}^{\\prime}=Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\otimes_{S_{n}} B$ to an element of $Q(B / \\pi B)$. Since $Q$ is smooth, it can be lifted to an element of $Q(B)$, so $Q_{B}^{\\prime}$ is a trivial $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-torsor. Let $t: \\operatorname{Spec}(B) \\rightarrow Q_{B}^{\\prime}$ be a trivialization. The composition $\\operatorname{Spd}(B) \\rightarrow$ $\\left(Q_{B}^{t \\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$ can be represented by a morphism $\\operatorname{Spf}(B) \\rightarrow\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ by Lemma 5.33 since\n\nits generic fiber can be represented by $\\operatorname{Spa}(B)_{\\eta} \\rightarrow Q_{B, \\eta}^{\\prime \\wedge} \\rightarrow Q_{B, \\eta}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu, \\eta}^{\\mathrm{loc}} \\cong M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu, \\eta}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$. Thus, we get a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-equivariant morphism $Q_{B}^{\\prime \\wedge} \\rightarrow\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ that represents $\\left(Q_{B}^{\\prime \\wedge}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$. It is easy to see that this map is independent of the choice of $t$. Thus, we can glue these morphisms to get a morphism $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge} \\rightarrow\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}$. By construction, it represents $\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$.\n\nNow, we have the following diagram.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nSince $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow Q_{S_{n}}$ and $M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ are isomorphisms outside $V(p)$, we may apply [Stacks, Tag 0ARB] to $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime}$ and $Q_{S_{n}} \\times_{M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}} M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ to see that $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge} \\rightarrow Q_{S_{n}}^{\\wedge} \\times_{\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}}\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ is uniquely algebraizable. Thus, we can uniquely fill the middle vertical arrow $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$.\n\nSince $Q_{S_{n}} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ is invariant under $\\Gamma_{n}$ by construction, $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$ is also invariant under $\\Gamma_{n}$. Since $Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(A_{S}\\right)$ is a coarse moduli space by [Con05, Theorem 3.1], the map factors through $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(A_{S}\\right) \\rightarrow M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$. Since $\\left(Q_{S_{n}}^{\\prime \\wedge}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spd}\\left(A_{S}\\right)$ is surjective, the map represents $\\operatorname{Spd}\\left(A_{S}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}$. By the previous argument, we see that $\\operatorname{Spf}\\left(A_{S}^{\\wedge}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}$ can be glued to a morphism $\\mathfrak{\\mathfrak { Y }} \\rightarrow\\left(M_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\mathrm{loc}}\\right)^{\\wedge}$.\n6.4. Canonical integral models of Shimura varieties. In this section, we construct canonical integral models of Shimura varieties under hyperspecial levels assuming the existence of those at hyperspecial levels. In this section, $(-)^{\\wedge}$ denotes the $p$-adic completion.\n\nLet $(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ be a Shimura datum satisfying the axiom (SV5). Let $\\mathrm{K}=\\mathrm{K}_{p} \\mathrm{~K}^{p} \\subset \\mathbf{G}\\left(\\mathbb{A}_{f}\\right)$ be a compact open subgroup such that $\\mathrm{K}^{p} \\subset \\mathbf{G}\\left(\\mathbb{A}_{f}^{p}\\right)$ is a sufficiently small (or neat) compact open subgroup and $\\mathrm{K}_{p} \\subset \\mathbf{G}\\left(\\mathbb{Q}_{p}\\right)$ is a parahoric subgroup. Let $\\mathbf{E}$ be the reflex field of $(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$. Let $v$ be a place of $\\mathbf{E}$ over $p$ and set $E=\\mathbf{E}_{v}$. The Shimura variety $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ is expected to admit an integral model $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ over $O_{E}$. In the abelian type, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is constructed in [Kis10], [KP18] and [KPZ24] under mild assumptions.\n\nThe theory of canonical integral models is developed to characterize a family $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$. In [PR24], canonical integral models are characterized in terms of local shtukas. Let us briefly recall the theory of canonical integral models after [PR24].\n\nLet $G=\\mathbf{G}_{Q_{p}}$ and let $\\mathcal{G}$ be a parahoric group scheme of $G$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with $\\mathcal{G}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)=\\mathrm{K}_{p}$. Let $\\{\\mu\\}$ be a geometric conjugacy class of minuscule cocharacters of $G$ corresponding to $\\mathbf{X}$. Then, $E$ is the reflex field of $\\{\\mu\\}$. Let $k$ be the residue field of $E$ and fix an algebraic closure $\\bar{k}$ of $k$. Let $O_{\\bar{E}}=W_{O_{E}}(\\bar{k})$ and $\\bar{E}=\\left.O_{\\bar{E}}\\right|_{\\bar{p}} ^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. For each $b \\in B\\left(G, \\mu^{-1}\\right)$, we have a local Shimura datum $(\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu)$ and an integral model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}$ over $O_{\\bar{E}}$ of the local Shimura variety $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b, \\mu}$ over $\\bar{E}$. The axioms of canonical integral models $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$, which is a family of normal flat separated $O_{E}$-scheme of finite type, are as follows (see [PR24, Theorem 1.3.2]):\n\n(0) $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ admits finite \u00e9tale prime-to- $p$ Hecke correspondences.\n(1) For every discrete valuation ring $R$ of mixed characteristic over $O_{E}$,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\underline{\\lim }_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})\\right)\\left(R\\lfloor\\frac{1}{p}\\rceil\\right)=\\left(\\underline{\\lim }_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right)(R)\n$$\n\n(2) The local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}, E}$ over $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ extends to a local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ over $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$.\n(3) For every $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\bar{k})$, there exists an isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\Theta_{x}:\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{\\lrcorner x_{0}}^{\\wedge} \\cong\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K} \\mid x}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\diamond}\n$$\n\nfor a suitable $b_{x} \\in G\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{p}\\right)$ and a base point $x_{0} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$ that is compatible with local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtukas on each side.\nNote that in the condition (2), $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ (resp. $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}, E}$ ) is defined over the $v$-sheafification of the $p$-adic completion $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\wedge}$ (resp. the adic space $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{\\underline{E}}^{\\mathrm{ad}}$ ).\n\nNow, by [DHKZ24b], [IKY23] and [DY24], most of the integral models $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ constructed in [Kis10], [KP18] and [KPZ24] are verified to be canonical in the sense of [PR24]. Here, we explain a relation between integral models at two different parahoric levels in terms of level structures on local shtukas, which can be expected from the diagram in [DHKZ24a, Theorem VII].\n\nLet $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ be another parahoric group scheme of $G$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with a morphism $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$. It corresponds to a parahoric subgroup $\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathrm{K}_{p}$. Let $\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{K}^{p}$ for each $\\mathrm{K}^{p}$.\n\nTheorem 6.20. Suppose that $\\mathrm{K}_{p}$ is hyperspecial and there exists a system of canonical integral models $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ of $\\left\\{\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ in the sense of Pappas-Rapoport. For every $\\mathrm{K}^{p}$, there is a normal flat separated algebraic space $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ of finite type over $O_{E}$ with $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, \\mathrm{E}} \\cong$ $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ such that\n(1) $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is proper and surjective over $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$, and\n(2) $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}$ is the flat moduli space of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$.\n\nMoreover, $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ satisfies the above axioms (0)-(3) of canonical integral models.\nProof. Let $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\bar{k})$ be a closed point. By the axiom (3), we have $\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K} \\mid x}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\diamond} \\cong\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{\\lrcorner x_{0}}^{\\wedge}$. By [Bar22] and [Ito23a], $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{\\lrcorner x_{0}}^{\\wedge}$ is represented by $O_{\\bar{E}}\\left\\llbracket T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r}\\right\\rrbracket$ for some $r \\geq 0$. Note that $E$ is unramified over $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ since $G$ splits over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{p}$. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is normal, flat and of finite type, it follows from [SW20, Proposition 18.4.1] that $\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right)_{\\lrcorner x}^{\\wedge} \\cong \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(O_{\\bar{E}} \\llbracket T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\rrbracket\\right)$. Thus, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is smooth over $O_{E}$.\n\nBy Proposition 5.9, we may apply Theorem 6.13 to the local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Let $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ be the flat moduli space of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Let $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\bar{k})$ be a closed point and take $b_{x}$ and $x_{0}$ as in the axiom (3). Here, we follow the notation in Section 6.3. Let $R=O_{\\bar{E}} \\llbracket T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{r} \\rrbracket$ and take the local $\\mathcal{G}$-shtuka over the $p$-adic ring $R$ to be the one induced from $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ by the pullback $\\operatorname{Spec}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$. By Theorem $6.15, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times{ }_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{\\lrcorner x_{0}}^{\\wedge}$ is\n\nrepresented by $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\wedge}$. By construction, we have a map $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\circ}$. Since there is a natural morphism $\\mathfrak{Y}_{\\eta} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, \\eta}$ of adic spaces by [Sch17, Lemma 15.6], that map is uniquely represented by a morphism $\\mathfrak{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ by Lemma 5.33. Thus, we have a morphism $\\mathfrak{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\wedge}} \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$. Since $\\operatorname{Spec}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}$ is flat, $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}} \\operatorname{Spf}(R)$ is flat over $O_{\\bar{E}}$. Since $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\circ} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$ are both thick closed subsheaves of $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{K}}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$, it follows from the uniqueness of thick closures that $\\mathfrak{Y}^{\\circ} \\cong \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\circ} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}} \\operatorname{Spd}(R)$. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\circ} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K} / x}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\cong \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x_{0}}^{\\wedge}\n$$\n\nIn particular, for every $y \\in \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k})$, there exists an isomorphism $\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime} / y}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\cong\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{y}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y_{0}}^{\\wedge}$ with $b_{y}=b_{x}$ and $y_{0} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}(\\bar{k})$ where $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\bar{k})$ is the image of $y$.\n\nNow, since $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, \\eta}$ is finite etale over $\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta}, \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, \\eta}$ is smooth, so in particular, normal. It follows from [AGLR22, Lemma 2.13] and Lemma 5.33 that $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ is absolutely weakly normal. Thus, it follows from [PR24, Proposition 3.4.1 (2)] and [AGLR22, Proposition 2.38] that $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ is normal.\n\nNext, we show that $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta}$ is the pullback of $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$. By construction in [PR24, Proposition 4.1.2], $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{K}, E}$ corresponds to the pro-\u00e9tale $\\mathrm{K}_{p}$-cover $\\underset{\\leftarrow}{\\lim }_{\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}} \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}} \\mathrm{K}^{p}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ of $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$. By the proof of Lemma 6.10, we see that $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{K}, E}}$ $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{\\bar{E}}^{\\text {ad }}$ classifies $\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime}$-subcovers of that pro-\u00e9tale $\\mathrm{K}_{p}$-cover, and $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}} \\mathrm{K}^{p}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ is isomorphic to $\\left(\\underline{\\lim }_{\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}} \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}} \\mathrm{K}^{p}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})\\right) / \\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus, we have $\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\eta} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}, \\eta}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{K}, E}} \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{\\bar{E}}^{\\text {ad }} \\cong$ $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{\\bar{E}}^{\\text {ad }}$ and we get the claim.\n\nFinally, we construct an algebraic model $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ of $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$. Let $U \\subset \\mathscr{S}_{k}$ be an arbitrary affine open subset and let $U=\\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. Let $A\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\rightarrow B$ be the finite \u00e9tale morphism representing $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ over $U_{\\eta}$. Let $B^{+} \\subset B$ be the integral closure of $A$. Let $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\subset \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ be the open formal subscheme over $U^{\\wedge} \\subset \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}^{\\wedge}$. Since $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}$ admits a maximal good cover by construction, it follows from Lemma 5.30 that $\\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U, \\eta}, \\mathcal{O}^{\\circ \\circ}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\hookrightarrow$ $\\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U, \\eta}, \\mathcal{O}^{+}\\right) \\cong\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{\\wedge}$. Thus, there is a finite $A$-subalgebra $B_{0} \\subset B^{+}$such that $B_{0}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]=B$ and there is a homomorphism $B_{0}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$. By Proposition 2.18, $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(B_{0}^{\\wedge}\\right)$ is a formal modification. By [Art70, Theorem 3.2], there is a unique proper morphism $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(B_{0}\\right)$ of algebraic spaces that is an isomorphism outside $V(p)$ and induces $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spf}\\left(B_{0}^{\\wedge}\\right)$ by taking the $p$-adic completion. It is easy to see from the uniqueness of $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}$ that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}$ is independent of the choice of $B_{0} \\subset B$ and its construction is functorial in $U$. In particular, we can glue them to obtain an algebraic space $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ over $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}}$ such that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\cong \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\cong \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$.\n\nWe prove that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ is normal. Take an \u00e9tale cover $V \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ from a scheme $V$ and consider the $p$-adic completion $V^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}, U}$. Since any $p$-adically completely \u00e9tale homomorphism can be written as the $p$-adic completion of an \u00e9tale homomorphism by [Elk73], it follows from [Mat80, Theorem 79] and the normality of $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathcal{K}^{\\prime}}$ that $V^{\\wedge}$ is normal. For any affine open subscheme $\\operatorname{Spec}(C) \\subset V, C \\rightarrow C^{\\wedge} \\times C\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right]$ is faithfully flat, so $C$ is normal by [Mat80,\n\nCorollary 21.3]. Thus, $V$ is normal, and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is normal. Moreover, since $\\mathcal{S}_{K^{\\prime}, U}$ is $p$-torsion free, $V^{\\wedge}$ is $p$-torsion free. Thus, $C$ is $p$-torsion free and $V$ is flat over $O_{E}$.\n\nNow, we have an integral model $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ of $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$. By construction, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is proper over $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is flat over $O_{E}$ and $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ is surjective, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is surjective. Thus, the condition (1) and (2) is verified for $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$. We will verify that $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ satisfies the axioms $(0)-(3)$.\n\nFirst, we check the axiom (1). Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic over $O_{E}$. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is proper over $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$, it follows from the valuative criterion that any element $y \\in \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{X})\\left(R_{[p]}^{(\\underline{1})}\\right)$ can be uniquely lifted to $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(R)$ as soon as we have a lift to $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(R)$ of the image of $y$ in $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{X})\\left(R_{[p]}^{(\\underline{1})}\\right)$. Thus, the extension property of $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ follows from that of $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$. The axiom (2) follows from the construction because the universal $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure over $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is the unique extension of $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, E}$. The axiom (3) is already proved for $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$. Thus, it is enough to check that $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ admits finite \u00e9tale prime-to- $p$ Hecke correspondences.\n\nLet $\\mathrm{K}_{i}^{p}(i=0,1)$ be sufficiently small (or neat) compact open subgroups with $g \\mathrm{~K}_{0}^{p} g^{-1} \\subset$ $\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{1}$ for $g \\in G\\left(\\mathbb{A}_{f}^{p}\\right)$. Let $\\mathrm{K}_{i}=\\mathrm{K}_{p} \\mathrm{~K}_{i}^{p}$ (resp. $\\mathrm{K}_{i}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{K}_{i}^{p}$ ) for $i=0,1$. By assumption, we have a finite \u00e9tale prime-to- $p$ Hecke correspondence $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}$ associated with $g$. By [PR24, Theorem 2.7.7, Proposition 4.1.2], $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}$ is isomorphic to the pullback of $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}$ along the Hecke correspondence of $g$. Thus, we have a closed immersion $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ by construction. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}$ is finite \u00e9tale, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}$ is normal and flat over $O_{E}$. In particular, $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is thick, so $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is an isomorphism. By [SW20, Proposition 18.4.1], $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}^{\\wedge}$ is an isomorphism, so it follows from [Art70, Theorem 3.2] that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}}$ is an isomorphism. In particular, we obtain a finite \u00e9tale Hecke correspondence $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{0}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\\prime}}$ associated with $g$.\n\nAs a result, we obtain the following corollary. We keep the notation in Theorem 6.20.\nCorollary 6.21. The p-adic completion $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}$ represents the $v$-sheaf parametrizing $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structures on $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ bounded by $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mu}^{\\text {loc }}$. Moreover, $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ y}^{\\wedge}$ is representable by a normal $p$-torsion free complete local Noetherian ring if $b=b_{x}$ and $y$ is over $x_{0}$ for some $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\bar{k})$. Proof. The claim follows from $\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\times_{\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K} / x}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\cong \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }} \\times_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{G}, b_{x}, \\mu}^{\\text {int }}\\right)_{/ x_{0}}^{\\wedge}$.\n\nEven if $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, E}$ is a scheme and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{p}}$ is locally projective over a scheme $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}, \\mathbb{F}_{p}}$, it does not directly follow that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is a scheme (for example, see [Mat15, Section 5.2]). We will show that $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is a canonical integral model of $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ if there exists one by partially following the proof of uniqueness of canonical integral models (see [Pap23, Theorem 7.1.7]).\nProposition 6.22. Under the situation in Theorem 6.20, if there is a system of canonical integral models $\\left\\{S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ of $\\left\\{\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}\\right\\}$, we have an isomorphism $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\cong \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$.\nProof. By [PR24, Corollary 4.3.2], there is a natural map $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$. Since $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is a $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ level structure on $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ over $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$, we have a map $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\operatorname{Sht}_{\\mathcal{G}}, \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}}}\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$. Since\n\n$S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is flat over $O_{E},\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, \\eta}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is dense in $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ (see [Lou20, Lemma 4.4]), so we have a map $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)^{\\circ}$. By [SW20, Proposition 18.4.1], it is representable by a morphism $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$.\n\nLet $U \\subset \\mathscr{S}_{k}$ be an affine open subset and let $U=\\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. Let $A\\left[\\frac{1}{p}\\right] \\rightarrow B$ be the finite \u00e9tale morphism representing $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ over $U_{\\eta}$. Let $B^{+} \\subset B$ be the integral closure of $A$. Let $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\subset S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ be the inverse image of $U$. Since $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, E} \\cong \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$, we have $p^{N} \\cdot B^{+} \\subset \\Gamma\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ for some $N \\geq 0$. By setting $B_{0}=A+p^{N} \\cdot B^{+}$for sufficiently large $N \\geq 0$, we get a finite $A$-algebra $B_{0}$ admitting $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(B_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(B_{0}\\right)$ that are isomorphisms outside $V(p)$. By [Stacks, Tag 0ARB], $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U}$ is uniquely algebraizable to $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U}$. By gluing these morphisms, we see that $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is uniquely algebraizable to $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$. We will show that this is an isomorphism.\n\nLet $y \\in S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, U}(\\bar{k})$ be a closed point and let $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\bar{k})$ be the image of $y$. By [PR24, (4.7.1), (4.8.2)], we have the following commutative diagram for a unique $y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k})$.\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nSince $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is induced by the $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$-level structure $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$, the isomorphism $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\cong$ $\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$ commutes with $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)^{\\circ}$. In particular, $y^{\\prime}$ is the image of $y$ and we have $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y}^{\\wedge} \\cong \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}$ by [SW20, Proposition 18.4.1]. It follows that $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k}) \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k})$ is injective since if $y_{0}, y_{1} \\in S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k})$ maps to $y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\bar{k})$, both of $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y_{i}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta}(i=0,1)$ isomorphically map to $\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime} / y^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta}$, so the injectivity of $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}^{\\wedge}\\right)_{\\eta}$ implies $y_{0}=y_{1}$.\n\nLet $V \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ be an \u00e9tale cover by an $O_{E}$-scheme $V$ and let $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V}=S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\times_{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}} V$. Since $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V}(\\bar{k}) \\rightarrow V(\\bar{k})$ is injective and $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V}\\right)_{E} \\rightarrow V_{E}$ is an isomorphism, $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V} \\rightarrow V$ is quasi-finite by [EGA4-4, Corollaire 13.1.4]. Since $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ are separated over $O_{E}$, we may apply Zariski's main theorem to $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V} \\rightarrow V$. Since it is birational and $V$ is normal, $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V} \\rightarrow V$ is an open immersion.\n\nSuppose that there is a closed point $y_{0} \\in V(\\bar{k})$ outside $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V}$. Since $V$ is flat over $O_{E}$, $y_{0}$ can be lifted to a point $y \\in V(R)$ with $R$ a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic over $O_{E}$. Since $R$ is strictly henselian and prime-to- $p$ Hecke correspondences are finite \u00e9tale, $y$ can be lifted to $y^{p} \\in \\lim _{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(R)$. By the extension property of $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$, $\\left\\{y_{R[1 / p]}^{p}\\right\\}$ can be lifted to an $R$-valued point of $\\lim _{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$. In particular, $y_{R[1 / p]}$ can be lifted to $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(R)$. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is separeted, this contradicts the assumption on $y_{0}$. Thus, we see that $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}, V} \\cong V$ and $S_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nIn particular, Proposition 6.22 implies that the functoriality of canonical integral models automatically satisfies [HR17, Axiom 3.1] under hyperspecial levels. In fact, this can be checked for every $\\mathrm{K}_{p}^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathrm{K}_{p}$ directly by following the proof of [Pap23, Proposition 7.1.9].\n\nProposition 6.23. Let $\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ (resp. $\\left.\\left\\{\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}\\right)$ be a system of canonical integral models of $\\left\\{\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}$ (resp. $\\left.\\left\\{\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{K}^{p}}\\right)$. The morphism $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ constructed in [PR24, Corollary 4.3.2] is proper and surjective.\n\nProof. Let $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\xrightarrow{j} Y \\xrightarrow{\\pi} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ be a Nagata compactification of $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ (see [Con07, Theorem 4.1]). By replacing $Y$ with the Zariski closure of $j\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)$, we may assume that $j$ has a dense image. Since $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ is finite \u00e9tale, we have $Y_{E} \\cong \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})_{E}$ and $Y-j\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)$ lies in the special fiber of $Y$. Suppose that we have a closed point $y_{0} \\in Y(\\bar{k})$ outside $j\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)$. Since $Y$ is flat over $O_{E}, y_{0}$ can be lifted to a point $y \\in Y(R)$ with $R$ a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic over $O_{E}$. Let $x \\in \\mathscr{S}_{K}(R)$ be the image of $y$. Since $R$ is strictly henselian, $x$ can be lifted to some $x^{p} \\in \\lim _{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}(R)$. Then, $x_{R[1 / p]}^{p} \\times y_{R[1 / p]}$ defines an element of $\\lim _{\\mathrm{K}^{p}} \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})(R[1 / p])$, so we see that $y_{R[1 / p]}$ extends to $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(R)$. Since $Y$ is separated, $y$ lies in $j\\left(\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}\\right)$, but this is a contradiction. Thus, $j$ is an isomorphism and $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is proper. Since $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is flat over $O_{E}$ and $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ is surjective, $\\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{S}_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is a proper surjection.\n\nNote that Proposition 6.23 does not rely on the axiom (SV5). However, the proof of Theorem 6.20 relies on (SV5) in that $\\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sh}_{\\mathrm{K}}(\\mathbf{G}, \\mathbf{X})$ is a finite \u00e9tale covering locally isomorphic to the finite set $\\mathcal{K}_{p} / \\mathcal{K}_{p}^{\\prime}$.
