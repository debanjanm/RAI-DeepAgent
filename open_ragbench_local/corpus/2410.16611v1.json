In the seminal work, Dybvig (1995) formulate an infinite horizon utility maximization problem under ratcheting constraint on consumption $c_{t} \\geq \\sup _{s \\leq t} c_{s}$, premising the situation with non-decreasing consumption rate. Along this direction, fruitful research studies can be found by considering different variations and extensions. To name a few, Angoshtari et al. (2019) study a similar utility maximization problem under a drawdown constraint on the excessive dividend rate until the bankruptcy time by mandating the current consumption rate to stay above a fraction of the past consumption peak $c_{t} \\geq \\lambda \\sup _{s \\leq t} c_{s}$ with $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$; Guasoni et al. (2020) propose the shortfall averse preference to measure the performance of relative consumption on the ratio between the current consumption and the historical consumption running maximum process; Jeon and Park (2021) examine the problem of Angoshtari et al. (2019) under general utility functions by utilizing the martingale duality method to relate the original control problem to some infinite horizon optimal stopping problems; Jeon and Oh (2022) later generalize the methodology in Jeon and Park (2021) to finite time horizon stochastic control problems; Deng et al. (2022) consider a different formulation in which the utility is generated by the difference between the current consumption and the historical consumption running maximum process, and Deng et al. (2022) provide the closed-form optimal consumption in the piecewise manner depending on the wealth level; Li et al. (2023) incorporate the life insurance purchase into the decision making under the shortfall averse preference in Guasoni et al. (2020) under the additional consumption drawdown constraint; Li et al. (2024) generalize the problem formulation in Deng et al. (2022) under S-shaped utility by featuring the loss aversion effect on relative consumption; Liang et al. (2023) generalize the problem formulation in Deng et al. (2022) to both reference level and drawdown constraint and reveal some new financial implications; Tanana (2023) refine the convex duality approach and establish the general duality theorem for the optimal consumption under a drawdown constraint in incomplete semimartingale markets; Recently, Chen et al. (2024) revisit the finite horizon problem in Jeon and Park (2021) on excessive consumption under a drawdown constraint using the PDE techniques and characterize the associated time-dependent free boundaries in analytical forms.\n\nAnother important branch of research in optimal investment and consumption is to concern the performance relative to an exogenous benchmark process, which might refer to the market index process, inflation rates, liabilities, etc. Portfolio management problems with various types of benchmark tracking have been extensively studied over the past decades. For example, Browne (1999a) consider some active portfolio management problems, including maximizing the probability of reaching a given wealth level while beating the performance of a benchmark; Browne (1999b) study the problem to minimize the expected time to reach the performance goal. Later, Browne (2000) examine the mixture of these two objectives as well as maximizing the expected reward and minimizing the expected penalty paid upon falling to the shortfall level. A large related literature also focus on measuring and minimizing the tracking error, see for instance, Gaivoronski et al. (2005), Yao et al. (2006) and Ni et al. (2022), which formulate the associated linear-quadratic stochastic control problems. Recently, a different tracking formulation using the fictitious capital injection is developed in Bo et al. (2021). Later, Bo et al. $(2023,2024)$ further study this optimal tracking portfolio problem by combing the utility maxization over consumption with different types of benchmark processes.\n\nIn the present paper, we draw upon the flexible benchmark tracking formulation as in Bo et al. (2021, 2023, 2024), in which it is presumed that a fund manager may tactically infuse\n\nfictitious capital as singular control into the fund account such that the total capital perpetually surpasses the designated benchmark process. We combine this optimal tracking control problem under dynamic state constraints with the additional drawdown constraint on the consumption control (see the problem formulation in (2.6)). This results in a class of non-standard optimal regular-singular control problems with dynamic state-control constraints. In addition, the change of variables and the dimension reduction cannot be applied as the homogeneity in the objective function of (2.6) no longer holds even when we consider power utility. To fit into the Markovian framework, we need to consider the value function with three state variables.\n\nTo resolve the intricate dynamic state-control constraint in problem (2.6), we first follow the techniques in Bo et al. $(2023,2024)$ to consider an equivalent problem formulation (2.10) with only regular controls such that the wealth state constraints induced by benchmark tracking can be absorbed by considering a new state process with reflections at the boundary 0 . Therefore, comparing with Bo et al. (2023, 2024), our main challenge in this paper is to cope with the drawdown constraint on consumption for the auxiliary stochastic control problem with reflections and one more state process described by the consumption running maximum process. Mathematically speaking, we encounter an associated HJB variational inequality (HJB-VI) with both Neumann boundary condition (due to the state reflection) and the free boundary condition (stemming from the consumption drawdown constraint). The main contributions of the present paper are to provide a thorough analysis of this new three-dimensional HJB equation with Neumann boundary and free boundary conditions as well as some novel and technical verification arguments on optimality as the objective function in (2.10) involves the non-standard local time of the reflected state process and the drawdown control constraint exhibits some path-dependent features. To analyze the HJB-VI problem, we first decompose the entire three-dimensional domain into five regions and transform the HJB-VI into a piecewise linear dual PDE with Neuamnn boundary and free boundary conditions together with a super-contact condition. We conjecture that the solution to the dual PDE problem satisfies a separation form. By utilizing the smooth-fit principle and the super-contact condition, we obtain a closed-form solution of the dual PDE and the free boundary can be characterized as the unique solution to some algebraic equation (see Proposition (3.1)). Using the inverse transform, we can further express the value function and the feedback optimal investment and consumption in terms of the three primal variables.\n\nFor the verification proof of Theorem 4.4, let us first highlight some main differences between our problem and some existing studies in the literature. On one hand, comparing with Bo et al. $(2023,2024)$ that handles the non-standard objective function involving the local time of the reflected state process, the drawdown consumption constraint significantly complicates the feedback functions of the optimal portfolio and consumption. Moreover, the free boundary, as an implicit function of the consumption historical maximum level, brings some new obstacles. The arguments in Bo et al. $(2023,2024)$ using the estimations of the optimal feedback controls and the dual representation cannot be directly adopted, especially in the proof of the transversality condition. On the other hand, some previous studies on drawdown constraint or consumption running maximum such as Angoshtari et al. (2019), Deng et al. (2022), Li et al. (2024) consider the standard Black-Scholes model such that the dual process as the unique state price density can be employed to facilitate the proof of the transversality condition. In sharp contrast, we choose to work in the auxiliary control problem where the primal state process satisfies a non-standard reflected SDE (2.9). As a consequence, we are lack of the well-established duality theorem and\n\nsome novel arguments are needed to overcome our new obstacles in the proof of the verification theorem. First, we manage to establish some growth estimations of the piecewise optimal feedback controls as well as the free boundary function in terms of the primal variables. Then, in response to the difficulties in verifying the key transversality condition, we introduce in the present paper an auxiliary dual reflected diffusion process defined in (4.40), which is constructed from the model of the primal auxiliary optimal control problem with reflections. Using this constructed dual process, we are able to derive a duality representation of the primal value function in (4.41) and a duality inequality (4.42). We then provide some new verification arguments by taking advantage of this duality inequality and passing the transversality condition from the primary state processes to the reflected dual process. Thanks to some newly established properties and moment estimations of the reflected dual process in Lemmas A. 2 and A.3, we finally can derive the desired transversality conditions under some mild conditions on the discount rate.\n\nMoreover, by using the reflected dual process, we can show that the expectation of the total optimal discounted capital injection is always finite and positive in Lemma 4.6. As a result, the capital injection is indeed necessary to meet the dynamic benchmark tracking constraint and our problem is well defined as it excludes the injection of infinite capital to fulfil the benchmark tracking constraint and the drawdown consumption constraint. In addition, some numerical examples on sensitivity results of model parameters are presented to compensate the theoretical results and illustrate some quantitative properties and financial implications of the optimal feedback control functions and the expectation of the discounted total capital injection.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first introduce the optimal consumption problem with relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint. We then reformulate the original problem into an equivalent auxiliary regular control problem by introducing a reflected state process and derive its associated HJB-VI with Neumann boundary condition. In Section 3, we rewrite the HJB-VI in the piecewise form according to the optimal consumption behavior, and derive the closed-form solution to the dual PDE with Neumann boundary and free boundary conditions by using the smooth-fit principle and super-contact condition. Section 4 establishes the verification theorem and characterizes the optimal feedback investment and consumption strategies in the piecewise form. Some numerical examples and financial implications are presented in Section 5.

Consider a financial market model consisting of $d$ risky assets whose price dynamics follows the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) that\n\n$$\nd S_{t}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\\left(\\mu d t+\\sigma d W_{t}\\right), \\quad S_{0} \\in(0, \\infty)^{d}, \\quad t>0\n$$\n\nwhere $S=\\left(S_{t}^{1}, \\ldots, S_{t}^{d}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}^{\\top}$ is the price process vector of $d$ risky assets, and $W=\\left(W_{t}^{1}, \\ldots, W_{t}^{d}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}^{\\top}$ is a $d$-dimensional $\\mathbb{F}$-adapted Brownian motion. Moreover, $\\mu=\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\ldots, \\mu_{d}\\right)^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes the\n\nvector of return rate and $\\sigma=\\left(\\sigma_{i j}\\right)_{d \\times d}$ is the volatility matrix that is assumed to be invertible. It is also assumed that the riskless interest rate $r=0$, which amounts to the change of num\u00e9raire. From this point onwards, all processes including the wealth process and the benchmark process are defined after the change of num\u00e9raire.\n\nAt time $t \\geq 0$, let $\\theta_{t}^{i}$ be the amount of wealth that the fund manager allocates in asset $S^{i}=\\left(S_{t}^{i}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$, and let $c_{t}$ be the non-negative consumption rate. The self-financing wealth process under the portfolio $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{t}^{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{t}^{d}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}^{\\top}$ and the consumption strategy $c=\\left(c_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is given by\n\n$$\nd V_{t}^{\\theta, c}=\\theta_{t}^{\\gamma} \\mu d t+\\theta_{t}^{\\gamma} \\sigma d W_{t}-c_{t} d t, \\quad t>0\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{0}^{\\theta, c}=\\mathrm{v} \\geq 0$ denotes the initial wealth of the fund manager.\nIn the present paper, we consider the situation when the fund manager also concerns the relative performance with respect to an external benchmark process, which is described by another GBM that\n\n$$\nd Z_{t}=\\mu_{Z} Z_{t} d t+\\sigma_{Z} Z_{t} d W_{t}^{\\gamma}, \\quad Z_{0}=z \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere the return rate $\\mu_{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the volatility $\\sigma_{Z} \\geq 0$, and the Brownian motion $W_{t}^{\\gamma}:=\\gamma^{\\top} W_{t}$ for $t \\geq 0$ and $\\gamma=\\left(\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{d}\\right)^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ satisfying $|\\gamma|=1$, i.e., the Brownian motion $W^{\\gamma}=\\left(W_{t}^{\\gamma}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a linear combination of $W$ with weights $\\gamma$.\n\nGiven the benchmark process $Z=\\left(Z_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$, we consider the relaxed benchmark tracking formulation in Bo et al. $(2023,2024)$ in the sense that the fund manager can strategically chooses the dynamic portfolio and consumption as well as the fictitious capital injection such that the total capital outperforms the benchmark process at all times. That is, the fund manager optimally chooses the regular control $\\theta$ as the dynamic portfolio in risky assets, the regular control $c$ as the consumption rate and the singular control $A=\\left(A_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ as the cumulative capital injection such that $A_{t}+V_{t}^{\\theta, c} \\geq Z_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nWe further consider a drawdown constraint on the consumption rate in the sense that $c_{t}$ cannot fall below a fraction $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$ of its past maximum that\n\n$$\nc_{t} \\geq \\lambda M_{t}, \\quad \\forall t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nHere, the non-decreasing reference process $M=\\left(M_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is defined as the historical spending maximum that\n\n$$\nM_{t}:=\\max \\left\\{m, \\sup _{s \\in[0, t]} c_{s}\\right\\}, \\quad \\forall t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwith $m \\geq 0$ being the initial reference level. The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected utility on consumption deducted by the cost of capital injection in the sense that, for all $(\\mathrm{v}, z, m) \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$ with $\\mathbb{R}_{+}:=[0, \\infty)$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathrm{w}(\\mathrm{v}, z, m):=\\sup _{(\\theta, c, A) \\in \\mathbb{U}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}\\right] \\\\\n\\text { subject to } A_{t}+V_{t}^{\\theta, c} \\geq Z_{t} \\text { for all } t \\geq 0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nHere, the admissible control set $\\mathbb{U}$ is defined as $\\mathbb{U}:=\\left\\{(\\theta, c, A)=\\left(\\theta_{t}, c_{t}, A_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}:(\\theta, c)\\right.$ is $\\mathbb{F}$-adapted processes taking values on $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}$satisfying the control drawdown constraint $c_{t} \\geq \\lambda M_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0, A$ is a non-negative, non-decreasing and $\\mathbb{F}$-adapted process with r.c.l.l. paths and initial value $A_{0}=0 \\geq 0\\}$. The constant $\\rho>0$ is the subjective discount rate, and the parameter $\\beta>0$ describes the cost of capital injection. We consider the CRRA utility in the present paper that\n\n$$\nU(x)=\\frac{1}{p} x^{p}\n$$\n\nwith the risk averse parameter $1-p \\in(0,1) \\cup(1,+\\infty)$.\nTo tackle the problem (2.6) with the floor constraint, we first reformulate the problem based on the observation that, for a fixed control $(\\theta, c)$, the optimal $A$ is always the smallest adapted rightcontinuous and non-decreasing process that dominates $Z-V^{\\theta, c}$. It follows from Lemma 2.4 in Bo et al. (2021) that, for fixed regular control $\\theta$ and $c$, the optimal singular control $A^{(\\theta, c), *}=\\left(A_{t}^{(\\theta, c), *}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ satisfies that $A_{t}^{(\\theta, c), *}=0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(Z_{s}-V_{s}^{\\theta, c}\\right), \\forall t \\geq 0$. Thus, the control problem (2.6) admits the equivalent formulation with a running maximum cost that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{w}(\\mathrm{v}, z, m)= & -\\beta(z-\\mathrm{v})^{+} \\\\\n& +\\sup _{(\\theta, c) \\in \\mathbb{U}^{r}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d\\left(0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(Z_{s}-V_{s}^{\\theta, c}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{U}^{r}$ denotes the admissible control set of pairs $(\\theta, c)=\\left(\\theta_{t}, c_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ that will be specified later.\nRemark 2.1. Note that the floor state constraint $A_{t}+V_{t}^{\\theta, c} \\geq Z_{t}$ disappears in the formulation above, while we still need to cope with the control drawdown constraint $c_{t} \\geq \\lambda M_{t}$ for the problem (2.8), which leads to a free boundary condition for the associated HJB equation that differs fundamentally from Bo et al. (2023, 2024). In addition, we would like to stress that $A_{t}^{(\\theta, c), *}=\\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(V_{s}^{\\theta, c}-Z_{s}\\right)^{-}$under the control pair $(\\theta, c)$ in fact records the largest shortfall when the wealth process $V_{s}^{\\theta, c}$ falls below the benchmark process $Z_{s}$ up to time $t$. Consequently, when the strategic capital injection $A_{t}$ is not possible for the fund management, we can also directly consider the problem formulation (2.8) to allow the wealth process $V_{t}^{\\theta, c}$ to fall below $Z_{t}$ from time to time, but we need to control the size of the expectation $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d\\left(0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(Z_{s}-V_{s}^{\\theta, c}\\right)\\right)\\right]$ as a type of risk measure so that the expected largest shortfall of the fund management with respect to the benchmark in a long run can be minimized.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.2 Equivalent auxiliary control problem \n\nIn this subsection, we introduce a more tractable auxiliary stochastic control problem, which is mathematically equivalent to the problem (2.8). To this end, we will introduce a new controlled state process to replace the process $V^{\\theta, c}=\\left(V_{t}^{\\theta, c}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ in (2.2). First, let us consider the distance process $D_{t}:=Z_{t}-V_{t}^{\\theta, c}, \\forall t \\geq 0$ with $D_{0}=z-\\mathrm{v}$ and its running maximum process given by $L_{t}:=0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t} D_{s} \\geq 0$ for $t \\geq 0$, and $L_{0}=0$.

Thus, we have to mandate the free boundary condition $v_{m}(x, z, m)=0$ and a so-called \"super-contact condition\" $v_{m x}(x, z, m)=v_{m z}(x, z, m)=0$.\n\nRegion V: On the set $\\mathcal{R}_{5}=\\left\\{(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} ; v_{x}(x, z, m)<y^{*}(m)\\right\\}$, the optimal consumption strategy $c^{*}(x, z, m)>m$, which indicates that the initial level $m$ is below the feedback control $c^{*}(x, z, m)$ and the historical peak $M=\\left(M_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ has a jump immediately to attain $c^{*}(x, z, m)$. As a result, for any initial value $(x, z, m)$ in the set $\\mathcal{R}_{5}$, the feedback control $c^{*}(x, z, m)$ will push the current states jumping immediately to the point $\\left(x, z, m^{*}\\right)$ on the region $\\mathcal{R}_{4}$ with $m^{*}=c^{*}(x, z, m)$.\n\nIn sum, it is sufficient to only consider $(x, z, m)$ on the effective domain $\\mathcal{D}:=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{4} \\mathcal{R}_{i}$.

Let us consider the candidate solution to Eq. (3.4) satisfying the separated form that $\\hat{v}(y, z, m)=l(y, m)+z \\psi(y)$.

(3.8), we obtain $\\psi(y)=y+K_{1} y^{\\kappa}+K_{2} y^{\\hat{\\kappa}}$ with constants $K_{1}, K_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ that will be determined later. In addition, denote $\\kappa$ and $\\hat{\\kappa}$ as two roots of the quadratic equation $\\alpha \\kappa^{2}+(\\rho-\\eta-\\alpha) \\kappa+\\mu_{Z}-\\rho=0$. We look for such a solution $y \\mapsto \\psi(y)$ with $K_{2}=0$ such that the Neumann boundary condition $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\beta)=0$ holds, which yields that $K_{1}=-\\frac{\\beta^{-\\kappa+1}}{\\kappa}$. Thus, we arrive at $\\psi(y)=y-\\frac{\\beta^{-\\kappa+1}}{\\kappa} y^{\\kappa}$.\n\nNext, we solve Eq. (3.7).

We only discuss the case when $m \\geq \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\beta^{\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}$ as the proof of the case $\\beta^{\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}} \\leq m<\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\beta^{\\frac{1}{\\rho-1}}$ is similar. Taking the derivative w.r.t. the variable $m$ on both sides of Eq.

Assume instead that $\\lim _{m \\rightarrow \\infty} y^{*}(m)=$ $C>0$. Sending $m \\rightarrow \\infty$ on both sides of Eq. (3.5), we get that, the left hand side of Eq.

It follows from It\u00f4's formula that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}, Z_{T}, m\\right)+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} U\\left(c_{s}\\right) d s \\\\\n& \\quad=v(x, z, m)+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}, Z_{s}, m\\right) \\theta_{s}^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} \\sigma_{Z} Z_{s}\\left(v_{z}-v_{x}\\right)\\left(X_{s}, Z_{s}, m\\right) d W_{s}^{\\gamma} \\\\\n& \\quad+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}, Z_{s}, m\\right) d L_{s}^{X}+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(\\mathcal{L}^{\\theta_{s}, c_{s}} v-\\rho v\\right)\\left(X_{s}, Z_{s}, m\\right) d s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere, for $(\\theta, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the operator $\\mathcal{L}^{\\theta, c}$ acting on $C^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}\\right)$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\theta, c} g:=\\ & \\theta^{\\top} \\mu g_{x}+\\frac{1}{2} \\theta^{\\top} \\sigma \\sigma^{\\top} \\theta g_{x x}+\\theta^{\\top} \\sigma \\gamma \\sigma_{Z} z\\left(g_{x z}-g_{x x}\\right)+U(c)-c v_{g} \\\\\n& -\\sigma_{Z}^{2} z^{2} g_{x z}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{Z}^{2} z^{2}\\left(g_{x x}+g_{z z}\\right)+\\mu_{Z} z\\left(g_{z}-g_{x}\\right), \\quad \\forall g \\in C^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$ and $(\\theta, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times[\\lambda m, m]$, Lemma 4.2 implies that $\\left(\\mathcal{L}^{\\theta, c} v-\\right.$ $\\rho v)(x, z, m) \\leq 0$ and $v_{x}(0, z, m)=\\beta$. Consequently, taking the expectation on both sides of (4.35), we deduce\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}, Z_{T}, m\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X}\\right] \\leq v(x, z, m)\n$$\n\nUsing Lemma 4.2 again, we arrive at $v_{x}(x, z, m) \\geq 0$ and $\\left|v_{z}(x, z, m)\\right| \\leq \\beta / \\kappa$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$. Thus, one gets, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$,\n\n$$\nv(x, z, m) \\geq v(0, z, m) \\geq v(0,0, m)-\\frac{\\beta}{\\kappa} z\n$$\n\nBy letting $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (4.36), we obtain from (4.37), Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT), the Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) and $\\rho>\\mu_{Z}$ that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv(x, z, m) & \\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X}\\right]+\\liminf _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}, Z_{T}, m\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X}\\right]+\\liminf _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T}\\left\\{v(0,0, m)-\\frac{\\beta}{\\kappa} \\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_{T}\\right]\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we prove that the equality in (4.34) holds true when $(\\theta, c)=\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right)$. It follows from Lemma A. 1 that $\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{U}^{r}$. We next show that the following transversality condition holds:\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}^{*}, Z_{T}, M_{T}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\leq 0\n$$\n\nTo this end, we introduce an auxiliary dual process $\\left(Y_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ with $Y_{t}=v_{x}\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)$ for all $t \\geq 0$ to facilitate the proof of the above convergence. By Lemma A. 2 in Appendix A, we know that $Y_{t}$ taking values on $(0, \\beta]$ satisfies the SDE with reflection that\n\n$$\nd Y_{t}=\\rho Y_{t} d t-\\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} Y_{t} d W_{t}-d L_{t}^{Y}\n$$\n\nHere, the process $L=\\left(L_{t}^{Y}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a continuous and non-decreasing process (with $L_{t}^{Y}=0$ ) that increases on the time set $\\left\\{t \\geq 0 ; Y_{t}=\\beta\\right\\}$ only. Moreover, it follows from the dual relationship that\n\n$$\nv\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)=\\hat{v}\\left(Y_{t}, Z_{z}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)+X_{t}^{*} Y_{t}=\\hat{v}\\left(Y_{t}, Z_{z}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)-Y_{t} \\hat{v}_{y}\\left(Y_{t}, Z_{z}, M_{t}^{*}\\right), \\quad \\forall t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nNote that $\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\hat{v}-y \\hat{v}_{y}\\right)}{\\partial y}(y, z, m)=-\\hat{v}_{y y}(y, z, m)<0$ for all $(y, z, m) \\in\\left[y^{*}(m), \\beta\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times\\left[\\beta^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}, \\infty\\right)$. It follows that the function $\\hat{v}-y \\hat{v}_{y}$ is strictly decreasing with respect to $y$. Thus, it suffices to consider the case $y=y^{*}(m) \\leq m^{p-1}$. Then, by Proposition 3.1 and (4.16), we have that\n\n$$\n\\hat{v}(y, z, m)-y \\hat{v}_{y}(y, z, m) \\leq K C_{6}(m) y^{-\\frac{\\rho}{\\alpha}} \\leq K m y \\leq y^{\\frac{1}{p-1}} y=K y^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is a positive constant that might be different from line to line. For the discount rate $\\rho>\\rho_{0}$, we have from (4.41), (4.42) and Lemma A. 3 in Appendix A, that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}^{*}, Z_{T}, M_{T}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\leq K \\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\overbrace{Y_{T}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nwhich gives the desired transversality condition (4.39).\nNow, for any $T>0$, using It\u00f4's rule, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}^{*}, Z_{T}, M_{T}^{*}\\right)+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} U\\left(c_{s}^{*}\\right) d s \\\\\n& \\quad=v(x, z, m)+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)\\left(\\theta_{s}^{*}\\right)^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} \\sigma_{Z} Z_{s}\\left(v_{z}-v_{x}\\right)\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d W_{s}^{\\gamma} \\\\\n& \\quad+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d L_{s}^{X}+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\sigma_{s}^{*}, c_{s}^{*}}^{\\theta_{s}^{*}, c_{s}^{*}} v-\\rho v\\right)\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d s \\\\\n& \\quad+\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{m}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d M_{s}^{*, c}+\\sum_{0<s \\leq T} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(v\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)-v\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s-}^{*}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $M^{*, c}$ is the continuous part of $M^{*}$. Note that, the process $M^{*}$ can only jump at time $t=0$ if $m<m^{*}(x, z)$, then $\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)$ stays in the domain $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} ; x \\leq F_{3}(z, m)\\right\\}$ for all\n\n$s>0$. Then, it follows from $M_{s}^{*, c}$ increases if and only if $M_{s}^{*, c}=m^{*}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}\\right), v_{m}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right)=$ 0 and (4.6) holds, we then deduce\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho s} v_{m}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d M_{s}^{*, c}+\\sum_{0<s \\leq T} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(v\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)-v\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s-}^{*}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\quad=v\\left(X_{0}^{*}, Z_{0}, M_{0}^{*}\\right)-v\\left(X_{0}^{*}, Z_{0}, M_{0}^{*}\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, by taking the expectation on both sides of Eq. (4.44), it follows from $\\left(\\mathcal{L}^{\\theta^{*}, c^{*}} v-\\rho v\\right)(x, z, m)=$ 0 and $v_{x}(0, z, m)=\\beta$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathcal{D}$ that\n\n$$\nv(x, z, m)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T} v\\left(X_{T}^{*}, Z_{T}^{*}, M_{T}^{*}\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}^{*}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X^{*}}\\right]\n$$\n\nLetting $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (4.45). We get from the inequality (4.39), DCT and MCT that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv(x, z, m) & \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}^{*}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X^{*}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\sup _{(\\theta, c) \\in \\mathbb{U}^{r}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}\\right) d t-\\beta \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d L_{t}^{X}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining (4.38) with (4.46), we conclude that the inequality in (4.46) holds as an equality.\nRemark 4.5. Recall that Proposition 3.1 provides an explicit classical solution to the dual PDE (3.4) but not verify if the inequality constraint $\\hat{v}_{m}(y, z, m) \\leq 0$ is satisfied. It requires quite tedious calculations due to the implicit expression of $y^{*}(m)$ and the coefficient functions $C_{i}(m)$ for $i=1, \\ldots, 6$. In turn, Lemma 4.2 does not show that the value function defined by (4.5)(4.6) satisfies the HJB-VI (2.12) as it remains to prove $v_{m}(x, z, m) \\leq 0$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$. However, it becomes an obvious result after Theorem 4.4 in view of definition of admissible set $\\mathbb{U}^{r}$ and the value function given by (2.10).\n\nThe following lemma shows that the expectation of the total optimal discounted capital injection is always finite and positive.\n\nLemma 4.6. Let the assumptions of Theorem 4.4 hold. Consider the optimal strategy of investment and consumption $\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right)=\\left(\\theta_{t}^{*}, c_{t}^{*}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ given in Theorem 4.4. Then, it holds that\n(i) The expectation of the discounted total capital injection under the optimal strategy $\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right)$ is finite that, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}^{*}\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{|p|} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} Y_{t}^{\\frac{p}{\\rho-1}} d t\\right]-v(x, z, m)<+\\infty\n$$\n\n(ii) The expectation of the discounted total capital injection under the optimal strategy $\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right)$ is strictly positive that, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times(0, \\infty)^{2}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}^{*}\\right] \\geq \\max \\left\\{z \\frac{1-\\kappa}{\\kappa}\\left(1+\\frac{x}{z}\\right)^{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa-1}}, \\frac{\\lambda m}{\\alpha+\\rho} e^{-\\frac{\\alpha+\\rho}{\\lambda m} x}\\right\\}>0\n$$\n\nHere, the optimal capital injection under the optimal strategy $\\left(\\theta^{*}, c^{*}\\right)$ is given by $A_{t}^{*}=0 \\vee$ $\\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(Z_{s}-V_{s}^{\\theta^{*}, c^{*}}\\right)$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\nProof. We first prove the item (i). For $(\\mathrm{v}, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$, by applying (2.6), we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}^{*}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}^{*}\\right) d t\\right]-v(x, z, m)\n$$\n\nwith $x=(\\mathrm{v}-z)^{+}$by Lemma 2.2. By uisng the dual relationship, we have that\n\n$$\nU\\left(c^{*}(x, z, m)\\right)=\\frac{\\left(c^{*}(x, z, m)\\right)^{p}}{p}=\\frac{1}{p} \\times \\begin{cases}\\lambda^{p} m^{p}, & (\\lambda m)^{p-1}<y \\leq \\beta \\\\ y^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}, & m^{p-1}<y \\leq(\\lambda m)^{p-1} \\\\ m^{p}, & y^{*}(m) \\leq y \\leq m^{p-1} \\\\ \\left(m^{*}(y)\\right)^{p}, & y<y^{*}(m)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $y=y(x, z, m)=v_{x}(x, z, m)$ and $y \\rightarrow m^{*}(y)$ is the inverse function of $m \\rightarrow y^{*}(m)$. From (4.50), we can deduce that $U\\left(c^{*}(x, z, m)\\right) \\leq y^{\\frac{p}{p-1}} /|p|$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$. Then, it follows from Lemma A. 2 and the proof of Lemma A. 3 in Appendix A that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} U\\left(c_{t}^{*}\\right) d t\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{|p|} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} Y_{t}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}} d t\\right]<+\\infty\n$$\n\nThen, the desired result (4.47) follows from (4.51).\nNext, we prove the item (ii). For any admissible portfolio $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$, we introduce, for all $t \\geq 0$\n\n$$\n\\tilde{V}_{t}^{\\theta}=\\mathrm{v}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_{s}^{\\top} \\mu d s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_{s}^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}, \\quad \\tilde{A}_{t}^{\\theta}=0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(Z_{s}-\\tilde{V}_{s}^{\\theta}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that $c_{t}^{*}>0$ for all $t \\geq 0$. It follows from (2.2) and (4.52) that $\\tilde{V}_{t}^{\\theta^{*}} \\geq V_{t}^{\\theta^{*}, c^{*}}$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, and hence\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}^{*}\\right]>\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d \\tilde{A}_{t}^{\\theta^{*}}\\right] \\geq \\inf _{\\theta} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d \\tilde{A}_{t}^{\\theta}\\right]=: \\tilde{\\mathrm{w}}(\\mathrm{v}, z)\n$$\n\nIt is not difficult to check that, for all $(\\mathrm{v}, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times(0, \\infty)$,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathrm{w}}(\\mathrm{v}, z)=z \\frac{1-\\kappa}{\\kappa}\\left(1+\\frac{(\\mathrm{v}-z)^{+}}{z}\\right)^{\\frac{\\kappa}{\\kappa-1}}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, for any admissible portfolio $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$, let us consider an auxiliary process\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}_{t}^{\\theta}=\\mathrm{v}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_{s}^{\\top} \\mu d s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_{s}^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}-\\lambda m t, \\quad \\hat{A}_{t}^{\\theta}=0 \\vee \\sup _{s \\leq t}\\left(-\\hat{V}_{s}^{\\theta}\\right), \\quad t \\geq 0\n$$\n\nNote that $c_{t}^{*} \\geq \\lambda m$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Then, it follows from (2.2) and (4.55) that $\\hat{V}_{t}^{\\theta^{*}} \\geq V_{t}^{\\theta^{*}, c^{*}}$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, and hence\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d A_{t}^{*}\\right]>\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d \\hat{A}_{t}^{\\theta^{*}}\\right] \\geq \\inf _{\\theta} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho t} d \\hat{A}_{t}^{\\theta}\\right]=: \\hat{\\mathrm{w}}(\\mathrm{v}, m)\n$$\n\nIn a similar fashion, we can verify that, for all $(\\mathrm{v}, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times(0, \\infty)$,\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathrm{w}}(\\mathrm{v}, m)=\\frac{\\lambda m}{\\alpha+\\rho} e^{-\\frac{\\alpha+\\rho}{\\lambda m} \\mathrm{v}^{+}}\n$$\n\nConsequently, combining (4.53), (4.54), (4.56) and (4.57), we complete the proof of the lemma.\nThe following result shows that when the drawdown constraint vanishes as parameter $\\lambda=0$, the stochastic control problem (2.10) simplifies to the optimal tracking problem with no consumption constraint in Bo et al. (2023).\n\nCorollary 4.7. Let assumptions of Theorem 4.4 hold. Then, for fixed $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$, the value function $v(x, z, m)$ given by (2.10). is non-increasing w.r.t. the fraction parameter $\\lambda$. In particular, when $\\lambda=0$, the value function admits the form given by, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv(x, z, m)= & \\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p} \\beta^{\\frac{1}{p-1}} f(x, z)+\\frac{(1-p)^{3}}{p(\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p)} f(x, z)^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}+x f(x, z) \\\\\n& +z\\left(f(x, z)-\\frac{\\beta^{-\\kappa+1}}{\\kappa} f(x, z)^{\\kappa}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $f(x, z)$ is uniquely determined by\n\n$$\nx=\\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p}\\left(f(x, z)^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}-\\beta^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}\\right)+z\\left(\\beta^{-\\kappa+1} f(x, z)^{\\kappa-1}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nFurthermore, the optimal feedback control function is given by, for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta^{*}(x, z, m)= & \\left(\\sigma \\sigma^{\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\mu\\left(\\frac{1-p}{\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p} f(x, z)^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}+(1-\\kappa) \\beta^{-(\\kappa-1)} z f(x, z)^{\\kappa-1}\\right) \\\\\n& +\\left(\\sigma \\sigma^{\\top}\\right)^{-1} \\sigma_{Z} \\sigma \\gamma z \\beta^{-(\\kappa-1)} f(x, z)^{\\kappa-1} \\\\\nc^{*}(x, z, m)= & f(x, z)^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}\n\\end{aligned}\\right.\n$$\n\nProof. Denote by $v_{\\lambda}(x, z, m)$ the value function and $\\mathbb{U}_{\\lambda}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ the admissible set to highlight the dependence on $\\lambda$. Then, for $0 \\leq \\lambda_{1} \\leq \\lambda_{2} \\leq 1$, it follows from the definition of the admissible set that $\\mathbb{U}_{\\lambda_{2}}^{\\mathrm{r}} \\subset \\mathbb{U}_{\\lambda_{1}}^{\\mathrm{r}}$, which yields $v_{\\lambda_{2}}(x, z, m) \\leq v_{\\lambda_{1}}(x, z, m)$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$.\n\nWhen $\\lambda=0$, by Proposition 3.1, we have $y^{*}(m)=m^{1-p}$ for $m \\geq \\beta^{1 /(p-1)}$, and for $(r, z, m) \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times\\left[\\beta^{1 /(p-1)}, \\infty\\right)$, the dual function $\\hat{v}(y, z, m)$ becomes\n\n$$\n\\hat{v}(y, z, m)=\\frac{1}{\\beta} C_{3}(m) y+\\beta^{\\frac{p}{\\alpha}} C_{4}(m) y^{-\\frac{p}{\\alpha}}+\\frac{(1-p)^{3}}{p(\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p)} y^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}+z\\left(y-\\frac{\\beta^{-\\kappa+1}}{\\kappa} y^{\\kappa}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, in view of $y^{*}(m)=m^{1-p}$, it holds that\n\n$$\nC_{6}(m)=\\frac{\\alpha^{3} \\beta^{-\\frac{p}{\\alpha}}}{\\rho(\\alpha+\\rho)^{2}(\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p)} m^{\\frac{\\alpha p-(1-p) \\rho}{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nAs a result, we can deduce that\n\n$$\nC_{3}(m)=\\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p} \\beta^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}, \\quad C_{4}(m)=0, \\quad \\forall m \\geq \\beta^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}\n$$\n\nIt follows from (4.61) and (4.62) that\n\n$$\n\\hat{v}(y, z, m)=\\frac{(1-p)^{2}}{\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p} \\beta^{\\frac{1}{p-1}} y+\\frac{(1-p)^{3}}{p(\\rho(1-p)-\\alpha p)} y^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}+z\\left(y-\\frac{\\beta^{-\\kappa+1}}{\\kappa} y^{\\kappa}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is independent of the variable $m$. Then, by Proposition 3.1, Lemma 4.2, Lemma 4.3 and Theorem 4.4, we get the desired results (4.58)-(4.60).", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-0.jpeg":

{"section_id": 7, "text": "# 5 Numerical Examples \n\nIn this section, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the sensitivity analysis with respect to some model parameters and discuss their financial implications based on the optimal feedback functions and the expected total capital injection obtained in (4.9). To ease the discussions, we only consider the case $d=1$ in all examples.\n\nWe first examine the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio, the optimal consumption and the expected capital injection in Figure 2 with respect to the drawdown constraint parameter $\\lambda$. Let us fix the model parameters $\\rho=2, p=-0.1, \\mu=0.01, \\sigma=0.02, \\beta=2, \\mu_{Z}=\\sigma_{Z}=0.05, z=$ $10, m=20$ and plot the curves with $\\lambda=0,0.05,0.1,0.5,1$, respectively. Being consistent with intuition, when the drawdown constraint parameter $\\lambda$ tends to zero, the optimal portfolio, the optimal consumption and the expected capital injection converge to their counterparts of the optimal tracking problem with no consumption constraint (i.e., $\\lambda=0$ ) in Bo et al. (2023). More importantly, when the wealth level $x$ is sufficiently high, the optimal consumption in the case of $\\lambda>0$ is in fact lower than the unconstrained one with $\\lambda=0$, indicating that the drawdown constraint may suppress the consumption behavior in the large wealth regime as the aggressive consumption leads to a larger drawdown reference process. We also observe that the optimal portfolio with $\\lambda>0$ is higher than the unconstrained case with $\\lambda=0$ so that the drawdown constraint leads to a larger investment amount in the financial market to ensure the drawdown constraint to be sustainable. Figure 2 also shows that a higher capital injection is needed to support a larger consumption drawdown constraint.\n\nWe next analyze the sensitivity results with respect to the capital injection cost parameter $\\beta$ in Figure 3. Let us fix model parameters $\\rho=2, p=-0.1, \\mu=0.01, \\sigma=0.02, \\lambda=0.2, \\mu_{Z}=\\sigma_{Z}=$ $0.5, z=20, m=6$ and plot the optimal portfolio, the optimal consumption and the expected capital injection with varying $\\beta=2,4,30,40,50$. It is not surprising to see in panel (c) of Figure 3 that the larger capital cost parameter $\\beta$, the less the capital injection. As the cost parameter $\\beta$ increases, the fund manager tends to choose a smaller consumption to reduce the required capital\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Sensitivity results w.r.t. $\\lambda$\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Sensitivity results w.r.t. $\\beta$.\ninjection. Meanwhile, the fund manager will strategically reduce the investment in the risk assets to avoid the unnecessary capital injection caused by the volatility of the controlled wealth process.\n\nTo understand how the market performance affects the optimal decision in our formulation, we also plot the sensitivity results w.r.t. the excessive returns $\\mu=0.004,0.008,0.012,0.016$ in Figure 4 while fixing other model parameters $\\rho=2, p=-0.1, \\sigma=0.02, \\lambda=0.2, \\beta=2, \\mu_{Z}=\\sigma_{Z}=$ $0.5, z=20, m=6$. From the panel (a) of Figure 4, it can be observed that the better the market performs, the more wealth the fund manager is willing to allocate into the market. It is also interesting to see from panel (b) that a higher excessive return $\\mu$ results in a larger consumption plan, which is opposite of the result in the classical Merton's problem. This new phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the flexibility in capital injection may increase risk taking attitude of the agent. Particularly, when the market return is good, the necessary amount of capital injection to fulfil the benchmark tracking constraint is significantly reduced. The injected capital might be mainly used to support the more aggressive consumption behavior. Comparing with Merton's formulation under the possible bankruptcy restriction, the capital injection will incentivize the agent to spend more gains from the financial market on consumption when the market performance is good because the agent can strategically inject capital to lift up the wealth whenever it falls down a threshold.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Sensitivity results w.r.t. $\\mu$.\n\nAcknowledgements L.

Let $\\mu_{Z} \\geq \\eta$ and $\\rho>\\rho_{0}$. Given the feedback control functions $\\theta^{*}(x, z, m)$ and $c^{*}(x, z, m)$ in Theorem 4.4, the system of reflected SDEs (4.33) has a unique strong solution.\n\nProof. It follows from Lemma 4.2 that $\\partial \\theta^{*} / \\partial h$ and $\\partial c^{*} / \\partial h$ are both continuous function in $h \\in$ $\\{x, z, m\\}$. For $R>0$, define\n\n$$\nK_{R}:=\\max _{(x, z, m) \\in[0, R]^{3}}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial x} \\vee \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial z} \\vee \\frac{\\partial \\theta^{*}}{\\partial m} \\vee \\frac{\\partial c^{*}}{\\partial x} \\vee \\frac{\\partial c^{*}}{\\partial z} \\vee \\frac{\\partial c^{*}}{\\partial m}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen, for all $\\left(x_{1}, z_{1}, m_{1}, x_{2}, z_{2}, m_{2}\\right) \\in[0, R]^{6}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|\\theta^{*}\\left(x_{1}, z_{1}, m_{1}\\right)-\\theta^{*}\\left(x_{2}, z_{2}, m_{2}\\right)\\right|+\\left|c^{*}\\left(x_{1}, z_{1}, m_{1}\\right)-c^{*}\\left(x_{2}, z_{2}, m_{2}\\right)\\right| \\\\\n\\leq K_{R}\\left(\\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\\right|+\\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\\right|+\\left|m_{1}-m_{2}\\right|\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nConsequently, we have from (4.33) that $\\theta^{*}\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)=\\theta^{*}\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, \\max \\left\\{m, \\max _{s \\in[0, t]} m^{*}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}\\right)\\right\\}\\right)$ for $t \\geq 0$. Fix $m \\geq 0$ and $t>0$, for any $x, z \\in C([0, t])$, let us define\n\n$$\nF(t, x, z):=\\theta^{*}\\left(x_{t}, z_{t}, \\max \\left\\{m, \\max _{s \\in[0, t]} m^{*}\\left(x_{s}, z_{s}\\right)\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then show $F\\left(t,\\left(x_{s}\\right)_{s \\in[0, t]},\\left(z_{s}\\right)_{s \\in[0, t]}\\right)$ is locally Lipschitz-continuous. To this end, fix $t>0$ and $R_{1}>0$. Let $x, \\hat{x}, z, \\hat{z} \\in C([0, t])$ satisfy $\\sup _{s \\in[0, t]}\\left|h_{t}\\right| \\leq R_{1}$ with $h \\in\\{x, \\hat{x}, z, \\hat{z}\\}$. Note that $(x, z) \\mapsto m^{*}(x, z)$ given in Lemma 4.1 is in $C^{2}$ in view of the definition of $m^{*}(x, z)$ and the smoothness of $(z, m) \\mapsto F_{3}(z, m)$. Then, we have $R_{2}:=\\max _{(x, z) \\in\\left[0, R_{1}\\right]^{2}} m^{*}(x, z)<\\infty$ and $\\tilde{K}_{R_{1}}:=\\max _{(x, z) \\in\\left[0, R_{1}\\right]^{2}}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial m^{*}(x, z)}{\\partial x} \\vee \\frac{\\partial m^{*}(x, z)}{\\partial z}\\right\\}<\\infty$. Introduce $R=\\max \\left\\{R_{1}, R_{2}\\right\\}$ and $C_{R}=\\max \\left\\{K_{R}, \\tilde{K}_{R_{1}}\\right\\}$. Then, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& |F(t, x, z)-F(t, \\hat{x}, \\hat{z})| \\\\\n& \\quad \\leq C_{R}\\left\\{\\left|x_{t}-\\hat{x}_{t}\\right|+\\left|z_{t}-\\hat{z}_{t}\\right|+\\left|\\max \\left\\{m, \\sup _{s \\in[0, t]} m^{*}\\left(x_{s}, z_{s}\\right)\\right\\}-\\max \\left\\{m, \\sup _{s \\in[0, t]} m^{*}\\left(\\hat{x}_{s}, \\hat{z}_{s}\\right)\\right\\}\\right|\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\quad \\leq 2 C_{R}\\left\\{\\sup _{s \\in[0, t]}\\left|x_{s}-\\hat{x}_{s}\\right|+\\sup _{s \\in[0, t]}\\left|z_{s}-\\hat{z}_{s}\\right|\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFix $t>0$, and for any $x, z \\in C([0, t])$, define $G(t, x, z):=c^{*}\\left(x_{t}, z_{t}, \\max \\left\\{m, \\sup _{s \\in[0, t]} m^{*}\\left(x_{s}, z_{s}\\right)\\right\\}\\right)$. Then, in a similar fashion, we can obtain the local Lipschitz continuity of $C([0, t])^{2} \\ni(x, z) \\mapsto$ $G(t, x, z)$ uniformly in $t$. Then, we define the stopping time by $\\tau_{n}:=\\inf \\left\\{t \\geq 0 ;\\left|X_{t}^{*}\\right| \\geq n\\right.$ or $\\left|Z_{t}\\right| \\geq$ $n\\}$ with $n>0$. By Theorem 7 in Section 3 of Chapter 5 in Protter (2005), the system of SDEs (4.33) has a unique strong solution on $\\left[0, \\tau_{n}\\right]$. Moreover, by Lemma 4.3 and estimate on moments of SDE, we have that, for any $t>0$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\tau_{n}<t\\right) \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\left|X_{\\tau_{n} \\wedge t}^{*}\\right|+\\left|Z_{\\tau_{n} \\wedge t}\\right|\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{\\tau_{n}<t}\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|X_{\\tau_{n} \\wedge t}^{*}\\right|+\\left|Z_{\\tau_{n} \\wedge t}\\right|\\right] \\leq \\frac{C}{n}(1+x+z)\n$$\n\nwhere $C>0$ is a constant independent of $n$. This implies that $\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\tau_{n}<t\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Thus, we can deduce that the system (4.33) has a unique strong solution.\n\nLemma A.2. Let $\\mu_{Z} \\geq \\eta$ and $\\rho>\\rho_{0}$. Consider the function $v(x, z, m)$ defined by (4.5)-(4.6) for $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$. It then holds that $v(x, z, m) \\in C^{3}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}\\right)$. Define the process $\\left(Y_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ by $Y_{t}=$ $v_{x}\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Then, $Y_{t} \\in(0, \\beta]$ is a reflected process that satisfies the following SDE with reflection:\n\n$$\nd Y_{t}=\\rho Y_{t} d t-\\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} Y_{t} d W_{t}-d L_{t}^{Y}\n$$\n\nwhere the process $L=\\left(L_{t}^{Y}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a continuous and non-decreasing process (with $L_{t}^{Y}=0$ ) which increases on the time set $\\left\\{t \\geq 0 ; Y_{t}=\\beta\\right\\}$ only.\n\nProof. In view of Proposition 3.1 and (4.5)-(4.6), the function $v(x, z, m)$ is $C^{3}$ in the interior of $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$ and $C^{2}$ in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$. Moreover, for $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$, we have from (4.6) and $v_{m}(x, z, m)=$ $v_{m}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right)=0$ that\n\n$$\nv_{x x x}(x, z, m)=v_{x x x}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right)+v_{x x m}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right) m_{x}^{*}(x, z)=v_{x x x}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich implies that $v_{x x x}$ is continuous in boundary of $\\mathcal{D}$. By applying similar calculation to the other third order partial derivatives of function $v$, we know $v(x, z, m) \\in C^{3}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}\\right)$. For any $t>0$, using It\u00f4's rule to $Y_{t}=v_{x}\\left(X_{t}^{*}, Z_{t}, M_{t}^{*}\\right)$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{t}= & Y_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} v_{x x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)\\left(\\theta_{s}^{*}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)\\right)^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma_{Z} Z_{s}\\left(v_{x z}-v_{x x}\\right)\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d W_{s}^{\\gamma} \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} v_{x x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d L_{s}^{X}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathcal{L}^{\\theta_{s}^{*}, c_{s}^{*}} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d s+\\int_{0}^{t} v_{x m}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d M_{s}^{*, c} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{0<s \\leq t} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)-v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s-}^{*}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $M^{*}, c$ is the continuous part of $M^{*}$. Note that, the process $M^{*}$ can only jump at time $t=0$ if $m<m^{*}(x, z)$, then $\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)$ stays in the domain $\\mathcal{D}$ for all $s>0$. In view that $M_{s}^{*, c}$ increases if and only if $M_{s}^{*, c}=m^{*}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}\\right), v_{m}\\left(x, z, m^{*}(x, z)\\right)=0$ and (4.6) holds, we deduce\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-\\rho s} v_{x m}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d M_{s}^{*, c}+\\sum_{0<s \\leq t} e^{-\\rho s}\\left(v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)-v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s-}^{*}\\right)\\right)=0\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 4.2, Lemma 4.3 and $W_{t}^{\\gamma}=\\gamma^{\\top} W_{t}$, we can obtain that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(v_{x x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)\\left(\\theta_{s}^{*}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right)\\right)^{\\top} \\sigma d W_{s}+\\sigma_{Z} Z_{s}\\left(v_{x z}-v_{x x}\\right)\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d W_{s}^{\\gamma}\\right) \\\\\n& \\quad=-\\int_{0}^{t} \\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d W_{s}=-\\int_{0}^{t} \\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} Y_{s} d W_{s} \\\\\n& \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathcal{L}^{\\theta_{s}^{*}, c_{s}^{*}} v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d s=\\int_{0}^{t} \\rho v_{x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d s=\\int_{0}^{t} \\rho Y_{s} d s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDenote $L_{t}^{Y}:=-\\int_{0}^{t} v_{x x}\\left(X_{s}^{*}, Z_{s}, M_{s}^{*}\\right) d L_{s}^{X}$ for $t \\geq 0$. Consequently, it follows from (A.1)-(A.4) that\n\n$$\nd Y_{t}=\\rho Y_{t} d t-\\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} Y_{t} d W_{t}-d L_{t}^{Y}, \\quad t>0\n$$\n\nNoting that $v_{x}(x, z, m) \\leq \\beta, v_{x}(0, z, m)=\\beta$ and $v_{x x}(x, z, m) \\leq 0$ for all $(x, z, m) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{3}$, we have that the process $L=\\left(L_{t}^{Y}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a continuous and non-decreasing process (with $L_{t}^{Y}=0$ ) which increases on the time set $\\left\\{t \\geq 0 ; Y_{t}=\\beta\\right\\}$ only. This implies that $Y$ taking values on $(0, \\beta]$ is a reflected process and $L^{Y}$ is the local time process of $Y$.\n\nLemma A.3. Let $\\mu_{Z} \\geq \\eta$ and $\\rho>\\rho_{0}$. Consider the reflected process $Y=\\left(Y_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ defined in Lemma A.2. Then, we have\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T} \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{T}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nProof. For the case $p<0$, the result obviously holds as $Y_{T}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}} \\leq \\beta^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}$ a.s., for all $T \\geq 0$. In what follows, we only consider the case $p \\in(0,1)$.\n\nFor $t \\geq 0$, let $H_{t}=\\beta Y_{t}^{-1}$, then by using It\u00f4's rule to $H_{t}$, we can deduce that $H_{t}$ taking values on $[1, \\infty)$ is a reflected process satisfies the following SDE with reflection:\n\n$$\nd H_{t}=(\\alpha-\\rho) H_{t} d t+\\mu^{\\top} \\sigma^{-1} H_{t} d W_{t}+d L_{t}^{H}\n$$\n\nwhere the process $L=\\left(L_{t}^{H}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is the local time process which is continuous and non-decreasing with $L_{t}^{H}=0$ and increases on the time set $\\left\\{t \\geq 0 ; H_{t}=1\\right\\}$ only. Then we can see\n\n$$\n0 \\leq \\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T} \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_{T}^{\\frac{p}{p-1}}\\right]=\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T} \\beta^{\\frac{p}{p-1}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[H_{T}^{\\frac{p}{1-p}}\\right] \\leq \\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-\\rho T} \\beta^{\\frac{p}{p-1}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[H_{T}^{\\frac{p^{\\prime}}{1-p^{\\prime}}}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $p^{\\prime}:=\\max \\{2 / 3, p\\}$.
