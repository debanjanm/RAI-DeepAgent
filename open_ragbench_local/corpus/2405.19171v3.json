They have also been investigated in the pointfree setting; see the recent monograph [PP21]. Among these, subfitness is a particularly important lower separation axiom. It is closely related to $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$-separation (a topological space is $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$ iff it is $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and the lattice of open sets is subfit; see, e.g., [PP21, p. 24]). Subfitness originated in the work of Wallman [Wal38] in its dual form under the name of disjunctivity (using the lattice of closed sets of a topological space). It was further studied by B\u00fcchi [B\u00fc48] and Pierce [Pie54]. In the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 54D10; 18F70; 06D22; 06B23; 06B15; 06D50; 06E15.\n    Key words and phrases. Separation axioms; distributive lattice; frame; subfit; regular; Boolean; DedekindMacNeille completion; Priestley duality.\n\nmodern form (using the lattice of open sets) it was explored by Simmons [Sim78] under the name of conjunctivity. In set theory, disjunctivity is known as separativity and plays an important r\u00f4le in forcing; see [Kun11, pp.199-200].\n\nTo distinguish these two notions, we refer to them as $\\vee$-subfitness and $\\wedge$-subfitness, but suppress $\\vee$ from the former when no confusion arises. Subfitness is usually defined for frames, that is, complete lattices in which finite meets distribute over arbitrary joins, as these provide a natural generalization of lattices of open sets [PP12]. However, they also make perfect sense for arbitrary bounded lattices. We thus define a bounded lattice A to be $\\vee$-subfit if\n\n$$\n\\forall a, b\\{a \\not \\leq b \\Longrightarrow \\exists c: a \\vee c=1 \\neq b \\vee c\\}\n$$\n\nand $\\wedge$-subfit if\n\n$$\n\\forall a, b\\{a \\not \\leq b \\Longrightarrow \\exists c: a \\wedge c \\neq 0=b \\wedge c)\n$$\n\nOur starting point is the following noteworthy observation of Janowitz [Jan68]:\n\n- A bounded lattice A is $\\vee$-subfit (resp. $\\wedge$-subfit) iff its Dedekind-MacNeille completion $\\mathcal{D}$ MA is $\\vee$-subfit (resp. $\\wedge$-subfit).\n- $\\mathcal{D}$ MA is Boolean iff A is distributive, $\\vee$-subfit, and $\\wedge$-subfit.\n\nWhile $\\mathcal{D M A}$ has many desirable properties, it is not always distributive (see, e.g., [BD74, Sec. XII.2]). This can be remedied by considering the injective hull (of a $\\wedge$-semilattice) constructed by Bruns and Lakser [BL70] (see also Horn and Kimura [HK71]), which is always a frame. We call it the Bruns-Lakser completion and denote by $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$. It is natural to consider the same questions for $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ as Janowitz considered for $\\mathcal{D M A}$. This is one of our main aims in this work. Additionally, we consider two other well-studied completions, the ideal completion $\\mathcal{I}$ A and the canonical completion $A^{\\sigma}$, and consider the same questions for them. The ideal completion gives the free frame over a distributive lattice, making it an important construction in frame theory [Joh82], whereas the canonical completion ${ }^{1}$ plays an important r\u00f4le in Kripke completeness of modal logics [BdRV01].\n\nAnother well-known separation axiom is regularity. For frames it is situated between subfit and Boolean. We recall that a frame is regular if\n\n$$\n\\forall a, b\\{a \\not \\leq b \\Longrightarrow \\exists c: c \\prec a \\& c \\not \\leq b\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\prec$ is the rather below relation (see Section 5 for details). Again, this condition makes perfect sense for arbitrary bounded lattices, however distributivity is required to prove that regularity implies subfitness. Because of this, in this paper we concentrate on distributive lattices. The general case will be studied in a forthcoming paper. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to investigate when the four completions $\\mathcal{D M A}, \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A, \\mathcal{I} A$, and $A^{\\sigma}$ of a bounded distributive lattice $A$ are subfit, regular, or Boolean. We will also study when these properties are preserved/reflected by these four completions. For this, as expected, counterexamples play an important r\u00f4le. These are often more efficiently described (not to mention discovered) by looking at the Priestley dual. Thus, Priestley duality for distributive lattices, which represents each distributive lattice as the lattice of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ It is more commonly known as the canonical extension, but in this context it is convenient to use a uniform term to describe all four constructions.\n\nclopen upsets of a Priestley space (see Section 2 for details), is one of main tools of this work.\n\nAs we will see in Section 2, we have the poset embeddings\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{J} A \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{~A}^{\\sigma} .\n$$\n\nThus, $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is the \"closest\" completion to $A$. As we pointed out above, Janowitz showed that $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is subfit iff $A$ is subfit. In addition, we describe when subfitness is preserved and/or reflected by a lattice extension, yielding Janowitz's result as a corollary. On the other hand, since $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ may not be distributive, the issue of regularity for $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is more complicated (see the previous paragraph). We thus assume that $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is distributive. In this case, we show that $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is regular iff $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular and $A$ is subfit.\n\nFor a distributive lattice A, Janowitz proved that $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M} A$ is Boolean iff $A$ is both $\\vee$-subit and $\\wedge$-subfit. We prove that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean iff $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit, hence obtaining Janowitz's other result as a corollary. We also characterize when $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit and when $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular. Each turns out to be strictly weaker than the corresponding property of $A$, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for when these two conditions are reflected. On the one hand, this relates to the notion of a proHeyting lattice; on the other hand, it results in a stronger notion of regularity for $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\n\nProHeyting lattices were introduced in [BPWW16] to characterize when the DedekindMacNeille completion of a distributive lattice is a frame. This plays an important r\u00f4le in our considerations. For each distributive lattice $A$, we introduce its proHeyting extension $p \\mathcal{J}(A$ and show that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is exactly the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of $p \\mathcal{J}(A$. We think of $p \\mathcal{J}(A$ as a \"finitary\" version of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, and show that whether $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit, regular, or Boolean depends on whether the corresponding properties hold for $p \\mathcal{J}(A$.\n\nAs we will see, the three separation axioms of subfitness, regularity, and Booleanness all collapse for the canonical completion $A^{\\sigma}$ and are equivalent to $A$ being Boolean. While for the ideal completion $\\mathcal{J} A$, to be Boolean requires the much stronger condition that $A$ is a finite Boolean algebra. As with $A^{\\sigma}$, for $\\mathcal{J} A$ to be regular is equivalent to $A$ being Boolean, however the ideal completion is more sensitive with respect to subfitness. Indeed, $\\mathcal{J} A$ is subfit iff every ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals, a condition that is strictly stronger than subfitness of $A$, but weaker than $A$ being Boolean.\n\nUtilizing Priestley duality, we characterize these three separation axioms for each of the completions by identifying an appropriate density property. For example, subfitness of $A$ is equivalent to the minimal spectrum of $A$ being dense in its Priestley space $X$, while subfitness of $\\mathcal{J} A$ is equivalent to to the density of the minimal spectrum of $A$ in the Skula topology of the topology of open upsets of X (see Section 4 for details).\n\nIt is natural to continue this line of research by considering other separation axioms as well as other completions. From a purely lattice-theoretic perspective, it is also of interest to explore the non-distributive setting, which we aim to do in the future.",

      "text": "# 2. Preliminaries \n\nWe start by recalling that a completion of a poset $P$ is a pair ( $C, e)$ where $C$ is a complete lattice and $e: P \\rightarrow C$ is a poset embedding. As is customary, we identify $P$ with its image $\\mathrm{e}[\\mathrm{P}]$ in C , and refer to C as a completion of P .\n\nWe say that P is join-dense in C if each element of C is a join from P , and define P being meet-dense in C similarly. Up to isomorphism, each poset P has a unique completion C such that P is both join- and meet-dense in C (see, e.g., [BD74, p. 237]). It is known as the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of P and we denote it by $\\mathcal{D M P}$. While $\\mathcal{D M P}$ has many desirable properties (for example, $\\mathcal{D M P}$ is the injective hull of P in the category Pos of posets and order-preserving maps), it may fail to be distributive. This can be remedied by considering injective hulls in the category MSLat of $\\wedge$-semilattices. These were constructed by Bruns and Lakser [BL70] (see also Horn and Kimura [HK71]), who showed that the injective hull of each $\\wedge$-semilattice $S$ is a frame ${ }^{2}$ in which $S$ is join-dense. We denote this completion by $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} S$.\n\nIn this paper we are mainly interested in bounded distributive lattices, so we let DLat be the category of bounded distributive lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms. For $A \\in$ DLat, in addition to the Dedekind-MacNeille completion $\\mathcal{D M A}$ and the Bruns-Lakser completion $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, we consider the ideal completion $\\mathcal{I A}$ (see, e.g., [Joh82, p. 59]) and the canonical completion $A^{\\sigma}$ (see, e.g., [Gol89, GJ94]). As follows from the name, $\\mathcal{I A}$ is the frame of all ideals of $A$, and the assignment $A \\mapsto \\mathcal{I} A$ defines a functor from DLat to the category Frm of frames (yielding an equivalence between DLat and the (non-full) subcategory CohFrm of Frm consisting of coherent frames; see, e.g., [Joh82, p. 65]). On the other hand, $A^{\\sigma}$ is, up to isomorphism, a unique completion of $A$ that is both compact and dense [GH01, p. 349]. Moreover, the assignment $A \\mapsto A^{\\sigma}$ defines a functor from DLat to the category CDLat of completely distributive lattices (see, e.g., [GH01, Thm. 5.4] or [BHJ21, Cor. 2.2]).\n\nWe next characterize each of these four completions using Priestley duality for DLat [Pri70, Pri72].\n\nDefinition 2.1. A Priestley space is a compact space $X$ equipped with a partial order $\\leqslant$ satisfying the Priestley separation axiom:\n\n$$\n\\text { if } x \\nless y \\text {, then there is a clopen upset } U \\text { such that } x \\in U \\text { and } y \\notin U \\text {. }\n$$\n\nRemark 2.2. The Priestley separation axiom implies that the topology has a basis of clopen sets. Thus, the topology of a Priestley space is a Stone topology (compact Hausdorff and zero-dimensional).\n\nA Priestley morphism between Priestley spaces is a continuous order-preserving map. Let Pries be the category of Priestley spaces and Priestley morphisms.\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Priestley duality). DLat is dually equivalent to Pries.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ We refer the reader to [Joh82] or [PP12] for all basics about frame/locale theory.\n\nRemark 2.4. The contravariant functors establishing Priestley duality are constructed as follows. For a Priestley space $X$, let $L(X)$ be the lattice of clopen upsets of $X$, and for a Priestley morphism $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ let $L(f)=f^{-1}: L(Y) \\rightarrow L(X)$. For a bounded distributive lattice $A$, let $\\mathcal{S}(A)$ be the poset of prime filters of $A$ and let $s_{A}: A \\rightarrow \\wp(\\mathcal{S}(A))$ be the Stone map given by $s_{A}(a)=\\{x \\in \\mathcal{S}(A): a \\in x\\}$. We order $\\mathcal{S}(A)$ by inclusion and topologize it by the subbasis\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\mathfrak{s}_{A}(a): a \\in A\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{s_{A}(b)^{c}: b \\in A\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen $\\mathcal{S}(A)$ is a Priestley space. Moreover, if $h: A \\rightarrow B$ is a bounded lattice morphism, then $\\mathcal{S}(h)=h^{-1}: \\mathcal{S}(B) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S}(A)$ is a Priestley morpism. These two contravariant functors $L, \\mathcal{S}$ establish Priestley duality. In particular, $s_{A}: A \\rightarrow L \\mathcal{S}(A)$ is a lattice isomorphism natural in each coordinate and $\\varepsilon_{X}: X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{S} L(X)$, given by $\\varepsilon_{X}(x)=\\{U \\in L(X): x \\in U\\}$, is an order-homeomorphism natural in each coordinate.\n\nRemark 2.5. Priestley duality depends on the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem (or one of its equivalents), which is a consequence of the Axiom of Choice. Thus, all of our results that depend on Priestley duality are not choice free.\n\nWe will freely use the following well-known facts about Priestley spaces (see, e.g., [DP02, pp. 258-259]):\nFact 2.6. Let X be a Priestley space.\n(1) $\\{\\mathrm{U} \\backslash \\mathrm{V}: \\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{V}$ clopen upsets $\\}$ forms a basis for the topology on X .\n(2) Open upsets (resp. downsets) are unions of clopen upsets (resp. downsets).\n(3) Closed upsets (resp. downsets) are intersections of clopen upsets (resp. downsets).\n(4) $\\leqslant$ is a closed subset of the product $X^{2}$. Consequently, $\\uparrow F$ and $\\downarrow F$ are closed for each closed subset F of X .\n\nEach Priestley space X carries a Stone topology, as well as the topology of open upsets and the topology of open downsets, the former being the join of the latter two. We write cl and int for the closure and interior in the Stone topology, $\\mathrm{cl}_{1}$ and $\\operatorname{int}_{1}$ for the closure and interior in the topology of open upsets, and $\\mathrm{cl}_{2}$ and $\\operatorname{int}_{2}$ for the closure and interior in the topology of open downsets. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{cl}_{1}(\\mathrm{~S})=\\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~S}) ; \\quad \\mathrm{cl}_{2}(\\mathrm{~S})=\\uparrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~S}) ; \\\\\n& \\operatorname{int}_{1}(\\mathrm{~S})=X \\backslash \\downarrow(X \\backslash \\operatorname{int}(\\mathrm{~S})) ; \\quad \\operatorname{int}_{2}(\\mathrm{~S})=X \\backslash \\uparrow(\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\operatorname{int}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\text { ). }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nx \\in \\mathrm{cl}_{1}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\text { iff } \\uparrow x \\cap \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\neq \\varnothing ; & x \\in \\mathrm{cl}_{2}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\text { iff } \\downarrow x \\cap \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\neq \\varnothing \\\\\nx \\in \\operatorname{int}_{1}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\text { iff } \\uparrow x \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(\\mathrm{~S}) ; & x \\in \\operatorname{int}_{2}(\\mathrm{~S}) \\text { iff } \\downarrow x \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}(\\mathrm{~S})\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe are ready to characterize $A^{o}$ and $\\mathcal{J} A$ in the language of Priestley spaces. For a Priestley space $X$, let $\\operatorname{Up}(X)$ be the completely distributive lattice of upsets and $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ the frame of open upsets of $X$. We then have:\n\nTheorem 2.7. Let $A \\in$ DLat and $X$ be the Priestley space of $A$.\n(1) [Gol89, GJ94] $A^{o} \\cong \\operatorname{Up}(X)$.\n\n(2) $[\\operatorname{Pri} 70] \\mathcal{J A} \\cong \\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$.\n\nRemark 2.8.\n(1) Alternatively, $A^{\\sigma}$ can be described as follows. Let $\\mathcal{F}(A)$ be the frame of filters of $A$. Then there is a Galois connection $(\\phi, \\psi)$ between the powersets of $\\mathcal{F}(A)$ and $\\mathcal{J}(A)$ given by\n\n$$\n\\phi(Y)=\\{I \\in \\mathcal{J}(A): I \\cap F \\neq \\varnothing \\forall F \\in Y\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathrm{Z})=\\{\\mathrm{F} \\in \\mathcal{F}(\\mathrm{~A}): \\mathrm{F} \\cap \\mathrm{I} \\neq \\varnothing \\forall \\mathrm{I} \\in \\mathrm{Z}\\}\n$$\n\nand $A^{\\sigma}$ is isomorphic to the complete lattice $\\mathcal{G}(\\phi, \\psi)$ of Galois closed elements (see [GH01, Prop. 2.6]).\n(2) The isomorphism of Theorem 2.7(2) sends $\\mathrm{I} \\in \\mathcal{J A}$ to the open upset\n\n$$\ns(I)=\\bigcup\\{s(a): a \\in I\\}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $s\\left(V_{\\alpha} I_{\\alpha}\\right)=\\bigcup_{\\alpha} s\\left(I_{\\alpha}\\right)$ and $s(I \\cap J)=s(I) \\cap s(J)$. This will be used in subsequent sections.\n\nTo characterize $\\mathcal{D} M A$ and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ in terms of the Priestley dual $X$ of $A$, we first recall that $\\mathcal{D} M A$ can be constructed as the complete lattice of normal ideals of $A$ and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ as the frame of D-ideals of A (see the beginning of Section 3 for details). Since ideals of A dually correspond to open upsets of $X$, it is sufficient to recognize which open upsets correspond to normal ideals and which to D-ideals.\n\nConsider the following two closure operators on $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ : $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}_{2}$ and $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}$. Observe that the second one is even a nucleus on $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ (see [BH14, Prop. 6.1]).\n\nDefinition 2.9. Let $X$ be a Priestley space.\n(1) We call a fixpoint of $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}_{2}$ a Dedekind-MacNeille upset or DM-upset, and let $\\operatorname{DM}(X)$ be the poset of DM-upsets of X.\n(2) We call a fixpoint of $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}$ a Bruns-Lakser upset or BL-upset, and let $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ be the poset of BL-upsets of X.\n\nIt turns out that normal ideals exactly correspond to DM-upsets, while D-ideals to BLupsets, and hence we obtain:\n\nTheorem 2.10. Let $A \\in$ DLat and $X$ be the Priestley space of $A$.\n(1) [BH04, Thm. 3.5] $\\mathcal{D} M A \\cong \\operatorname{DM}(X)$.\n(2) [BH14, Prop. 6.1, 8.12] $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\cong B L(X)$.\n\nRemark 2.11. We have the following poset inclusions\n\n$$\nL(X) \\subseteq \\operatorname{DM}(X) \\subseteq \\operatorname{BL}(X) \\subseteq \\operatorname{OpUp}(X) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Up}(X)\n$$\n\nmost of which are obvious. We only verify that $\\operatorname{DM}(X) \\subseteq \\operatorname{BL}(X)$ : if $U \\in \\operatorname{DM}(X)$ then $U=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}_{2}(U)$, so\n\n$$\nU \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(U) \\subseteq \\operatorname{int}_{1} \\uparrow \\mathrm{cl}(U)=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}_{2}(U)=U\n$$\n\nand hence $U \\in \\operatorname{BL}(X)$. Moreover, $L(X)$ is a bounded sublattice of each of the four, $\\operatorname{DM}(X)$ is a bounded sub- $\\cap$-semilattice of $\\operatorname{BL}(X), \\operatorname{BL}(X)$ is a sublocale ${ }^{3}$ of $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$, and $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ is a subframe of $\\operatorname{Up}(X)$. That $\\operatorname{BL}(X)$ is a sublocale of $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ can be seen by observing that $\\operatorname{BL}(X)$ is the fixpoints of the nucleus $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}$ on $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$. For the same reason, joins in $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ are calculated by the formula $\\bigvee_{\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})} \\mathrm{S}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(\\bigcup S)$ for each $\\mathrm{S} \\subseteq \\operatorname{OpUp}(\\mathrm{X})$. This will be used frequently in subsequent sections.\n\nRemark 2.12. As a consequence of Remark 2.11, we obtain the following poset embeddings\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{A} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{D} M A \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{J} A \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{~A}^{\\sigma}\n$$\n\n(which can also be proved directly without the use of Priestley duality). Furthermore, A is isomorphic to a bounded sublattice of each of the four, $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is isomorphic to a bounded sub- $\\wedge$-semilattice of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A, \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is isomorphic to a sublocale of $\\mathcal{J} A$, and $\\mathcal{J} A$ is isomorphic to a subframe of $A^{\\sigma}$. For a direct proof that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is isomorphic to a sublocale of $\\mathcal{J} A$ we refer to [BDRWW24, Thm. 5.17].\n\nTable 1 summarizes the completions of a distributive lattice that will be considered in this paper, together with their representations.

[BPWW16, Def. 3.1] A $\\in$ DLat is proHeyting if $\\langle a, b\\rangle$ is a normal ideal for each $a, b \\in A .{ }^{5}$\n\nRemark 3.6. By Remark 3.3(2), every Heyting lattice is proHeyting. Therefore, proHeyting lattices provide a natural generalization of Heyting lattices. That this is indeed a proper generalization is shown in [BPWW16, Sec. 3].\n\nWe point out that the importance of proHeyting is in the following:\nProposition 3.7. [BPWW16, Thm. 6.3] For A $\\in$ DLat, the following are equivalent:\n(1) $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is a frame.\n(2) $\\mathcal{D} M A \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\n(3) A is proHeyting.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ The referee pointed out to us that the dual statement of Lemma 3.4 for filters is given in [JS24, Prop. 5.5].\n    ${ }^{5}$ In [BPWW16], the authors write $b \\downarrow a$ instead of $\\langle a, b\\rangle$.\n\nRemark 3.8. An alternate proof of the above result is given in [BDRWW24, Thm. 3.15].\nWe next introduce our proHeyting extension of $A \\in$ DLat. Viewing $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ as the frame of D-ideals of A, it follows from Lemma 3.4 that relative annihilator ideals of A form a meet-dense subposet of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\n\nDefinition 3.9. For $A \\in$ DLat, the proHeyting extension of $A$ is the bounded sublattice $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$ of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ generated by the relative annihilator ideals of A .\n\nRemark 3.10. As we will see in Corollary 3.13(1), $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$ is always a proHeyting lattice, justifying the name. The following is a convenient way to think about $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$ : Let $\\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{A}(\\mathrm{A})$ be the poset of finite intersections of relative annihilator ideals. Then $\\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{A}(\\mathrm{A})$ is a bounded sub- $\\wedge$-semilattice of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, and $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$ consists of the finite joins in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ of elements of $\\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{A}(\\mathrm{A})$. In fact, as is shown in $\\left[\\mathrm{BMM}^{+} 24\\right.$, Sec. 4], $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$ is exactly the distributive lattice envelope of $\\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{A}(\\mathrm{A})$.\n\nSince $a \\mapsto \\downarrow a$ embeds $A$ into $p \\mathcal{H}(A$, from now on we will identify $A$ with its image in $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$. Thus, we have the following lattice inclusions $A \\subseteq p \\mathcal{H}(A \\subseteq \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$. In the next proposition we characterize when these inclusions are equalities.\n\nProposition 3.11. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat.\n(1) $A=p \\mathcal{H}(A$ iff $A$ is Heyting.\n(2) $p \\mathcal{H}(A=\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ iff $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ is a frame.\n\nProof. (1) A is Heyting iff $a \\rightarrow b$ exists in A for each $a, b \\in A$, which is equivalent to $\\langle a, b\\rangle$ being principal for each $a, b \\in A$. The latter means that $A=p \\mathcal{H}(A$.\n(2) Clearly if $p \\mathcal{H}(A=\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ then $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ is a frame. For the converse, since $A$ is join-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, for each $x \\in p \\mathcal{H}(A$ we have $x=\\bigvee_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} S$ for some $S \\subseteq A$. Since $x \\in p \\mathcal{H}(A$, $\\mathrm{x}=\\bigvee_{p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}} \\mathrm{~S}$, and so A is join-dense in $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$. By [BPWW16, Thm. 7.4], each frame having A as a base contains $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$. Thus, if $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ is a frame then $p \\mathcal{H}(A=\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\n\nThe following shows that the Bruns-Lakser completion of a distributive lattice can always be realized as the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of a suitably enlarged lattice (the proHeyting extension).\n\nTheorem 3.12. For any $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{D M}(p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}) \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\nProof. Since $A$ is join-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, we have that $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ is also join-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$. By Lemma 3.4(2), the poset of relative annihilators is meet-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, and hence so is $p \\mathcal{H}(A$. Because $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ is both join- and meet-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, we conclude that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{D M}(p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A})$ (see, e.g., [BD74, p. 237]).",

This may be generalized as follows: by [BDRWW24, Thm. 5.17], up to isomorphism, the frames that have $A$ as a lattice base form the interval $[\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A, \\mathcal{J} A]$ in the co-frame of sublocales of $\\mathcal{J} A$. For each such $L$, we may consider the sublattice of L generated by the relative annihilators of A. In our opinion, these constructions deserve further investigation.",

      "text": "# 4. SUBFITNESS \n\nIn this section we characterize when the various completions considered in this paper are subfit. This yields necessary and sufficient conditions for when subftness is preserved or reflected by these completions.\n\nWe begin by recalling a characterization of subfitness of a distributive lattice in terms of its Priestley dual. For $A \\in$ DLat and $X$ the Priestley space of $A$, we denote by $\\min X$ the set of minimal points of $X$. Since for each $x \\in X$ there exists $m \\in \\min X$ such that $m \\leqslant x$, we see that $\\min X$ is order-dense in $X$ in that $X=\\uparrow \\min X$ (see, e.g, [Pri84, p. 42]). The lattice A being subfit exactly amounts to $\\min X$ being topologically dense in X :\nProposition 4.1. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat and its Priestley space X , the following are equivalent:\n(1) A is subfit.\n(2) $a \\not \\leqslant b$ implies there is a maximal ideal $M$ with $b \\in M$ and $a \\notin M$.\n(3) Every principal ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals.\n(4) $\\min X$ is dense in $X$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Leftrightarrow(2)$ is proved in [DIM21, Prop. 3.2], (2) $\\Leftrightarrow(3)$ is obvious, and (1) $\\Leftrightarrow(4)$ is proved in [BCM23, Lem. 3.1] when A is a frame, but the same proof works for an arbitrary $A \\in$ DLat (see also $\\left[\\mathrm{BMM}^{+} 24\\right.$, Prop. 5.2]).\n\nWe next consider subfitness of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. As pointed out in the introduction, this was first studied in [Jan68]. Janowitz does not assume distributivity and uses a formally weaker form of subfitness which, as will be shown in a forthcoming paper, is equivalent to subfitness as defined above. The next result is slightly more general in that completeness of the lattice B plays no r\u00f4le.\nTheorem 4.2. Let A be a bounded sublattice of B .\n(1) If A is meet-dense in B and B is subfit then A is subfit.\n(2) If A is both join- and meet-dense in B and A is subfit then B is subfit.\n\nProof. (1) Suppose $a \\not \\leqslant b$ in $A$. Since $B$ is subfit, there is $x \\in B$ with $a \\vee x=1$ but $b \\vee x \\neq 1$. Because $A$ is meet-dense in $B$, there is $c \\in A$ with $b \\vee x \\leqslant c<1$. Therefore, $a \\vee c=1$ but $b \\vee c \\neq 1$ in $A$, and hence $A$ is subfit.\n(2) Suppose $x \\not \\leqslant y$ in $B$. Since $A$ is both join- and meet-dense in $B$, there are $a, b \\in A$ with $a \\leqslant x, y \\leqslant b$, and $a \\not \\leqslant b$. Because $A$ is subfit, there is $c \\in A$ with $a \\vee c=1$ but $b \\vee c \\neq 1$ in $A$. Therefore, $x \\vee c=1$ but $y \\vee c \\neq 1$ in $B$. Thus, $B$ is subfit.\nCorollary 4.3. [Jan68, Cor. 2.5] Let A be a bounded lattice. Then $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is subfit iff A is subfit.\n\nProof. Identify A with a sublattice of $\\mathcal{D M A}$ and observe that A is both join- and meet-dense in $\\mathcal{D M A}$. Now apply Theorem 4.2.\n\nWe now consider subfitness for the Bruns-Lakser completion of A. As we saw in Corollary 4.3, subfitness of $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is equivalent to that of A ; in comparison, subfitness of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is equivalent to that of $p \\mathcal{H} \\mathrm{~A}$ :\n\nTheorem 4.4. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ is subfit iff $p \\mathcal{H} \\mathrm{~A}$ is subfit.\nProof. By Theorem 3.12, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A} \\cong \\mathcal{D M}(p \\mathcal{H} \\mathrm{~A})$. Therefore, by Corollary 4.3, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ is subfit iff $p \\mathcal{H} \\mathrm{~A}$ is subfit.\n\nRemark 4.5. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, let X be the Priestley dual of A and pX the Priestley dual of $p \\mathcal{H} \\mathrm{~A}$. As an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.1 and Theorem 4.4, we obtain: $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ is subfit iff $\\min \\mathrm{pX}$ is dense in pX . It is interesting to give an explicit description of pX , which we aim to do in future work.\n\nAs with $\\mathcal{D M A}$, we show that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ preserves subfitness. However, unlike $\\mathcal{D M A}$, it does not reflect it. For this we need the following:\n\nLemma 4.6. [BMPWW17, Lem. 7.4] If $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat is subfit then A is proHeyting.\nTheorem 4.7. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat.\n(1) A subfit implies that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ is subfit.\n(2) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ subfit does not imply that A is subfit.\n\nProof. (1) If A is subfit, then A is proHeyting by Lemma 4.6, hence $\\mathcal{D M A} \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ by Proposition 3.7. Therefore, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} \\mathrm{A}$ is subfit by Corollary 4.3.\n(2) Let $X$ be the space depicted in Fig. 1, where $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\{y\\}$ is the set of isolated points and $\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}$ is the limit of $\\left\\{\\mathrm{x}_{0}, \\mathrm{x}_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. In other words, X is the one-point compactification of the discrete space $\\left\\{\\mathrm{x}_{0}, \\mathrm{x}_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\{\\mathrm{y}\\}$. Define the partial order on X as shown in the figure (that is, $\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}<\\mathrm{y}$ is the only nontrivial relation).\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. A Priestley space $X$ with $\\operatorname{BL}(X)$ subfit but $L(X)$ not.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that X equipped with this partial order is a Priestley space. Let $A=L(X)$. By Priestley duality, we identify $X$ with the Priestley space of $A$. Since $\\min X=\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{x_{\\infty}\\right\\}$ is not dense in $X$, by Proposition 4.1 A is not subfit. We show\n\nthat $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit. By Theorem 2.10(2), we identify $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ with $\\operatorname{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$. Let $\\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ with $U \\nsubseteq V$. We have three cases to consider:\n\nFirst suppose there is $x_{n} \\in U \\backslash V$. Then $W:=X \\backslash\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}$ is a clopen upset, hence an element of $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$, such that $\\mathrm{U} \\cup W=\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{V} \\cup W \\neq \\mathrm{X}$. Since the join in $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is given by $\\mathrm{D} \\vee \\mathrm{E}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{D} \\cup \\mathrm{E})$ (see Remark 2.11) and $\\mathrm{x}_{n}$ is isolated, we obtain $\\mathrm{U} \\vee \\mathrm{W}=\\mathrm{X}$ and $V \\vee W \\neq X$.\n\nNext suppose $y \\in U \\backslash V$. Let $W=\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. Then $W \\in B L(X)$. Because $y \\in U$, we have $U \\cup W$ is dense in $X$, so $U \\vee W=X$. On the other hand, $y \\notin V$ implies $x_{\\infty} \\notin V$, so $V \\subseteq W$, and hence $V \\vee W=W \\neq X$.\n\nFinally, let $x_{\\infty} \\in U \\backslash V$. Then $y \\in U$, so if $y \\notin V$, we are in the previous case. Suppose $y \\in V$. If $V$ contains a cofinite subset of $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, then $x_{\\infty} \\in \\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(V)=V$, a contradiction. So $V \\cap\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ is finite. On the other hand, $U$ must contain a cofinite subset of $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ because, by Fact 2.6(2), there is $W \\in L(X)$ such that $x_{\\infty} \\in W \\subseteq U$. Since $W$ is clopen containing $x_{\\infty}$, which is the limit of $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}, W$ must contain a cofinite subset of $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. Thus, there must exist $x_{n} \\in U \\backslash V$, and we are in the first case, completing the proof that $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is subfit.\n\nPutting Theorems 4.4 and 4.7 together yields:\nCorollary 4.8. If $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat is subfit, then so is $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A}$, but not conversely.\nTo obtain an analogue of Corollary 4.3 for $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (equivalently for $p \\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{~A})$, we need the additional requirement that A is proHeyting:\nProposition 4.9. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat be proHeyting. Then $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit iff A is subfit.\nProof. The reverse implication follows from Theorem 4.7(1). For the forward implication, since $A$ is proHeyting, Proposition 3.7 implies that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\cong \\mathcal{D} M A$, thus it is enough to apply Corollary 4.3.\n\nWe next consider subfitness for the ideal completion. As we pointed out in Remark 2.8(2),\n\n$$\nI \\mapsto s(I)=\\bigcup\\{s(a): a \\in I\\}\n$$\n\nis an isomorphism of $\\mathcal{H}(\\mathrm{A})$ and $\\mathrm{OpUp}(\\mathrm{X})$, where X is the Priestley space of A . Similarly,\n\n$$\nF \\mapsto s(F)=\\bigcap\\{s(a): a \\in F\\}\n$$\n\nis an isomorphism between the filters of $A$ and the closed upsets of $X$ (ordered by $\\supseteq$ ). The following lemma belongs to folklore.\nLemma 4.10. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, I be an ideal, and F a filter of A . Then $\\mathrm{I} \\cap \\mathrm{F} \\neq \\varnothing$ iff $\\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{F}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{I})$. Proof. If $a \\in F \\cap I$, then $s(F) \\subseteq s(a) \\subseteq s(I)$. Conversely, since $X$ is compact, from $s(F) \\subseteq s(I)$ it follows that there is $a \\in A$ with $s(F) \\subseteq s(a) \\subseteq s(I)$. Thus, $a \\in F \\cap I$.\n\nFor the next theorem, we utilize the Skula topology [Sku69] - a convenient tool in the study of topological spaces. We recall that the Skula topology of a topological space X is the topology generated by the basis\n\n$$\n\\{U \\backslash V: U, V \\text { open in } X\\}\n$$\n\nTheorem 4.11. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat and X be the Priestley space of A . The following are equivalent:\n(1) $\\mathcal{J A}$ is subfit.\n(2) For any $\\mathfrak{a} \\notin \\mathrm{J} \\in \\mathcal{J A}$, there is a maximal ideal M with $\\mathrm{J} \\subseteq \\mathrm{M}$ and $\\mathfrak{a} \\notin \\mathrm{M}$.\n(3) Every ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals.\n(4) For any $\\mathfrak{a} \\notin \\mathrm{J} \\in \\mathcal{J A}$, there is a minimal prime filter P such that $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{P} \\cap \\mathrm{J}=\\varnothing$.\n(5) $\\min X$ is dense in the Skula topology of $\\mathrm{OpUp}(X)$.\n(6) $x \\in \\mathrm{cl}(\\min \\downarrow x)$ for each $x \\in X$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (4): Suppose $\\mathfrak{a} \\notin \\mathrm{J}$, so $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{a} \\nsubseteq \\mathrm{J}$. Since $\\mathcal{J} A$ is subfit, there is $\\mathrm{I} \\in \\mathcal{J} A$ such that $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{a} \\vee \\mathrm{I}=\\mathrm{A}$ but $\\mathrm{J} \\vee \\mathrm{I} \\neq \\mathrm{A}$. Therefore, by Remark $2.8(2), \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})=\\mathrm{X}$ but $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I}) \\neq \\mathrm{X}$. The latter equality delivers $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\min X$ such that $\\mathrm{P} \\notin \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})$. Since $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})$ and $\\mathrm{P} \\notin \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})$, we must have $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$, so $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathrm{P}$. Also, because $\\mathrm{P} \\notin \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J})$, Lemma 4.10 implies that $\\mathrm{P} \\cap \\mathrm{J}=\\varnothing$. Thus, (4) holds.\n$(2) \\Leftrightarrow(3)$ : This is obvious.\n(2) $\\Leftrightarrow(4)$ : It is well known that prime ideals are exactly the complements of prime filters (see, e.g., [BD74, p. 68]) and, under that correspondence, maximal ideals are the complements of minimal prime filters. Thus, for the forward implication put $\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{A} \\backslash \\mathrm{M}$, and for the reverse implication put $M=A \\backslash P$.\n(4) $\\Rightarrow$ (5): Let $U, V \\in \\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ and $U \\backslash V \\neq \\varnothing$. By Fact 2.6(2), there is a clopen upset $W \\subseteq U$ such that $W \\nsubseteq V$. Since $W=s(a)$ and $V=s(J)$ for some $a \\in A$ and $J \\in \\mathcal{J} A$, we have $\\mathfrak{a} \\notin \\mathrm{J}$. So by (4) there is a minimal prime filter P such that $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{P} \\cap \\mathrm{J}=\\varnothing$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\min X \\cap W$ and $\\mathrm{P} \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ (by Lemma 4.10). Thus, $\\min X \\cap(U \\backslash V) \\neq \\varnothing$, and hence $\\min X$ is dense in the Skula topology of $\\mathrm{OpUp}(X)$.\n(5) $\\Rightarrow\\{1)$ : Suppose $\\mathrm{I} \\nsubseteq \\mathrm{J}$ in $\\mathcal{J A}$. Then there is $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathrm{I} \\backslash \\mathrm{J}$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\nsubseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J})$, so $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J}) \\neq \\varnothing$. By (5), there is a minimal prime filter P such that $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J})$. Let $W=X \\backslash\\{P\\}$. Then $W$ is an open upset, $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I}) \\cup W=X$ (because $\\mathrm{P} \\in \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})$ ), and $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J}) \\cup W \\neq X$ (because $\\mathrm{P} \\notin \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{J})$ and $\\mathrm{P} \\notin W$ ). Let $\\mathrm{H}=\\{\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathrm{A}: \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{W}\\}$ be the ideal of A corresponding to W. By Remark 2.8(2), $\\mathrm{I} \\vee \\mathrm{H}=\\mathrm{A}$ but $\\mathrm{J} \\vee \\mathrm{H} \\neq \\mathrm{A}$, and hence $\\mathcal{J A}$ is subfit.\n(3) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (6): Since every ideal is an intersection of prime ideals, (3) is equivalent to every prime ideal being the intersection of maximal ideals containing it. Recall (see, e.g., [Pri84, p. 54] or [BBGK10, p. 385]) that an ideal I is prime iff $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})=\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathrm{x}$ for some $\\mathrm{x} \\in \\mathrm{X}$ and I is maximal iff $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{I})=\\mathrm{X} \\backslash\\{\\mathrm{x}\\}$ for some $\\mathrm{x} \\in \\min \\mathrm{X}$. Since the meet in $\\mathrm{OpUp}(X)$ is given by $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\bigcap$, we see that the above is equivalent to $X \\backslash \\downarrow x=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\bigcap\\{X \\backslash\\{y\\}: y \\in \\min X$ and $y \\leqslant x\\}$ for each $x \\in X$. This, in turn, is equivalent to $\\downarrow x=\\mathrm{cl}_{1}(\\min \\downarrow x)$ for each $x \\in X$. Finally, since $\\mathrm{cl}_{1}=\\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}$ and $\\mathrm{cl} \\min \\downarrow \\mathrm{x} \\subseteq \\downarrow \\mathrm{x}$, the last condition is equivalent to (6).",

(1) This is immediate from Propositions 4.11(3) and 4.1(3).\n(2) Let $X$ be the space shown in Fig. 2, where $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{y_{0}, y_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ is the set of isolated points of $X, x_{\\infty}$ is the limit of $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ and $y_{\\infty}$ is the limit of $\\left\\{y_{0}, y_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ (that is, $X$ is the two-point compactification of the discrete space $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{y_{0}, y_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ ).\n\nClearly X is a Stone space. Let the partial order on X be as depicted in Fig. 2 (that is, the only nontrivial relation is $\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}<\\mathrm{y}_{\\infty}$ ).\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. A Priestley space $X$ with $L(X)$ subfit but $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$ not.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that X equipped with this partial order is a Priestley space. Let $A=L(X)$; as before, identify $X$ with the Priestley space of $A$. It is clear that\n\n$$\n\\min X=\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{x_{\\infty}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{y_{0}, y_{1}, \\ldots\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis dense in X. Thus, A is subfit by Proposition 4.1. On the other hand, $\\min \\left(\\downarrow y_{\\infty}\\right)=\\left\\{\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}\\right\\}$, so $\\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\min \\downarrow \\mathrm{y}_{\\infty}\\right)=\\left\\{\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}\\right\\}$, and hence $\\mathrm{y}_{\\infty} \\notin \\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\min \\downarrow \\mathrm{y}_{\\infty}\\right)$. Consequently, Proposition 4.11(6) is not satisfied, so $\\mathcal{F A}$ is not subfit.\n\nFinally, we consider subfitness for the canonical completion.\nProposition 4.13. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $A^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is subfit iff A is Boolean.\nProof. First suppose A is Boolean. Then the order on the Priestley space X of A is trivial, so $\\mathrm{Up}(\\mathrm{X})=\\mathcal{P}(\\mathrm{X})$. By Theorem 2.7(1), $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is Boolean, hence subfit. Conversely, suppose $\\mathrm{A}^{\\mathrm{o}}$ is subfit, so $\\mathrm{Up}(\\mathrm{X})$ is subfit. Thus, the order on X is trivial by [EGP07, Cor. 4.9]. Consequently, A is Boolean (see, e.g., [Gra11, p. 119]).\n\nRemark 4.14. We recall that a space X is Alexandroff if an arbitrary intersection of open sets is open, in which case the opens of X are exactly the upsets of X in the specialization preorder (defined by $\\mathrm{x} \\leqslant \\mathrm{y}$ iff $\\mathrm{x} \\in \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{y})$ ). An Alexandroff space is $\\mathrm{T}_{0}$ iff the specialization preorder is a partial order. Using this language, [EGP07, Cor. 4.9] states that the frame of opens of an Alexandroff $\\mathrm{T}_{0}$-space is subfit iff X is discrete. This result generalizes to arbitrary Alexandroff spaces as follows:\n\nLet X be an Alexandroff space and $\\mathrm{X}_{0}$ its $\\mathrm{T}_{0}$-reflection (that is, $\\mathrm{X}_{0}$ is the quotient of X by the equivalence relation $\\sim$ defined by $\\mathrm{x} \\sim \\mathrm{y}$ iff $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{x})=\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{y})$ ). Since the frames $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{X})$ and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\mathrm{X}_{0}\\right)$ of opens of X and $\\mathrm{X}_{0}$ are isomorphic, we have that $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{X})$ is subfit iff $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\mathrm{X}_{0}\\right)$ is subfit. Moreover, the specialization order on $\\mathrm{X}_{0}$ is discrete iff the specialization preorder on X is an equivalence relation. Thus, [EGP07, Cor. 4.9] yields: $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{X})$ is subfit iff the specialization preorder of X is an equivalence relation.\n\nAs a consequence of Proposition 4.13, we obtain that subfitness is not preserved but is reflected by canonical completions:\n\nCorollary 4.15. Let $A \\in$ DLat.\n(1) $A^{\\sigma}$ subfit implies $A$ subfit.\n(2) A subfit does not imply $A^{\\sigma}$ subfit.\n\nProof. (1) If $A^{\\sigma}$ is subfit, then $A$ is Boolean by Proposition 4.13, and hence $A$ is subfit.\n(2) Take any subfit non-Boolean $A$ (for example, the lattice consisting of $\\varnothing$ and the cofinite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ ) and apply Proposition 4.13.\n\nThe situation summarizes as follows:\nSummary 4.16. Let $A \\in$ DLat.\n(1) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit iff $p \\mathcal{H} A$ is subfit iff $\\min p X$ is dense in $p X$.\n(2) $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is subfit iff $A$ is subfit iff $\\min X$ is dense in $X$.\n(3) $\\mathcal{J} A$ is subfit iff $\\min X$ is dense in the Skula topology of $\\operatorname{OpUp}(X)$.\n(4) $A^{\\sigma}$ is subfit iff $A$ is Boolean iff $\\min X=X$.\n\nThis motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 4.17. We call $A \\in$ DLat $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L}$-subfit if $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit, and $\\mathcal{J}$-subfit if $\\mathcal{J} A$ is subfit.\nRemark 4.18. Obviously the terms $p \\mathcal{H}$-subfit, $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M}$-subfit, and $(\\cdot)^{\\sigma}$-subfit are redundant; $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L}$-subfitness is a proper weakening of subfitness, while $\\mathcal{J}$-subfitness is a proper strengthening thereof. Subfitness is equivalent to every principal ideal being an intersection of maximal ideals. $\\mathcal{J}$-subfitness strengthens this to all ideals, which is not quite equivalent to A being Boolean (the same example as in Proposition 4.15(2) is $\\mathcal{J}$-subfit - as every ideal is principal - but not Boolean). For A to be Boolean, $A^{\\sigma}$ must be subfit.",

      "text": "# 5. Regularity \n\nIn this section we characterize when the four completions are regular. For distributive lattices, regularity is a natural strengthening of subfitness. As we saw above, subfitness of the canonical completion is equivalent to the lattice being Boolean. As we will see below, regularity yields the same result for the ideal completion. A more subtle result occurs for the Bruns-Lakser completion. The situation for the Dedekind-MacNeille completion is further complicated by the fact that the latter need not be distributive. Regular lattices behave very differently in the non-distributive setting; in particular, regularity no longer implies subfitness. This will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming paper. Here we will restrict our attention to Dedekind-MacNeille completions that are distributive.\n\nThe next definition is well known for frames (see, e.g., [PP12, Sec. V.5]) and generalizes directly to bounded lattices.\n\nDefinition 5.1. Let $A$ be a bounded lattice.\n(1) For $a, b \\in A, a$ is rather below (well inside) $b$, written $a \\prec b$, provided there is $\\mathrm{c} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ such that $\\mathrm{a} \\wedge \\mathrm{c}=0$ and $\\mathrm{b} \\vee \\mathrm{c}=1$.\n(2) $A$ is regular if $a \\nless b$ implies the existence of $c \\in A$ such that $c \\prec a$ but $c \\nless b$.\n\nRemark 5.2.\n(1) If $a$ has the pseudocomplement $a^{*}$, then $a \\prec b$ iff $a^{*} \\vee b=1$.\n(2) A is regular iff every element is the join of elements rather below it. This is the usual definition of regularity in frames, but the above definition is more appealing for arbitrary bounded lattices. Observe that while arbitrary joins may not exist in $A \\in$ DLat, if $A$ is regular then the join of $\\{b \\in A: b \\prec a\\}$ is $a$, so this join does exist for every $a \\in A$.\n(3) Every Boolean lattice is regular and in [BMPWW17, p. 360] it is shown that every regular distributive lattice is subfit. In a forthcoming paper we will show that this is no longer true for non-distributive lattices.\n\nOur first goal is to characterize when distributive lattices are regular using Priestley duality. We do so by generalizing some existing results for frames, proved in [BGJ16, Lem. 3.3, 3.6]. Since pseudocomplements may not exist in an arbitrary distributive lattice, the proofs below are somewhat more involved. We start by characterizing the rather below relation.\n\nLemma 5.3. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat with Priestley dual X ,\n\n$$\na \\prec b \\text { iff } \\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})\n$$\n\nProof. First suppose $a \\prec b$. Then there is $c \\in A$ such that $a \\wedge c=0$ and $b \\vee c=1$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cap \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\varnothing$ and $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\mathrm{X}$. Since $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})$ is an upset, $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cap \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\varnothing$. Thus, $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})$.\n\nConversely, suppose $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})$. Since $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$ is a closed downset, it is the intersection of clopen downsets containing it (see Fact 2.6). But then by compactness, there is a clopen downset D such that $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{D} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})$. Let $\\mathrm{c} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ be such that $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\mathrm{D}$. Then $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cap \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\varnothing$ and $\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})$. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cap \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\varnothing$ and $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})=\\mathrm{X}$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{a} \\wedge \\mathrm{c}=0$ and $\\mathrm{b} \\vee \\mathrm{c}=1$, and hence $\\mathfrak{a} \\prec \\mathfrak{b}$.\n\nFollowing [BGJ16, Def. 3.4], for each $V \\in L(X)$, define the regular part of $V$ to be\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{~V})=\\bigcup\\{\\mathrm{U} \\in \\mathrm{~L}(\\mathrm{X}): \\downarrow \\mathrm{U} \\subseteq \\mathrm{~V}\\}\n$$\n\nFor simplicity, we abbreviate the regular part of $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$ by $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathfrak{a}}$.\nProposition 5.4. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat with Priestley dual X , the following are equivalent:\n(1) A is regular.\n(2) $R_{a}$ is dense in $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$ for each $\\mathfrak{a} \\in A$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2): Let $a \\in A$. Take $x \\in s(a)$ and let $U$ be a clopen neighborhood of $x$ in $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$. We must show that $U \\cap R_{a} \\neq \\varnothing$. Since $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$, there are $\\mathrm{c}, \\mathrm{d} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ such that $\\mathrm{x} \\in \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{d}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{U}$ (see Fact 2.6(1)). Without loss of generality we may assume that $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$ (by intersecting $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})$ with $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$ ). Because $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{d}) \\neq \\varnothing$, $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\nsubseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{d})$, so $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{d}$. Since A is regular, there is $\\mathrm{e} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ such that $\\mathrm{e} \\prec \\mathrm{c}$ and $\\mathrm{e} \\nless \\mathrm{d}$. By Lemma 5.3, $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{e}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c})$, so $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{e}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{c}} \\subseteq \\mathrm{R}_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ and $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{e}) \\nsubseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{d})$. Thus, $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathfrak{a}} \\cap(\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\backslash \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathrm{d})) \\neq \\varnothing$, so $R_{a} \\cap U \\neq \\varnothing$, and hence $R_{a}$ is dense in $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$.\n\n(2) $\\Rightarrow$ (1): Let $a \\nless b$. Then $s(a) \\nsubseteq s(b)$, so $R_{a} \\nsubseteq s(b)$ since $R_{a}$ is dense in $s(a)$. Therefore, there is $\\mathrm{c} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ such that $\\downarrow \\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{a})$ and $\\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{c}) \\nsubseteq \\mathrm{s}(\\mathrm{b})$. Thus, $\\mathrm{c} \\prec \\mathrm{a}$ (by Lemma 5.3) and $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{~b}$, yielding that A is regular.\n\nWe next give a general characterization, akin to Theorem 4.2, of when regularity is preserved and/or reflected when moving between $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is a bounded sublattice of B. We write $\\prec_{A}$ or $\\prec_{B}$ to emphasize which rather below relation is being used. Clearly $a \\prec_{A} b$ implies $a \\prec_{B} b$ for all $a, b \\in A$, however the converse is not true in general. Because of this, the proposition below requires an extra assumption. As in Theorem 4.2, distributivity plays no r\u00f4le.\n\nProposition 5.5. Let A be a bounded sublattice of B. Suppose that $a \\prec_{A} b$ iff $a \\prec_{B} b$ for all $\\mathrm{a}, \\mathrm{b} \\in \\mathrm{A}$.\n(1) If A is join-dense in B and B is regular then A is regular.\n(2) If A is both join- and meet-dense in B and A is regular then B is regular.\n\nProof. (1) Let $a, b \\in A$ with $a \\nless b$. Since $B$ is regular, there is $x \\in B$ with $x \\prec_{B} a$ and $x \\nless b$. Because $A$ is join-dense in $B$, there is $c \\in A$ with $c \\leqslant x$ and $c \\nless b$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{c} \\leqslant \\mathrm{x} \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{a}$, so $\\mathrm{c} \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{a}$, and hence $\\mathrm{c} \\prec_{\\mathrm{A}} \\mathrm{a}$ (by assumption) and $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{~b}$. Thus, A is regular.\n(2) Let $x, y \\in B$ with $x \\nless y$. Since $A$ is both join- and meet-dense in $B$, there are $a, b \\in A$ such that $a \\leqslant x, y \\leqslant b$, and $a \\nless b$. Because $A$ is regular, there is $c \\in A$ with $c \\prec_{A} a$ and $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{~b}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{c} \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{a}$ (by assumption) and $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{~b}$, so $\\mathrm{c} \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}} \\mathrm{x}$ and $\\mathrm{c} \\nless \\mathrm{y}$. Thus, B is regular.\n\nSince $A$ is both join- and meet-dense in $\\mathcal{D M A}$, one could expect that regularity is both preserved and reflected by the Dedekind-MacNeille completion, but this is not the case since the additional assumption in Proposition 5.5 may not be satisfied. We again emphasize that $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is not always distributive and hence regularity of $\\mathcal{D M A}$ need not imply subfitness. Thus, we make the blanket assumption that $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is distributive. While this does not necessarily imply that $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is a frame, it is indeed the case provided $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is regular.\n\nProposition 5.6. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat and $\\mathcal{D M A}$ be distributive. Then regularity of $\\mathcal{D M A}$ implies that $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is a frame, and hence $\\mathcal{D M A} \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.\n\nProof. If $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is distributive, by [BMPWW17, p. 360] regularity of $\\mathcal{D M A}$ implies subfitness of $\\mathcal{D M A}$, and consequently subfitness of $A$ by Corollary 4.3. But then $A$ is proHeyting by Lemma 4.6. Hence, $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is a frame and $\\mathcal{D M A} \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ by Proposition 3.7.\n\nThe above proposition yields the following characterization of when a distributive Dede-kind-MacNeille completion is regular.\n\nProposition 5.7. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat and $\\mathcal{D M A}$ be distributive. The following are equivalent:\n(1) $\\mathcal{D M A}$ is regular.\n(2) A is subfit and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular.\n(3) A is proHeyting and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2): That $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular follows from Proposition 5.6. Regular implies subfit for distributive lattices, so $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is subfit, but then so is $A$ by Corollary 4.3.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(3):$ This follows from Lemma 4.6.\n$(3) \\Rightarrow(1):$ This follows from Proposition 3.7.\nWe next concentrate on characterizing when $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular. Since $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is a frame, the rather below relation is conveniently expressible in terms of the pseudocomplement (see Remark 5.2(1)). We use Priestley duality to describe this pseudocomplement. By Theorem 2.10(2), $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\cong B L(X)$ and by Remark 2.11, $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is the sublocale of $\\mathrm{OpUp}(\\mathrm{X})$ given by the nucleus $\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}$. Since the pseudocomplement in $\\mathrm{OpUp}(\\mathrm{X})$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{U}^{*}=\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})\n$$\n\nthe pseudocomplement in $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\neg \\mathrm{U}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\mathrm{U}^{*}\\right)=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}))\n$$\n\nLemma 5.8. Let $\\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$.\n(1) int $\\downarrow$ clint $\\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})=\\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})$.\n(2) $\\mathrm{U} \\prec_{\\mathrm{BL}} V$ iff $\\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{V})$.\n(3) If $\\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$, then $\\mathrm{U} \\prec_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\mathrm{V}$ iff $\\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{U} \\subseteq \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nProof. (1) The right-to-left inclusion is obvious. For the other inclusion, observe that\n\n$$\n\\text { int } \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl} \\text { int } \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\subseteq \\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\subseteq \\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})\n$$\n\nbecause $\\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})$ is a closed downset (see Fact 2.6(4)).\n(2) Recalling how joins are defined in $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ (see Remark 2.11) and that $\\mathrm{cl}_{1}=\\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}$, by (1) we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{U} \\prec_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\mathrm{~V} & \\Leftrightarrow \\neg \\mathrm{U} \\vee \\mathrm{~V}=\\mathrm{X} \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\neg \\mathrm{U}) \\cup \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~V})=\\mathrm{X} \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow \\mathrm{clint}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})) \\cup \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~V})=\\mathrm{X} \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow(\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\text { int } \\mathrm{cl}_{1} \\text { int } \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})) \\cup \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~V})=\\mathrm{X} \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow \\text { int } \\downarrow \\mathrm{clint} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~V}) \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow \\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{~V}) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(3) This follows from (2) since $\\mathrm{U}, \\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$ imply $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U})=\\mathrm{U}$ and $\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThis allows us to see that when restricted to $A$, the rather below relations on $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ and $p \\mathcal{H}(A$ coincide.\nProposition 5.9. For each $\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{b} \\in \\mathrm{A}, \\mathfrak{a} \\prec_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} \\mathfrak{b}$ iff $\\mathfrak{a} \\prec_{p \\mathcal{H}(A} \\mathfrak{b}$.\nProof. First suppose that $\\mathfrak{a} \\prec_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} \\mathfrak{b}$. Let $X$ be the Priestley space of $A$. Then int $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})$ by Lemma 5.8(3). Let $\\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})$. Then $\\mathrm{U} \\in \\mathrm{pH}(\\mathrm{X})$ by Lemma 3.14, and $\\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\cap \\mathrm{U}=\\varnothing$. Moreover, since int $\\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a}) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{U}) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})=\\mathrm{cl}(\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})) \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})=\\{\\mathrm{X} \\backslash \\operatorname{int} \\downarrow \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{a})\\} \\cup \\mathfrak{s}(\\mathfrak{b})=\\mathrm{X}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $U \\vee_{p H(X)} s(b)=X$, so $s(a)$ is rather below $s(b)$ in $p H(X)$, and hence $a \\prec_{p \\cap A} b$ by Proposition 3.15 .\n\nFor the converse, suppose that $a \\prec_{p \\cap A} b$. By Proposition 3.15, there is $U \\in \\mathrm{pH}(\\mathrm{X})$ such that $s(a) \\cap U=\\varnothing$ and $U \\vee_{p H(X)} s(b)=X$. The former gives $\\downarrow s(a) \\cap U=\\varnothing$, so $U \\subseteq X \\backslash \\downarrow s(a)$. The latter yields that $c l(U) \\cup s(b)=X$. Therefore, $c l(X \\backslash \\downarrow s(a)) \\cup s(b)=X$, so $(X \\backslash \\operatorname{int} \\downarrow s(a)) \\cup s(b)=X$, and hence int $\\downarrow s(a) \\subseteq s(b)$. Thus, $a \\prec_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} b$ by Lemma 5.8(3).\n\nIn order to show that regularity of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is equivalent to that of $p \\mathcal{O}(A$, we require the following general fact.\n\nProposition 5.10. Let A be a bounded sublattice of B . If A is join-dense in B , then the following are equivalent:\n(1) B is regular.\n(2) $b=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{B} b\\right\\}$ for each $b \\in B$.\n(3) $a=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{B} a\\right\\}$ for each $a \\in A$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2): Let $b \\in B$. Since $B$ is regular, $b=\\bigvee\\left\\{d \\in B: d \\prec_{B} b\\right\\}$ (see Remark 5.2(2)). Because A is join-dense in $B, d=\\bigvee\\{c \\in A: c \\leqslant d\\}$. But $c \\leqslant d \\prec_{B} b$ implies $c \\prec_{B} b$, so $b=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{B} b\\right\\}$\n(2) $\\Rightarrow$ (3): This is obvious.\n(3) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) Let $b \\in B$. Since $A$ is join-dense in $B, b=\\bigvee\\left\\{a \\in A: a \\leqslant b\\right\\}$. By assumption, $a=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{B} a\\right\\}$ for each $a \\in A$. From $c \\prec_{B} a \\leqslant b$ it follows that $c \\prec_{B} b$. Therefore, $b=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{B} b\\right\\}$, and hence $B$ is regular.\n\nTheorem 5.11. For $A \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular iff $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is regular.\nProof. Let $a \\in A$. Since $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is join-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, it follows from Proposition 5.9 that $a=\\bigvee_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A}\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} a\\right\\}$ iff $a=\\bigvee_{p \\mathcal{O}(A}\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{p \\mathcal{O}(A} a\\right\\}$. But $A$ is join-dense in both $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, and thus, by Proposition 5.10, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular iff $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is regular.\n\nWe next give a characterization of when $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular akin to Proposition 5.4.\nDefinition 5.12. Let $V \\in \\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$. We call\n\n$$\nR_{B L}(V):=\\bigcup\\left\\{U \\in L(X): U \\prec_{B L} V\\right\\}\n$$\n\nthe regular part of $V$ in $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$.\nTheorem 5.13. Let $A \\in$ DLat. The following are equivalent:\n(1) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular.\n(2) $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})$ is dense in V for each $\\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$.\n(3) $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})$ is dense in V for each $\\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (2): Since $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\cong B L(X)$, it is enough to show that $B L(X)$ is regular iff $R_{B L}(V)$ is dense in $V$ for each $V \\in B L(X)$. Let $V \\in B L(X)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\bigvee\\left\\{U \\in L(X): U \\prec_{B L} V\\right\\}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} c l \\bigcup\\left\\{U \\in L(X): U \\prec_{B L} V\\right\\}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} c l\\left(R_{B L}(V)\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, by Proposition 5.10, $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is regular iff $\\mathrm{V}=\\operatorname{int}_{1} \\mathrm{cl}\\left(\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})\\right)$ iff $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})$ is dense in $V$ for each $V \\in \\operatorname{BL}(X)$.\n$(1) \\Leftrightarrow(3)$ : By Proposition 5.10, $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is regular iff $\\mathrm{V}=\\bigvee\\left\\{\\mathrm{U} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X}): \\mathrm{U} \\prec_{\\mathrm{BL}} \\mathrm{V}\\right\\}$ for each $V \\in L(X)$. The same proof as in $(1) \\Leftrightarrow(2)$ may be used to show that this is equivalent to $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})$ being dense in V for each $\\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$.\n\nWe now compare regularity of $A$ to that of $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$.",

(1) This follows from Proposition 5.10 since $a \\prec_{A} b$ implies $a \\prec_{\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A} b$ for each $a, b \\in A .{ }^{7}$\n(2) Let $A$ be the finite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ together with $\\mathbb{N}$. Then $A \\in$ DLat, but it is not regular since it is not subfit. On the other hand, we show that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, so $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean, hence regular. Let $X$ be the Priestley space of $A$, where $x_{n}$ is the prime filter of A generated by $\\{n\\}$ and $x_{\\infty}$ is $\\{\\mathbb{N}\\}$ (see Fig. 3).\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3. The Priestley space $X$ of $A$.\n\nBy Theorem 2.10(2), it is enough to show that $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$. Since $\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty}$ is the only limit point of $X$, open upsets of $X$ are $X$ and the subsets of $\\left\\{x_{n}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$. Of these, only $\\left\\{x_{n}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$ is not a BL-upset, yielding that $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$.\n\nWe next strengthen Theorem 5.14(2) and show that there are even subfit $A$ such that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular but $A$ is not.\n\nExample 5.15.

It is straightforward to check that with the order as depicted below, X is a Priestley space.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4. A Priestley space $X$ with $L(X)$ subfit, $\\mathrm{BL}(\\mathrm{X})$ regular, but $\\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$ not regular.\n\nLet $A=L(X)$ and, as before, identify $X$ with the Priestley space of $A$. Since $\\min X$ is dense in $X$ (the only non-minimal point is $y_{\\infty}$, which is a limit point), we see that $A$ is subfit (by Proposition 4.1). But $A$ is not regular. To see this, consider the clopen upset $\\mathrm{U}=\\left\\{\\mathrm{y}_{1}, \\mathrm{y}_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{\\mathrm{y}_{\\infty}, \\mathrm{z}\\right\\}$. We show that $\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{U})=\\left\\{\\mathrm{y}_{1}, \\mathrm{y}_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. Let V be a clopen upset contained in $U$. If $y_{\\infty} \\in V$, then $\\downarrow V \\nsubseteq U$ since $x_{\\infty} \\in \\downarrow V \\backslash U$. Otherwise $V \\subseteq\\left\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, and hence $\\downarrow V=V \\subseteq U$. Thus, $V \\prec U$ iff $V \\subseteq\\left\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, yielding that $R(U)=\\left\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. Since $z \\notin \\operatorname{clR}(U)$, we see that $R(U)$ is not dense in $U$. Therefore, $A$ is not regular by Proposition 5.4.\n\nOn the other hand, we show that $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular. For this, by Theorem 5.13, it is sufficient to show that $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})$ is dense in V for each $\\mathrm{V} \\in \\mathrm{L}(\\mathrm{X})$. If $\\mathrm{y}_{\\infty} \\notin \\mathrm{V}$, then V is a finite subset of $\\left\\{\\mathrm{x}_{n}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{\\mathrm{y}_{n}: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$, so $\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$, and hence $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nSuppose $y_{\\infty} \\in V$. Then cofinitely many $y_{n}$ are in $V$. We have that $z \\in V$ or $z \\notin V$. First let $z \\in V$. If $x_{\\infty} \\notin V$, then $V$ only contains finitely many $x_{n}$, so int $\\downarrow V=V$, and hence $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$. If $\\mathrm{x}_{\\infty} \\in \\mathrm{V}$, then V is a downset, so $\\mathrm{R}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$, and thus $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{BL}}(\\mathrm{V})=\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nNext let $z \\notin V$. If $x_{\\infty} \\notin V$, then $V$ only contains finitely many $x_{n}$, so $R_{B L}(V)$ consists of these finitely many $x_{n}$ and cofinitely many $y_{n}$, and hence $R_{B L}(V)$ is dense in $V$. If $x_{\\infty} \\in V$, then cofinitely many $x_{n}$ are in $V$, so $R_{B L}(V)$ consists of cofinitely many $x_{n}$ and cofinitely many $y_{n}$, and again $R_{B L}(V)$ is dense in $V$. Thus, in all cases we have that $R_{B L}(V)$ is dense in $V$.\n\nWe now introduce a stronger notion of regularity for $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ which is equivalent to $A$ being regular. This notion makes sense for any lattice $B$ that has $A$ as a bounded sublattice.\n\nDefinition 5.16. Let $A$ be a bounded sublattice of $B$.\n(1) For $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B, a$ is $A$-below $b$, written $a \\triangleleft b$, provided there is $c \\in A$ such that $a \\prec_{A} c \\leqslant b$.\n\n(2) We say that $B$ is $A$-regular if for each $b, d \\in B$, from $b \\nless d$ it follows that there is $a \\in A$ with $a \\triangleleft b$ and $a \\nless d$.\n\nRemark 5.17.\n(1) Clearly, if $a, b \\in A$ then $a \\triangleleft b$ iff $a \\prec_{A} b$, and $B$ is $A$-regular iff $b=\\bigvee\\{a \\in A: a \\triangleleft b\\}$ for each $b \\in B$ (cf. Proposition 5.10).\n(2) If $A$ is join-dense in $B$ then $B$ is $A$-regular iff the following condition holds:\n\nIf $a \\in A, b \\in B$, and $a \\nless b$ then there is $c \\in A$ with $c \\prec_{A} a$ and $c \\nless b$.\nProposition 5.18. Let A be a join-dense bounded sublattice of B. Then A is regular iff B is A-regular.\n\nProof. Suppose $A$ is regular and $b \\in B$. Since $A$ is join-dense in $B, b=\\bigvee\\{a \\in A: a \\leqslant b\\}$. But $A$ is regular so $a=\\bigvee\\left\\{c \\in A: c \\prec_{A} a\\right\\}$ for each $a \\in A$. From $c \\prec_{A} a \\leqslant b$ it follows that $c \\triangleleft b$. Therefore, $b=\\bigvee\\{c \\in A: c \\triangleleft b\\}$, and thus $B$ is $A$-regular.\n\nConversely, suppose $B$ is $A$-regular and $a, b \\in A$ with $a \\nless b$. Since $a=\\bigvee\\{c \\in A: c \\triangleleft a\\}$, there is $c \\in A$ such that $c \\triangleleft a$ and $c \\nless b$. Therefore, $A$ is regular by Remark 5.17(1).\n\nSince $A \\in$ DLat is join-dense in both $p \\cap A$ and $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$, we conclude:\nCorollary 5.19. For $A \\in$ DLat, the following are equivalent:\n(1) A is regular.\n(2) $p \\cap A$ is A-regular.\n(3) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is A-regular.\n\nAs another consequence, we obtain:\nCorollary 5.20. If $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (resp. $p \\cap A$ ) is A-regular, then $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (resp. $p \\cap A$ ) is regular, but not conversely.\n\nProof. If $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is $A$-regular, then $A$ is regular by Proposition 5.18, and hence $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular by Theorem 5.14(1). On the other hand, let $A$ be as in Example 5.15. Then $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular, but $A$ is not regular. Therefore, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is not $A$-regular by Proposition 5.18.\n\nThe remainder of this section focuses on characterizing when the ideal and canonical completions are regular. For this, we recall some definitions and results from frame theory. For any frame L:\n\n- an element $a \\in L$ is compact if $a \\leqslant \\bigvee S$ implies $a \\leqslant \\bigvee T$ for some finite $T \\subseteq S$;\n- [Joh82, p. 63] L is coherent if the set $\\mathrm{K}(\\mathrm{L})$ of compact elements is join-dense and a bounded sublattice of L;\n- [Ban89] L is Stone if L is coherent and $\\mathrm{K}(\\mathrm{L})$ is a Boolean algebra;\n- A coherent frame is Stone iff it is regular. ${ }^{8}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ This was proved by Banaschewski in a seminar series at the University of Cape Town in 1988. For a proof, see [Wal89, Prop. 1.22], where the result is shown for $\\sigma$-frames (an analogous argument works for frames).\n\nRecall that, up to isomorphism, coherent frames are exactly the frames of ideals of bounded distributive lattices, which in turn are realized as the compact elements of coherent frames ([Joh82, p. 64]). Thus, we obtain:\n\nProposition 5.21. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{J} \\mathrm{A}$ is regular iff A is Boolean.\nProof. First suppose that $\\mathcal{J} A$ is regular. Since $\\mathcal{J} A$ is coherent, it follows that $\\mathcal{J} A$ is Stone, hence the compact elements of $\\mathcal{J} A$ form a Boolean algebra. But $K(\\mathcal{J} A)$ is isomorphic to $A$, so $A$ is Boolean. Conversely, if $A$ is Boolean then it is well known that $\\mathcal{J} A$ is Stone [Ban89], hence regular.\n\nTransitioning to the canonical completion, since regularity implies subfitness for distributive lattices, one implication of the next proposition is a consequence of Proposition 4.13, while the other follows from the fact that $A$ is Boolean iff $A^{\\sigma}$ is Boolean (see Proposition 6.6):\n\nProposition 5.22. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $A^{\\sigma}$ is regular iff A is Boolean.\nThe situation summarizes as follows:\nSummary 5.23. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat.\n(1) If $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is distributive, then $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is regular iff $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular and $A$ is subfit.\n(2) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (resp. $p \\mathcal{N}(A)$ is regular iff $R_{B L}(U)$ is dense in $U$ for each $U \\in L(X)$.\n(3) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (resp. $p \\mathcal{N}(A)$ is $A$-regular iff $A$ is regular iff $R(U)$ is dense in $U$ for each $U \\in L(X)$.\n(4) $\\mathcal{J} A$ is regular iff $A^{\\sigma}$ is regular iff $A$ is Boolean iff $R(U)=U$ for each $U \\in L(X){ }^{9}$",

      "text": "# 6. BOOLEANNESS \n\nWe finally concentrate on when the four completions are Boolean. Janowitz [Jan68, Thm. 3.11] gives a characterization for the Dedekind-MacNeille completion to be Boolean. We obtain his result as a corollary to our characterization of when the Bruns-Lakser completion is Boolean. This requires using the notion of $\\wedge$-subfitness (see the introduction). Since $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit iff its order-dual is $\\vee$-subfit, Proposition 4.1 immediately yields:\nProposition 6.1. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat and X its Priestley dual, the following are equivalent:\n(1) $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit.\n(2) $a \\nless b$ implies there is a maximal filter $F$ with $a \\in F$ and $b \\notin F$.\n(3) Every principal filter is an intersection of maximal filters.\n(4) $\\max X$ is dense in $X$.\n\nCorollary 6.2. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat with Priestley space X .\n(1) If max $X$ is closed, then $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit iff $A$ is Boolean.\n(2) If A is a frame, then A is $\\wedge$-subfit iff A is Boolean.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ For the last equivalence it is sufficient to observe that $R(U)=U$ for each $U \\in L(X)$ iff each $U$ is a complemented element of $L(X)$.\n\nProof. (1) Suppose $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit. By Proposition 6.1, max $X$ is dense in $X$. But max $X$ is closed, so $\\max X=X$, and hence $A$ is Boolean (see, e.g., [Gra11, p. 119]). The other implication is always true.\n(2) If $A$ is a frame then max $X$ is closed (see, e.g., [Esa19, p. 47]) and hence (1) applies.\n\nWe utilize the above two results to characterize when the Bruns-Lakser completion of a distributive lattice is Boolean.\n\nTheorem 6.3. For $A \\in$ DLat, the following are equivalent.\n(1) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean.\n(2) $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit.\n(3) $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is Boolean.\n\nProof. $(1) \\Rightarrow(2)$ : Let $a, b \\in A$ with $a \\nless b$. Since $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean, it is $\\wedge$-subfit, so there is $u \\in \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ such that $b \\wedge u=0$ and $a \\wedge u \\neq 0$. Because $A$ is join-dense in $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A, u=\\bigvee S$ for some $S \\subseteq A$. Therefore, since $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is a frame, $b \\wedge s=0$ for each $s \\in S$ and there is $t \\in S$ with $a \\wedge t \\neq 0$. Thus, $b \\wedge t=0$ but $a \\wedge t \\neq 0$, and hence $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit.\n$(2) \\Rightarrow(3)$ : Since $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is generated as a distributive lattice by relative annihilators, it is enough to show that each relative annihilator has a complement in $p \\mathcal{O}(A$. By Lemma 3.14(1) and Proposition 3.15, it is sufficient to show that $X \\backslash \\downarrow(\\mathrm{U} \\backslash \\mathrm{V})$ has a complement in $\\mathrm{pH}(\\mathrm{X})$ for any clopen upsets $U, V$ of $X$. Specifically, we show that $X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{\\mathrm{C}} \\cup V\\right)$ is the complement of $X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)$ in $p H(X)$. Since $U^{c} \\cup V$ is clopen, $X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{c} \\cup V\\right) \\in p H(X)$ by Lemma 3.14(2). Moreover, it is straightforward to see that\n\n$$\n[X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)] \\cap\\left[X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{c} \\cup V\\right)\\right]=\\varnothing\n$$\n\nFurthermore, since $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit, max $X$ is dense in $X$ by Proposition 6.1. But\n\n$$\n\\max X \\subseteq[X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)] \\cup\\left[X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{c} \\cup V\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nso $[X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)] \\cup\\left[X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{c} \\cup V\\right)\\right]$ is dense in $X$, and hence\n\n$$\n[X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)] \\vee_{p H(X)}\\left[X \\backslash \\downarrow\\left(U^{c} \\cup V\\right)\\right]=X\n$$\n\nThus, $X \\backslash \\downarrow(U \\backslash V)$ has a complement in $p H(X)$, finishing the proof that $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is Boolean.\n$(3) \\Rightarrow(1)$ : By Theorem 3.12, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A \\cong \\mathcal{D} M(p \\mathcal{O}(A)$. Therefore, $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ Boolean implies that so is $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ because the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of a Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra (see, e.g., [BD74, p. 239]).\n\nAs a consequence, we obtain:\nCorollary 6.4. [Jan68, Thm. 3.11] For $A \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is Boolean iff $A$ is $\\vee$-subfit and $\\wedge$-subfit.\n\nProof. First suppose $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is Boolean. Then $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is $\\vee$-subfit, so $A$ is $\\vee$-subfit by Corollary 4.3. Moreover, $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is a frame (since every complete Boolean algebra is a frame; see, e.g., [BD74, p. 53]), so $\\mathcal{D} M A \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ by Proposition 3.7. Therefore, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean, so $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit by Theorem 6.3.\n\nConversely, suppose $A$ is $\\vee$-subfit and $\\wedge$-subfit. Since $A$ is $\\vee$-subfit, $A$ is proHeyting by Lemma 4.6, so $\\mathcal{D} M A \\cong \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ by Proposition 3.7. Because $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit, $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is Boolean by Theorem 6.3. Thus, $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is Boolean.\n\nWe conclude this section by characterizing when the ideal and canonical completions are Boolean. As we will see, the condition for the ideal completion to be Boolean is more restrictive.\n\nProposition 6.5. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $\\mathcal{M}$ is Boolean iff A is finite and Boolean.\nProof. If A is finite, then $\\mathcal{M} \\cong \\mathrm{A}$, so A Boolean implies that $\\mathcal{M}$ is Boolean. Conversely, suppose $\\mathcal{M}$ is Boolean. Then every ideal, being complemented, is principal, so again $\\mathcal{M} \\cong \\mathrm{A}$. Since every infinite boolean algebra has an infinite pairwise disjoint set [Kop89, Prop. 3.4], it must also have a nonprincipal ideal. Thus, $A$ is finite.\nProposition 6.6. For $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, $A^{\\sigma}$ is Boolean iff A is Boolean.\nProof. Let $X$ be the Priestley space of $A$. Then $A$ is Boolean iff the order on $X$ is discrete (see, e.g., [Gra11, p. 119]), which happens iff $\\mathrm{Up}(\\mathrm{X})=\\mathcal{P}(\\mathrm{X})$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{A}^{\\sigma}$ being Boolean.\n\nThe situation summarizes as follows:\nSummary 6.7. Let $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat.\n(1) $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ (resp. $p \\mathcal{O}(A)$ is Boolean iff $A$ is $\\wedge$-subfit iff max $X$ is dense in $X$.\n(2) $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is Boolean iff $A$ is both $\\vee$ - and $\\wedge$-subfit iff both $\\min X$ and $\\max X$ are dense in $X$.\n(3) $A^{\\sigma}$ is Boolean iff $A$ is Boolean iff $\\max X$ is $X$.\n(4) $\\mathcal{M}$ is Boolean iff $A$ is finite and Boolean iff $\\max X$ is $X$ and $X$ is finite.",

Within each table, the conditions are arranged from the weakest to the strongest.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, recall the following notions from the end of Section 4 relating to subfitness:\n\n- A is $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L}$-subfit if $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is subfit (equivalently, $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is subfit);\n- A is $\\mathcal{J}$-subfit ${ }^{10}$ if $\\mathcal{M}$ is subfit;\n\nFor $\\mathrm{A} \\in$ DLat, consider the following definitions relating to regularity:\n\n- A is $\\mathcal{D} M$-regular if $\\mathcal{D} M A$ is regular;\n- A is $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L}$-regular if $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L} A$ is regular (equivalently, $p \\mathcal{O}(A$ is regular);\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ This should not be confused with the notion of ideally subfit introduced in [DIM21, Def. 2.13] (which is of novel interest only when $A$ is unbounded).\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable 2. Summary for subfitness\n\nFor Dedekind-MacNeille completions that are distributive, the notion of $\\mathcal{D} \\mathcal{M}$-regular is simply $\\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{L}$-regular plus subfit (Proposition 5.7). Also, the notions of $\\mathcal{J}$ - and $(\\cdot)^{\\sigma}$-regular coincide with being Boolean (Propositions 5.21 and 5.22).\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nTable 3.
