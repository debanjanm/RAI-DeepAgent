Let us denote by $\\mathbb{C}^{+}$the upper complex half-space, which can be identified with $\\mathbb{C}^{+} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\times(0,+\\infty)$. Then, the Hardy space $H^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{+}\\right)$consists on analytic functions $F$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{+}$with finite norm\n\n$$\n\\|F\\|_{H^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{+}\\right)}:=\\left(\\sup _{y>0} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|F(x+i y)|^{2} d x\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\n\nSpecifically, the result obtained in [42, Theorem X] (see also [54, Chapter III]) states that the action of the Fourier transform allows us to establish an isometric isomorphism between $H^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{+}\\right)$and $L^{2}(0,+\\infty)$.\n\nGeneralizations of Paley-Wiener type theorems can also be obtained for Bernstein spaces $B_{R}^{p}$, with $R>0$ and $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. It is known from [10, p. 98] that $f \\in B_{R}^{p}$ if, and only if, $f$ is an entire function satisfying\n\n$$\n\\|f(\\cdot+i y)\\|_{p} \\leq\\|f\\|_{p} e^{R|y|}, \\quad y \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_{p}$ denotes the standard $L^{p}$-norm on $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe Bernstein spaces $B_{R}^{p}$ can be characterized in different ways:\n(i) A function $f \\in L^{p}(\\mathbb{R})$ belongs to $B_{R}^{p}$ if, and only if, its distributional Fourier transform has support $[-R, R]$ in the sense of distributions.\n(ii) Let $f \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ be such that $f^{(k)} \\in L^{p}(\\mathbb{R})$, for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and some $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Then, $f \\in B_{R}^{p}$ if and only if $f$ satisfies the so-called Bernstein's inequality (cf. [41], p. 116)\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f^{(k)}\\right\\|_{p} \\leq R^{k}\\|f\\|_{p}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}\n$$\n\nThe subsequent characterization, which establishes the equivalence between Bernstein's inequalities and Bernstein-type spaces, is currently referred to as the real Paley-Wiener type theorems (see, e.g., [1, 3, 4]). This field has been the focus of extensive research by numerous scholars since the seminal contributions of Pesenson [43], Krein-Pesenson [30], Bang [5], and Tuan [55]. One of the primary reasons for this interest is that it can be universally extended to other Fourier-like transforms, whereas the complex Paley-Wiener approach cannot do so (cf. [56, 2, 47, 48]).\n\nIn the hypercomplex setting, Kou and Qian made the first successful attempt, documented in their seminal paper [28]. In particular, they showed that the lack of a generalization for the Phragm\u00e9n-Lindel\u00f6f theorem (cf. [10]) to hypercomplex variables did not prevent them from proving their result. Years later, Franklin, Hogan, and Larkin reformulated Kou and Qian's proofs in terms of Bernstein-type spaces in [20]. Recently, Li, Leng, and Fei provided a different approach to real Paley-Wiener spaces in [32].\n\nIn the papers [20, 32], the authors use a Clifford-type Fourier transform. This approach first appeared in the context of hypercomplex variables in the seminal paper by Brackx, De Schepper, and Sommen in the mid-2000s (see [13]). It is noteworthy that both papers unjustly overlooked the interplay between Bernstein-type spaces and Bernstein's inequalities. This paper can be seen as a comprehensive exploration of these concepts.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1.2 Synopsis \n\nThis paper addresses a hypercomplex version of the Paley-Wiener theorem within the framework developed by Li, McIntosh, and Qian [33], and McIntosh [38]. For a thorough review, see the book by Qian and Li [50]. Our approach also integrates the work of Andersen et al. $[1,2,3,4]$ and Pesenson et al. $[44,45,46,47,48,49]$.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we revise some preliminaries on Clifford algebras and Clifford-valued function spaces. In Section 3, we introduce the fundamental tools of our approach, including the concept of Dirac operators and generalized Hardy and Cauchy-type kernels. We also explain our choice of the Riesz-Hilbert transform and, consequently, the Dirac operator (Subsection 3.1). The two main components of our approach are the following: First, the introduction of the space-fractional Dirac operator\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}=e^{-\\frac{i \\pi \\theta}{2}}(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\theta}{2}\\right)+i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\theta}{2}\\right) \\mathcal{H}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}$ denotes the Riesz-Hilbert transform. This operator includes not only the Dirac operator $\\boldsymbol{D}$ (see (9)), but also the Riesz derivative $(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ (case $\\theta=0$ ) of order $\\alpha$ and skewness $\\theta$, with $0<\\alpha \\leq 1$ and $|1-\\theta|<\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$. This extends the pseudo-differential representation of the Dirac operator $\\boldsymbol{D}$ (see (3) in Subsection 3.1) as previously considered in the first author's paper [6]; secondly, the formulation of generalized Hardy and Bernstein spaces derived from the Clifford-valued solutions of the subsequent Cauchy problem $\\left(\\mathcal{C P}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n\nFollowing the introduction of a new class of Dirac-type operators, the subsequent step entails the development of a comprehensive array of novel techniques that have not been addressed by the monogenic theory of Hardy spaces (see [39]). This necessity arises primarily from the absence of a Cauchy integral type formula in the space-fractional setting. To address this critical gap, the generalized Hardy spaces $H_{\\alpha, \\beta}^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1} ; C \\ell_{0, n}\\right)$ and the underlying generalized Cauchy kernels $\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\alpha, n}^{ \\pm}$, have been defined and developed in Subsection 3.2 and Subsection 3.3, respectively.\n\nIn developing such framework, we have integrated ideas from the following three contemporary research areas:\n(I) On the theory of semigroups, the fractional Laplacian of order $\\alpha,-(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$, is the generator of the Feller semigroup\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\exp \\left(-t e^{\\frac{i \\pi \\gamma}{2}}(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\right)\\right\\}_{t \\geq 0}, \\text { whereby } 0<\\alpha \\leq 1 \\text { and }|\\gamma|<\\alpha\n$$\n\n(II) On the theory of probability, the so-called L\u00e8vy-Feller diffusion process is uniquely determined, for values of $0<\\alpha \\leq 1$, by the kernel function\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{K}_{\\alpha, n}(\\boldsymbol{x}, z)=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} e^{-z|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}|^{n}} e^{i|\\boldsymbol{x} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}|} \\boldsymbol{d} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\quad \\Re(z)>0\n$$\n\n(III) In the theory of singular integral operators, the Riesz-Hilbert transform $\\mathcal{H}$ permits us to consider, for every $\\boldsymbol{f} \\in L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n} ; C \\ell_{0, n}\\right)(1<p<\\infty)$, the functions $\\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}=$ $\\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{f} \\pm \\mathcal{H} \\boldsymbol{f})$ as the boundary values of Hardy type spaces in the upper and lower half spaces, $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ resp. $\\mathbb{R}_{-}^{n+1}$.\nWe refer to [19, Chapter IX] and [26, Chapter 4] for an overview of (I), to [9] and the references therein for an overview of (II), and to [39, 38, 50] for an overview of (III). The combination of (I), (II), and (III) in this paper provides a comprehensive framework for dealing with function spaces and distributions. This framework is not limited to power series representations of solutions to the Cauchy problem $\\left(\\mathcal{C P}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)$, which several authors have previously explored using the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension (cf. [15]).\n\nRemark 1 Although statement (III) holds in the borderline cases $p=1$ and $p=\\infty$ (cf. [14]), we will focus our analysis in this paper on the range $1<p<\\infty$ to avoid further technicalities related to arguments of weak boundedness in BMO type spaces (see [16] and the references therein for an overview). We plan to pursue these cases in a separate paper.\n\nIn Section 4, we will consider the generalization of Paley-Wiener theory to the hypercomplex setting, focusing on the solutions of the equation $\\left(\\mathcal{C P}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)$ that are generated from the one-parameter semigroup $\\left\\{e^{-x_{0} \\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}}\\right\\}_{x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}}$ of exponential type $R^{\\alpha}$. The central tenet underpinning our construction is the investigation of the growth behavior of the sequences of functions $\\left(\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}\\right)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$, which play the role of the sequence of functions $\\left(f^{(k)}\\right)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$ generated by the derivatives of $f$ in the one-dimensional setting. It is important to note that these two sequences of Clifford-valued functions are generated from the iterated powers of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}$ and the boundary values $\\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}$of the Hardy spaces, as mentioned in (III).\n\nIn real Paley-Wiener theory, one typically starts by choosing a real-valued bump function $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ such that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=1$ in $\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}$, so that each $\\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}$can be represented, in the distributional sense, as $\\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}=\\boldsymbol{\\psi} * \\boldsymbol{f}_{ \\pm}$. Such a fact is inherited from the framework considered by Andersen and Jeu in [3] and has been used to simplify parts of the proofs available in most of the literature, including the proofs on the seminal papers by Bang [5] and Tuan [55]. In our concrete case, this serves as a starting point, first in Section 4.1, Theorem 4, to reformulate Andersen's proof [2] on the Hankel transform for Clifford-valued functions which are $r$ adially symmetric, and later, in Subsection 4.2, to extend the Paley-Wiener framework presented by Pesenson-Zayed in [48] and by Pesenson in [49] to the hypercomplex setting.\n\nAlthough in the case of $r$ adially symmetric functions, the normalized Bessel functions of order $\\frac{n}{2}, \\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})=(R|\\boldsymbol{x}|)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} J_{\\frac{n}{2}}(R|\\boldsymbol{x}|)$, seem to be natural candidates for defining compactly supported functions on $\\overline{B(0, R)}$ satisfying $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=1$ in $\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}$ (cf. [26, p. 118]), it should be emphasized that the existence of $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ is topologically guaranteed by the so-called Uryshon's Lemma (see [34, Exercise 1.15]).\n\nThe main result of the paper is in Section 4.2, Theorem 5, where we prove a chain of Paley-Wiener equivalences, which in several papers are called real Paley-Wiener theorems.\n\nAs will be demonstrated in Section 5, the tools developed in Section 4 can be used for two purposes: first, to generalize the proof given by Kou and Qian in their paper [28] and to deepen the characterization of Bernstein spaces as presented in [20, Theorem 5.1] (see Theorem 6); Secondly, the tools developed herein can provide more precise information about $\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}$ (see Theorem 7).\n\nIn the final Section 6, we draw some conclusions and discuss open problems.\nRemark 2 In the case where $p=2$, the compactness constraints imposed throughout the paper are not required a priori due to the direct application of Plancherel's theorem (see, for example, [3, Theorem 3.5]). This observation is consistent with the proofs of the PaleyWiener theorem obtained in the works [28, 20], where the condition $\\operatorname{supp} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq \\overline{B(0, R)}$ was replaced by $\\operatorname{supp} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq B(0, R)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Preliminaries\n### 2.1 Clifford algebras\n\nLet $C \\ell_{0, n}$ be the universal Clifford algebra of signature $(0, n)$, generated by the basis $\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{e}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{e}_{n}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

Throughout the paper,\n\n$\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}$ will be referred to as the Dirac operator of Riesz-Feller type because of its several similarities to the one-dimensional Riesz-Feller derivative. For further details, we refer to the paper [37] by Mainardi-Luchko-Pagnini and the references therein.\n\nThe study of these operators and their variants, as infinitesimal generators of semigroups, goes back to the operator-theoretical approaches of Bochner [11] and Feller [18], connecting stable distributions with diffusion equations, and has been a source of many fundamental developments in the theory of Hardy spaces in a broad sense (cf. [57]). In addition to its similarity to the polar decomposition underlying complex numbers, it is noteworthy that the choice of $h_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ as the phase component of the Clifford vector $\\boldsymbol{z}=|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}|^{\\alpha} h_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ holds particular significance in the field of optics.\n\nThe definition of $h_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ by (14) is derived from the Fourier symbol of the Riesz-Hilbert transform $\\mathcal{H}$. This approach parallels the methodology used to derive the fractional Hilbert transform from the Hilbert transform (see [35, 36]). Furthermore, it extends the Fourier symbol of the fractional Hilbert transform in a coherent way, preserving its intrinsic properties $[7,24,8]$. This makes it particularly valuable for analyzing the local orientation, amplitude, and phase of wave functions, as it seamlessly integrates the influences of both near and far fields. The above aspects distinguish our work from much of the existing literature on fractional Dirac operators (see, e.g., [52, 40, 51]). In our study, the optical implementation of the fractional Hilbert transform was crucial and served as the fundamental basis for the pseudo-differential representation of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}$, provided by (15). We also emphasize that our methodology is in contrast to that proposed by Zayed in [58], where the fractional Fourier transform serves as the basis for constructing a fractional Hilbert transform. Furthermore, this technique is extended to the Riesz transform, allowing the derivation of fractional Riesz transforms; see, for example, [22].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 3.2 Generalized Hardy spaces $H_{\\alpha, \\beta}^{p}$ \n\nLet us now consider the Cauchy problem as follows:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\partial_{x_{0}} \\boldsymbol{u}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, x_{0}\\right)+\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{u}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, x_{0}\\right)=0 & , \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\quad, x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}, 0)=\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) & , \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\\n\\lim _{|x_{0}| \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\boldsymbol{u}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, x_{0}\\right)=0 & , \\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nTo study it from a Hardy space point of view, we need to define appropriate function spaces that capture the order and skewness parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$, of $\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}$ on the upper and lower half-spaces, $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ and $\\mathbb{R}_{-}^{n+1}$, of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

Then, the limit\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}\n$$\n\nexists, is finite and coincides with\n\n$$\nR(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}):=\\inf \\{\\sigma>0: \\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq \\overline{B(0, \\sigma)}\\}\n$$\n\nConversely, if $\\boldsymbol{u} \\in \\mathcal{S B}^{p}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)$ is such that $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\cdot, 0)=\\boldsymbol{f}$, and the limit (57) exists and is finite, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq \\overline{B(0, R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}))}\n$$\n\nProof: Starting from Lemma 4, the inequality (56) leads to\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}=\\left(\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\ell}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k \\ell}} \\leq\\left(C_{k, \\ell}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k \\ell}}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{\\frac{\\ell}{\\alpha k}}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}-\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\ell}}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\ell} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\ell}}\n$$\n\nThis implies that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\leq\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{\\frac{\\ell}{\\alpha k}}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\liminf _{\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\ell} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\ell}}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, if we take $\\limsup _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}$ on both sides of the above inequality, we get\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\leq \\liminf _{\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{\\ell} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\ell}}\n$$\n\nwhich shows that the limit (57) exists.\nNext, we prove that $R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})$, defined by (58), is an upper bound of the limit (57). To do this, we observe that, given the statement (B) of Theorem 5, one has the inequality\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\leq C^{\\frac{1}{k}} R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{\\frac{\\ell}{\\alpha k}}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}\n$$\n\nfor some $0<C<\\infty$.\nThen, by taking the limit $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ of both sides of the above inequality, we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\leq R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\n$$\n\nNow, to prove that the limit (57) coincides with (58), we assume by contradiction that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}<R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\n$$\n\nThen there exist $\\sigma>0$ and $M>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}<\\sigma<R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}}) \\quad \\& \\quad\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p} \\leq M \\sigma^{\\alpha k}\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\|_{p}\n$$\n\nSo by the statement (A) of the Theorem 5 we get $\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq \\overline{B(0, \\sigma)}$, which contradicts the definition (58) of $R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})$.\n\nConversely, let us assume that the limit (57) exists and is finite. This means that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}=\\liminf _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}\n$$\n\nThen there exists $R>0$ such that the Bernstein type inequality, which appears in statement (B) of Theorem 5, holds. Thus, according to statement (A) of Theorem 5, this is equivalent to saying that $\\operatorname{supp} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}} \\subseteq \\overline{B(0, R)}$.\nThen, from the definition (58) of $R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})$, it immediately follows that the inequality\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p} \\leq C\\left(R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\\right)^{\\alpha k}\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\|_{p}\n$$\n\nholds for every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}}{C^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}\\|\\boldsymbol{f}\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}}} \\leq R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\n$$\n\nFurthermore, by allowing $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ on both sides of the above inequality, we get\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)^{k} \\boldsymbol{f}\\right\\|_{p}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha k}} \\leq R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})\n$$\n\nFinally, the proof that the left side of the above inequality is indeed equal to $R(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{f}})$ is obtained by applying the contradiction argument outlined previously.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 6 Some Outlook \n\nThe foundations of a Paley-Wiener theory have been developed, and this theory accurately describes Clifford-valued functions of exponential type $R^{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{u}$, from the knowledge of the support of the Fourier transform of $\\boldsymbol{f}=\\boldsymbol{u}(\\cdot, 0)$, and vice versa. In particular, the spectral formula for the maximum radius $R$, provided by the Theorem 7 , allows for an explicit calculation of the so-called bandwidth of the generalized Bernstein space $\\mathcal{S B}_{R}^{p}\\left(\\boldsymbol{D}_{\\theta}^{\\alpha}\\right)$.\n\nThe predominant comprehension of generalized Bernstein spaces indicates the possibility for a hypercomplex extension of the Whittaker-Shannon sampling theorem, analogous to the one outlined in [29]. However, further investigation is necessary to develop numerical implementations of sampling reconstruction schemes. This investigation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, which is beyond the scope of the present paper. The authors intend to explore these topics in a future publication.\n\nIn a different direction, it would be worthwhile to consider the potential applications of our results for values of $0<p \\leq 1$ and $p=\\infty$. While many steps in our proofs appear to necessitate only minor alterations, as evidenced by the results obtained in [14], this approach is contingent on intricate properties involving duality theorems between Hardy-type spaces $H^{1}$ and $B M O$-type spaces, as well as, more generally, between Hardytype spaces $H^{p}$ and Morrey-Campanato type spaces (see, for example, [16, 57] for a comprehensive overview).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# Acknowledgements \n\nN.
