InTRODUCTION\n\n1.1. Backgrounds. In 1986, Buchweitz introduced a quotient category of an associative algebra $A$, which is called singularity category of $A$ now [5]. The singularity category $D_{s g}(A)$ is defined as the Verdier quotient $D^{b}(A) / \\operatorname{Perf}(A)$, where $\\operatorname{Perf}(A)$ is the full subcategory consisting of perfect complexes in the derived category $D^{b}(A)$ of $A$. Hence, $D_{s g}(A)$ measures the smoothness of $A$ in the sense that $A$ is homologically smooth if and only if $D_{s g}(A)$ is trivial. In that note, Buchweitz showed that $D_{s g}(A)$ is equivalent to the stable category $\\underline{\\mathrm{CM}}(A)$ of Cohen-Macaulay $A$-modules as triangulated categories when $A$ is Gorenstein. Later Orlov rediscovered the singularity category via the perspectives of algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. Also he recover its deep relationship with Homological Mirror Symmetry [21]. Therefore singularity categories attract the interest of many mathematicians and there are many significant progress about singularity categories in various fields, such as tilting theory ( $[13,23,6]$ etc.), homological algebra ( $[5,8,17,26,27]$ ), algebraic geometry ( $[28,15,3]$ etc.) and even in knot theory ( $[14]$ ).\n\nSingularity categories are triangulated categories. We know invariants under triangulated equivalence play an important role in the research of triangulated categories. For example, the Hochschild (co)homology of an associative algebra are both invariant under the derived Morita equivalence. Moreover, Armenta and Keller [1] showed that the differential calculus (consisting of Hochschild homology and cohomology endowed with several actions) of an associative algebra is invariant under the derived Morita equivalence. For singularity categories, Wang showed that the Gerstenhaber bracket structure on the Tate-Hochschild cohomology is invariant under the singular equivalence of Morita type with level (see [27]).\n\nIn noncommutative algebraic geometry, invariants from geometry are also important and interesting. Bondal and Orlov [4] showed that for a projective variety $X$\n\nwith ample or anti-ample canonical bundle, its bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $D^{b}(X)$ recovers $X$. Recently, Hua and Keller [11] showed the coordinate ring of a hypersurface with issolated singularity can be constructred via it singularity category. The authors prove the result by using an isomorphism between the zeroth Tate-Hochschild cohomology and the Tyurina algebra of the hypersurface.\n1.2. Main result. In [22], Orlov proved that the completion of a variety along its singular locus determines its singularity category, up to the idempotent completion of a triangulated category. Hence there is a natural question: is it true that the singularity category of a commutative ring determines its singular locus? In this paper, We give an confirm answer of this question up to some extent.\n\nFor a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R, D_{s g}(R)$ is not enough to detect the geometry generally. The result in [10] motivates us to consider some DG enhancement of $D_{s g}(R)$. The singularity category $D_{s g}(R)$ admits a canonical DG enhancement given by the DG quotient $S_{d g}(R):=\\mathcal{D}^{b}(R) / \\mathcal{P} \\operatorname{erf}(R)$ ([10, \u00a73]), where $\\mathcal{D}^{b}(R)$ is the canonical DG enhancement of $D^{b}(R)$, which then induces a DG enhancement $\\operatorname{Perf}(R)$ of $\\operatorname{Perf}(R)$. Our main result is the following.\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let $R$ be a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring. Let $S_{d g}(R)$ be the $D G$ category described as above. Then there is an affine scheme $X$ constructed solely from $S_{d g}(R)$, and a finite surjective morphism $X \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)$, where $\\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)$ is the singular locus in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$.\n\nIn the above theorem, the singular locus is given as follows. Let $X$ be a scheme over $k$, then the singular locus of $X$ is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Sing}(X):=\\left\\{\\mathbf{p} \\in X \\mid X_{\\mathbf{p}} \\text { is singular }\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $X_{\\mathbf{p}}$ is the localization of $X$ at point $\\mathbf{p}$. Note that the scheme structure of $\\operatorname{Sing}(X)$ is induced from $X$. When $X$ is an affine scheme, i.e. $X \\cong \\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ for some commutative Noetherian ring $R$, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Sing}(X) \\cong \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)\n$$\n\nas scheme, where $I=\\bigcap_{\\substack{\\mathbf{p} \\subset R \\\\ R_{\\mathbf{p}} \\text { is not regular }}}$ p. Note that $I \\cong \\sqrt{I}$ as ideal of $R$ and then $\\operatorname{Sing}(X)$ is reduced in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$.\n1.3. Idea of the proof. To prove the theorem, there are 3 steps as follows\n(1) First, for any commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring, we show that the coordinate ring of its singular locus is a subring of its zeroth Tate-Hochschild cohomology.\n\n(2) Second, we continue to show that the reduced zeroth Tate-Hochschild cohomology is a finitely generated module over the coordinate ring of its singular locus.\n(3) At last, we construct a scheme $X$ with a morphism $X \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)$, and prove the Theorem 1.1.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the notions and some properties of DG categories, DG singularity categories and DG singular equivalences. In Section 3, we prove the statements in the steps (1) and (2) above. In Section 4, we give the proof of the statement in step (3), and get the main result.\n1.4. Notation and conventions. Throughout this paper, $k$ is a field with characteristic zero. In addition, commutative Noetherian rings are assumed to be finitely generated over $k$ with finite Krull dimensions. Unless specified, an associative algebra $A$ is a unital over $k$. We denote by $\\bmod (A)$ the category of finitely generated right $A$-modules and by $\\operatorname{proj}(A)$ the full subcategory of $\\bmod (A)$ consisting of finitely generated projective $A$-modules. Recall that $D^{b}(A)$ is the bounded derived category of $\\bmod (A)$, and $\\operatorname{Perf}(A)$ is the bounded homotopy category of complexes of $\\operatorname{proj}(A)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2.

On the other hand, it is well-known that both $D^{b}(A)$ and $\\operatorname{Perf}(A)$ are DG categories.

But, in general, singular equivalence cannot be lifted to DG singular equivalence. However, we have the following proposition for some special cases.\n\nProposition 3.4 ([9, Proposition 3.1]).

Hochschild cohomology of DG singularity category. In this subsection, we give proofs of the statements in steps (1) and (2) in $\\S 1.3$.\n\nOur goal is to construct a multiplication on $\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$. First, we know that the composition of elements in the endomorphism ring $F^{*}=\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), \\operatorname{Bar}(R))$ is a natural multiplication. Second, the following map\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE^{*} \\otimes E^{*} & \\cong\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right)\\right) \\otimes\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\cong \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}}\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) \\otimes \\operatorname{Bar}(R)\\right) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text { inval }}{ } \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} R^{e} \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) \\\\\n& \\cong \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right)=E^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ninduced by involution, gives a natural multiplication structure on $E^{*}$. Finally, there is a canonical $\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), \\operatorname{Bar}(R))\\right)^{\\mathrm{e}}$-module structure on $\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, viewing Cone $\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$ as a semi-product $E^{*} \\rtimes F^{*}$, we obtain a natural multiplication on $\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$.\n\nNext, recall that the canonical morphism $E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}$ is given by the following composition map:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) & \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(R^{e}, \\operatorname{Bar}(R)\\right) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) \\\\\n& \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), \\operatorname{Bar}(R))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis morphism together with differentials on $F^{*}$ and $E^{*}$ gives the natural differential on $\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$. It is easy to check that the differential is compatible with the multiplication on $\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)$ is a differential graded algebra.\n\nIn the following, we recall the support scheme of object in $D(R)$ and the diagonal support scheme of $S_{s g}(R)$.\n\nDefinition 3.10.

Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring. Let $R / I$ be the coordinate ring of the singular locus in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. Then there is an algebraic injection\n\n$$\n\\iota_{I}: R / I \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is the quotient ring of $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)$ by its nilpotent ideal.\nProof. First, there is a canonical DG algebraic homomorphism\n\n$$\nF^{*} \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich induces the following algebraic homomorphism\n\n$$\n\\pi_{R}: R \\cong \\mathrm{HH}^{0}(R) \\cong \\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(F^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)\n$$\n\nSecond, the composition of algebraic homomorphisms:\n\n$$\n\\iota_{R}: R \\xrightarrow{\\pi_{R}} \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R) \\nrightarrow \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\n$$\n\ngives the canonical $R$-module structure on $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$.\nObviously $\\iota_{R}$ induces an algebraic injection $R / I \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ when $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\iota_{R}\\right) \\cong I$ as ideals of $R$. Now, we view $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ as a sheaf on $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$. To prove the\n\nproposition, it suffices to show that the support scheme of $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is $V(I) \\subseteq$ $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ since $V\\left(\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\iota_{R}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Supp}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right)$.\n\nThus, it is enough to show that the diagonal support scheme $\\operatorname{DSupp}\\left(S_{d g}(R)\\right)$ is exactly $V(I)$. In fact, the support scheme $\\operatorname{Supp}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ is $\\operatorname{Supp}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)\\right)$. Moreover, $\\operatorname{Supp}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)\\right)$ is also $\\operatorname{DSupp}\\left(S_{d g}(R)\\right)$ by definitions, since the $R$-module structure on $\\bigoplus_{i} \\operatorname{Hom}_{D_{r g}\\left(R^{c}\\right)}(R, R[i])$ is given by the composition of $\\pi_{R}$ and the natural injection $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R) \\hookrightarrow \\bigoplus_{i} \\operatorname{Hom}_{D_{r g}\\left(R^{c}\\right)}(R, R[i])$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{p}$ be an element in $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$.

From the isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\left(\\operatorname{Hom}_{S_{d g}\\left(R^{c}\\right)}(R, R)\\right)_{\\mathbf{q}} \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{S_{d g}\\left(R_{\\mathbf{q}}^{c}\\right)}\\left(R_{\\mathbf{q}}, R_{\\mathbf{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nas algebras in the above argument, we know that $\\mathbf{q}$ is contained in $\\operatorname{DSupp}\\left(S_{d g}(R)\\right)$, which suggests that\n\n$$\nV(I) \\subseteq \\operatorname{DSupp}\\left(S_{d g}(R)\\right)\n$$\n\nThen we obtain $V(I)=\\operatorname{DSupp}\\left(S_{d g}(R)\\right)$, which means that the diagonal support scheme of $\\operatorname{Hom}_{S_{d g}\\left(R^{c}\\right)}(R, R)$ is $V(I)$. Thus, we complete the proof.\n\nVia the algebra homomorphism $\\iota_{I}, \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ can be viewed as an $R / I$-module.\nLemma 3.12. With the above setting, $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is a finitely generated $R / I$-module.\n\nProof. First, by Proposition 3.9, we have $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)=\\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)\\right)$.\nSecond, $R^{e}$ is also a Gorenstein Noetherian algebra, since $R$ is a Gorenstein Noetherian algebra. Hence, $R^{e}$ admits a bounded injective $R^{e}$-module resolution, denoted by $J^{*}$. There exist two quasi-isomorphisms\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), J^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right)\n$$\n\nvia the injective resolution $R^{e} \\hookrightarrow J^{*}$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(R, J^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), J^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nvia the Bar resolution $\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\nrightarrow R$. Due to the boundedness of $J^{*}$, there are only finite parts of the complex $\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(R, J^{*}\\right)$ have nontrivial cohomologies.\n\nMeanwhile, $\\forall i \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\operatorname{Hom}_{K\\left(R^{e}\\right)}\\left(P_{R}^{*}, R^{e}[i]\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{D\\left(R^{e}\\right)}\\left(R, R^{e}[i]\\right)$ for any finitely generated projective resolution $P_{R}^{*}$ of $R$ as $R^{e}$-modules, where $K\\left(R^{e}\\right)$ is the homotopy category of complexes of $R^{e}$-modules. Hence we have that for any $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\operatorname{Hom}_{D\\left(R^{e}\\right)}\\left(R, R^{e}[i]\\right)$ is a finitely generated $R^{e}$-module.\n\nBy [12, Proposition 3.5], we find that $\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), J^{*}\\right)$ is quasi-isomorphic to a complex of finitely generated bounded $R^{e}$-modules. Thus, $\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), J^{*}\\right)$ admits a finitely generated projective $R^{e}$-module resolution, denoted by $P_{J^{*}}^{*}$. It suggests that there are quasi-isomorphisms\n$\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{*} \\xrightarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(R, J^{*}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), J^{*}\\right)$ $\\xrightarrow{\\sim} \\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} \\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_{R^{e}}\\left(\\operatorname{Bar}(R), R^{e}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} E^{*}$.\n\nMoreover, there is a quasi-isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Bar}(R) \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{*} \\xrightarrow{\\sim} R \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{*}\n$$\n\nThus, we have\n\n$$\nR \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{*} \\xrightarrow{\\sim} E^{*}\n$$\n\nin $D(k)$. Meanwhile, we know that $P_{J^{*}}^{j}$ is a finitely generated projective $R^{e}$-module for any $j$. Thus, $R \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{j}$ is a finitely generated $R$-module for any $j$. Since $R \\otimes_{R^{e}} P_{J^{*}}^{*}$ is a finitely generated $R$-module complex, the cohomologies of $E^{*}$ are all finitely generated $R$-modules.\n\nFrom the distinguished triangle\n\n$$\nF^{*} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow E^{*}[1]\n$$\n\nwe have the long exact sequence\n\n$$\n\\cdots \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(E^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(F^{*}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_{R}} \\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^{1}\\left(E^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(F^{*}\\right) \\cong \\mathrm{HH}^{0}(R) \\cong R$ and $\\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(\\operatorname{Cone}\\left(E^{*} \\rightarrow F^{*}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)$. Since both $\\mathrm{H}^{0}\\left(F^{*}\\right)$ and $\\mathrm{H}^{1}\\left(E^{*}\\right)$ are finitely generated $R$-modules, we find that $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)$ is also\n\na finitely generated $R$-module from the long exact sequence. Thus, $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is a finitely generated $R$-module\n\nSince $\\iota_{R}$ factors through the algebraic homomorphism $\\iota_{I}: R / I \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ (see Proposition 3.11), we obtain that $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is a finitely generated $R / I$-module.

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. Proof of the main Result \n\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Keep the settings in Proposition 3.11 and Lemma 3.12. Since the algebraic homomorphism $\\iota_{I}$ gives the $R / I$-module structure on $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$, the image of $\\iota_{I}$ is contained in the center $Z\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right)$ of $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$. Note that $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{\\bullet}(R)$ is a Gerstenhaber algebra, hence $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)$ is a commutative subalgebra of $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{\\bullet}(R)$ endowed with the cup product [26]. Therefore, $Z\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right)=\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$. Now, we have a homomorphism between commutative rings\n\n$$\n\\iota_{I}: R / I \\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 3.12, it is clear that $\\iota_{I}$ is a finite morphism between commutative rings, i.e., $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is a finitely generated $R / I$-module. Hence, $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$ is also a Noetherian ring. Moreover, by Proposition 3.11, $\\iota_{I}$ is also a finite injection. Combining above arguments, it follows that there exists a surjective morphism between schemes:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\iota_{I}\\right)_{\\natural}: \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec}(R / I)\n$$\n\ngiven by $\\iota_{I}$. Furthermore, $\\left(\\iota_{I}\\right)_{\\natural}$ is also a finite morphism between schemes by the finiteness property of $\\iota_{I}$. Then we complete the proof.\n\nFrom the above theorem, we obtain the following.\nCorollary 4.1. Let $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ be two commutative Gorenstein Noetherian rings. Suppose that there is a DG singular equivalence\n\n$$\nF: S_{d g}\\left(R_{1}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} S_{d g}\\left(R_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen the two singular loci in the affine schemes of these two rings have the same dimension.\n\nProof. Again keep the settings in Proposition 3.11 and Lemma 3.12. Since $\\left(\\iota_{I}\\right)_{\\natural}$ is a finite morphism between schemes, $\\left(\\iota_{I}\\right)_{\\natural}$ has finite fibers, i.e., any one of its fibers has finite points. It implies that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}(\\operatorname{Spec}(R / I))=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nsince $\\left(\\iota_{I}\\right)_{\\natural}$ is surjective. Thus the dimension of singular locous of $\\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is equal to the Krull dimension of $\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}(R)_{\\text {red }}$.\n\nIn the meantime, there is a quasi-equivalence\n\n$$\nF: S_{d g}\\left(R_{1}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\sim} S_{d g}\\left(R_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus by Theorem 3.6, their Hochschild cohomologies are isomorphic. It implies that\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}\\left(R_{1}\\right)_{\\text {red }} \\cong \\mathrm{HH}_{s g}^{0}\\left(R_{2}\\right)_{\\text {red }}\n$$\n\nas algebras. Therefore, the two singular loci in these two schemes of $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ respectively, have the same dimension.\n\nBy Proposition 3.4, any singularity equivalence of Morita type gives a DG singularity equivalence, and thus we get the following.\n\nCorollary 4.2. Let $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ be two commutative Gorenstein Noetherian rings. Suppose that there is a singular equivalence of Morita type\n\n$$\n\\Phi: D_{s g}\\left(R_{1}\\right) \\xrightarrow{(-) \\otimes_{R_{1}} M} D_{s g}\\left(R_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some $R_{2} \\otimes R_{1}^{\\text {op }}$-module $M$. Then the two singular loci in the affine schemes of these two rings have the same dimension.\n\nAcknowledgements.
