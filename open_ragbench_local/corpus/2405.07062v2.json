One of our main tools in this paper is from self-similar higher rank graphs and their $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1. InTRODUCTION\n\nA self-similar higher rank graph $(G, \\Lambda)$ is a pair, which consists of a group $G$ and a higher rank graph $\\Lambda$ such that $G$ acts on $\\Lambda$ from the left and $\\Lambda$ 'acts' on $G$ from the right, where these two actions are compatible in an appropriate way. After [21, 35, 44], self-similar higher rank graphs and their $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda}$ have been systematically studied in [39, 40, 41]. In particular, in [39], when $\\Lambda$ is strongly connected, we find a canonical Cartan subalgebra of $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda}$ en route to the study of the KMS states of $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda}$. However, to achieve this, $\\Lambda$ is required to be locally faithful. The local faithfulness is a key property to obtain the main results in [39]. Roughly speaking, it guarantees that one could define a periodicity group in a way very similar to higher rank graphs in [15, 16, 26]. It turns out that the local faithfulness condition blocks a lot of interesting examples. This provides our starting point of this paper - to explore non-locally faithful self-similar higher rank graphs and their $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$ algebras. During the exploration, we find that a particular non-locally faithful class is closely related to Baumslag-Solitar (BS) semigroups. Due to the higher rank feature, we call such self-similar higher rank graphs higher rank BS semigroups. One extreme case of higher rank BS semigroups is about products of odometers ([38]), while the other extreme case is surprisingly related to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture.\n\nWith semigroups mentioned, there is no surprise that $\\Lambda$ is assumed to be single-vertex in this paper. Taking rank 1 (i.e., classical) BS semigroups into consideration, we also consider $G=\\mathbb{Z}$ only. For single-vertex higher rank graphs, they have been systematically studied in the literature. To name just a few, see, for instance, [14]-[17], [52, 53]. Those graphs seem very special, but exhibit a lot of interesting properties. Surprisingly, they are also shown to interact intimately with the Yang-Baxter equation ([55]). For BS semigroups, they have\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L05; 46L10, 20M30.\n    Key words and phrases.

See $[7,11,25,36,50]$ and the references therein. Those semigroups provide, on one hand, a class of nice examples for some properties $[11,36,50]$, and on the other hand, some counter-examples for other properties $[7,25]$. Our main purpose in this paper is to mingle single-vertex higher rank graphs and BS semigroups.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, some necessary preliminaries are provided. Although most of them are known, Subsection 2.4 is new, where we introduce a notion of semigroups from self-similar actions. Those semigroups are different from self-similar semigroups/monoids in [3] and the references therein (Remark 2.10). Since the rank 1 case is studied in a more general setting, we focus on this case in Section 3. Even in this case, it includes generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) semigroups, and BS semigroups as well, as examples. We study the periodicity of the associated self-similar graph, and obtain a canonical Cartan subalgebra of its $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra (Propositions 3.22 and 3.23). The simplicity of the $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra is characterized in terms of the relation between the number of edges and the restriction map; and when it is Kirchberg is also described (Theorem 3.20). We turn to higher rank cases in Section 4. We first propose a notion of higher rank BS semigroups (Definition 4.2). We briefly discuss how higher rank BS semigroups are related to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture in Subsection 4.2. We then focus on two extreme classes. The first extreme class is about products of odometers studied in [38]; but here, we investigate the associated von Neumann algebra: Its factoriality is characterized and its type is also determined (Theorem 4.13). The second extreme class seems trivial at first sight, but turns out to be intriguing. We exhibit a canonical Cartan in this case, which is generally a proper subalgebra of the cycline algebra (Theorem 4.22). We close with computing the spectrum of the fixed point algebra of its gauge action. We hope that we could push Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture further in this vein in our future studies.\n\nNotation and Conventions.

For $1 \\leq \\mathrm{k} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}:=(1, \\ldots, 1) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$.\n\nWe use the multi-index notation: For $\\mathbf{q}=\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ with all $p_{i} \\neq 0$, let $\\mathbf{p}^{\\mathbf{q}}:=\\prod_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{k}} p_{i}^{q_{i}}$.\n\nFor convenience, sometimes we also let $\\mathbb{Z}=\\langle a\\rangle$, which is written multiplicatively.\nAs with most literatures in Operator Algebras, all semigroups in this paper are assumed to be monoids, unless otherwise specified.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Preliminaries \n\n2.1. Single-vertex rank k graphs. A countable small category $\\Lambda$ is called a rank k graph (or k-graph) if there exists a functor $d: \\Lambda \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ satisfying the following unique factorization property: For $\\mu \\in \\Lambda, \\mathbf{n}, \\mathbf{m} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{k}$ with $d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{n}+\\mathbf{m}$, there exist unique $\\beta \\in d^{-1}(\\mathbf{n})$ and $\\alpha \\in d^{-1}(\\mathbf{m})$ such that $\\mu=\\beta \\alpha$. A functor $f: \\Lambda_{1} \\rightarrow \\Lambda_{2}$ is called a graph morphism if $d_{2} \\circ f=d_{1}$.\n\nLet $\\Lambda$ be a k-graph and $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{k}$. Set $\\Lambda^{\\mathbf{n}}:=d^{-1}(\\mathbf{n})$. For $\\mu \\in \\Lambda$, we write $s(\\mu)$ and $r(\\mu)$ for the source and range of $\\mu$, respectively. Then $\\Lambda$ is said to be row-finite if $\\left|v \\Lambda^{\\mathbf{n}}\\right|<\\infty$ for all $v \\in \\Lambda^{0}$ and $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$; and source-free if $v \\Lambda^{\\mathbf{n}} \\neq \\varnothing$ for all $v \\in \\Lambda^{0}$ and $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$. For more information about k-graphs, refer to [33]. In this paper, all k-graphs are assumed to be rowfinite and source-free. Actually, we focus on a special class of rank k graphs - single-vertex rank k graphs.\n\nSingle-vertex k-graphs, at first sight, seem to be a very special class of k-graphs. It turns out that they are a rather intriguing class to study. They have been systematically studied in the literature, e.g., $[14,15,16,17]$. There are close connections with the well-known Yang-Baxter equation [55].\n\nLet $\\left\\{\\epsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right\\}$ be the standard basis of $\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$, and $\\Lambda$ be a single-vertex rank k graph. For $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, write $\\Lambda^{\\epsilon_{i}}:=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}: \\mathfrak{s} \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]\\right\\}$, where $n_{i}=\\left|\\Lambda^{\\epsilon_{i}}\\right|$. It follows from the factorization property of $\\Lambda$ that, for $1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, there is a permutation $\\theta_{i j} \\in S_{n_{i} \\times n_{j}}$ satisfying the following $\\theta$-commutation relations\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i} \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{t}}^{j}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{t}^{\\prime}}^{j} \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}}^{i} \\quad \\text { if } \\quad \\theta_{i j}(\\mathfrak{s}, \\mathfrak{t})=\\left(\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}, \\mathfrak{t}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo emphasize $\\theta$-commutation relations involved, this single-vertex k -graph $\\Lambda$ is denoted as $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ in this paper. So $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ is the following (unital) semigroup\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\theta}=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}: \\mathfrak{s} \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right], 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k} ; \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i} \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{t}}^{j}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{t}^{\\prime}}^{j} \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}}^{i} \\text { whenever } \\theta_{i j}(\\mathfrak{s}, \\mathfrak{t})=\\left(\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}, \\mathfrak{t}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\rangle^{+}\n$$\n\nwhich is also occasionally written as\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\theta}=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}: \\mathfrak{s} \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right], 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k} ; \\theta_{i j}, 1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\rangle^{+}\n$$\n\nOne should notice that $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ has the cancellation property due to the unique factorization property. It follows from the $\\theta$-commutation relations that every element $w \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$ has the normal form $w=\\mathbf{x}_{u_{1}}^{1} \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_{u_{\\mathrm{k}}}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ for some $\\mathbf{x}_{u_{i}}^{i} \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}^{\\epsilon_{i} \\mathrm{~N}}(1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k})$. Here we use the multi-index notation: $\\mathbf{x}_{u_{i}}^{i}=\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}_{1}}^{i} \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}_{n}}^{i}$ if $u_{i}=\\mathfrak{s}_{1} \\cdots \\mathfrak{s}_{n}$ with all $\\mathfrak{s}_{i}$ 's in $\\left[n_{i}\\right]$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{k}=2$, every permutation $\\theta \\in S_{n_{1} \\times n_{2}}$ determines a single-vertex rank 2 graph. But for $\\mathrm{k} \\geq 3, \\theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{i j}: 1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ determines a rank k graph if and only if it satisfies a cubic condition (see, e.g., $[16,22]$ for its definition). This cubic condition exactly provides interplay between k-graphs and the Yang-Baxer equation ([55]).\n\nHere are some examples of single-vertex k-graphs which will be used later.\nExample 2.1. (Trivial permutation) For $1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, let $\\theta_{i j}$ be the trivial permutation: $\\theta_{i j}(s, t)=(s, t)$ for all $s \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]$ and $t \\in\\left[n_{j}\\right]$. Then clearly $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ is a k-graph for all $\\mathrm{k} \\geq 1$, which is written as $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{id}}$.\n\nExample 2.2. (Division permutation) Let $\\theta_{i j}$ be defined by $\\theta_{i j}(s, t)=\\left(s^{\\prime}, t^{\\prime}\\right)$, where $s^{\\prime} \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]$ and $t^{\\prime} \\in\\left[n_{j}\\right]$ are the unique integers such that $s+t n_{i}=t^{\\prime}+s^{\\prime} n_{j}$. One can check that this determines a k-graph for any $\\mathrm{k} \\geq 1$ (see, e.g., [38]), denoted as $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nIn particular, if $n_{i}=n$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, then $\\theta$ coincides with the flip commutation relation: $\\theta_{i j}(s, t)=(t, s)$.\nExample 2.3. (\"Trivial\" case) Let $n_{i}=1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. Then $\\theta_{i j}$ has to be the trivial commutation relation, which is the same as the division commutation relation. This is a special case of both Examples 2.1 and 2.2.\n\nVery surprisingly, this case is not trivial at all when it is equipped with self-similar actions! It is extremely interesting and related to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture. See Section 4.2 below.\n2.2. Self-similar single-vertex k-graph $\\mathbf{C}^{*}$-algebras. To unify the treatments of $[30,31]$ and $[44,46]$, self-similar graphs and their $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras naturally arise in [21] and are well studied there. Later, they are generalized to higher rank cases in [40], and are further studied in $[39,41]$.\n\nSince this paper mainly focuses on single-vertex k-graphs, we adapt the notions of $[39,40]$ to our setting and simplify them accordingly.\n\nLet $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ be a single-vertex k-graph. A bijection $\\pi: \\Lambda_{\\theta} \\rightarrow \\Lambda_{\\theta}$ is called an automorphism of $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ if $\\pi$ preserves the degree map $d .{ }^{1}$ Denote by $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ the automorphism group of $\\Lambda$.\n\nLet $G$ be a (discrete countable) group. We say that $G$ acts on $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ if there is a group homomorphism $\\varphi$ from $G$ to $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$. For $g \\in G$ and $\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$, we often simply write $\\varphi_{g}(\\mu)$ as $g \\cdot \\mu$.\n\nDefinition 2.4 ([39, Definition 3.2]). Let $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ be a single-vertex k-graph, $G$ be a group acting on $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$, and $G \\times \\Lambda_{\\theta} \\rightarrow G,(g, \\mu) \\mapsto g \\rrbracket_{\\mu}$ be a given map. Then we call $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ a self-similar k-graph if the following properties hold true:\n(i) $g \\cdot(\\mu \\nu)=(g \\cdot \\mu)\\left(\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu\\right)$ for all $g \\in G, \\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$;\n(ii) $\\left.g\\right|_{v}=g$ for all $g \\in G, v \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}^{0}$;\n(iii) $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu \\nu}=\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu} \\rrbracket_{\\nu}$ for all $g \\in G, \\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$;\n(iv) $\\left.1_{G}\\right|_{\\mu}=1_{G}$ for all $\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$;\n(v) $\\left.(g h)\\right|_{\\mu}=\\left.g\\right|_{h \\cdot \\mu} h \\rrbracket_{\\mu}$ for all $g, h \\in G, \\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$.\n\nIn this case, we also say that $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ is a self-similar k-graph over $G$, and that $G$ acts on $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$ self-similarly.\n\nDefinition 2.5. A self-similar k-graph $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ is said to be pseudo-free if $g \\cdot \\mu=\\mu$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}=1_{G}$ implies $g=1_{G}$ for all $g \\in G$ and $\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$.\n\nDefinition 2.6 ([39, Definition 3.8]). Let $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ be a self-similar k-graph. The self-similar k-graph $C^{*}$-algebra $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$ is defined to be the universal unital $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra generated by a family of unitaries $\\left\\{u_{g}\\right\\}_{g \\in G}$ and a family of isometries $\\left\\{s_{\\mu}: \\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right\\}$ satisfying\n(i) $u_{g h}=u_{g} u_{h}$ for all $g, h \\in G$;\n(ii) $s_{\\mu} s_{\\nu}=s_{\\mu \\nu}$ for all $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$;\n(iii) $\\sum_{\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}^{0}} s_{\\mu} s_{\\mu}^{*}=I$ for all $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$;\n(iv) $u_{g} s_{\\mu}=s_{g \\cdot \\mu} u_{g \\rrbracket_{\\mu}}$ for all $g \\in G$ and $\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}$.\n\nLet us record the following result ([40, Propositions 3.12 and 5.10]), which will be used later without mentioning.\n\nProposition 2.7. Let $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ be a self-similar k-graph. Then\n(i) the linear span of $\\left\\{s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}: \\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}, g \\in G\\right\\}$ is a dense $*$-subalgebra of $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$;\n(ii) The k-graph $C^{*}$-algebra $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\theta}}$ naturally embeds into $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$;\n(iii) $G$ and $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G)$ embed into $\\mathcal{O}_{G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$, provided that $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ is pseudo-free and $G$ is amenable.\n\nAs in [40], let $\\gamma$ be the gauge action of $\\mathbb{T}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ on $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathbf{t}}\\left(s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}\\right)=\\mathbf{t}^{d(\\mu)-d(\\nu)} s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}, g \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbf{t} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{\\mathrm{k}}$. The fixed point algebra, $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}^{\\gamma}$, of $\\gamma$ is generated by the standard generators $s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}$ with $d(\\mu)=d(\\nu)$. We often write $\\mathcal{F}$ to stand for $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}^{\\gamma}$.

Also $\\Phi_{0}$ is a faithful conditional expectation from $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$ onto $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}^{\\gamma}$.\n\nWe end this subsection by briefly recalling the periodicity of $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$. Let $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ be a selfsimilar k-graph. For $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}, g \\in G$, the triple $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$ is called cycline if $\\mu(g \\cdot x)=\\nu x$ for all $x \\in s(\\nu) \\Lambda^{\\infty}$. Clearly, every triple $\\left(\\mu, 1_{G}, \\mu\\right)(\\mu \\in \\Lambda)$ is cycline. Those cycline triples are said to be trivial. An infinite path $x \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}^{\\infty}$ is said to be $G$-aperiodic if, for $g \\in G, \\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbf{k}}$ with $g \\neq 1_{G}$ or $\\mathbf{p} \\neq \\mathbf{q}$, we have $\\sigma^{\\mathbf{p}}(x) \\neq g \\cdot \\sigma^{\\mathbf{q}}(x)$; otherwise, $x$ is called $G$-periodic. $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ is said to be aperiodic if there exists a $G$-aperiodic path $x \\in \\Lambda_{\\theta}^{\\infty}$; and periodic otherwise.\nTheorem 2.8 (Li-Yang [39]). $\\left(G, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ is aperiodic $\\Longleftrightarrow$ all cycline triples are trivial.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.3. Right LCM semigroup $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras and their boundary quotient $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras. \n\nLet us recall some basics about right LCM semigroups and their $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras from [6].

Thus\n\n$$\nn=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\kappa} n_{i} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{1}=\\bigsqcup_{i=1}^{\\kappa} \\mathcal{E}_{i}\n$$\n\nFor $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$, let\n\n$$\nm_{i}:=\\sum_{s \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]}\\left.a\\right|_{e_{s}^{i}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad m:=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\kappa} m_{i}\n$$\n\nClearly the self-similar action of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ induces a self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq$ $\\kappa$. Conversely, if there is a self-similar action $\\mathbb{Z}$ on each $\\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}$, then these $\\kappa$ self-similar graphs $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ determine a self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$.\n\nSo, in the rank 1 case, one can rewrite\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}:=\\left\\langle a, e \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{1}: a e=\\left.a \\cdot e a\\right|_{e} \\quad \\text { if } a\\right|_{e} \\geq 0\\right\\rangle^{+}\n$$\n\nBefore going further, we should mention that [44] also deals with the rank 1 case. But there, in terms of our terminology, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}$ on the infinite path space $\\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ is assumed to be faithful. This in particular implies that the self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is aperiodic. Thus this eliminates all interesting (periodic) self-similar graphs (cf. Propositions 3.18, 3.22, 3.23, and Theorem 3.20 below).\n\nThroughout this section, we assume that\n\n$$\nm_{i} \\neq 0 \\text { for all } 1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa\n$$\n\nThis condition assures that the self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is pseudo-free (Lemma 3.11), which is required in $[21,39,40]$.\nRemark 3.1. It is worth mentioning that, under the assumptions $(\\dagger), \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ is embedded into the group $\\mathrm{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}([1])$.\n\nA special class of self-similar graphs is worth mentioning for later use.\nExample 3.2 $((n, m)$-odometer $\\mathrm{E}(n, m))$. For $1 \\leq n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $0 \\neq m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, an $(n, m)$-odometer is a self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ with the action and restriction given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na \\cdot e_{s} & = \\begin{cases}e_{s+1} & \\text { if } 0 \\leq s<n-1 \\\\\ne_{0} & \\text { if } s=n-1\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\left.a\\right|_{e_{s}} & = \\begin{cases}0 & \\text { if } 0 \\leq s<n-1 \\\\\na^{m} & \\text { if } s=n-1\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe $(n, m)$-odometer is denoted as $\\mathrm{E}(n, m)$. The case of $m=1$ yields the classical odometers which have been extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., [45] and the references therein).\n\nIn the sequel, we provide two examples of important semigroups which can be realized as semigroups of self-similar graphs.\nExample 3.3 (BS semigroups). For $1 \\leq n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $0 \\neq m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the Baumslag-Solitar (BS) semigroup is\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, m):=\\left\\langle a, b \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{array}{l}\na^{n} b=b a^{m} \\\\\na^{n} b a^{-m}=b\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right.\\right.\n$$\n\nThe semigroup $\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, m)$ can be realized as the semigroup of an $(n, m)$-odometer.\nFrom now on, we use the semigroups $\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, m)$ and $(n, m)$-odometer interchangeably.\nExample 3.4 (GBS semigroups). As the name indicates, this example generalizes BS semigroups in Example 3.3. Let $1 \\leq \\kappa \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$. For $1 \\leq n_{i} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $0 \\neq m_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}(1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa)$, the generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) semigroup is\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{GBS}_{\\kappa}^{+}\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right):=\\left\\langle a, b_{i} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{array}{l}\na^{n_{i}} b_{i}=b_{i} a^{m_{i}} \\\\\na^{n_{i}} b_{i} a^{-m_{i}}=b_{i}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right. \\text { if } m_{i}>0, \\quad 0, \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa\\rangle^{+}\n$$\n\nThe GBS semigroup $\\mathrm{GBS}_{\\mathrm{E}}^{+}\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right)$ can also be realized as the semigroup of a self-similar graph as follows. Let E be the single-vertex directed graph with the edge set $\\left\\{e_{s}^{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq\\right.$ $\\left.\\kappa, s \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]\\right\\}$. To each $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$, we associate an $\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right)$-odometer. Then $\\operatorname{GBS}_{\\kappa}^{+}\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right) \\cong$ $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{E}}$.\n\nTherefore, semigroups of self-similar graphs encompass GBS semigroups.\nRemark 3.5. In this remark, let us mention some connections with the literature.\n(i) BS semigroups usually provide a nice class of examples or counter-examples for some properties (e.g., [7, 25]). They have been attracting a lot of operator algebraists' attention recently. For instance, in [50], the boundary quotient of the semigroup $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$ algebra $\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, m)$ is first investigated via the $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra for a category of paths. In [11], the KMS states of the semigroup $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra of quasi-lattice ordered BS semigroups are studied. This is generalized to all BS semigroups later in [7].\n\n(ii) Very recently, in [10] Chen-Li study the $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras for a class of semigroups, which are graphs of semigroups which are constructed very similarly to graphs of groups in [49]. There is some intersection: For instance, their semigroups encompass GBS semigroups. However, theirs do not include all semigroups $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}}$. Most importantly, theirs do not include any 'genuine' higher rank BS semigroups studied in Section 4 below.\n3.1. Some basic properties. The two lemmas below will be used frequently. One can prove the first one by simple calculations, and the second one by applying Remark 3.1. Their proofs are omitted here.\nLemma 3.6. Let $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ be a self-similar graph. Then, for $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$, and $p \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]$, one has\n(i) $a^{\\ell n_{i}+p} \\cdot e_{s}^{i}=e_{(s+p) \\bmod n_{i}}^{i}$;\n(ii) $\\left.a^{\\ell n_{i}+p}\\right|_{e_{s}^{i}}= \\begin{cases}a^{\\ell n_{i}} & \\text { if } p=0, \\\\ a^{\\ell m_{i}} \\prod_{q=0}^{p-1} a\\right|_{e_{(s+q) \\bmod n_{i}}}^{i} & \\text { if } 0<p<n_{i}-1 .\\end{cases}$\n\nLemma 3.7. Every element $x \\in \\mathrm{~S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ has a unique representation $x=e_{\\mu} a^{\\ell}$ for some $\\mu \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}$ and $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nProposition 3.8. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ is right LCM.\nProof. Consider $e_{\\mu} a^{k}$ and $e_{\\nu} a^{\\ell}$ in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$. It is not hard to see that they have a right common upper bound if, and only if either $e_{\\mu}=e_{\\nu} e_{\\tilde{\\mu}}$ for some $e_{\\tilde{\\mu}} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}$ or $e_{\\nu}=e_{\\mu} e_{\\tilde{\\nu}}$ for some $e_{\\tilde{\\nu}} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}$. WLOG we assume that $e_{\\nu}=e_{\\mu} e_{\\tilde{\\nu}}$ for some $e_{\\tilde{\\nu}} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}$. Let $e_{\\alpha}:=a^{-k} \\cdot e_{\\tilde{\\nu}}$. Then one can show the following: If $\\left.a^{\\ell} \\geq a^{k}\\right|_{e_{\\alpha}}$ (resp. $\\left.a^{\\ell}<a^{k}\\right|_{e_{\\alpha}}$ ), then $e_{\\nu} a^{\\ell}$ (reps. $\\left.e_{\\nu} a^{k}\\right|_{e_{\\alpha}}$ ) is a least right common upper bound of $e_{\\mu} a^{k}$ and $e_{\\nu} a^{\\ell}$ (in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ ).\nRemark 3.9. If $\\left.a\\right|_{e} \\geq 0$ for all $e \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}$, then $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ is a Zappa-Sz\u00e9p product of the semigroups $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{n}^{+}([6])$.\n\nSince $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ is right LCM, from Subsection 2.3 and the analysis above, one has the following Corollary 3.10. $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}\\right) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}} \\cong \\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}\\right)$.\nProof. By Proposition 3.8, the sets $\\{a\\}$ and $\\left\\{e_{i}: i \\in[n]\\right\\}$ are foundation sets of $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$. Then the map\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{~S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}, v_{e_{\\mu} a^{\\ell}} \\mapsto s_{e_{\\mu}} u_{a^{\\ell}}, e_{e_{\\mu} a^{\\ell} \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}} \\mapsto s_{e_{\\mu}} s_{e_{\\mu}}^{*}\n$$\n\nyields an isomorphism. The proof of $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}\\right) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ is even simpler.\n3.2. Pseudo-freeness of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$. Let $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ be a self-similar graph satisfying our standing assumption $(\\dagger)$.\nLemma 3.11. The self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is pseudo-free.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 3.6. In fact, suppose that $g \\cdot \\mu=\\mu$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}=0$. If $|\\mu|=1$, it then follows from Lemma 3.6 and the assumption $(\\dagger)$ that $g=0$. Now suppose that $g \\cdot \\mu=\\mu$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}=0$ with $|\\mu|=k$ imply $g=0$. Let $g \\cdot\\left(\\mu e_{s}^{i}\\right)=\\mu e_{s}^{i}$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu e_{s}^{i}}=0$ for some edge $e_{s}^{i}$ in the $i$-th orbit. Then $\\left.g \\cdot \\mu g\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot e_{s}^{i}=\\mu e_{s}^{i} \\Longrightarrow g \\cdot \\mu=\\mu$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot e_{s}^{i}=e_{s}^{i}$. So the latter implies $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}=a^{\\ell n_{i}}$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. But also $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu e_{s}^{i}}=0$ implies that $\\left.0=\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}\\right|_{e_{s}^{i}}=\\left.a^{\\ell n_{i}}\\right|_{e_{s}^{i}}=a^{\\ell m_{i}}$. Hence $\\ell=0$ as $m_{i} \\neq 0$. Therefore $g \\cdot \\mu=\\mu$ and $\\left.g\\right|_{\\mu}=0$. By our inductive assumption, we have $g=0$. This proves the pseudo-freeness of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$.\n\nRemark 3.12. Lemma 3.11 is no longer true if $m_{i}=0$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$. For example, consider the self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{2}\\right)$ with $a e_{1}=e_{2} a$ and $a e_{2}=e_{1} a^{-1}$. Then $a^{2} e_{i}=e_{i}$ for $i=1,2$, and $\\left.a^{2}\\right|_{e_{i}}=0$. Clearly, this self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{2}\\right)$ is not pseudo-free.\n3.3. The periodicity of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$. In this subsection, we study the periodicity of self-similar graphs $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ in detail. We first analyze the case when $\\kappa=1$, and then use it to study the general case.\n\nRecall that $\\kappa$ is the number of orbits of $\\mathbb{Z}$ on $\\mathrm{E}_{n}$.\n3.3.1. The case of $\\kappa=1$.\n\nProposition 3.13. If $\\kappa=1$, then $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic if and only if $n \\mid m$.\nProof. Suppose that $m=n \\ell$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $x=e_{i_{1}} e_{i_{2}} \\cdots \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ be an infinite path. Repeatedly applying Lemma 3.6 gives\n\n$$\na^{n k} \\cdot x=a^{n k} \\cdot e_{i_{1}} a^{n k}\\left.\\right|_{e_{i_{1}}} \\cdot\\left(e_{i_{2}} \\cdots\\right)=e_{i_{1}} a^{n \\ell k} \\cdot\\left(e_{i_{2}} \\cdots\\right)=\\cdots=x \\quad \\text { for all } \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nThis shows that every infinite path $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic in the sense of [40]. So $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic.\n\nIt remains to show that if $n \\nmid m$ then $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is aperiodic. To the contrary, assume that $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic. It follows from [39, Theorem 3.7] $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ has a non-trivial cycline triple $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$. That is, $\\mu g \\cdot x=\\nu x$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ with $g \\neq 0$ or $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\nCase (a): $|\\mu|<|\\nu|$. Then there is a unique $\\nu^{\\prime} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*} \\backslash \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{0}$ such that $\\nu=\\mu \\nu^{\\prime}$. Thus $g \\cdot x=\\nu^{\\prime} x$ and so $g \\cdot x\\left(0,\\left|\\nu^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)=\\nu^{\\prime}$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$. This is impossible by noticing that $n$ has to be greater than 1 .\n\nCase (b): $|\\mu|>|\\nu|$. Since $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ is arbitrary, we replace $x$ with $g^{-1} \\cdot x$ and then apply Case (a).\n\nCase (c): $|\\mu|=|\\nu|$. Then $\\mu=\\nu$ and $g \\cdot x=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$. Let $d:=\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)>0$. Write $m=d m_{0}$ and $n=d n_{0}$. Since $n \\nmid m$, we have $n_{0} \\nmid m_{0}$. Write $x=e_{i_{1}} e_{i_{2}} \\cdots$ with $i_{j} \\in[n]$. Then\n\n$$\ng \\cdot\\left(e_{i_{1}} e_{i_{2}} \\cdots\\right)=e_{i_{1}} e_{i_{2}} \\cdots \\Longrightarrow g \\cdot e_{i_{1}}=\\left.e_{i_{1}}, g\\right|_{e_{i_{1}}} \\cdot e_{i_{2}}=e_{i_{2}}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nHence there is a sequence $\\left\\{k_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\geq 1} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ of (non-zero) integers such that\n\n$$\ng=a^{k_{1} n}, a^{k_{1} m}=a^{k_{2} n}, a^{k_{2} m}=a^{k_{3} n}, a^{k_{3} m}=a^{k_{4} n}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nSo\n\n$$\nk_{1} m=k_{2} n, k_{2} m=k_{3} n, \\ldots\n$$\n\nimply\n\n$$\nk_{1} m_{0}=k_{2} n_{0}, k_{2} m_{0}=k_{3} n_{0}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThus one has that $m_{0}^{p} k_{1}=n_{0}^{p} k_{p+1}$ for all $p \\geq 1$. In particular $n_{0}^{p} \\mid k_{1}$ for all $p \\geq 1$ as $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(m_{0}, n_{0}\\right)=1$. But $n \\nmid m$ implies $n_{0}>1$. So $k_{1}=0$ and hence $g=0$. Then $(\\mu, g, \\nu)=(\\mu, 0, \\mu)$ is a trivial cycline triple. This is a contradiction.\n\nRemark 3.14. Let $(G, \\Lambda)$ be a self-similar k-graph. As mentioned in [40], it is easy to see that if $\\Lambda$ is periodic, then $(G, \\Lambda)$ is periodic. But the converse is not true. Here is a class of counter-examples: It is well-known that $\\mathrm{E}_{n}$ is aperiodic if $n>1$. But Proposition 3.13 shows that $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic whenever $n \\mid m$. Therefore, the periodicity of $(G, \\Lambda)$ is more complicated than that of the ambient graph $\\Lambda$.\n\nWe now determine all cycline triples of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ when $\\kappa=1$. Notice that all cycline triples are trivial if $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is aperiodic by Theorem 2.8. Hence it suffices to consider periodic self-similar graphs $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$.\n\nWhen $n=1$, there is a unique infinite path. So the following is straightforward.\nLemma 3.15. If $n=1$, then every triple $\\left(\\mu, a^{\\ell}, \\nu\\right)$ is cycline.\nProposition 3.16. Suppose that $\\kappa=1, n>1$, and $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic. Then $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$ is cycline if and only if $\\mu=\\nu$ and $g=a^{\\ell n}$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nProof. \"If\" part is clear. For the \"Only if\" part, assume that $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$ is cycline. Then\n\n$$\n\\mu g \\cdot x=\\nu x \\text { for all } x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nIf $|\\mu|=|\\nu|$, then $\\mu=\\nu$ and $g \\cdot x=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$. As in the proof of Proposition 3.13, one can see that $g=a^{\\ell n}$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $|\\mu| \\neq|\\nu|$, WLOG, $|\\nu|>|\\mu|$. Then $\\nu=\\mu \\nu^{\\prime}$ for some $\\nu^{\\prime} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*} \\backslash \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{0}$ and $g \\cdot x=\\nu^{\\prime} x$. This is impossible as $n>1$.\n\nCombining [40, Theorem 6.6, Theorem 6.13] with Corollary 3.10 yields\nTheorem 3.17. $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathfrak{N}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}\\right)$ with $\\kappa=1$ satisfies UCT. It is simple iff $n \\nmid m$. So it is a Kirchberg algebra iff $n \\nmid m$.\n3.3.2. The general case. For the general $\\kappa \\geq 1$, we begin with a relation between the periodicity of $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ and that of its restrictions on orbits.\n\nFor simplification, let $\\mathfrak{N}:=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(n_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa\\right)$.\nProposition 3.18. $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic, if and only if the restriction $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ is periodic for each $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$, if and only if $n_{i} \\mid m_{i}$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$.\n\nProof. If there is $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$ such that $n_{i} \\nmid m_{i}$, then $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ is aperiodic by Proposition 3.16. Then clearly $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is aperiodic.\n\nNow let us assume that $n_{i} \\mid m_{i}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$. Say $m_{i}=n_{i} \\widetilde{m}_{i}$ with $0 \\neq \\widetilde{m}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$. Then\n\n$$\na^{\\mathfrak{N}} e_{s_{1}}^{i_{1}} \\cdots e_{s_{p}}^{i_{p}}=e_{s_{1}}^{i_{1}} \\cdots e_{s_{p}}^{i_{p}} a^{\\mathfrak{N} \\widetilde{m}_{i_{1}} \\cdots \\widetilde{m}_{i_{p}}}\n$$\n\nThus one can check that for arbitrary $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$ one has $a^{\\mathfrak{N}} \\cdot x=x$. Therefore, every infinite path $x$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic, and so $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic.\n\nWe now determine all cycline triples. If $n=1$, this is provided in Lemma 3.15.\nProposition 3.19. If $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$ is periodic with $n>1$, then $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$ is cycline if and only if $\\mu=\\nu$ and $g=a^{\\ell \\mathfrak{N}}$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nProof. \"If\" part is clear. For the \"Only if\" part, assume that $(\\mu, g, \\nu)$ is cycline. Then\n\n$$\n\\mu g \\cdot x=\\nu x \\text { for all } x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nIf $|\\mu|=|\\nu|$, then $\\mu=\\nu$ and $g \\cdot x=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{\\infty}$. It is now not hard to see that $g=a^{\\ell \\mathfrak{N}}$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $|\\mu| \\neq|\\nu|$, WLOG, $|\\nu|>|\\mu|$. Then $\\nu=\\mu \\nu^{\\prime}$ for some $\\nu^{\\prime} \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*} \\backslash \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{0}$ and $g \\cdot x=\\nu^{\\prime} x$. This is impossible as $n>1$.\n\nCombining [40, Theorem 6.6, Theorem 6.13] with Corollary 3.10 yields\n\nTheorem 3.20. $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$ satisfies UCT. It is simple iff $n_{i} \\nmid m_{i}$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$. So it is a Kirchberg algebra iff $n_{i} \\nmid m_{i}$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa$.\n\nRemark 3.21. It is well-known that the roles of $n$ and $m$ in Baumslag-Solitar groups $\\mathrm{BS}(n, m)$ are symmetric in the sense of $\\mathrm{BS}(n, m) \\cong \\mathrm{BS}(m, n)$. So $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathrm{BS}(n, m)) \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathrm{BS}(m, n))$. However, the symmetry is lost for BS semigroups. For instance, If $0<n \\neq m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $n \\mid m$, then $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, m)\\right)$ is not simple while $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(m, n)\\right)$ is simple.\n3.4. Cartan subalgebras of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$. We begin with the definition of Cartan subalgebras. Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be an abelian $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-subalgebra of a given $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra $\\mathcal{A} . \\mathcal{B}$ is called a Cartan subalgebra in $\\mathcal{A}$ if\n(i) $\\mathcal{B}$ contains an approximate unit in $\\mathcal{A}$;\n(ii) $\\mathcal{B}$ is a MASA;\n(iii) $\\mathcal{B}$ is regular: the normalizer set $N(\\mathcal{B})=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathcal{A}: x \\mathcal{B} x^{*} \\cup x^{*} \\mathcal{B} x \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}\\right\\}$ generates $\\mathcal{A}$;\n(iv) there is a faithful conditional expectation $\\mathcal{E}$ from $\\mathcal{A}$ onto $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\nIn this subsection, we show that there is a canonical Cartan subalgebra for each $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$. It is closely related to the fixed point algebra $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}^{\\gamma}$ of the gauge action $\\gamma$. However, there is an essential difference between the cases of $n=1$ and $n>1$.\n3.4.1. The case of $n=1$. The case of $n=1$ is a special case of Subsection 4.4 below with $\\mathrm{k}=1$ (i.e., rank 1 ), which does not use any results from this section. So we record the result below just for completeness.\n\nIn what follows, to simplify our writing, let us set $\\mathcal{F}:=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}^{\\gamma}$, and $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ to be the (relative) commutant of $\\mathcal{F}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$.\n\nProposition 3.22. Keep the above notation. Then $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{e^{p}} a^{\\ell} s_{e^{q}}^{*}: m^{p}=m^{q}, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is a Cartan subalgebra of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{1}}$.\n\nIt is worth noticing that there are three possible cases for $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ :\n\n- If $m=1$, then $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{e^{p}} u_{a^{\\ell}} s_{e^{q}}^{*}: p, q \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{1}} \\cong \\mathrm{C}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{2}\\right)$.\n- If $m=-1$, then $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{e^{p}} u_{a^{\\ell}} s_{e^{q}}^{*}: p, q \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right.$ with $\\left.p-q \\in 2 \\mathbb{Z}, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$.\n- If $m \\neq \\pm 1$, then $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n3.4.2. The case of $n>1$. Recall that $\\mathfrak{N}=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(n_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\kappa\\right)$ and $n=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\kappa} n_{i}$.\n\nProposition 3.23. If $n>1$, then the cycline $C^{*}$-subalgebra $\\mathcal{M}:=\\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(s_{\\mu} u_{a^{\\ell \\mathrm{m}}} s_{\\mu}^{*}: \\mu \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}, \\ell \\in\\right.$ $\\mathbb{Z})$ is a MASA in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}}$.\n\nProof. We first show that $\\mathcal{M}$ is abelian. Compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(s_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\mu}^{*}\\right)\\left(s_{\\nu} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu}^{*}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\ns_{\\mu} u_{a(K+L) \\mathfrak{N}} s_{\\mu}^{*} & \\text { if } \\mu=\\nu \\\\\ns_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu^{\\prime}} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu}^{*}=s_{\\mu} s_{\\nu^{\\prime}} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}}\\left\\lvert\\,_{\\nu^{\\prime}} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu}^{*}=s_{\\nu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}}\\right. & \\text { if } \\nu=\\mu \\nu^{\\prime} \\\\\ns_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\mu^{\\prime}}^{*} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu}^{*}=s_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} u_{\\left.\\left(a^{-L n}\\right]_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}} \\mu^{\\prime}}\\right)^{-1}} s_{\\mu^{\\prime}}^{*} s_{\\nu}^{*}=s_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}}\\left\\lvert\\,_{\\mu^{\\prime}} s_{\\mu}^{*} \\quad \\text { if } \\mu=\\nu \\mu^{\\prime}\\right. \\\\\n0 & \\text { otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilar calculations yield\n\n$$\n\\left(s_{\\nu} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\nu}^{*}\\right)\\left(s_{\\mu} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\mu}^{*}\\right)= \\begin{cases}s_{\\nu} u_{a(K+L) \\mathfrak{N}} s_{\\nu}^{*} & \\text { if } \\mu=\\nu \\\\ s_{\\nu} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}}\\left\\lvert\\,_{\\nu^{\\prime}} s_{\\nu}^{*}\\right. & \\text { if } \\nu=\\mu \\nu^{\\prime} \\\\ s_{\\mu} u_{a^{L \\mathfrak{N}}}\\left\\lvert\\,_{\\mu^{\\prime}} u_{a^{K \\mathfrak{N}}} s_{\\mu}^{*}\\right. & \\text { if } \\mu=\\nu \\mu^{\\prime} \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThus $\\mathcal{M}$ is abelian.\nAs in [39], let $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}$ be the groupoid associated to the self-similar graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n}\\right)$. It follows from [39, Lemma 5.2] and Proposition 3.19 that $\\operatorname{Iso}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}\\right)^{\\circ}=\\bigcup_{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathbb{Z}}, l \\in \\mathbb{Z}} Z\\left(\\mu, a^{\\ell \\mathfrak{N}}, \\mu\\right)$. Also notice that $\\mathcal{M} \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\operatorname{Iso}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}\\right)^{\\circ}\\right)$. So $\\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\operatorname{Iso}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}\\right)^{\\circ}\\right)$ is abelian. Hence, by [9, Corollary 5.4], $\\mathcal{M}$ is a MASA.\n\nRemark 3.24. By Lemma 3.15, when $n=1$, the cycline subalgebra of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{1}}$ coincides with $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{1}}$, which is generally not abelian. So Proposition 3.23 does not hold true for $n=1$.\n\nRemark 3.25. Keep the same notation in the proof above. If $\\operatorname{Iso}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}\\right)^{\\circ}$ is closed, then applying [5, Corollary 4.5] one can conclude that $\\mathcal{M}$ is Cartan in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}$. But, unfortunately, $\\operatorname{Iso}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbf{E}_{n}}\\right)^{\\circ}$ needn't be closed in general.\n3.5. Some old examples revisited.

In [11], it is shown that $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, n)\\right) \\cong \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T}) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{n}$. From what we have obtained so far, we can prove this by relating to rank 2 graphs.

Also $\\pi$ is surjective as from $a e_{i}=e_{i+1}(0 \\leq i \\leq n-2)$ and $a e_{n-1}=e_{0} a^{n}$ one has\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_{a} s_{e_{i}} s_{e_{i}}^{*}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} s_{e_{i+1}} s_{e_{i}}^{*}+s_{e_{0}} u_{a^{n}} s_{e_{n-1}}^{*}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} s_{e_{i+1}} s_{e_{i}}^{*}+u_{a^{n}} s_{e_{0}} s_{e_{n-1}}^{*}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} s_{e_{i+1}} s_{e_{i}}^{*}+F_{0} s_{e_{n-1}}^{*}\n$$\n\nConversely, define $\\rho: \\mathcal{Q}\\left(\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(n, n)\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\text {flip }}}$ by\n\n$$\ns_{e_{i}} \\mapsto s_{\\mathbf{e}_{i}}, u_{a} \\mapsto \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} s_{\\mathbf{e}_{i+1}} s_{\\mathbf{e}_{i}}^{*}+s_{\\mathbf{f}_{0}} s_{\\mathbf{e}_{n-1}}^{*}\n$$\n\nThen $\\rho$ determines a homomorphism. Also one can check that $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ are the inverse to each other.

In this example, through $\\mathrm{BS}^{+}(2,2)$, we are able to show that $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\text {square }}} \\cong$ $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\text {flip }}}$, which seems unclear in [15] although both $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\text {flip }}}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\text {square }}}$ are well-studied there.\n\nLet $W:=s_{\\mathbf{e}_{1}} s_{\\mathbf{e}_{0}}^{*}+s_{\\mathbf{f}_{0}} s_{\\mathbf{e}_{1}}^{*}$.

Rank k case: more than higher rank Baumslag-Solitar Semigroups \n\nIn this section, we first propose a notion of higher rank BS semigroups $\\Lambda_{\\theta}(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathfrak{m})$. We then briefly describe how higher rank BS semigroups relate to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture. Our main focus here are two cases $-\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ and $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$. For $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$, it is related to products of odometers studied in [38]. Applying some results in [38, 39], one can easily characterize the simplicity of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$ and see that the cycline subalgebra is Cartan in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$. But, here, we first show the fixed point algebra $\\mathcal{F}$ of the gauge action $\\gamma$ is a BunceDeddens algebra, and so $\\mathcal{F}$ has a unique faithful tracial state $\\tau$. Then composing with the conditional expectation $\\Phi$ from $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$ onto $\\mathcal{F}$ yields a state $\\omega=\\tau \\circ \\Phi$. We then study the associated von Neumann algebra $\\pi_{\\omega}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)^{\\prime \\prime}$ in the same vein of $[52,53]$. More precisely, we provide some characterizations of when $\\pi_{\\omega}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)^{\\prime \\prime}$ is a factor, and further obtain its type. For $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$, it is intimately related to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture. In this case, we obtain a canonical Cartan for $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$, which is generally a proper subalgebra of its cycline subalgebra. We will continue studying $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$ and its relative(s) in a forthcoming paper.\n4.1. Higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups. Consider k given self-similar graphs $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ with $\\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}: s \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right]\\right\\}(1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k})$. Suppose that $\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}$ 's satisfy the commutation relations $\\theta_{i j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}, \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{i}}^{j}\\right)=\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{i}^{\\prime}}^{j}, \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right)$ for $1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. Applying [38, Proposition 4.1], one has\n\nProposition 4.1. Keep the same notation. The k self-similar graphs $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathrm{E}_{n_{i}}\\right)$ with the commutation relations $\\theta_{i j}$ 's determine a self-similar k -graph $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{\\theta}\\right)$ if and only if\n\n$$\n\\left(a \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}\\right)\\left(\\left.a\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}}^{i}} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{i}}^{j}\\right)=\\left(a \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{i}^{\\prime}}^{j}\\right)\\left(\\left.a\\right|_{\\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}}^{j}} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathfrak{s}^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k}, \\mathfrak{s} \\in\\left[n_{i}\\right], \\mathfrak{t} \\in\\left[n_{j}\\right]$.\nBased on Example 3.3, it is reasonable to introduce the following notion.\nDefinition 4.2. A self-similar k -graph obtained from $\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right)$-odometers with the commutation relations $\\theta_{i j}$ 's is called a rank $\\mathrm{k} B S$ semigroup, denoted as $\\Lambda_{\\theta}\\left(\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right),\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)\\right)$, or simply $\\Lambda_{\\theta}(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathfrak{m})$ if the context is clear. The ambient k -graph is still written as $\\Lambda_{\\theta}$.\n\nHere are some examples of higher rank BS semigroups.\n\nExample 4.3. A standard product of odometers studied in [38] is a rank k BS semigroup induced from $\\left(n_{i}, 1\\right)$-odometers $\\mathrm{E}\\left(n_{i}, 1\\right)(1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k})$ with the division commutation relations (refer to Example 2.2 for d). So it is of the form $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$.\nExample 4.4. Consider $\\left(n_{i}, m_{i}\\right)$-odometers with the trivial permutation $\\theta_{i j}(1 \\leq i<j \\leq \\mathrm{k})$ (see Example 2.1). Then they induce a rank k BS semigroup if and only if $n_{i}=1$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. In fact, the condition (4) in Proposition 4.1 implies $n_{i}=1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. Then the trivial relation is the same as the division commutation relation. The rank k BS semigroup obtained in this case is of the form $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$.\nExample 4.5. Suppose that $n_{i}=n$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, and that $\\theta_{i j}$ is the division permutation. Then one necessarily has $\\theta_{i j}(s, t)=(t, s)$. One can check that this yields a rank k BS semigroup if and only if either $m_{i}=m_{j}$ for all $1 \\leq i, j \\leq \\mathrm{k}$, or $n \\mid m_{i}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. These are rank k BS semigroups of the form $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}((n, \\ldots, n),(m, \\ldots, m))$, or $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left((n, \\ldots, n),\\left(n \\widetilde{m}_{1}, \\ldots, n \\widetilde{m}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nSo the class obtained in Example 4.4 is a special case here with $n=1$.\nIn the sequel, we provide some interesting $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras studied in the literature, which can be realized from higher rank BS semigroups.\n(i) It is shown in [38] that the Cuntz algebra $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ is isomorphic to the boundary quotient of a semigroup of the form in Example 4.3.\n(ii) For $2 \\leq p \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the $p$-adic $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra $\\mathcal{Q}_{p}$ can also be recovered from a semigroup of the form in Example 4.3 (cf. [38] for $p=2$ in terms of standard product of odometers).\n(iii) $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\mathbb{N}}$ can be also realized as a boundary quotient of the left $a x+b$ semigroup $\\mathbb{N} \\rtimes \\mathbb{N}^{\\times}$ studied in [34]. The $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra of $\\mathbb{N} \\rtimes \\mathbb{N}^{\\times}$itself is also related to higher rank BS semigroups.\n(iv) The boundary $\\partial \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\mathbb{N}^{\\times} \\ltimes \\mathbb{N}\\right)$ of the right $a x+b$ semigroup $\\mathbb{N}^{\\times} \\ltimes \\mathbb{N}$ is a boundary quotient of a higher-rank BS semigroup of the form given in Example 4.4.\n(v) The $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra $\\mathcal{O}\\left(E_{n, m}\\right)$ studied by Katsura in [30] is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathrm{E}(n, m)}$ (see Examples 3.2 and 3.3).\n\nRemark 4.6. The $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras of both the left $a x+b$ semigroup $\\mathbb{N} \\rtimes \\mathbb{N}^{\\times}$and the right $a x+b$ semigroup $\\mathbb{N}^{\\times} \\ltimes \\mathbb{N}$ are related to higher rank BS semigroups. This will be studied elsewhere.\n4.2. Relation to Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture. We first give a very brief introduction on Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture. For all undefined notions or any further information, refer to $[8,23,24,48]$.\n\nLet $2 \\leq p, q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be multiplicatively independent, i.e., $\\frac{\\ln p}{\\ln q} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$. Define $T_{p}: \\mathbb{T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{T}$ by $T_{p}(z)=z^{p}$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{T}$. Similarly for $T_{q}$. A subset of $\\mathbb{T}$ is said to be $\\times p, \\times q$-invariant if it is invariant under both $T_{p}$ and $T_{q}$. Furstenberg classifies all closed $\\times p, \\times q$-invariant subsets of $\\mathbb{T}$ in [23]: Such a subset is either finite or $\\mathbb{T}$ itself. Then he conjectures the following:\nConjecture (Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture). An ergodic $\\times p, \\times q$-invariant Borel probability measure of $\\mathbb{T}$ is either finitely supported or the Lebesgue measure.\n\nAccording to our best knowledge, this conjecture is still open. The best known result so far is the following theorem, which is proved by Rudolph when $p$ and $q$ are coprime in [47], and later improved by Johnson in [28].\n\nTheorem (Rudolph-Johnson). If $\\mu$ is an ergodic $\\times p, \\times q$-invariant measure on $\\mathbb{T}$, then either both entropies of $T_{p}$ and $T_{q}$ with respect to $\\mu$ are 0 , or $\\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.\n\nWhen both entropies of $T_{p}$ and $T_{q}$ with respect to $\\mu$ are 0 , Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture is reduced to studying the $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G)$ of the group $G$, where\n\n$$\nG:=\\left\\langle s, t, z: s t=t s, s z=z^{p} s, t z=z^{q} t\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nIt turns out that $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p q}\\right]\\right) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}^{2} \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p q}\\right] \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\right)$. In [24], the representation theory of $\\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p q}\\right]\\right) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is studied. In particular, the authors focus on which kind of its representations are induced by $\\times p, \\times q$-invariant measures on $\\mathbb{T}$. Later, the following equivalence is shown in [8]: Furstenberg's $\\times p, \\times q$ conjecture holds true if and only if the canonical trace is the only faithful extreme tracial state on $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1}{p q}\\right] \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\right)$.\n\nOur purpose here is to connect Furstenberg's conjecture with higher rank BS semigroups. For this, from (5) one has\n\n$$\nt^{-1} s^{-1}=s^{-1} t^{-1}, z^{-1} s^{-1}=s^{-1} z^{-p}, z^{-1} t^{-1}=t^{-1} z^{-q}\n$$\n\nLet $\\tilde{G}$ be the group\n\n$$\n\\tilde{G}:=\\left\\langle\\tilde{s}, \\tilde{t}, \\tilde{z}: \\tilde{t} \\tilde{s}=\\tilde{s} \\tilde{t}, \\tilde{z} \\tilde{s}=\\tilde{s} \\tilde{z}^{p}, \\tilde{z} \\tilde{t}=\\tilde{t} \\tilde{z}^{q}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThus $G \\cong \\tilde{G}$ and so $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\tilde{G})$. The upshot by doing so is $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((1,1),(p, q))}$.\nNow return to (5) again. Let $G^{+}$be the corresponding semigroup\n\n$$\nG^{+}:=\\left\\langle s, t, z: s t=t s, s z=z^{p} s, t z=z^{q} t\\right\\rangle^{+}\n$$\n\nThen we claim that $\\mathcal{Q}\\left(G^{+}\\right) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((p, q),(1,1))}$. In fact, let $e_{i}:=z^{i} s$ and $f_{j}:=z^{j} t$ for $i \\in[p]$ and $j \\in[q]$. Then $s t=t s \\Longleftrightarrow e_{0} f_{0}=f_{0} e_{0}$. For $k \\in[p]$ and $\\ell \\in[q]$, let $k^{\\prime} \\in[p]$ and $\\ell^{\\prime} \\in[q]$ be the unique ones such that $k+\\ell p=\\ell^{\\prime}+k^{\\prime} q$. Then we have\n\n$$\ne_{k} f_{\\ell}=z^{k} s z^{\\ell} t=z^{k} z^{\\ell p} s t=z^{\\ell^{\\prime}} z^{k^{\\prime} q} t s=z^{\\ell^{\\prime}} t z^{k^{\\prime}} s=f_{\\ell^{\\prime}} e_{k^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nThus there is a homomorphism\n\n$$\n\\pi: \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((p, q),(1,1))}=\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Z}, \\Lambda_{d}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Q}\\left(G^{+}\\right), s_{\\mathbf{x}_{1}^{1}} \\mapsto v_{e_{i}}, s_{\\mathbf{x}_{2}^{2}} \\mapsto v_{f_{j}}, u_{a} \\mapsto v_{z}\n$$\n\nwhich is an isomorphism as it has an inverse given by\n\n$$\nv_{s} \\mapsto s_{\\mathbf{x}_{0}^{1}}, v_{t} \\mapsto s_{\\mathbf{x}_{0}^{2}}, v_{z} \\mapsto u_{a}\n$$\n\nHence $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((p, q),(1,1))} \\cong \\mathcal{Q}\\left(G^{+}\\right)$.\nTo sum up, we have shown that\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((1,1),(p, q))} \\text { and } \\mathcal{Q}\\left(G^{+}\\right) \\cong \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}((p, q),(1,1))}\n$$\n\nBased on the above, in what follows, we focus on two extreme, but rather interesting, classes of higher rank BS semigroups: $\\Lambda_{d}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ with $\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}} \\leq \\mathfrak{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ and $\\Lambda_{d}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ with $m_{i} \\neq 0$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$.\n\nFrom now on, to unify our notation, the set $\\left\\{0,1 \\neq p_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is said to be multiplicatively independent if there is no $\\mathbf{0} \\neq q \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ such that $\\prod_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{k}} p_{i}^{q_{i}}=1$. When all $p_{i}$ 's are also $\\geq 1,\\left\\{p_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is multiplicatively independent if and only if $\\left\\{\\ln p_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is rationally independent.\n\n4.3. The case of $\\mathfrak{m}=\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}$. The $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebra of the self-similar $\\mathrm{k}$-graph $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ is studied in [38]. It is shown there that $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$ is simple if and only if $\\left\\{n_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is multiplicatively independent, and that its cycline subalgebra is Cartan by [39, Theorem 5.6]. In what follows, we identify the center of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$, which is overlooked in [38, 39]. A useful lemma first:\n\nLemma 4.7. (i) Let $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{p}}\\left(\\mathfrak{p} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then there is $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\nu a^{m}=a^{\\ell} \\mu$.\n(ii) $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{u_{a^{m}} s_{\\alpha} s_{\\beta}^{*}: m \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\alpha, \\beta \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. (i) We first prove the lemma holds true for the classical odometer action $\\mathrm{E}(n, 1)$. We argue this by induction with respect to the lengths of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. If $\\mu:=e_{i}$ and $\\nu:=e_{j}$. WLOG we assume that $i \\geq j \\in[n]$. For any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, by Lemma 3.6 one can verify that $a^{m n+i-j} \\nu=\\mu a^{m}$. Assume that this is true for any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and all $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\mathrm{E}_{n}^{*}$ with $|\\mu|=|\\nu| \\leq k$. Now consider $e_{s} \\mu$ and $e_{t} \\nu$ with $|\\mu|=|\\nu|=k$. Let $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. By our inductive assumption, we have $e_{s} \\mu a^{m}=e_{s} a^{\\ell^{\\prime}} \\nu=a^{\\ell} e_{t} \\nu$ for some $\\ell^{\\prime}, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This proves the $\\mathrm{E}(n, 1)$ case.\n\nNow return to $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Let $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{d}$ with $d(\\mu)=d(\\nu)=\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$. Then by the unique factorization property $\\mu=\\mu_{1} \\cdots \\mu_{\\mathrm{k}}$ and $\\nu=\\nu_{1} \\cdots \\nu_{\\mathrm{k}}$ with $\\mu_{i}, \\nu_{i} \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mu_{i} \\nu_{i}}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. Then for any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, apply the above to $\\mu_{\\mathrm{k}} a^{m}$ in $\\mathrm{E}\\left(n_{\\mathrm{k}}, 1\\right)$, there is $\\ell_{\\mathrm{k}} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\mu a^{m}=\\mu_{1} \\cdots \\mu_{\\mathrm{k}-1} a^{\\ell_{\\mathrm{k}}} \\nu_{\\mathrm{k}}$. Repeatedly using the above gives $\\mu a^{m}=a^{\\ell} \\nu$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n(ii) This follows from (i) and Proposition 2.7 (i).\n\nBy [39, Theorem 7.5] (or Appendix there), $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)$ and $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}$ share the same periodicity $\\left\\{\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}}: \\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{p}}=1\\right\\}$. Thus, for each pair $(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\times \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ with $\\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{p}}=\\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{q}}$, there is a bijection $\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}: \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{p}} \\rightarrow \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{q}}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\mu \\nu=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu), \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)=\\nu \\mu\n$$\n\nfor every pair $(\\mu, \\nu) \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{p}} \\times \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{q}}([16$, Theorem 7.1]) (or [26, Section 5]). Let\n\n$$\nV_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}:=\\sum_{\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathbf{p}}} s_{\\mu} s_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*}\n$$\n\nBy ([16, Theorem 4.9]), each $V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}$ is a unitary in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$.\nProposition 4.8. The center of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)=\\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}:(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\times \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{p}}=\\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)$ is trivial, if and only if $\\left\\{n_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is multiplicatively independent.\n\nProof. Suppose that $A \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)$. Then by Proposition 2.7, one has $A \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}}\\right)$. But $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}}\\right)=\\mathrm{C}^{*}\\left(V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}:(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\times \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{p}}=\\mathfrak{n}^{\\mathbf{q}}\\right)([16])$.\n\nIt remains to show that each $V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}$ is indeed in $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)}\\right)$. This has been proved in [16, Theorem 4.9]. In what follows, we prove this by invoking Lemma 4.7.\n\nWe first show that $u_{a}$ commutes with $V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}$. Then on one hand one has\n\n$$\na \\cdot(\\mu \\nu)=a \\cdot\\left(\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu)\\right) \\Longrightarrow a\\left.\\cdot \\mu a\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu=a \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu) a|_{\\phi(\\mu)} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, we have\n\n$$\n\\left.a \\cdot \\mu a\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(a \\cdot \\mu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}\\left(\\left.a\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu\\right)\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu)=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}\\left(a^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\right) \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}\\left(\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu\\right) \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}\\left(\\left.a^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu)=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}\\left(\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\mu} \\cdot \\nu\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen one can easily see $g \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(g \\cdot \\mu)$ for any $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, one gets from the 2nd identity of (9) that $g \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(\\nu)=\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}^{-1}(g \\cdot \\nu)$ for any $g \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus the 2 nd identity of (10) yields $\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}=\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\mu}$, and so $\\left(\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}\\right)^{-1}=\\left(\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\mu}\\right)^{-1}$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\left.a\\right|_{\\left.a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}\\right.}=\\left.a\\right|_{\\left.a^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\right.}\n$$\n\nNow compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{a} V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}} & =\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{a \\cdot \\mu} u_{a \\mid \\mu} s_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*}=\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{\\mu} u_{a \\mid a^{-1} \\cdot \\mu} s_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}\\left(a^{-1} \\cdot \\mu\\right)}^{*} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{\\mu} u_{a \\mid a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)} s_{a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*}(\\text { from (10) and (11)) } \\\\\n& =\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{\\mu} u_{\\left(\\left.a^{-1}\\right|_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}\\right)^{-1}} s_{a^{-1} \\cdot \\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*}=\\left(\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{\\mu} s_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*}\\right) u_{a} \\\\\n& =V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}} u_{a}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\left(u_{a^{m}} s_{\\alpha} s_{\\beta}^{*}\\right) V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}=u_{a^{m}} V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}} s_{\\alpha} s_{\\beta}^{*}=V_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}\\left(u_{a^{m}} s_{\\alpha} s_{\\beta}^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 4.7 (ii), $\\sum_{d(\\mu)=\\mathbf{p}} s_{\\mu} s_{\\phi_{\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}}(\\mu)}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{d}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}\\right)}\\right)$.\n\nFor $\\mathbf{m} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbf{k}}$, let $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbf{m}}:=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{\\mu} a^{n} s_{\\nu}^{*}: \\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}\\right)}\\right.$ with $d(\\mu)=d(\\nu)=\\mathbf{m}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, and so $\\mathcal{F}=\\overline{\\bigcup_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}^{k}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathbf{m}}} \\cdot \\mathbb{P} \\cdot \\mathbb{P}$.

In particular, $\\mathcal{F}$ has a unique faithful tracial state.\n\nProof. The proof below is motivated by the proof of [41, Theorem 3.16].\nFor $\\mathbf{m} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbf{k}}$, let $\\left\\{e_{\\mu, \\nu}\\right\\}_{\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathbf{d}}^{\\mathbf{m}}}$ be the matrix entries of $K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)\\right) .{ }^{2}$ To simplify our notation, let $\\left\\{a^{n}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ be the generating unitaries of $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Clearly, there is a homomorphism\n\n$$\n\\rho_{1}: K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{d}^{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}_{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}}, e_{\\mu, \\nu} \\mapsto s_{\\mu} s_{\\nu}^{*}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\rho_{2}: \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}_{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}}, a^{n} \\mapsto \\sum_{\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{d}^{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{k}}}} s_{\\mu} u_{a^{n}} s_{\\mu}^{*}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ In our case, $K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{d}^{m}\\right)\\right) \\cong M_{n^{m}}(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nSome simple calculations show the images of $\\rho_{1}$ and $\\rho_{2}$ commute. By [43, Theorem 6.3.7], there is a homomorphism $\\rho: K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)\\right) \\otimes \\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}_{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}{ }^{3}$ satisfying $\\rho\\left(e_{\\mu, \\nu} \\otimes a^{n}\\right)=s_{\\mu} u_{a^{n}} s_{\\nu}^{*}$. It is not hard to see that $\\rho$ is also invertible and so an isomorphism.\n\nSet $\\mu_{0}:=\\mathbf{x}_{0}^{1} \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_{0}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathfrak{n}-\\mathbb{1}}:=\\mathbf{x}_{n_{1}-1}^{1} \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_{n_{\\mathrm{k}}-1}^{\\mathrm{k}}$. Embed $K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{m \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)\\right) \\otimes \\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathbb{Z})$ into $K\\left(\\ell^{2}\\left(\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{(m+1) \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)\\right) \\otimes$ $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(\\mathbb{Z})$ as follows:\n\n$$\ne_{\\mu, \\nu} \\otimes a^{n} \\mapsto \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{k}} e_{\\mu a^{n} \\cdot \\alpha, \\nu \\alpha} \\otimes\\left.a^{n}\\right|_{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\left.a\\right|_{\\alpha}=a$ if $\\alpha=\\mu_{\\mathfrak{n}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}$, and $\\left.a\\right|_{\\alpha}=0$, otherwise.\nNow we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{a} & =u_{a} \\sum_{\\mu \\in \\Lambda^{m} \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}} s_{\\mu} s_{\\mu}^{*}=\\sum_{\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}^{m} \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}} s_{a \\cdot \\mu} u_{a \\mid \\mu} s_{\\mu}^{*} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{\\mu \\neq \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}} s_{a \\cdot \\mu} s_{\\mu}^{*}+s_{a \\cdot \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}} u_{a} s_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}^{*} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{\\mu \\neq \\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}} s_{a \\cdot \\mu} s_{\\mu}^{*}+s_{\\mu_{0}} u_{a} s_{\\mu_{\\mathrm{n}}-\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to a Bunce-Deddens algebra of type of $d^{\\infty}$, and so it has a unique faithful tracial state ([13]).\nRemark 4.10. It is worth mentioning the following: If $S:=\\left\\{n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ is a set of mutually coprime natural numbers, then $\\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to $B_{S}$ in [2].\n\nBy Lemma 4.9 and [13], $\\mathcal{F}$ has a unique faithful tracial state, say $\\tau$, given by\n\n$$\n\\tau\\left(s_{\\mu} u_{a^{n}} s_{\\mu}^{*}\\right)=\\mathfrak{n}^{-d(\\mu)} \\delta_{n, 0}\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\Phi_{\\mathbf{0}}$ is the faithful conditional expectation from $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1})}$ onto $\\mathcal{F}$ via the gauge action $\\gamma$ (see Subsection 2.2).

Notice that, for $\\mu, \\nu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right), g \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the function $\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}(\\mathfrak{n}, \\mathbb{1})}, \\xi \\mapsto e^{i \\xi \\mathfrak{r} \\cdot(d(\\mu)-d(\\nu))} s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}$ is an entire function. So $s_{\\mu} u_{g} s_{\\nu}^{*}$ is an analytic element.

The case of $\\mathfrak{n}=\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}$. Since there is only one edge for each color $i$, in order to ease our notation, we write $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ (instead of the notation $\\mathbf{x}_{1}^{i}$ used above) for this unique edge. Thus $\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\mathbf{x}_{j}=\\mathbf{x}_{j} \\mathbf{x}_{i}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\neq j \\leq \\mathrm{k}$. Since this is the unique commutation relation on $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ 's, we denote $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ simply as $\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$. The ambient k -graph is just denoted as $\\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}$.\n\nWe should mention that it seems that the case of $\\mathfrak{n}=\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}$ is also studied in [39]. However, this is exactly the case which is completely ignored there. This could be due to two reasons: one is that $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ is clearly not locally faithful, which is the crucial property required in [39]; the other is that this case, at first glance, seems too special.\nObservation 4.14. The observations below are obvious and will be used frequently later without any further mention.\n(i) For every $\\mathbf{p} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{k}, \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}^{\\mathbf{p}}$ is a singleton: $\\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}^{\\mathbf{p}}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{p}}:=\\mathbf{x}_{1}^{p_{1}} \\cdots \\mathbf{x}_{\\mathrm{k}}^{p_{k}}\\right\\}$. Also, $s_{\\mu}$ is a unitary for every $\\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}$.\n\n(ii) $\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ is pseudo-free. In fact, some computations show $\\left.a^{n}\\right|_{\\mu}=a^{n \\mathfrak{m}^{d(\\mu)}}$ and so $\\left.a^{n}\\right|_{\\mu}=0 \\Longleftrightarrow n=0$.\n\nOur next goal is to show that $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)$ has a canonical Cartan subalgebra. In particular, this canonical Cartan subalgebra is $\\mathcal{F}$ if $\\left\\{\\left|m_{i}\\right|: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\}$ is multiplicatively independent; it properly contains $\\mathcal{F}$, otherwise.\n\nLemma 4.15. $\\mathcal{F}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{\\mu} u_{a^{\\ell}} s_{\\mu}^{*}: \\mu \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}}, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}}\\left\\{s_{\\mu}^{n} u_{a^{\\ell}} s_{\\mu}^{-n}: d(\\mu)=\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ell \\in\\right.$ $\\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nProof.

It follows from Observation 4.14 that $d(\\mu)=d(\\nu)$ forces $\\mu=\\nu$, say equal to $\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{n}}$ for some $\\mathbf{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathrm{k}}$.

We first show that $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is abelian. For this, let $A:=s_{\\mu} u_{a^{M}} s_{\\nu}^{*}$ and $B:=s_{\\alpha} u_{a^{N}} s_{\\beta}^{*}$ be two standard generators in $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$.

Thus $A B=B A$ and so $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is abelian.\nNow we show $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is a MASA.

So there is a conditional expectation $\\Phi$ from $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathrm{~m}\\right)}$ onto $\\mathcal{F}$.

Let $\\left.\\Phi_{0}\\right|_{\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}}$ be the restriction of $\\Phi_{0}$ onto $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$, and $\\Psi$ be the expectation induced from $\\alpha$ above.

It remains to show that $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is regular, For this, let $A:=s_{\\mu} u_{a}^{M} s_{\\nu}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ and $B:=$ $s_{\\alpha} u_{a}^{N} s_{\\beta}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathrm{~m}\\right)}$.

Thanks to Anna Duwenig and Rachael Norton for some discussion.\n\nProof. Let $G:=\\left\\langle a, \\mathbf{x}_{i}: a \\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\mathbf{x}_{i} a^{m_{i}}, 1 \\leq i \\leq \\mathrm{k}\\right\\rangle$. Then it it easy to see that $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)} \\cong$ $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G)$ via $u_{a} \\mapsto a$ and $s_{\\mathbf{x}_{i}} \\mapsto \\mathbf{x}_{i}$. By [40], $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$ is amenable and so is $\\mathrm{C}^{*}(G)$. Thus $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)} \\cong \\mathrm{C}^{*}(G) \\cong \\mathrm{C}_{i}^{*}(G)$.\n\nLet $S:=\\left\\{\\mu a^{n} \\nu^{-1}: \\mathfrak{m}^{d(\\mu)}=\\mathfrak{m}^{d(\\nu)}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.21, one can easily show that $S$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Also, analogous to the proof of Lemma $4.18,{ }^{6}$ one can show that, for $\\alpha a^{k} \\beta^{-1} \\in G$, if the set $\\left\\{\\left(\\mu a^{n} \\nu^{-1}\\right)\\left(\\alpha a^{k} \\beta^{-1}\\right)\\left(\\nu a^{-n} \\mu^{-1}\\right): \\mu, \\nu \\in\\right.$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathrm{k}}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right), n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is not a singleton, then it has to be infinite. Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mu a^{n} \\nu^{-1}\\right)\\left(\\alpha a^{k} \\beta^{-1}\\right)\\left(\\nu a^{-n} \\mu^{-1}\\right)=\\left(\\mu^{\\prime} a^{n^{\\prime}} \\nu^{\\prime-1}\\right)\\left(\\alpha a^{k} \\beta^{-1}\\right)\\left(\\nu^{\\prime} a^{-n^{\\prime}} \\mu^{\\prime-1}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow n \\mathfrak{m}^{d(\\mu^{\\prime})}=n^{\\prime} \\mathfrak{m}^{d(\\mu)}\n$$\n\nHence $S$ is immediately centralizing. By [20, Theorem 3.1], $\\mathrm{C}_{i}^{*}(S)$ is Cartan in $\\mathrm{C}_{i}^{*}(G)$. Therefore $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ is Cartan in $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$.\nRemark 4.23. Notice that, since $\\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ has a unique infinite path, every triple $\\left(\\mu, a^{n}, \\nu\\right)$ is cycline. So the cycline subalgebra of $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$ coincides with $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)}$, and does not provide much information of the canonical Cartan subalgebra $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}$ in general.\n4.5.

Consider the subalgebras $\\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ along with the inclusions $\\varphi_{n}: \\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}} \\hookrightarrow$ $\\mathcal{F}_{(n+1) \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ given by $\\varphi_{n}\\left(s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}} u_{a^{p}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}}^{*}\\right)=s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n+1}} u_{a^{p m}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n+1}}^{*}$. Then $\\mathcal{F}=\\varliminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$, and the spectrum of $\\mathcal{F}$ is homeomorphic to $S_{\\mathfrak{M}}$.\n\nProof. Notice that\n\n$$\ns_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}} u_{a^{p}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}}^{*}=s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}}^{*} u_{a^{p}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n}}^{*}=s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n+1}} u_{a^{p m}} s_{\\mathfrak{c}^{n+1}}^{*}\n$$\n\nThis shows that $\\varphi_{n}$ is indeed an inclusion of $\\mathrm{C}^{*}$-algebras. Since the union $\\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ is dense in $\\mathcal{F}$ (actually they are equal), we have that $\\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to the direct limit of $\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}, \\varphi_{n}\\right)$ (see [43] Remark 6.1.3).\n\nDue to [51, Theorem 2], the spectrum of $\\mathcal{F}$ is the projective limit of the spectra of the subalgebras $\\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$, with the maps $\\phi_{n+1}: \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}_{(n+1) \\mathbb{1}_{k}}} \\rightarrow \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}}$ which induce the maps $\\varphi_{n}$. However\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Actually, it is easier here since $A=a^{n}$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nwe will work with an isomorphic direct system in order to make things more concrete. Observe that we have an isomorphism $\\psi_{n}$ between $\\mathcal{F}_{n \\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ and $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T})$ that sends the element $s_{\\ell^{n}} a s_{\\ell^{n}}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{n}$ to the function $f(z)=z$ in $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T})$, which we will just denote by $z$ (note that $z$ is a unitary element that generates $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T})$ ). Let $\\varphi_{n}^{\\prime}: \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T})$ be the map defined by sending the function $z$ to $z^{\\mathfrak{M}}$. Then by a direct calculation the following diagram commutes:\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nBy [51, Proposition 2], $\\mathcal{F}$ is then isomorphic to the direct limit of the system $\\left(\\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T}), \\varphi_{n, n+1}^{\\prime}\\right)$. We now observe that homeomorphism $\\rho: \\mathbb{T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{T}$ defined by $\\rho(z)=z^{\\mathfrak{M}}$ induces the maps $\\varphi_{n}^{\\prime}: \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}(\\mathbb{T})$, and so the spectrum $\\mathcal{F}$ is homeomorphic to the projective limit of\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{T} \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\leftarrow} \\mathbb{T} \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\leftarrow} \\mathbb{T} \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\leftarrow} \\mathbb{T} \\stackrel{\\rho}{\\leftarrow} \\ldots\n$$\n\nwhich is precisely $S_{\\mathfrak{M}}$.\nRemark 4.25. One can show that $\\mathcal{O}_{\\Lambda\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{k}, \\mathfrak{m}\\right)} \\cong \\mathcal{F} \\ltimes \\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\cong \\mathrm{C}\\left(S_{\\mathfrak{M}}\\right) \\ltimes \\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}}$. In fact, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}}$ on $\\mathcal{F}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha: \\mathbb{Z}^{\\mathrm{k}} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut} \\mathcal{F}, \\alpha_{\\mathbf{n}}(A)=s_{\\nu} A s_{\\nu}^{*}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu$ is the unique path in $\\Lambda_{\\mathbb{1}_{k}}$ of degree $\\mathbf{n}$.\nAcknowledgements.

We focus on two extreme, but\ninteresting, classes - one is related to products of odometers and the other is\nrelated to Furstenberg's $\\times p,, \\times q$ conjecture. For the former\nclass, whose C*-algebras are studied by H. Li and the second author, we here\ncharacterize the factoriality of the associated von Neumann algebras and\nfurther determine their types; for the latter, we obtain their canonical Cartan\nsubalgebras. In the rank 1 case, we study a more general setting which\nencompasses (single-vertex) generalized Baumslag-Solitar semigroups. One of our\nmain tools is from self-similar higher rank graphs and their C*-algebras.", "updated": "2025-04-24T14:25:41Z", "published": "2024-05-11T17:37:59Z"}
