InTRODUCTION \n\nWe consider a complex manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ of complex dimension $n>1$. Let $\\Theta$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic tangent fields of $\\mathcal{M}$. Let $M=\\{\\rho<0\\}$ be a relatively compact domain with $C^{2}$ boundary in $\\mathcal{M}$. In this paper, we will prove the following.\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let $M$ be a relatively compact domain with $C^{2}$ boundary in $\\mathcal{M}$ with $H^{1}(M, \\Theta)=0$. Suppose that at each point of $b M$ the Levi form of $\\rho$ has $n-1$ positive eigenvalues or at least 3 negative eigenvalues. Fix $r_{0}>5 / 2$. There exists $\\delta>0$ satisfying the following: if $A \\in C_{(0,1)}^{1}(\\bar{M}, \\Theta)$ defines a formally integrable (see definition below) almost complex structure $H$ on $\\bar{M},\\|A\\|_{\\Lambda^{r_{0}}(M)}<\\delta$ and $A \\in \\Lambda^{r}(M)$ with $r_{0}<r \\leq \\infty$, then there exists an embedding $F \\in \\Lambda^{s}(M)$ for all $s<r+1 / 2$ from $\\bar{M}$ into $\\mathcal{M}$ that transforms $H$ into the complex structure on $F(\\bar{M})$.\n\nHere $\\Lambda^{r}(M)$ denotes the H\u00f6lder-Zygmund space defined in Section 3. See Theorem 8.2 for the full version of Theorem 1.1. The rest of the introduction provides the motivation of the main theorem and related open problems.\n\nGiven a complex manifold $\\mathcal{M}$, let $T \\mathcal{M}$ and $T \\mathcal{M} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ denote respectively its real and complex tangent bundles. Assume that $M \\Subset \\mathcal{M}$ is a relatively compact domain with $C^{2}$ boundary. The complex structure on $\\mathcal{M}$ or its restriction on $M$ will be denoted by $H_{\\text {st }}$. An almost complex structure on the closure $\\bar{M}$ is defined by a complex subbundle $H$ of $T_{\\mathbb{C}} \\bar{M}:=(T \\mathcal{M} \\otimes \\mathbb{C})|_{\\bar{M}}$ such that $T_{\\mathbb{C}} \\bar{M}=H \\oplus \\bar{H}$. For each $p \\in U_{k} \\cap \\bar{M}, H_{p}$ has a basis\n\n$$\nX_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}=\\sum_{\\beta=1}^{n}\\left\\{A_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\beta}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\beta}}+B_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\bar{\\beta}}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta}}\\right\\}, \\quad \\alpha=1, \\ldots, n\n$$\n\nwhen $z_{k}=\\left(z_{k}^{1}, \\ldots, z_{k}^{n}\\right)$ are holomorphic coordinates on $U_{k} \\subset \\mathcal{M}$ with $\\bar{M} \\subset \\cup U_{k}$. The almost complex structure will also be denoted by $H$. We always assume that $H$ has finite distance from the standard complex structure on $\\bar{M}$, i.e. $\\left(B_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)_{1 \\leq \\alpha, \\beta \\leq n}$ are invertible. By changing bases, we take $\\left(B_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)$ as the identity matrix. This determines $A_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\beta}$ uniquely and $A:=\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta} A_{k, \\bar{\\alpha}}^{\\beta}\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\alpha} \\otimes \\partial / \\partial z_{k}^{\\beta}$ is a global section of $\\Theta$-valued $(0,1)$ form on $\\bar{M} . H$ is formally integrable if it is closed under the Lie bracket $[H, H] \\subset H$, or equivalently, if $\\bar{\\partial} A=-\\frac{1}{2}[A, A]$ (see Section 3 for details).\n\nWe say that the almost complex structure $H$ is locally integrable on the interior of $M$ if for each $p \\in M$, there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ and a diffeomorphism\n\n$F$ from $U$ into $\\mathcal{M}$ such that $F_{*}(H)=H_{s t}$, i.e. $F_{*} X_{k, \\bar{\\pi}}$ are in the span of $\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{n}} ; 1 \\leq\\right.$ $\\beta \\leq n\\}$. Assuming the existence of $F$, since $\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{\\overline{\\mathbb{P}_{k}^{n}}\\right\\}$ is closed under the Lie bracket, we know that $H$ is closed under the Lie bracket. In other words, if $H$ is locally integrable on $M$ then it is formally integrable on $M$.\n\nThe celebrated Newlander-Nirenberg theorem [45] states that the converse is true locally. Namely, at each interior point $p$ of $M$, if $H$ is formally integrable near $p$, then there exists a neighborhood $U_{p}$ of $p$ in $M$ on which $H$ is integrable. In this case, we refer the corresponding diffeomorphism $F$ from $U_{p} \\Subset M$ into $\\mathcal{M}$ as a local embedding for $H$. This classical theorem now has several proofs due to Kohn [26], Malgrange [39] and Webster [58]. See Yao [61] for counter-examples on sharpness of the coordinate maps. The reader is also referred to the optimal regularity results in Street [57] on the elliptic structures in general.\n\nThe global analogue of the above result, known as the global Newlander-Nirenberg problem, can be stated as follows. Suppose the almost complex structure $H$ is formally integrable on $\\bar{M}$ and is sufficiently close to the complex structure on $\\mathcal{M}$, is $H$ integrable on $\\bar{M}$ ? i.e. does there exist a global embedding $F$ for $H: \\bar{M} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}$ ? Here by \"sufficiently close\" we mean that the $A$ given above is small in certain norms. A similar local boundary version of the Newlander-Nirenberg problem asks whether a formally integrable $H$ admits an embedding near boundary point of the domain $M$.\n\nIt turns out that certain geometric assumption on the boundary is needed for the global or boundary Newlander-Nirenberg theorem to hold. We now describe this phenomena. Following H\u00f6rmander [25], we say that the domain $M$ (or its boundary $b M$ ) satisfies the condition $a_{q}$, if $M=\\{\\rho(p)<0: p \\in \\mathcal{M}\\}$ has a $C^{2}$ definition function $\\rho$, and the Levi-form of $\\rho$ at each boundary point $p \\in U_{k} \\cap b M$, defined by $L_{p}(\\rho, t)=\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2} p}{\\partial z_{k}^{n} \\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{n}}(p) t^{\\alpha} \\overleftrightarrow{t^{\\beta}}$, has at least $n-q$ positive or $q+1$ negative eigenvalues on $T_{p}^{(1,0)}(b M):=\\left\\{\\sum_{\\alpha} t^{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{n}} \\left\\lvert\\,{ }_{p}: \\sum_{\\alpha} t^{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial z_{k}^{n}}(p)=0\\right.\\right\\}$. In [24], Hill showed that if the Levi form on the boundary of the domain has exactly 1 negative eigenvalue, then there are many formally integrable smooth almost complex structures for which local embedding for the structures fails to exist at each boundary point.\n\nWe now describe positive results. In pioneering work [18-20], Hamilton proved the existence of a $C^{\\infty}$ global embedding for $H$ on $\\bar{M}$ when both $H, b M$ are $C^{\\infty}$ and $M$ is $a_{1}$. Hamilton's result has to assume that the perturbation $A$ is small in some norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda^{\\prime \\circ}}$ with unspecified (large) $r_{0}$. Catlin [3] and Hanges-Jacobowitz [21] solved a local version of Newlander-Nirenberg problem near boundary points of a strong pseudoconvex domain. It is worth emphasizing that all these results are only for $C^{\\infty}$ category for the structures and the boundary of the domains, and the proofs are based on $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann type methods.\n\nWhen the domain is strongly pseudoconvex in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, Gan and the first-named author [11] showed the existence of global solutions that have a loss of derivatives with respect to the finite smoothness of the given almost complex structure. This result has been improved significantly in the very recent work of the second-named author [52].\n\nTherefore, Theorem 1.1 proves the existence of solution for the global NewlanderNirenberg problem on $a_{1}^{+}$domains (i.e. the ones satisfying $a_{1}, a_{2}$ conditions) with the almost $1 / 2$ regularity gain.\n\nTo prove Theorem 1.1, we will employ the homotopy formula methods together with a modified Nash-Moser type iteration. The idea is to find a sequence of embedding $F^{j}: M_{j} \\rightarrow M_{j+1}$, with $M_{0}=M$, so that the the error $A^{j}$ converges to 0 . We then show that the maps $\\widetilde{F}_{j}:=F^{j} \\circ F^{j-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ F^{0}$ converge to the embedding $F$ which is the solution.\n\nThese techniques were originally employed by Webster [58-60] to investigate the classical Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, the CR vector bundle problem, and the more challenging local CR embedding problem. These techniques, together with a more precise interior regularity estimate for Henkin's integral solution operators of $\\bar{\\partial}_{b}$ on strong pseudoconvex real hypersurfaces, were successfully used by GongWebster [15-17] to obtain a sharp version of CR vector bundle problem and the local CR embedding problem; see [12] also for a parameter version of FrobeniusNirenberg theorem by using similar techniques. The scheme of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is similar to the ones in Gan-Gong [12] and Shi [52]. However, we mention an important new feature in the present work. Here we must deal with the failure of local homotopy formula for $a_{1}$ domains near the concave side of the boundary. Noticeably, the lack of homotopy formulas with good estimates was shown by Nagel-Rosay [44] in the situation for local CR embedding problem in dimension 5. In our setting, it was proved by Laurent-Thi\u00e9baut and Leiterer [35, Prop. 0.7] that there is no local homotopy formula with good estimates for $(0, q)$ forms near a boundary point of the concave side of some $a_{q}$ domain.\n\nFor the proof Theorem 1.1, we construct a global homotopy formula on $a_{1}^{+}$ domains. Let us introduce notations. Note that for an $a_{q}$ domain $M, b M$ is the disjoint union of $b_{n-q}^{+} M$ and $b_{q+1}^{-} M$, where $b_{n-q}^{+} M$ (resp. $b_{q+1}^{-} M$ ) is the union of the components of $b M$ on which $L_{\\zeta}(\\rho, t)$ has at least $(n-q)$ positive (resp. $(q+1)$ negative) eigenvalues at each $\\zeta \\in b_{n-q}^{+} M$ (resp. $b_{q+1}^{-} M$ ). Define\n\n$$\n|\\rho|_{a}^{*}:=\\max \\left\\{|\\rho|_{C^{2}(\\mathcal{M})},\\|\\rho\\|_{\\Lambda^{n}(\\mathcal{N})}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor a fixed neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}$ of $b_{q+1}^{-} M$ in $\\mathcal{M}$. We say that $M$ is an $a_{q}^{+}$domain if it satisfies conditions $a_{q}$ and $a_{q+1}$.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose that $M$ defined by a $C^{2}$ function $\\rho$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies condition $a_{q}^{+}$with $q>0$. Let $V$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathcal{M}$. Assume that $H^{q}(D, \\mathcal{O}(V))$ vanishes. Let $r>0, \\varepsilon>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1 / 2$. Then\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} R_{q} \\varphi+R_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ is a $V$-valued $(0, q)$ form with $\\varphi, \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi \\in \\Lambda^{r}(M)$. Furthermore, for $j=q, q+1$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|R_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{r+\\delta}(M)} \\leq C_{r, \\delta, \\varepsilon}\\left(|\\rho|_{r+2+\\delta}^{*}|\\rho|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{b}\\|f\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(M)}+\\|f\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(M)}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere the positive constants $b, C_{r, \\delta, \\varepsilon}$ depend on $\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho$ and are stable under small perturbation of $\\rho$ as defined in Section 3.\n\nTheorem 1.2 on homotopy formulas for $a_{q}^{+}$domains in a complex manifold is interesting in its own right. We briefly mention a few related results. The construction of $\\bar{\\partial}$ solution operators for strongly pseudoconvex domains in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ has a long history. Almost $1 / 2$ gain for $\\bar{\\partial}$ solutions was obtained by Kerzman [28] and the exact $1 / 2$ gain estimate was obtained by Henkin-Ramanov [23]. For higher order derivative estimate with exact $1 / 2$ gain on H\u00f6lder spaces, $\\bar{\\partial}$ solution operators were constructed by Siu [55] for $(0,1)$ forms and by Lieb-Range [37] for $(0, q)$ forms for $q \\geq 1$ when the boundaries of the strongly pseudoconvex domains are\n\nsufficiently smooth. For a homotopy formula on strongly pseudoconvex domains in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with $C^{2}$ boundary, Gong [12] obtained the $1 / 2$ gain for H\u00f6lder-Zygmund spaces and Shi [52] obtained an almost $1 / 2$ gain for $L^{p}$ Sobolev spaces. In this paper we will use Rychkov extension introduced to the study of $\\bar{\\partial}$-problem by Shi-Yao [54]. We also mention that integral formulas and canonical solutions (with minimum $L^{2}$ norms) also play important roles in the study of Kerzman's problem [28] on super-normal estimates for polydiscs and more general product domains; a problem was solved recently by Li [36] and Yuan [63] independently. The interested reader should consult $[7,12,36,53,63]$ and references therein.\n\nIt is worthy to give an example for which Theorem 1.1 applies. Using a vanishing theorem on harmonic forms of Shaw [50, Thm. 2.2], we can prove the following global Newlander-Nirenberg theorem on a shell domain.\n\nCorollary 1.3. Let $D=D_{2} \\backslash \\bar{D}_{1}$, where $D_{1}, D_{2}$ are two bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with $C^{2}$ boundary in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}, \\overline{D_{1}} \\subset D_{2}$, and $n \\geq 4$. Assume that $r_{0}>5 / 2$. There exists $\\delta>0$ satisfying the following: if $r_{0} \\leq r<\\infty$ and $A \\in \\Lambda_{(0,1)}^{\\mathrm{r}}(D, \\Theta)$ satisfies $\\bar{\\partial} A=-\\frac{1}{2}[A, A]$ and $\\|A\\|_{\\Lambda^{r_{0}}(D)}<\\delta$, then the almost complex structure on $D$ defined by $A$ can be transformed into the standard complex structure on $F(D)$ via an embedding $F \\in \\Lambda^{s}(D)$ from $\\bar{D}$ into $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ for all $s<r+1 / 2$.\n\nWe conclude the introduction with the following open problems.\nProblem 1.4. In Theorem 1.2, replace $a_{q}^{+}$condition by $a_{q}$ condition on $M$ with $C^{2}$ boundary. Determine if there is a homotopy formula $f=\\bar{\\partial} A_{q} f+A_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} f$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\left\\|A_{j} g\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{r+1 / 2}(M)} \\leq C_{r}\\|g\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(M)}, \\quad j=q, q+1, \\forall r>0\n$$\n\nProblem 1.5. Under conditions of Theorem 1.1, determine if there is a solution $F \\in \\Lambda^{r+1 / 2}(M)$ when $A \\in \\Lambda^{r}(M)$.\n\nOne would expect that a solution to the last question would have applications. For instance, it might be helpful to settle the sharp regularity result left open in the local CR embedding problem $[17,38,60]$ for dimension 7 or higher.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2. OUTLINE OF THE PAPER \n\nSection 3 contains some elementary facts about the H\u00f6lder-Zygmund spaces $\\Lambda^{r}$. We construct a Moser type smoothing operator $S^{t}: C^{0}(\\bar{D}) \\rightarrow C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)\\right)$, where $D$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain. The important new feature here is that $S^{t} f$ is defined on a neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$ of $D$. This fact is needed to estimate each iterating embedding $F^{j}$, which is defined as the time-1 flow of the vector fields $-S^{t_{j}} P^{j} A^{j}$ for a sequence of $A^{j}$ on $M_{j}$ for Sections 7 and 8.\n\nIn Section 4, we derive estimates for the time-1 flow of a vector field. The main estimate is (4.5), where we estimate the $\\bar{\\partial}$ of the flow in terms of the $\\bar{\\partial}$ of the vector fields. We also prove the crucial estimate (3.8) for the commutator $\\left[\\nabla, S^{t}\\right]=\\nabla S^{t}-S^{t} \\nabla$, which is the key to obtaining optimal convergence in the Nash-Moser iteration. All results in Sections 3 and 4 can be applied in general situations beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nIn Section 5, we improve the local homotopy formulas constructed in [14] for $a_{q}^{+}$ domains by using an estimate on the commutator $[\\mathcal{E}, \\bar{\\partial}]$ for the Rychkov extension operator due to Shi-Yao $[53,54]$ on spaces $\\Lambda^{r}(M)$ when $0<r \\leq 1$.\n\nSection 6 contains proof of Theorem 1.2, i.e., the construction of a global homotopy formula on $a_{q}^{+}$domains. First, we use the Grauert bumping method and the local homotopy formulas to construct an approximate global homotopy formula on some bigger $C^{\\infty}$ domain $\\widetilde{M}$ that is a small $C^{2}$ perturbation of $M$, with $M \\Subset \\widetilde{M}$ and\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} T_{q} \\varphi+T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+K_{q} \\varphi, \\quad \\text { on } \\widetilde{M}\n$$\n\nHere $K_{q} \\varphi$ is a $(0, q)$ form with $C^{\\infty}(\\widetilde{M})$ coefficients (See Proposition 6.7.) We can then apply the $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann formula $I=\\square_{q} N_{q}+H_{q}^{0}$ to $K_{q} \\varphi$ on $\\widetilde{M}$ to get\n\n$$\nK_{q} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial}_{q-1} \\bar{\\partial}_{q-1}^{*} N_{q} K_{q} \\varphi+\\bar{\\partial}_{q}^{*} \\bar{\\partial}_{q} N_{q} K_{q} \\varphi+H_{q}^{0} K_{q} \\varphi\n$$\n\nThe operator $H_{q}^{0}$ maps $L_{(0, q)}^{2}(\\widetilde{M}, V)$ to the space of harmonic forms $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(\\widetilde{M}, V)$.\nA well-known result of H\u00f6rmander states that the condition $H^{q}(M, \\mathcal{O}(V))=0$ is stable under small perturbations of an $a_{q}$ domain and thus hold for $M$ replaced by $\\widetilde{M}$. Using this fact we can prove that $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(\\widetilde{M}, V)=0$ and thus $H_{q}^{0} K_{q} \\varphi=0$. See Theorem 6.10 for a general statement allowing non-vanishing of $H^{q}(M, \\mathcal{O}(V))$.\n\nNow $\\widetilde{M}$ is still an $a_{q}^{+}$domain since it is a small perturbation of $M$, and the $a_{q}^{+}$ condition allows us to commute $\\bar{\\partial}_{q}$ with $N_{q}: \\bar{\\partial}_{q} N_{q}=N_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}$, thus the second term on the right-hand side of (2.2) becomes $\\bar{\\partial}_{q}^{*} N_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial}_{q} K_{q} \\varphi$. Combining all these facts in (6.5) and (2.2) we obtained (Theorem 1.2) a global homotopy formula on $M$ :\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} R_{q} \\varphi+R_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{q} \\varphi:=T_{q}+\\bar{\\partial} \\partial^{*} N_{q} K_{q} \\varphi$ and $R_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi:=T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+\\bar{\\partial}^{*} N_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q} \\varphi$. We remark that $\\bar{\\partial} K_{q} \\varphi$ depends only on $\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi$ and not on $\\varphi$. This important fact follows from the Grauert-bumping procedure (Propoitions 6.4 and 6.6).\n\nSection 7 contains the main step in a Nash-Moser iteration for the proof of Theorem 1.1. We will finish the proof of the theorem in Section 8. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is more subtle when $M$ is not strongly pseudoconvex since Theorem 1.2 requires many derivatives for $b M$. We will solve this difficulty by combining the Hartogs's extension and the Nash-Moser iteration scheme.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3. Preliminaries \n\nIn this section, we first recall elementary properties of H\u00f6lder norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C^{\\alpha}(M)}$ with $0 \\leq a<\\infty$ and H\u00f6lder-Zygmund norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda^{\\alpha}(M)}$ with $0<a<\\infty$ where $M$ is a Lipschitz domain. For abbreviation, we also write $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C^{\\alpha}(M)}$ as $\\|\\cdot\\|_{M, a}$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda^{\\alpha}(M)}$ as $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{M, a}$.

For each $k$, we assume\n(i) there is a holomorphic coordinate map $\\psi_{k}$ from $U_{k}$ onto $\\hat{U}_{k} \\Subset \\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and $\\psi_{k}$ is biholomorphic on an open set $\\hat{U}_{k}$ containing $\\overline{U_{k}}$;\n(ii) $M_{k}:=U_{k} \\cap M \\neq \\emptyset, \\overline{U_{k}} \\subset M$ if $\\overline{U_{k}} \\cap b M \\neq \\emptyset$, and $D_{k}:=\\psi_{k}\\left(U_{k} \\cap M\\right)$ are Lipschitz domains;\n(iii) there is a partition of unity $\\left\\{\\chi_{k}\\right\\}$ such that $\\operatorname{supp} \\chi_{k} \\Subset U_{k}, \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{M})$, and $\\sum \\chi_{k}=1$ on a neighborhood $\\mathcal{U}$ of $\\bar{M}$, and set $\\hat{\\chi}_{j}=\\chi_{j} \\circ \\psi_{j}^{-1}$;\n(iv) for a subset $A$ of $E=\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, we use $\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}(A):=\\left\\{x \\in E: \\operatorname{dist}_{A}(x)<\\delta\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{dist}_{A}$ is the distance from $A$.\nWe will write $z_{k}=x_{k}+i y_{k}=\\psi_{k}=\\left(z_{k}^{1}, \\ldots, z_{k}^{n}\\right)$ as local holomorphic coordinates on $U_{k}$. We will write $\\nabla^{\\ell}$ as the set of partial derivatives of order $\\ell$ in local real coordinates. When $M^{\\prime}$ is a small $C^{2}$ perturbation of $M$, the above conditions are still satisfied for $M^{\\prime}$, without changing $\\psi_{k}, U_{k}, \\chi_{k}, \\mathcal{U}$.\n\nWe now use the local charts to define norms.\nLet $r=k+\\beta$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $0<\\beta \\leq 1$. Let $D$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let $\\|u\\|_{C^{r}(\\bar{D})}$ denote the standard H\u00f6lder norm for a function $u \\in C^{r}(\\bar{D})$. The H\u00f6lder-Zygmund space $\\Lambda^{\\beta}(D)$ is the set of functions $u \\in C^{0}(\\bar{D})$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{\\Lambda^{\\beta}(D)}:=\\sup _{x \\in D}|u(x)|+\\sup _{x, x+h, x+2 h \\in D, h \\neq 0}|h|^{-\\beta}\\left|\\Delta_{h}^{2} u(x)\\right|<\\infty\n$$\n\nHere $\\Delta_{h} u(x)=u(x+h)-u(x)$ and $\\Delta_{h}^{2} u(x)=u(x+h)+u(x+2 h)-2 u(x+h)$. When $r=k+\\beta$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $0<\\beta \\leq 1$, define $\\|u\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(D)}=\\|u\\|_{C^{k}(D)}+\\left\\|\\partial^{k} u\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{\\beta}(D)}$.\n\nWe also write $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C^{a}(D)}$ as $\\|\\cdot\\|_{D, a}$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda^{a}(D)}$ as $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{D, a}$.\nFor discussions on various equivalent forms of the norm $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{D, r}$ on bounded Lipschitz domains $D$, see [14, sect. 5]. For instance, a theorem in [1, Thm. 18.5, p. 63] says that $u \\in \\Lambda^{k+\\beta}(D)$ if and only if\n\n$$\n\\sup _{x \\in D}|u(x)|+\\sup _{x, x+h, \\ldots, x+(k+2) h \\in D, h \\neq 0}|h|^{-k-\\beta}\\left|\\Delta_{h}^{k+2} u(x)\\right|<\\infty\n$$\n\nFurther, the latter and $|u|_{D, k+\\beta}$ are equivalent norms.\nFor $r \\in[0, \\infty)$, we say that an $L^{2}$ function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ belongs to $H^{r}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ if\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{H^{r}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)}^{2}:=\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\\left(1+|\\xi|^{2}\\right)^{r}|\\hat{f}(\\xi)|^{2} d \\xi<\\infty\n$$\n\nIf $D$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$, let $H^{r}(D)$ be the set of functions $f \\in L^{2}(D)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{H^{r}(D)}:=\\inf _{\\left.\\tilde{f}\\right|_{D}=f}\\|\\tilde{f}\\|_{H^{r}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)}<\\infty\n$$\n\nAssume that $V$ is a holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathcal{M}$. We fix the coordinate charts so that $V$ over $U_{k}$ admits a holomorphic basis $\\left\\{e_{k, 1}, \\ldots, e_{k, m}\\right\\}$. For the holomorphic tangent bundle $\\Theta$ of $\\mathcal{M}$, we always use $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{l}}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{r}}$ as its basis on $U_{k}$.\n\nDefinition 3.1. When $u$ is a function on $\\bar{M}$, define $u_{k}=u \\circ \\psi_{k}^{-1}$ and\n\n$$\n|u|_{M, r}:=\\|u\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(M)}:=\\max _{k}\\left|u_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}, r}, \\quad\\|u\\|_{H^{r}(M)}:=\\max _{k}\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{H^{r}\\left(D_{k}\\right)}\n$$\n\nLet $\\varphi$ be a section $V$-valued $(0, q)$ forms on $\\bar{M}$ where $q=0,1, \\ldots, n$. Write $\\left.\\varphi\\right|_{U_{k}}=$ $\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\sum_{|I|=q} \\varphi_{k, I}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\left(d \\bar{z}_{k}\\right)^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$. Set\n\n$$\n|\\varphi|_{M, r}:=\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}(M)}:=\\max _{k, I, j}\\left|\\varphi_{k, I}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}, r}\n$$\n\nTo apply the Nash-Moser iteration, we need to consider domains $\\widetilde{M}$ that vary in $\\mathcal{M}$. However, these domains will be small $C^{2}$ perturbations of $M$. Thus, we can use the same coordinate charts $\\left\\{U, \\psi_{k}\\right\\}$ to define the norms $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r}$. We will also need to define norms of a diffeomorphism $F$ from $M$ onto its image that is a small perturbation of the identity mapping $\\operatorname{id}_{M}$. Thus, we can define the following.\n\nDefinition 3.2. Let $M, \\widetilde{M}$ be domains in $\\mathcal{M}$. Let $F: M \\rightarrow \\widetilde{M}$ be a diffeomorphism. Set\n\n$$\nF_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right):=\\psi_{k} F \\psi_{k}^{-1}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+f_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{k}$ are sufficiently small. Define $|F-\\left.\\mathrm{id}\\right|_{M, r}=\\max _{k}\\left|f_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}, r}$.\n3.3. Convexity of norms and stability of constants. For bounded Lipschitz domains, the following H\u00f6lder estimates for interpolation, product rule and chain rule are well-known.\n\nProposition 3.3. Let $M, \\widetilde{M}$ be Lipschitz domains in $\\mathcal{M}$. Let $\\varepsilon>0$. Then for $a>0$ and functions $u, v$ on $M$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& |u v|_{M, a} \\leq C_{a}\\left(|u|_{M, a}\\|v\\|_{M, 0}+\\|u\\|_{M, 0}|v|_{M, a}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left|\\frac{1}{u}\\right|_{M, a} \\leq C_{a, \\varepsilon}\\left(1+\\left|u^{-1}\\right|_{M, \\varepsilon}\\right)^{a+2}\\left(1+|u|_{M, \\varepsilon}^{a+1}\\right)|u|_{M, a}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSuppose that $g$ maps $M$ into $\\widetilde{M}$ and $\\|g-\\mathrm{id}\\|_{M ; 1}<C(M)^{-1}$. Then for $a>1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\|u \\circ g\\|_{M, 1} \\leq C_{\\varepsilon}\\|u\\|_{\\widetilde{M}, 1}\\left(1+|g|_{M, 1+\\varepsilon}\\right) \\\\\n& |u \\circ g|_{M, a} \\leq C_{a, \\varepsilon}\\left(|u|_{\\widetilde{M}, a}\\left(1+|g|_{M, 1+\\varepsilon}^{2}\\right)+|u|_{\\widetilde{M}, 1+\\varepsilon}|g|_{M, a}+\\|u\\|_{\\widetilde{M}, 0}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $C_{a}, C_{a, \\varepsilon}, C_{\\varepsilon}$ are stable under a small $C^{1}$ perturbation of $M$. The estimates hold for $\\varepsilon=0$ if all norms are replaced by the corresponding $\\|\\cdot\\|$ norms.\n\nProof. The case $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is proved in [15]. The general case is reduced to local coordinate charts via Definition 3.2.\n\nLemma 3.4. Let $\\left\\{M^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty}$ be a sequence of Lipschitz domains in $\\mathcal{M}$. Assume $F^{\\ell}$ maps $M^{\\ell}$ into $M^{\\ell+1}$ and all $M^{\\ell}$ are small perturbations of $M^{0}$. Suppose that $\\left\\|F^{\\ell}-i d\\right\\|_{M^{\\ell}, 1}<\\frac{1}{C\\left(M^{0}\\right) \\ell^{2}}$ for all $\\ell \\geq 0$. Then for $\\varepsilon>0, r>1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|u \\circ F^{m-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ F^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}^{m+1}\\left\\{|u|_{M^{m}, r}+\\sum_{i}|u|_{M^{m}, 1+\\varepsilon}|f^{i}\\right|_{M^{i}, r} \\\\\n& \\left.+|u|_{M^{m}, r}|f^{i}\\right|_{M^{i}, 1+\\varepsilon} ^{2}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe estimates hold for $\\varepsilon=0$ and $r \\geq 0$ if all norms are replaced by the corresponding $\\|\\cdot\\|$ norms.\n\nProof. When $\\mathcal{M}$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, the lemma is in [15]. In general case, we need to use Definition 3.2. Thus, we write\n\n$$\nu \\circ F^{m} \\circ \\cdots \\circ F^{0} \\circ \\psi_{k}^{-1}=\\tilde{u} \\circ \\tilde{F}^{m} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\tilde{F}^{0}\n$$\n\nwith $\\tilde{F}_{k}^{j}=\\psi_{k} \\circ F^{j} \\circ \\psi_{k}^{-1}$ and $\\tilde{u}_{k}=u \\circ \\psi_{k}^{-1}$. Then the estimate follows from the definition and the lemma for $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n3.4. Smoothing operators. We now modify the smoothing operator in Moser [43] as follows.\n\nLemma 3.5. Fix an integer $m_{*} \\geq 0$. Let $\\omega$ be an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. There is a smooth function $\\mu$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with compact support in $\\omega$ such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} x^{I} \\mu(x) d x=0$ for $I \\in \\mathbb{N}^{d}$ with $0<|I| \\leq m_{*}$ and $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\mu(x) d x=1$.\n\nProof. Consider $d=1$. Given an interval $(a, a+\\varepsilon)$. Let us find smooth functions $\\chi_{0}, \\ldots, \\chi_{m_{*}}$ with compact support in $(a, a+\\varepsilon)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{j} c_{j} \\chi_{j}(t) d t=1, \\quad \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\sum_{j} c_{j} \\chi_{j}(t) t^{i} d t=0, \\quad i=1, \\ldots, m_{*}\n$$\n\nIt suffices to find $\\chi_{0}, \\ldots, \\chi_{m_{*}}$ such that\n\n$$\nA_{m_{*}}:=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\chi_{0}(t) d t & \\cdots & \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\chi_{m_{*}}(t) d t \\\\\n\\vdots & \\cdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} t^{m_{*}} \\chi_{0}(t) d t & \\cdots & \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} t^{m_{*}} \\chi_{m_{*}}(t) d t\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nis non-singular.\nThe case $m_{*}=0$ is trivial. Suppose we have found $\\chi_{0}, \\ldots, \\chi_{m_{*}-1}$ so that $A_{m_{*}-1}$ is non-singular. By row reduction, we find a matrix $B_{m_{*}}$ such that $B_{m_{*}} A_{m_{*}}=$ $\\left(c_{i j}\\right)_{0 \\leq i, j \\leq m_{*}}$ is an upper triangular matrix with all diagonal entries being non-zero except for possible the last one:\n\n$$\nc_{m_{*} m_{*}}=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\chi_{m_{*}}(t) p(t) d t, \\quad p(t)=t^{m_{*}}-b_{0}-\\cdots-b_{m_{*}-1} t^{m_{*}-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $b_{i}$ depend only on $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} t^{i} \\chi_{j}(t) d t$ for $i=0, \\ldots, m_{*}$ and $j<m_{*}$. Since $p$ is not identically zero on $(a, a+\\varepsilon)$, we can find a desired $\\chi_{m_{*}}$. Now $\\mu(t)=\\sum_{j} c_{j} \\chi_{j}(t)$ satisfies the condition when $d=1$.\n\nFor $d>1$, we can take $\\mu(x)=\\mu_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\cdots \\mu_{d}\\left(x_{d}\\right)$ for suitable $\\mu_{1}, \\ldots, \\mu_{d}$.\nWe now prove additional properties for the Moser smooth operator. A useful feature of the smoothing operator is that it extends functions form $D$ to a fixed and slightly larger domain.\n\nLemma 3.6. Fix a positive integer $m_{*}$. Let $D \\Subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be a Lipschitz domain. There exist operators\n\n$$\nS^{t}: C^{0}(\\bar{D}) \\rightarrow C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)\\right), \\quad t \\in(0,1]\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|S^{t} u\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D), r} \\leq C_{r, s} t^{s-r}|u|_{D, s}, \\quad 0<s \\leq r<\\infty \\\\\n& \\left|\\left(I-S^{t}\\right) E u\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D), s} \\leq C_{r, s} t^{r-s}|u|_{D, r}, \\quad 0<s \\leq r+m_{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere the constants $C_{r, s}$ depend only on $r, s, m_{*}$ and the Lipschitz norm of $D$. Further, when $u \\in \\Lambda^{r}(D)$ with $0<r \\leq 1$, the $\\left[\\nabla, S^{t}\\right] u$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla, S^{t}\\right] u=\\lim _{z \\rightarrow 0^{+}}\\left[\\nabla, S^{t}\\right] S^{c} u\n$$\n\nThe same estimates hold for the H\u00f6lder norms including $r=0$.\nProof. We will use a similar construction in [52]. We cover $\\bar{D}$ by finitely many open balls $B_{j}$ where $\\left\\{B_{j}\\right\\}$ is a stable covering for a small perturbation on $D$, namely $B_{j} \\Subset D$ if $B_{j} \\cap \\partial D \\neq \\emptyset$. Let $\\left\\{\\chi_{j}\\right\\}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to $\\left\\{B_{j}\\right\\}$. Thus, $\\sum \\chi_{j}=1$ on $\\mathcal{U}$ where $\\mathcal{U}$ is a fixed neighborhood of $\\bar{D}$.\n\nLet $E: C^{0}(\\bar{D}) \\rightarrow C_{0}^{0}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ be the Stein extension operator [56]. Note that $E$ is linear and\n\n$$\n|E f|_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}, a} \\leq C_{a}(D)|f|_{D, a}, a>0 ; \\quad\\|E f\\|_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}, a} \\leq C_{a}(D)\\|f\\|_{D, a}, a \\geq 0\n$$\n\nLet $f_{j}=\\chi_{j} f$, which is well-defined on $\\bar{D}$. Note that $f_{j}$ vanishes on $\\mathcal{N}_{c_{1}}\\left(\\bar{D} \\backslash B_{j}\\right)$ for some $c_{1}>0$. We have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp} \\chi_{j} \\Subset D \\quad \\text { or } \\quad B_{j} \\cap \\partial D \\neq \\emptyset\n$$\n\nThus we can find an open set $\\omega_{j}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{t}\\left(B_{j} \\cap D\\right)-t \\omega_{j} \\subset \\bar{D}, \\quad \\forall t \\in[0,1]\n$$\n\nFix a compact set $K_{j}$ such that its interior $K_{j}^{o}$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\emptyset \\neq K_{j}^{o} \\subset K_{j} \\subset \\omega_{j}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 3.5, we find a smooth function $\\mu_{j}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that $\\int y^{I} \\mu_{j}(y) d y=0$ for $|I|>0, \\int \\mu_{j}(y) d y=1$ and\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{supp} \\mu_{j} \\subset K_{j}^{o}\n$$\n\nBy (3.10)-(3.12), for $t \\in[0,1]$\n\n$$\nS_{j}^{t} f_{j}(x)=\\int_{y \\in \\omega_{j}} f_{j}(x-t y) \\mu_{j}(y) d y\n$$\n\nis a well-defined smooth function on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}\\left(B_{j} \\cap D\\right)$. Now by adjusting $\\omega_{j}$ if necessary we have $S_{j}^{t} f_{j}=0$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{c_{1}}\\left(\\bar{D} \\cap \\partial B_{j}\\right)$ for some $c_{1}>0$. Define $S_{j}^{t} f_{j}=0$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}\\left(D \\backslash B_{j}\\right)$. Then $S_{j}^{t} f_{j}$ is smooth on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$. We still have (3.13) and\n\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla, S_{j}^{t}\\right] f_{j}=0\n$$\n\nLet $E_{j} f=\\chi_{j} E f$. By (3.10) and (3.13), $S_{j}^{t} f_{j}=S_{j}^{t} E_{j} f$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$. In other words, on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D), S_{j}^{t} E_{j} f$ is independent of $E_{j}$.\n\nBy properties of Moser's smoothing operator, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|S_{j}^{t} E_{j} f\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D), r} \\leq C_{r, s} t^{s-r}\\left|E_{j} f\\right|_{D_{j}, s} \\leq C_{r, s}^{\\prime} t^{s-r}|f|_{D, s}, 0<s \\leq r<\\infty \\\\\n\\left|\\left(I-S_{j}^{t}\\right) E_{j} f\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D), r} \\leq C_{r, s} t^{s-r}\\left|E_{j} f\\right|_{D_{j}, s} \\leq C_{r, s}^{\\prime} t^{s-r}|f|_{D, s}, 0<r \\leq s+m_{*}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nNote that these properties are usually stated for H\u00f6lder norms; via interpolation they hold for Zygmund norms too. The reader is referred to [14, sect. 5], for instance, on the equivalence of norms when interpolation is applied.\n\nOn $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$, we define\n\n$$\nS^{t} f:=\\sum S_{j}^{t}\\left(\\chi_{j} f\\right)\n$$\n\nWe obtain (3.4)-(3.7) immediately from the estimates for $S_{j}^{t}$ and the inequality\n\n$$\n\\left|\\chi_{j} f\\right|_{r} \\leq C_{r}|f|_{r}\n$$\n\nvia (3.2). We now prove (3.8). We first consider the case that $r>1$. We have $S^{t}(\\nabla f)=\\sum S_{j}^{t}\\left(\\chi_{j} \\nabla f\\right)$. On $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$, by (3.14)\n\n$$\n\\nabla S^{t} f=\\sum S_{j}^{t}\\left(\\nabla\\left(\\chi_{j} f\\right)\\right)=S^{t} \\nabla f+\\sum S_{j}^{t}\\left(f \\nabla \\chi_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo finish the proof, we use the crucial fact that $S_{j}^{t}\\left(f \\nabla \\chi_{j}\\right)=S_{j}^{t}\\left(E f \\nabla \\chi_{j}\\right)$ by (3.10). Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\left[\\nabla, S^{t}\\right] f=\\sum\\left(S_{j}^{t}-\\mathrm{id}\\right)\\left(E f \\nabla \\chi_{j}\\right)+E f \\sum \\nabla \\chi_{j}\n$$\n\nThe last sum vanishes since $\\sum_{j} \\chi_{j}=1$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(D)$. Now (3.8) for $r>1$ follows from (3.6)-(3.7).\n\nConsider now $0<r \\leq 1$. By (3.7), the $S^{\\varepsilon} u$ converges to $u$ in $C^{0}(\\bar{D})$ norm as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. Since (3.8) holds when $u$ is replaced by $S^{\\varepsilon} u$, we have\n\n$$\n|h|^{-r}\\left|\\Delta_{h}^{2} u(x)\\right|=\\lim _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0}|h|^{-r}\\left|\\Delta_{h} S^{\\varepsilon} u(x)\\right| \\leq C_{r, s} t^{s-r} \\liminf _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\left|S^{\\varepsilon} u\\right|_{s} \\leq C_{r, s} t^{s-r}|u|_{s}\n$$\n\nfor any $x, x+h, x+2 h \\in D$ and $h \\neq 0$. This verifies (3.8) via equivalent norms.\nNext, we extend the above definition and properties of $S^{t}$ for sections of holomorphic vector bundles on $M$. For our use, we will replace $\\nabla$ by the global operator $\\bar{\\partial}$.\n\nRecall that $\\left\\{U_{k}\\right\\}$ is an open covering of $\\bar{M}$ and $z_{k}=\\psi_{k}: U_{k} \\rightarrow \\hat{U}_{k}$ are coordinate maps. Let $\\left\\{\\chi_{k}\\right\\}$ be a partition of unity subordinated to $\\left\\{U_{k}\\right\\}$ such that $\\sqrt{\\chi_{k}} \\in$ $C^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{M}), \\sum \\chi_{k}=1$ in a neighborhood $\\mathcal{U}$ of $M$ and $\\operatorname{supp} \\chi_{k} \\Subset U_{k}$ and let $\\hat{\\chi}_{k}=$ $\\chi_{k} \\circ \\psi_{k}^{-1}$. Let $D_{k}=\\psi_{k}\\left(M_{k}\\right)$.\n\nSet $M_{t}=\\cup \\psi_{k}^{-1}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{t}\\left(D_{k}\\right)\\right)$ for $t>0$, which is a neighborhood of $\\bar{M}$ in $\\mathcal{M}$.\nDefinition 3.7. Let $V$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathcal{M}$ with holomorphic basis $\\left\\{e_{k, 1}, \\ldots, e_{k, m}\\right\\}$ on $U_{k}$. Suppose that $v=\\sum_{j, I} v_{k, I}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ is in $C_{0, q}^{0}(\\bar{M}, V)$. Define an extension $E v \\in C_{(0, q)}^{0}(\\mathcal{M}, V)$ by\n\n$$\nE v:=\\sum_{k} \\sum_{|I|=q} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\tilde{v}_{k, I}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\\left(z_{k}\\right), \\quad\\left|\\tilde{v}_{k, I}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r} \\leq C_{r}|v|_{M, r}\n$$\n\nHere $\\tilde{v}_{k, I}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=\\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} E_{D_{k}}\\left(\\hat{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ on $\\mathcal{M}$ (and $\\tilde{v}_{k, I}^{j}=0$ on $\\mathcal{M} \\backslash U_{k}$ ).\n\nLet $S_{k}^{t}$ be a smoothing operator for functions on $D_{k}=\\psi_{k}\\left(U_{k} \\cap M\\right)$ satisfying Lemma 3.6. Then $\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k} \\check{v}_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\check{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}$ is smooth on $U_{k} \\cap \\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$ and vanishes on $\\mathcal{N}_{c_{2}}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M) \\cap \\partial U_{k}\\right.$ for some $\\left.c_{2}>0\\right)$. Hence, it is well-defined and smooth on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$ by setting it to be zero on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)) \\backslash U_{k} \\cap \\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$.\nDefinition 3.8. Let $v \\in C_{[0, q)}^{0}(\\bar{M}, V)$. Define on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$\n\n$$\nS^{t} v=\\sum_{k} \\sum_{|I|=q} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\check{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\n$$\n\nHere $\\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} \\check{v}_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right)$, vanishing on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M) \\backslash U_{k}$, are smooth on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$.\nNote that on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$, the $S^{t} E v=S^{t} v$ depends only on the values of $v$ on $M$.

The first two inequalities follows from (3.16), (3.17), and the previous lemma immediately.\n\nWe now estimate $\\left[\\bar{\\partial}, S^{t}\\right]$. Recall that on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M) \\cap U_{k}, S^{t}(\\bar{\\partial} v)$ depends only on the value of $\\bar{\\partial} v$ on $M$.

Therefore, on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$ we can express\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\partial} S^{t} v= & \\sum_{k, j, I} \\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\wedge d \\check{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{k, j, I} \\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} \\wedge\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\check{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k, j, I} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\check{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\wedge d \\check{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\left[\\bar{\\partial}, S^{t}\\right] v=} & \\sum_{k, j, I} \\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} \\wedge\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(\\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\tilde{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k, j, I} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\left(S_{k}^{t}\\left(v_{k, I}^{j} \\bar{\\partial} \\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\wedge d \\tilde{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{k, j, I} \\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} \\wedge\\left(\\left(S_{k}^{t}-I\\right)\\left(\\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\tilde{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k, j, I} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\left(\\left(S_{k}^{t}-I\\right)\\left(v_{k, I}^{j} \\bar{\\partial} \\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2}\\right)\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\wedge d \\tilde{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k, j, I}\\left(\\left(2 \\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2} \\bar{\\partial} \\tilde{\\chi}_{k}^{1 / 2}\\right)\\left(v_{k, I}^{j}\\right)\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\right) \\wedge d \\tilde{z}_{k}^{I} \\otimes e_{k, j}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe last summation is zero, as it equals $\\sum_{k}\\left(2 \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2} \\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{k}^{1 / 2}\\right) \\wedge v$ and $\\sum \\chi_{k}=1$. Now the lemma follows from (3.7) and the smooth approximation of $v$ via $S^{c} v$ for (3.20) when $s \\in(0,1]$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. Estimates of the flows \n\nIn this section, we describe a formally integrable complex structure that has finite distance to the complex structure of $\\mathcal{M}$ in a $C^{1}$ section of $\\Theta$-valued $(0,1)$ form on $\\bar{M}$. We show the time-one mapping $F^{1}$ of the smoothing $S^{t} v$ of a vector filed $v$ defined on $M$ can be estimated on the same domain $M$. We also derive estimates for $\\bar{\\partial} F^{1}$ in terms of $\\bar{\\partial} v$ for non-holomorphic $v$.\n4.1. Almost complex structures in coordinate charts. An almost complex structure $X$ on $\\bar{M}$ that has a finite distance to the standard complex structure on $\\mathcal{M}$ is given in local coordinates $z_{k}$ by\n\n$$\nX_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\alpha}}+\\sum_{\\beta} A_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\beta}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\beta}}, \\quad \\alpha=1, \\ldots, n\n$$\n\nBy definition, the span of $\\left\\{X_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}\\right\\}$ is the same as the span of $\\left\\{X_{j, \\bar{\\sigma}}\\right\\}$ on $U_{k} \\cap U_{j}$. Thus $A:=A_{k, \\bar{\\beta}}^{\\alpha}\\left(z_{k}\\right) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}} \\in C_{(0,1)}^{1}(\\bar{M}, \\Theta)$ is a global section. We have\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} A=\\sum_{\\beta<\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta}} A_{k, \\bar{\\gamma}}^{\\alpha}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\gamma}} A_{k, \\bar{\\beta}}^{\\alpha}\\right) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\gamma} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nThe formal integrability means that $\\left[X_{\\alpha}, X_{\\beta}\\right]$ is in the span of $X_{k, \\bar{\\gamma}}, \\ldots, X_{k, \\bar{\\pi}}$. One can check that equivalently, we have $\\left[X_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}, X_{k, \\bar{\\beta}}\\right]=0$, i.e. $\\bar{\\partial} A=-\\frac{1}{2}[A, A]$, where in local coordinates the Lie bracket is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{[A, A]: } & =\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma} Q_{k, \\overline{\\beta \\gamma}}^{\\alpha}(A) d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\gamma} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}} \\\\\nQ_{k, \\overline{\\beta \\gamma}}^{\\alpha}(A) & :=\\sum_{\\tau} A_{k, \\bar{\\beta}}^{\\tau}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial A_{\\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\alpha}}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\tau}}-A_{k, \\bar{\\gamma}}^{\\tau}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial A_{k, \\bar{\\beta}}^{\\alpha}}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\tau}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe standard complex structure on $M$ corresponds to $A=0$.\n\nWe will use the following lemma in Webster [58] showing how an almost complex structure changes with respect to a transformation of the form $F=\\mathrm{id}+f$ where $I$ is the identity mapping. It provides a useful formula for $A^{\\prime}$ in terms of $A$ and $F$.\n\nWe will use matrix $A_{k}=\\left(A_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\alpha}\\right)_{1 \\leq \\alpha, \\beta \\leq n}$. Denote by $I$ the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\nLemma 4.1. Let $M$ be a relatively compact domain in $\\mathcal{M}$ with $C^{2}$ boundary and let $M^{\\prime} \\Subset \\mathcal{M}$ be a small $C^{2}$ perturbation of $M$. Let $\\left\\{X_{\\bar{\\sigma}}\\right\\}_{\\alpha=1}^{n}$ be a $C^{1}$ almost complex structure on an open set $\\bar{M}$ that has finite distance to the standard complex structure on $M$. Let $F$ be a $C^{1}$ mapping from $\\bar{M}$ onto $\\bar{M}^{\\prime}$. Let $F_{k}=\\psi_{k} F \\psi_{k}^{-1}=\\mathrm{id}+f_{k}$. There is a constant $\\delta$ depends on $\\|A\\|_{0}$ such that if\n\n$$\n\\|F-\\mathrm{id}\\|_{M, 1}<\\delta\n$$\n\nthen $F$ is a $C^{1}$ diffeomorphism and $\\left(F_{k}\\right)_{*} X_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}$ are in the span of\n\n$$\nX_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\alpha}}+\\sum_{\\beta} A_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\prime \\beta}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\beta}}, \\quad \\alpha=1, \\ldots, n\n$$\n\nFurthermore, $X_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}} F_{k}^{\\beta}=\\left(X_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}} F_{k}^{\\bar{\\sigma}}\\right)\\left(A^{\\prime \\beta}{ }_{k, \\bar{\\sigma}}^{\\beta} \\circ F_{k}\\right)$. Equivalently, as matrices,\n(4.1) $A_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)+\\left(f_{k}\\right)_{\\bar{z}_{k}}+A_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\left(f_{k}\\right)_{\\bar{z}_{k}}=\\left(I+\\left(\\bar{f}_{k}\\right)_{\\bar{z}_{k}}+A_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{f}_{k}\\right)_{z_{k}}\\right) A_{k}^{\\prime} \\circ F_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, a $C^{2}$ diffeomorphism from $M$ onto $M^{\\prime}$ that is close to the identity transforms $A \\in C_{(0,1)}^{1}(M, \\Theta)$ into $A^{\\prime} \\in C_{(0,1)}^{1}\\left(M^{\\prime}, \\Theta\\right)$ that still satisfies $\\bar{\\partial} A^{\\prime}=$ $-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[A^{\\prime}, A^{\\prime}\\right]$ on $M^{\\prime}$. Thus, the solution to the global Newlander-Nirenberg theorem is meant to find an $F$ with a desired regularity such that $F$ transforms $A$ into $A^{\\prime}=0$, according to the relation (4.1).\n4.2. Time-one maps of vector fields of type $(1,0)$. The advantage of expressing an almost complex structure via a global section $A \\in C_{(0, r)}^{1}(M, \\Theta)$ is to use the time-one map of a global section $v \\in C^{1}(M, \\Theta)$ to transform the structure. This however requires the vector fields to be defined on a domain slightly larger than $M$.\n\nWe will study the flows of a type $(1,0)$ vector field $v$ on $\\mathcal{M}$, i.e. the $v$ that has the form $v=\\sum v_{k}^{\\alpha}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}}$, and let $F^{\\lambda}$ be its flow. We will also estimate $\\bar{\\partial} F^{\\lambda}$ in terms of $\\bar{\\partial} v$. Define\n\n$$\n\\psi_{k} F^{\\lambda} \\psi_{k}^{-1}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+f_{k}^{\\lambda}\\left(z_{k}\\right), \\quad f_{k}^{\\lambda}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=\\lambda v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)+w_{k}\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right)\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\left\\{U_{k}\\right\\}$ covers a neighborhood of $\\bar{M}$. In the following, let us denote\n\n$$\n|v|_{\\mathcal{N}_{a}(M), r}=\\max _{k, \\alpha}|v_{k}^{\\alpha}|_{\\mathcal{N}_{a}\\left(D_{k}\\right), r}\n$$\n\nDefine $\\|v\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{a}(M), r}$ analogously. Define\n\n$$\n|v|_{r}=\\max \\left|v_{k}\\right|_{U_{k}, r}, \\quad\\|v\\|_{r}=\\max \\left\\|v_{k}\\right\\|_{U_{k}, r}\n$$\n\nWhen we smooth a vector field $v$ on $M, S^{t} v$ is defined on a slightly large domain $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$. This allows us to estimate the time-one map of the smoothed vector field without shrinking the original domain. More precisely, we have the following.\nProposition 4.2. Let $M$ be a relatively compact Lipschitz domain in $\\mathcal{M}$. Let $v=\\sum v_{k}^{\\alpha}\\left(z_{k}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}}$ be a $C^{1}$ vector field defined on $\\mathcal{M}$ and let $F^{\\lambda}$ be its flow. There are positive constants $C_{n}, \\delta_{0}, \\delta_{1}, \\delta_{1}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{2}$ such that if $\\|v\\|_{1} \\leq \\delta_{1}$, then the flow $F^{\\lambda}$ of $v$ is well-defined on $\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{0}}(M)$ for $\\lambda \\in[-1,1]$ and\n\n$$\nF^{\\lambda}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}(M)\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta+C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0}}(M), \\quad 0 \\leq \\delta \\leq \\delta_{0}, \\quad \\lambda \\in[-1,1]\n$$\n\nIn particular, when $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq \\delta_{0}$ and $C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0} \\leq \\delta_{0}$,\n\n$$\nM^{1}:=F^{1}(M) \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0}}(M), \\quad F^{-1}\\left(M^{1}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{C_{n}\\left(C_{n}+1\\right)\\|v\\|_{0}}(M)\n$$\n\nFurther, for fixed $\\varepsilon>0, w_{k}:=F_{k}^{\\lambda}-\\mathrm{id}-\\lambda v_{k}$ satisfy the following\n(a) If $|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}<\\delta_{1, \\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon}$ and $r>1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|w_{k}(\\cdot, \\lambda)\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right), r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}(M)|v|_{r}^{*} \\\\\n& \\left|w_{k}(\\cdot, \\lambda)\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right), r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}(M)|v|_{r+1}^{*}|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) If $|v|_{2+\\varepsilon}<\\delta_{2, \\varepsilon}$ and $r>1$, then\n\n$$\n\\left|\\bar{\\partial} w_{k}(\\cdot, \\lambda)\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right), r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|\\bar{\\partial} v|_{r+1}^{*}|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*}+C_{r, \\varepsilon}(M)|\\bar{\\partial} v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*}|v|_{r+1}^{*}\n$$\n\nHere $|v|_{r}^{*}=|v|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta+C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0}}(M), r}$. Further, $C_{n}$ depends only on $n$, and $C_{r, \\varepsilon}(M), \\delta_{0}$, $\\delta_{1}, \\delta_{1, \\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon}, \\delta_{2, \\varepsilon}$ are stable under small perturbations of $b M$. The estimates (4.3)-(4.5) hold for $\\varepsilon=0$ if all $|\\cdot|$ norms are replaced by the corresponding $\\|\\cdot\\|$ norms.\n\nProof. The uniqueness and the local existence of $C^{1}$ flows for $C^{1}$ vector fields is a standard theorem; see [33, Thm. 4.2]. We need to verify (4.2) and the rest of estimates.\n\nRecall that $z_{k}$ maps $U_{k}, U_{k}^{\\prime}$ onto $\\hat{U}_{k}, \\hat{U}_{k}^{\\prime}$ respectively. In the coordinate chart $\\left(U_{k}, z_{k}\\right)$, let $v_{k}=\\left(v_{k}^{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}^{n}\\right)$ be the components of $v$. Write $F^{\\lambda}$ as\n\n$$\nF_{k}^{\\lambda}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+\\lambda v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)+w_{k}\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right)\n$$\n\nIt suffices to solve for $\\lambda \\in[-1,1]$\n\n$$\nw_{k}\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right)=\\left(T_{k} w_{k}\\right)\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{k}$ is the map defined by\n\n$$\n\\left(T_{k} w_{k}\\right)\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right):=\\int_{0}^{\\lambda}\\left\\{v_{k}\\left(z_{k}+s v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)+w_{k}\\left(z_{k}, s\\right)\\right)-v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\right\\} d s\n$$\n\nLet $B^{0}$ be the set of families $\\left\\{w_{k}\\right\\}$, where $w_{k}$ is a $C^{0}$ mapping from $\\widehat{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right)} \\times[-1,1]$ into the polydisc $\\overline{\\Delta_{2 a}^{n}}$ with $a=\\left\\|v_{k}\\right\\|_{U_{k} ; 0}$. On $B^{0}$, we use the metric\n\n$$\nd\\left(\\tilde{w}_{k}, w_{k}\\right)=\\left\\|\\tilde{w}_{k}-w_{k}\\right\\|_{0}\n$$\n\nHere and in what follows, we denote $\\left\\|w_{k}\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right) \\times[0,1], r},\\left|w_{k}\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right) \\times[0,1], r}$ by $\\left\\|w_{k}\\right\\|_{r}$ and $\\left|w_{k}\\right|_{r}$ respectively.\n\nWe now choose $C$ so large that $z_{k}+s \\tilde{v}_{k}+\\tilde{w}_{k} \\in \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta+C_{2}^{2} v_{k} \\|_{0}}\\left(D_{k}\\right)$, when\n\n$$\nz_{k} \\in \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right), \\quad \\tilde{v}_{k} \\in \\Delta_{a}^{n}, \\quad \\tilde{w}_{k} \\in \\Delta_{2 a}^{n}\n$$\n\nBy the contraction mapping theorem, when $\\left\\|v_{k}\\right\\|_{\\hat{U}_{k}, 1}<\\delta_{1}$, there is a unique solution $w_{k} \\in B^{0}$ satisfying (4.6). Thus, $w_{k}$ satisfies\n\n$$\nw_{k}\\left(z_{k}, \\lambda\\right)=\\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{k}\\left(z_{k}+s v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)+w_{k}\\left(z_{k}, s\\right)\\right)-v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right) d s\n$$\n\nTo simplify notation, we drop subscript $k$ in $w, v$. We write $w_{z}$ and $w_{\\bar{z}}$ for the Jacobean matrices in $z$ and $\\bar{z}$, respectively. Write $\\bar{v}(z)=\\overline{v(z)}$. We also write\n\n$|w(\\cdot, \\lambda)|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right), a}$ as $|w(\\cdot, \\lambda)|_{a}$. Differentiating (4.7), we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{z}(z, \\lambda)= & \\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{z}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))-v_{z}(z) d s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{z}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))\\left(s v_{z}(z)+w_{z}(z, s)\\right) d s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{\\bar{z}}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))\\left(s \\bar{v}_{z}(z)+\\bar{w}_{z}(z, s)\\right) d s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the $\\bar{z}$ derivatives, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{\\bar{z}}(z, \\lambda)= & \\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{\\bar{z}}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))-v_{\\bar{z}}(z) d s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{z}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))\\left(s v_{\\bar{z}}(z)+w_{\\bar{z}}(z, s)\\right) d s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{\\lambda} v_{\\bar{z}}(z+s v(z)+w(z, s))\\left(s \\bar{v}_{\\bar{z}}(z)+\\bar{w}_{\\bar{z}}(z, s)\\right) d s \\\\\n= & I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the contraction mapping again, one can show that when $v \\in \\Lambda^{r}$ with $r>1, w_{(z, \\bar{z})}(\\cdot, \\lambda)$ are in $\\Lambda^{r-1}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta}\\left(D_{k}\\right)\\right)$ when $\\lambda$ is fixed.\n\nWe will first derive estimate (4.3). Suppose $r>1$. By (4.7) and (3.5), we get\n\n$$\n|w(\\cdot, \\lambda)|_{r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left\\{|v|_{r}^{*}(1+|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*}+\\sup _{|s| \\leq|\\lambda|}|w(\\cdot, s)|_{1+\\varepsilon}\\right)^{1+2 \\varepsilon}+|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*}\\left(|v|_{r}^{*}+\\sup _{|s| \\leq|\\lambda|}|w(\\cdot, s)|_{r}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nUsing $\\sup _{|s| \\leq 1}|w(\\cdot, s)|_{1+\\varepsilon} \\leq C_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime}|v|_{1+\\varepsilon}^{*} \\leq C_{\\varepsilon} \\delta_{1, \\varepsilon}^{\\prime}<1 / 2$, we solve for $\\sup _{|s| \\leq 1}|w(\\cdot, s)|_{r}$. This yields (4.3) immediately.\n\nWe now use (4.3) to derive better estimates.

Then the estimates in Theorem 5.5 imply that the homotopy formula holds for $\\varphi$; see the end of proof of Lemma 3.6 for more details.\n\nProposition 5.9. Let $r \\in(1, \\infty)$ and $1 \\leq q \\leq n-3$. Let $\\left(D^{1}, D^{2}, D^{3}\\right)$ be a $(q+2)$-concave configuration. Assume that $r_{4}<r_{3} / C_{n}$. For $\\varphi \\in \\Lambda_{(0, q)}^{r}\\left(D^{12}, V\\right)$ with $\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi \\in \\Lambda_{(0, q+1)}^{r}\\left(D^{12}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} H_{q} \\varphi+H_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi \\quad \\text { on } D^{1} \\cap B_{r_{4}}\n$$\n\nwhere for $j=q, q+1, H_{j}=H_{j}^{(1)}+H_{j}^{(2)}+H_{j}^{(3)}$ with $H_{j}^{(1)}, H_{j}^{(2)}$ being given by $(5.4)-(5.6)$ and\n\n$$\nH_{j}^{(3)} f=L_{12 ; j}^{123} f-T_{B_{r_{4}} ; j} L_{12 ; j}^{23} f\n$$\n\nTo derive our main estimates, we use the following.\nLemma 5.10 ([14]). Let $0<\\beta \\leq 1$. Let $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a bounded and connected Lipschitz domain. Suppose that $f$ is in $C_{l o c}^{[\\beta]+1}(D)$ and\n\n$$\n\\left|\\nabla^{1+[\\beta]} f(x)\\right| \\leq A \\operatorname{dist}(x, \\partial D)^{\\beta-1-[\\beta]}\n$$\n\nFix $x_{0} \\in D$. Then $\\|f\\|_{\\Lambda^{n}(D)}^{m} \\leq\\|f\\|_{C^{0}(D)}+C_{\\beta} A$, where constants $C_{0}, C_{\\beta}$ are stable under small perturbations of $D$.\n\nLemma 5.11. Let $\\beta \\in(-1, \\infty), \\mu_{1} \\in[0, \\infty), 0 \\leq \\lambda \\leq \\mu_{1}$, and $0<\\delta<1$. Set\n\n$$\n\\beta^{\\prime}:=\\beta-\\frac{\\mu_{1}+\\lambda-3}{2}\n$$\n\nThen for $m \\geq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{[0,1]^{3}} \\frac{s_{1}^{\\beta}\\left(\\delta+s_{1}+s_{2}+t^{2}\\right)^{-1-\\mu_{1}} t^{m}}{\\left(\\delta+s_{1}+s_{2}+t\\right)^{m+\\lambda-\\mu_{1}}} d s_{1} d s_{2} d t< \\begin{cases}C \\delta^{\\beta^{\\prime}}, & \\beta^{\\prime}<0 \\\\ C, & \\beta^{\\prime}>0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProof. The lemma is proved in [14, Lem. 6.2] for $\\beta \\geq 0$. The same proof without any changes is valid for $\\beta>-1$.\n\nTheorem 5.12. Let $r \\in(0, \\infty), \\varepsilon>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1 / 2$, and let $1 \\leq q \\leq n-2$. Let $\\left(D^{1}, D^{2}, D^{3}\\right)$ be a $(q+2)$-concave configuration. Assume that $\\varphi \\in \\Lambda^{r}\\left(\\overline{D^{12}}\\right)$ and $\\varepsilon>0$. Then the homotopy operators in Proposition 5.9 satisfy\n\n$$\n\\left\\|H_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{r+\\delta}\\left(D_{r_{4} ; 2}^{12}\\right)} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon, \\delta}\\left(\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{\\Lambda^{r+2+\\delta}}\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}\\left(\\overline{D^{12}}\\right)}+\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\Lambda^{r}\\left(D^{12}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, $C_{r, \\varepsilon, \\delta}$, which is independent of $\\varphi$, stable under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of $\\rho^{1}$. Consequently, the homotopy formula in Proposition 5.9 can be extended uniquely to the case $r \\in(0, \\infty)$ so that $(5.8)$ still holds.\n\nProof. The last assertion follows from estimates (5.8) by a smooth approximation as Corollary 5.8.\n\nWe now derive the estimate. To ease notation, write\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\Lambda^{a}\\left(D^{12}\\right)}, \\quad\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{a}\\left(D^{12}\\right)}, \\quad\\left\\|H_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{a}\\left(D_{14 / 2}^{12}\\right)}, \\quad\\left\\|H_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{C^{a}\\left(D_{14 / 2}^{12}\\right)}\n$$\n\nas $|\\varphi|_{a},\\|\\varphi\\|_{a},\\left|H_{q} \\varphi\\right|_{a},\\left\\|H_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{a}$, respectively. We also write $\\left\\|\\rho^{1}\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{a}\\left(U^{1}\\right)},\\left\\|\\rho^{1}\\right\\|_{C^{a}\\left(U^{1}\\right)}$ as $\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{a},\\left\\|\\rho^{1}\\right\\|_{a}$. Recall the homotopy operator\n\n$$\nH_{q} \\varphi=\\left(H_{q}^{(1)}+H_{q}^{(2)}+H_{q}^{(3)}\\right) \\varphi\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ has type $(0, q)$ and\n\n$$\nH_{q}^{(1)} \\varphi=R_{U^{1} \\cup D^{12}}^{0} E \\varphi+R_{U^{1}}^{[0]}(\\bar{\\partial}, E] \\varphi\n$$\n\nNear the origin, each term in $H_{q}^{(3)} \\varphi$ is a linear combination of integrals of $K_{0} f_{0}$, where $f_{0}$ is a coefficient of $\\varphi$. The $K_{0} f_{0}$ is expressed as\n\n$$\nK_{0} f_{0}(z):=A\\left(z, \\nabla_{z} \\rho^{1}, \\nabla_{z}^{2} \\rho^{1}\\right) \\tilde{K}_{0} f_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{K}_{0}$, which involves only $\\nabla \\rho^{1}$, is defined by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{K}_{0} f_{0}(z):=\\int_{S^{I}} \\frac{f_{0}(\\zeta)(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta})^{e} d V(\\zeta)}{\\left(g^{1}(z, \\zeta) \\cdot(\\zeta-z)\\right)^{a}\\left(g^{2}(z, \\zeta) \\cdot(\\zeta-z)\\right)^{b}\\left(g^{3}(z, \\zeta) \\cdot(\\zeta-z)\\right)^{c}|\\zeta-z|^{2 d}}\n$$\n\nHere $a, b, c, d$ are non-negative integers, $e \\in \\mathbb{N}^{2 n}$, and $S^{I}$ is actually $S_{12}$. Therefore, for the $g^{1}, g^{2}, g^{3}$ that appears in the kernel, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|g^{i}(z, \\zeta) \\cdot(\\zeta-z)\\right| \\geq c_{0}\n$$\n\nwhen $z \\in D_{r_{4} / 2}^{12}$ and $\\zeta \\in S^{I}$; see [14] for instance. Then, we have $\\left|\\tilde{K}_{0} f_{0}\\right|_{r+\\delta} \\leq$ $C_{r}\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{r+1+\\delta}\\left\\|f_{0}\\right\\|_{0}$ and\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{0} f_{0}\\right|_{r+\\delta} \\leq C_{r}\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{r+2+\\delta}\\left\\|\\tilde{K}_{0} f_{0}\\right\\|_{0}+C_{r}\\left|\\tilde{K}_{0} f_{0}\\right|_{r+\\delta}\n$$\n\nHere and in what follows $C_{r}$ denotes a constant depending on $\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{0} f_{0}\\right|_{a} \\leq C_{r}\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{2+a}\\|f\\|_{0}, \\quad a>0\n$$\n\nEach term in $H_{q}^{(2)} \\varphi$ is a linear combination of integrals of $K_{0} f_{0}$ which have been estimated or integrals over $S^{I}$ being one of $S^{12}, S^{2}, S_{1}^{+}$or over $U^{1}$, whose kernels do not have singularity for $z \\in D_{r_{4} / 2}^{12}$. The only difference is that we need to use $\\mathcal{E} \\varphi$ instead of $\\varphi$. Thus we need to replace $\\|f\\|_{0}$ by $|\\mathcal{E} f|_{z}$. This shows that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(H_{q}^{(2)}, H_{q}^{(3)}\\right) \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\Lambda^{r+\\delta}\\left(D_{r_{4} / 2}^{12}\\right)} \\leq C_{r, \\bar{\\varepsilon}}\\left|\\rho^{1}\\right|_{\\Lambda^{r+2+\\delta}}\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{a}\\left(\\overline{D^{12}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe now estimate the main term $H^{(1)} \\varphi$, which is decomposed as\n\n$$\nH^{(1)} \\varphi(z)=\\int_{D^{12} \\cup U^{1}} \\Omega_{(0, q)}^{0}(z, \\zeta) \\wedge E \\varphi(\\zeta)+\\int_{U^{1}} \\Omega_{(0, q)}^{01}(z, \\zeta) \\wedge[\\bar{\\partial}, E] \\varphi(\\zeta)\n$$\n\nDenote the first integral by $K_{1} \\varphi$. By an estimate on Newtonian potential [58, p. 316] (see Lemma 6.5), we have\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{1} \\varphi\\right|_{r+1} \\leq C_{r}|\\varphi|_{r}, \\quad r>0\n$$\n\nThe last integral in (5.9) can be written as a linear combination of\n\n$$\nK_{2} f(z):=A\\left(z, \\nabla_{z} \\rho^{1}, \\nabla_{z}^{2} \\rho^{1}\\right) \\tilde{K}_{2} f(z)\n$$\n\nwhere $f$ is a coefficient of the form $[\\bar{\\partial}, \\mathcal{E}] \\varphi$. By Proposition 5.3, we have\n\n$$\n|f(\\zeta)| \\leq C_{r}\\left(D^{1}\\right)|\\varphi|_{r} \\operatorname{dist}\\left(\\zeta, D^{1}\\right)^{r-1}, \\quad r>0\n$$\n\nNote that $f$ vanishes on $\\overline{D^{12}}$.

Let $r=k+\\alpha$ with integer $k \\geq 0$ and $0<\\alpha \\leq 1$. In the following cases, we will apply Lemma 5.11 several times. For clarity, we will specify values $\\left(\\beta, \\beta^{\\prime}\\right)$ in Lemma 5.11 via $\\left(\\beta_{i}, \\beta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ when we use the lemma.\n(i) $0<\\alpha+\\delta<1$. Recall that the kernel of $\\tilde{K}_{2}$ involves only first-order derivatives of $\\rho^{1}$ in $z$-variables, and it does not involve $\\zeta$-derivatives of $\\rho^{1}$. Further, $\\Phi$ is a linear combination of $\\zeta_{j}-z_{j}$. Let $\\nabla^{\\ell} \\rho^{1}$ denote a partial derivative of $\\rho^{1}(z)$ in $z, \\bar{z}$ of order $\\ell$. Since $\\rho^{1} \\in \\Lambda^{k+\\alpha+2+\\delta} \\subset C^{k+2}$, via the product and chain rules we can express $\\nabla^{k+1} \\tilde{K}_{2} f$ as a sum of\n\n$$\nK_{\\mu, \\nu}^{(k+1)} f:=\\nabla^{1+\\nu_{1}^{\\prime}} \\rho^{1} \\cdots \\nabla^{1+\\nu_{\\mu_{1}}^{\\prime}} \\rho^{1} K_{\\mu} f\n$$\n\nHere $\\mu_{1}$ is the number of times that we differentiate $\\Phi(z, \\zeta)$ in the numerator of the kernel of $\\tilde{K}_{2} f$. Also,\n\n$$\nK_{\\mu} f(z):=\\int_{U^{1}} \\frac{f(\\zeta) N_{1-\\mu_{0}+\\mu_{1}-\\nu_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}-\\cdots-\\nu_{\\mu_{1}}^{\\prime \\prime}+\\mu_{2}}(\\zeta-z)}{(\\Phi(z, \\zeta))^{n-j+\\mu_{1}}|\\zeta-z|^{2 j+2 \\mu_{2}}} d V\n$$\n\nNote that $1 \\leq j<n, \\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=0,1$, and\n\n$$\n\\mu_{0}+\\mu_{2}+\\sum\\left(\\nu_{i}^{\\prime}+\\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leq k+1, \\quad \\nu_{i}^{\\prime}+\\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\geq 1\n$$\n\nTo estimate (5.15), we use (5.11)-(5.13): For $z \\in D^{1}, \\zeta \\in U \\backslash D^{1}$ and $D^{1}$ defined by $s_{1}<0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n|\\Phi(z, \\zeta)| \\geq c_{*}\\left(\\operatorname{dist}\\left(z, \\partial D^{1}\\right)+s_{1}(\\zeta)+\\left|s_{2}(\\zeta)\\right|+|t(\\zeta)|^{2}\\right) \\\\\nC|\\zeta-z| \\geq|\\Phi(z, \\zeta)| \\geq c_{*}|\\zeta-z|^{2} \\\\\n|\\zeta-z| \\geq c_{*}\\left(\\operatorname{dist}\\left(z, \\partial D^{1}\\right)+s_{1}(\\zeta)+\\left|s_{2}(\\zeta)\\right|+|t(\\zeta)|\\right.\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nConsequently, the worst term for $K_{\\mu} f$ occurs when $j=n-1$. Note that we use $\\left|\\nabla \\rho^{1}(z)\\right| \\geq c$ in (5.15). Thus, the worst term for $K_{\\mu, \\nu}^{(k+1)} f$ also occurs when $\\mu_{0}+\\mu_{2}$ is absorbed into $\\sum \\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$. Therefore, it suffices to estimate terms with $\\mu_{0}=\\mu_{2}=0$ and $j=n-1$, which are assumed now.\n\nThroughout the proof, we assume that $\\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=0$ and hence $\\nu_{i}^{\\prime} \\geq 1$ for $i \\leq \\mu_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $\\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=1$ for $i>\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}+\\mu_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\mu_{1}, \\quad \\sum_{i \\leq \\mu_{1}^{\\prime}} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i \\leq \\mu_{1}} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThus (5.16) is simplified in the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nK_{\\mu} f(z):=\\int_{G^{1}} \\frac{f(\\zeta) N_{1+\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}}(\\zeta-z)}{(\\Phi(z, \\zeta))^{1+\\mu_{1}}|\\zeta-z|^{2(n-1)}} d V \\\\\n\\mu_{1} \\leq \\mu_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}+\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mu_{1}} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime} \\leq \\sum\\left(\\nu_{i}^{\\prime}+\\nu_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\leq k+1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWhen applying Lemma 5.11, we always take\n\n$$\n\\lambda:=\\mu_{1}-\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}, \\quad m=2 n-3\n$$\n\nWe need $\\beta_{1}>-1$ and $\\beta_{1}^{\\prime} \\leq \\beta_{1}-\\frac{\\mu_{1}+\\lambda-3}{2}$ which are satisfied by\n\n$$\n\\beta_{1}^{\\prime}=\\alpha+\\delta-1<0, \\quad \\beta_{1}=\\max \\left\\{-1+\\varepsilon, \\alpha+\\delta-1+\\frac{\\mu_{1}+\\lambda-3}{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAssume that $0<\\varepsilon<r$. Clearly, $\\beta_{1}>-1$. Using $\\lambda=\\mu_{1}-\\mu_{1}^{\\prime}$ and (5.18), we can verify that $\\beta_{1} \\leq k+\\alpha+\\delta-3 / 2 \\leq r-1$.

Denote the $U_{i}, \\omega, \\rho_{1}, \\chi, \\tilde{\\chi}$ in Lemma 6.3 by $U_{i}(p), \\omega_{p}, \\rho_{1, p}, \\chi_{p}, \\tilde{\\chi}_{p}$ as they depend on $p$. By Lemma 6.3, we can find finitely many points $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{N}$ in $b M$ that are independent of $\\varepsilon$ and open sets $\\omega_{p_{1}}, \\ldots, \\omega_{p_{N}}$ such that $b M \\subset \\cup \\omega_{p_{j}}$. Let $\\varphi_{0}=\\varphi$ and $\\rho_{0}=\\rho$. Let $\\rho_{j}=\\rho_{j-1}-\\varepsilon \\tilde{\\chi}_{p_{j}}$.\n\nNow, $M^{j}$ is a small perturbation of $M$, so there exist operators $T_{j, q}, T_{j, q+1}$ with $\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} T_{j, q} \\varphi+T_{j, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi$ on $U_{1}\\left(p_{j}\\right) \\cap M^{j}$.

We now copy the definition of $\\tilde{\\varphi}$ via $\\varphi$ in Lemma $6.3(b)$. For $j \\geq 0$, we thus define\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{j+1}= \\begin{cases}\\varphi_{j}-\\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\chi_{p_{j+1}} T_{j+1, q} \\varphi_{j}\\right)-\\chi_{p_{j+1}} T_{j+1 ; q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j}, & \\text { on } M^{j} \\\\ =0, & \\text { on } M^{j+1} \\backslash M^{j}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen $K_{q}^{0} \\varphi:=\\varphi_{N}$ and\n\n$$\nT_{q} \\varphi:=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\chi_{p_{j}} T_{j, q} \\varphi_{j-1}, \\quad T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi:=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\chi_{p_{j}} T_{j, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j-1}\n$$\n\nhave the desired estimates by applying the estimates in Lemma 6.3 inductively and taking $\\widetilde{M}=M_{N}$.\n\nNote that the $b \\leq C N$ is determined by the number of bumps that are used. Thus, $b$ is stable under $C^{2}$ perturbations of $\\rho$.\n\nNext, we want to achieve interior $C^{\\infty}$ smoothing via the homotopy formula on the coordinate balls.

We first find $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{N} \\in \\bar{M}$ and coordinate balls $\\omega_{j}, \\omega_{j}^{\\prime}, U_{j}$ such that $p_{j} \\in$ $\\omega_{j} \\Subset \\omega_{j}^{\\prime} \\Subset U_{j}$ and $\\bar{M} \\subset \\cup_{j=1}^{N} \\omega_{j} \\Subset \\widetilde{M}$. We may assume that $U_{j} \\Subset \\widetilde{M}$ are coordinate balls centered at $p_{j}$. We also have a homotopy formula $\\psi=\\bar{\\partial} B_{U_{j}, q}+B_{U_{j}, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\psi$ on $U_{j}$. Choose $\\chi_{j} \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\omega_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $\\chi_{j}=1$ in a neighborhood of $\\overline{\\omega_{j}^{\\prime}}$.\n\nLet $\\varphi_{0}:=\\varphi$ be a $(0, q)$ form on $\\widetilde{M}$. We first define $\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{N}$ inductively by\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{j}=\\varphi_{j-1}-\\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\chi_{j} B_{U_{j}, q} \\varphi_{j-1}\\right)-\\chi_{j} B_{U_{j}, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j-1} \\quad \\text { on } \\widetilde{M}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varphi_{j} & =\\left(1-\\chi_{j}\\right) \\varphi_{j-1}-\\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{j} \\wedge B_{U_{j}, q} \\varphi_{j-1} \\\\\n\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j} & =\\left(1-\\chi_{j}\\right) \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j-1}-\\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{j} \\wedge B_{U_{j}, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{supp} \\bar{\\partial} \\chi_{j} \\Subset U_{j}$, by (6.6) the two formulas immediately yield\n\n$$\n\\left|\\varphi_{j}\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}\\left|\\varphi_{j-1}\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}^{j}\\left|\\varphi_{0}\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r},\\left.\\quad \\mid \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j}\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}^{j}\\left|\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{0}\\right|_{\\widetilde{M}, r}\n$$\n\nLet us show that with $\\hat{\\omega}_{j}:=\\omega_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\omega_{j}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j}}\\left(\\bar{\\omega}_{j}\\right), r} \\leq C_{r, \\delta_{j}}\\left\\|\\varphi_{0}\\right\\|_{\\widetilde{M}, 0}, \\quad\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j}}\\left(\\bar{\\omega}_{j}\\right), r} \\leq C_{r, \\delta_{j}}\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{0}\\right\\|_{\\widetilde{M}, 0}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{j}>0$ will be chosen. In fact, $\\varphi_{1}=0$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{1}}\\left(\\omega_{1}\\right)$ if $\\chi_{1}=1$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{1}}\\left(\\omega_{1}\\right)$ and hence the inequality holds trivially for $j=1$; for the induction step, we can only prove the above weaker form.\n\nSuppose that (6.14) holds and we want to verify it when $j$ is replaced by $j+1$. We observe that $\\chi_{j+1} \\equiv 1$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j+1}}\\left(\\omega_{j+1}\\right)$ when $\\delta_{j+1}$ is sufficiently small and $0<\\delta_{j+1}<\\delta_{j} / 2$.

By (6.6), we obtain $\\left\\|B_{U_{j+1}, q} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j+1}}\\left(\\hat{\\omega}_{j}\\right) \\cap \\omega_{j+1}^{\\prime}, r} \\leq C_{r}\\left(\\left|\\varphi_{j}\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j}}\\left(\\hat{\\omega}_{j}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta_{j+1}}\\left(\\omega_{j+1}^{\\prime}\\right), r}+\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\bar{M}, 0}\\right) \\leq C_{r}^{\\prime}\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\bar{M}, 0}$. Combining the last three displayed estimates and using formulas (6.11), we see that (6.14) holds for $\\varphi_{j+1}$. The estimate for $\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j+1}$ can be obtained by the same argument via formula (6.12).\n\nFinally, as in Proposition 6.4 we have the desired estimates for $K_{q}^{1} \\varphi:=\\varphi_{N}$ and\n\n$$\nB_{q} \\varphi:=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\chi_{j} B_{U_{j}, q} \\varphi_{j-1}, \\quad B_{q+1} \\psi:=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\chi_{j} B_{U_{j}, q+1} \\psi_{j-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{j}$ are defined by (6.11) and $\\psi_{j}$ is defined by (6.12) in which $\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j}$ is replaced by $\\psi_{j}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, N$.\n\nApplying Lemma 6.6 in which $\\varphi$ is $K_{q}^{0} \\varphi$, we immediately obtain the following.\nProposition 6.7. Let $r \\in(0, \\infty), \\varepsilon>0,0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1 / 2$, and $q \\geq 1$. Let $M \\Subset$ $\\mathcal{M}: \\rho<0$ be a domain with $C^{2}$ boundary satisfying the conditions $a_{q}^{+}$. Let $V$ be a holomorphic vector bundle of finite rank over $\\mathcal{M}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} H_{q} \\varphi+H_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+K_{q} \\varphi\n$$\n\nfor any $(0, q)$ forms $\\varphi$ on $M$ such that $\\varphi, \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi \\in \\Lambda^{r}(M, V)$. Here $K_{q} \\varphi$ are $\\bar{\\partial}$ closed $V$-valued $(0, q)$ forms on $\\bar{M} \\otimes \\bar{M}$. Further, $H_{q}, H_{q+1}, K_{q}$ are independent of $r$ and we have the following.\n(a) If $b M \\in C^{2}$ is strictly $(n-q)$ convex, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|H_{j} \\varphi\\right|_{M, r+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)\\|\\varphi\\|_{M, r}, \\quad j=q, q+1 \\\\\n\\left\\|K_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\bar{M}, r} & \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)\\|\\varphi\\|_{M, \\varepsilon}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(b) If $b_{q+1}^{-} M \\in \\Lambda^{r+2+\\delta}$, then for $j=q, q+1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|H_{j} \\varphi\\right|_{M, r+\\delta} & \\leq C_{r, \\delta, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)\\left(\\|\\rho\\|_{r+2+\\delta}^{*} \\|\\rho\\|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{s b}|\\varphi|_{M, \\varepsilon}+|\\varphi|_{M, r}\\right) \\\\\n\\left\\|K_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\bar{M}, r} & \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)\\|\\rho\\|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{* b}\\|\\varphi\\|_{M, \\varepsilon}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, the positive constants $b, C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)$ and $C_{r, \\delta, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla^{\\rho}, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)$ are stable under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of $\\rho$.\n\nProof. By Propositions 6.4 and 6.6, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} T_{q} \\varphi+\\bar{\\partial} B_{q} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi+T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+B_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi+K_{q}^{1} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi\n$$\n\nDefine $H_{q} \\varphi=T_{q} \\varphi+B_{q} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi$ and $H_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+B_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi$. Define $K_{q} \\varphi=$ $K_{q}^{1} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi$. Note that $H_{q+1} \\varphi$ is well-defined. Indeed, if $\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} \\bar{\\varphi}$ on $M$, we have $T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=T_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\bar{\\varphi}$. Also, by (6.9) and estimate (6.3) for $K_{q}^{0}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|B_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\bar{\\varphi}-B_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi\\right|_{M, \\varepsilon} \\leq C_{\\varepsilon}\\left|\\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\bar{\\varphi}-\\bar{\\partial} K_{q}^{0} \\varphi\\right|_{\\bar{M}, \\varepsilon} \\leq C_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime}\\left|\\bar{\\partial} \\bar{\\varphi}-\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi\\right|_{M, \\varepsilon}=0\n$$\n\nThe estimates follow from Propositions 6.4 and 6.6. Note that $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\varepsilon}$, instead of $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\varepsilon}$ is need in this proposition, since estimates in Proposition 6.4 requires $r>0$.\n\n6.2. An application of $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann operators. To construct the global homotopy formula by removing the compact operator in the approximate homotopy formula, we will use the $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann solution operators in Kohn [30,31] and KohnRossi [32]. Suppose that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a hermitian manifold and $V$ is a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathcal{M}$. Let $M$ be a relatively compact domain in $\\mathcal{M}$ with smooth boundary. (We will take $M$ to be the $\\widetilde{M}$ in our application.) Then $M$ is defined by $\\rho<0$ with $|d \\rho|=1$ at each point in $\\partial M$. Locally, for each $\\zeta \\in b M$, we can choose a special unitary frame $\\omega^{1}, \\ldots, \\omega^{n}$ for $(1,0)$ forms on a neighborhood $U$ of $\\zeta$ such that on $b M \\cap U, \\omega^{n}=\\sqrt{2} \\partial \\rho$, and a unitary frame $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{m}$ for $V$ such that a $V$-valued $(0, q)$ form $\\varphi$ can be written as\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\sum \\varphi_{I}^{j} \\bar{\\omega}^{I} \\otimes e_{j}, \\quad \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=\\sum \\varphi_{I ; \\alpha}^{j} \\bar{\\omega}^{\\alpha} \\wedge \\bar{\\omega}^{I} \\otimes e_{j}\n$$\n\nLet $d V$ be the volume on $\\mathcal{M}$ with respect to the hermitian metric on $\\mathcal{M}$. For $\\varphi, \\psi \\in L_{(0, q)}^{2}(M, V)$, define\n\n$$\n(\\varphi, \\psi):=\\int_{M}\\langle\\varphi, \\psi\\rangle d V, \\quad\\langle\\varphi, \\psi\\rangle=\\sum \\varphi_{I}^{j} \\overline{\\psi_{I}^{j}}, \\quad\\|\\varphi\\|^{2}:=(\\varphi, \\varphi)\n$$\n\nLet $\\bar{\\partial}_{q}: L_{(0, q)}^{2}(M, V) \\rightarrow L_{(0, q+1)}^{2}(M, V)$ be the standard closed and densely defined $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator. Let $\\operatorname{Dom} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}$ be the domain of $\\bar{\\partial}_{q}$. Define $g \\in \\operatorname{Dom} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}^{*} \\subset L_{(0, q+1)}^{2}(M, V)$ and write $\\bar{\\partial}^{*} g=v$, if $\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{q} u, g\\right)=(u, v)$ for $u \\in \\operatorname{Dom} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}$. Define $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann Laplacian $\\square_{q}=\\bar{\\partial}_{q}^{*} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}+\\bar{\\partial}_{q-1} \\bar{\\partial}_{q-1}^{*}$ for $q>0$, where we use convention $\\bar{\\partial}_{n}^{*}=0$. We recall the following.\n\nTheorem 6.8 ([32], Thm. 3.9; [9], Thm. 3.1.14, p. 51 and p. 77). If bM satisfies the $a_{q}$ condition with $q>0$ and $b M \\in C^{\\infty}$, then for any hermitian vector bundle $V$ on $\\mathcal{M}$ there exists a bounded operator $N_{q}: L_{0, q}^{2}(M, V) \\rightarrow L_{0, q}^{2}(M, V)$ satisfying the following\n(a) $N_{q} L_{(0, q)}^{2}(M, V) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{q}\\right)$ and\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\square_{q} N_{q} \\varphi+H_{q}^{0} \\varphi, \\quad H_{q}^{0} \\varphi \\in \\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V), \\quad \\forall \\varphi \\in L_{(0, q)}^{2}(M, V)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ is the space of $V$-valued harmonic $(0, q)$-forms.\n(b) $N_{q}$ commutes with $\\square_{q}$ on $\\operatorname{Dom} \\square_{q}$. Assume further that $N_{q+1}$ is defined on $L_{(0, q+1)}^{2}(M, V)$. Then $N_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial}_{q} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial}_{q} N_{q} \\varphi$ if $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Dom} \\bar{\\partial}_{q}$.\n(c) $N_{q}\\left(C_{(0, q)}^{\\infty}(\\bar{M}, V)\\right) \\subset C_{(0, q)}^{\\infty}(\\bar{M}, V)$ and $\\left\\|N_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{H^{s+1}(M)} \\leq C_{s}\\|\\varphi\\|_{H^{s}(M)}$ for all $\\varphi \\in C_{(0, q)}^{\\infty}(\\bar{M})$.\n\nRemark 6.9. As mentioned in Folland-Kohn [9, p. 51], $N_{q+1}$ is defined whenever $\\square_{q+1}$ has closed range, whether the basic estimate (i.e. condition $a_{q+1}$ ) holds or not for $(0, q+1)$ forms.\n\nTheorem 6.10. Let $r>0, \\varepsilon>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1 / 2$. Suppose that bM satisfies conditions $a_{q}^{+}$with $q>0$. Assume that $r \\in(0, \\infty)$. Then for $\\varphi, \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi \\in \\Lambda^{r}(M, V)$ we have on $M$\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} R_{q} \\varphi+R_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi \\in \\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(\\widetilde{M}, V)$ and $\\widetilde{M} \\otimes M$ is an $a_{q}^{+}$domain with smooth boundary.\n(a) If $b M \\in C^{2}$ is strictly $(n-q)$ convex, then\n\n$$\n|R_{s} \\varphi|_{r+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r}|\\varphi|_{r}, \\quad\\left\\|\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|\\varphi\\|_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\n(b) For $j=q, q+1$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|R_{j} \\varphi\\right|_{r+\\delta} \\leq C_{r, \\delta, \\varepsilon}\\left(|\\rho|_{r+2+\\delta}^{*}|\\rho|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{* b}|\\varphi|_{\\varepsilon}+|\\varphi|_{r}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left\\|\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi\\right\\|_{r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\|\\rho\\|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{* b}\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\varepsilon}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, if $0<\\delta_{0}<\\delta_{1}$, then for any $\\delta^{\\prime}, \\delta^{\\prime \\prime}$ satisfying $\\delta_{0}<\\delta^{\\prime}<\\delta^{\\prime \\prime}<\\delta_{1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|R_{s} \\varphi\\right|_{M \\backslash \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta^{\\prime \\prime}}\\left(k_{q+1}^{-}, M\\right), r+1 / 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{r, \\varepsilon}}{\\left(\\delta^{\\prime \\prime}-\\delta^{\\prime}\\right)^{r+\\epsilon_{*}}}\\left(\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\varepsilon}+|\\varphi|_{M \\backslash \\mathcal{N}_{\\delta^{\\prime}}\\left(k_{q+1}^{-}, M\\right), r}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $C_{r, \\varepsilon}=C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho, \\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right)$ are stable under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of $\\rho$.\nProof. By Proposition 6.7, we have $\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} H_{q} \\varphi+H_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+K_{q} \\varphi$, where $K_{q} \\varphi$ is defined on $\\widetilde{M}$. By Theorem $6.8(a)-(b)$ applied to the domain $\\widetilde{M}$, we decompose\n\n$$\nK_{q} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} T_{q} \\varphi+\\tilde{T}_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+H_{q}^{0} K_{q} \\varphi\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\tilde{T}_{q} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial}^{*} N_{q} K_{q} \\varphi, \\quad \\tilde{T}_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=\\bar{\\partial}^{*} N_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} K_{q} \\varphi\n$$\n\nHere $N_{s}, H_{q}^{0}$ are the corresponding operators in Theorem 6.8 for the $a_{q}^{+}$domain $\\tilde{M}$. Thus, we have obtained $\\varphi=\\bar{\\partial} R_{s} \\varphi+R_{q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi+\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi$ with $R_{s} \\varphi:=H_{q} \\varphi+\\tilde{T}_{s} \\varphi$ and $\\tilde{H}_{q} \\varphi:=H_{q}^{0} K_{q} \\varphi$.\n\nWe now need to derive interior estimates for $N_{j}$ for $j=q, q+1$. Recall that since $N_{j}$ exists, we have\n\n$$\n\\square N_{j} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}=\\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}-H_{j}^{0} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}\n$$\n\nWe will take $\\tilde{\\varphi}_{q}=K_{q} \\varphi$ and $\\tilde{\\varphi}_{q+1}=\\bar{\\partial} K_{q} \\varphi$.\nWe now derive the estimates using local interior estimates for the elliptic system that is valid for any relatively compact subdomain of $\\widetilde{M}$, by using the global $L^{2}$ estimate in Theorem 6.8\n\n$$\n\\left\\|N_{j} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\widetilde{M})} \\leq C_{q}(\\widetilde{M})\\left\\|\\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\widetilde{M})}\n$$\n\nBy the regularity of $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann operator, we know that for $a_{q}$ domain $\\widetilde{M}$ which has $C^{\\infty}$ boundary, harmonic forms on smooth on $\\widetilde{\\widetilde{M}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\left|H_{j}^{0} \\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}\\right|_{M, r} \\leq C_{r}\\left\\|\\tilde{\\varphi}_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\widetilde{M})}, \\quad \\forall r>0\n$$\n\nThe interior estimation is local and we may assume that $M$ is contained in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.

Applying the above estimates to $u=\\tilde{\\chi} N_{j} \\tilde{\\varphi}$, this gives us (6.19). We left the details to the reader.\n6.3. Stability of cohomology groups and proof of Corollary 1.3. We also need to identify the cohomology groups after bumping. Let us collect some known results. Let $\\bar{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ be the quotient of $\\bar{\\partial}$-closed $V$-valued $(0, q)$ forms on $M$ by $L_{(0, q)}^{2}(M, V) \\cap \\bar{\\partial} L_{(0, q-1)}^{2}(M, V)$.\n\nProposition 6.11. Let $M \\Subset \\mathcal{M}$ be an $a_{q}$ domain with $C^{2}$ boundary defined by $\\rho<0$ and let $M^{a}$ be defined by $\\rho<a$. Let $V$ be a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on $\\mathcal{M}$. Then we have\n(a) Suppose that $M^{-c}$ are $a_{q}$ domains for $0<c \\leq c_{*}$. Then the restriction of $\\bar{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ on $\\bar{H}_{(0, q)}\\left(M^{-c_{*}}, V\\right)$ is injective.\n(b) $\\bar{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ are isomorphic.\n(c) If $H^{q}(M, \\mathcal{O}(V))=0$, then $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(\\widetilde{M}, V)=0$, where $\\widetilde{M}$ is given by Theorem 6.10 via the Grauert bumping; hence, Theorem 1.2 holds.\n(d) If $M$ further satisfies $a_{q}^{+}$condition, then $H^{q}(M, \\mathcal{O}(V))$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{(0, q)}(M, V)$ are isomorphic.\n\nProof. By Dolbeault isomorphism, we have $H^{(0, q)}(\\mathcal{M}, V) \\approx H^{q}(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{O}(V))$ for a holomorphic vector bundle $V$ on a complex manifold $\\mathcal{M}$.\n(a) is in H\u00f6rmander [25, Thm. 3.4.6] when $V$ is trivial and $\\partial M \\in C^{3}$; see also Appendix B in [14] for the general case.\n(b) is in Folland-Kohn [9, p. 77] and (d) is in Folland-Kohn [9, Thm. 4.3.1], when $b M \\in C^{\\infty}$. The restriction for $b M \\in C^{\\infty}$ can be relaxed to $b M \\in C^{2}$; see Appendix B in [14].\n(c) Suppose that $f$ is an $V$-valued $(0, q)$ form on $M^{\\prime}$ satisfying $\\bar{\\partial}_{q} f=0$ and $\\bar{\\partial}_{q-1}^{*} f=0$. Then $f \\in C^{\\infty}$. Now $H^{(0, q)}(M, V)=0$ implies that $f=\\bar{\\partial} u$ for some $u \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$. Since $u \\in L^{2}\\left(M^{-c}\\right)$, then $f=\\bar{\\partial} \\tilde{u}$ for some $\\tilde{u} \\in L^{2}\\left(M^{\\prime}\\right)$ by $(a)$. Thus $(f, f)=(f, \\bar{\\partial} u)=\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{*} f, u\\right)=0$.\n\nBefore we prove Theorem 1.1, let us first prove its corollary.\nProof of Corollary 1.3. Shaw [50, Thm. 2.2] showed that when $D_{1}, D_{2}$ are bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with smooth boundary with $D_{1} \\Subset D_{2}$ and $n \\geq 3$, the harmonic space $\\mathcal{H}_{(0,1)}\\left(D_{2} \\backslash \\overline{D_{1}}\\right)$ vanishes. Since the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is trivial, applying this result to $\\tilde{M}$ when $M$ is contained in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, we obtain $\\mathcal{H}_{(0,1)}(\\widetilde{M}, \\Theta)=0$. Therefore, Corollary 1.3 follows from Theorem 1.1 directly.\n\nRemark 6.12. Note that we need $n \\geq 4$ instead of $n \\geq 3$ for Corollary 1.3, because our proof relies on regularity of $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$. On $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, there is no need of time-one maps. It is plausible that the requirement of $r_{0}>5 / 2$ in Corollary 1.3 can be lowed to $r_{0}>3 / 2$ as in Shi [52].\n\nAs mentioned in Folland-Kohn [9, p. 77], the relations between these important cohomology groups are non-trivial. It seems that it is unknown if the conclusion in (c) holds for $a_{q}$ domains. For vanishing of cohomology groups, see Chakrabarti-Laurent-Thi\u00e9baut-Shaw [4, Thm. 1.8]. For recent work on stability on spectrum of the $\\bar{\\partial}$-Neumann Laplacian for families of domains, see Fu-Zhu [10].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 7. ESTIMATES FOR THE MAIN INDUCTIVE STEP \n\nIn this section and next, we prove Theorem 1.1 and a detailed version Theorem 8.2, using Theorem 1.2. The proof does not need condition $a_{1}^{+}$and it only requires the existence of homotopy formulas, the estimates of the homotopy operators and the $a_{1}$ condition to ensure the stability of the existence of homotopy formulas under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of the domain $M$ as stated in Theorem 1.2 and an use of Hartogs's extension in Subsection 8.4 is valid.\n\nThis section provides the inductive step for a Nash-Moser iteration. We finish the proof in Section 8.\n7.1. Strongly pseudoconvex case. Let $M$ be a strictly pseudoconvex domain in $\\mathcal{M}$. Given the initial integrable almost complex structure on $M$, we want to find a transformation $F$ defined on $\\bar{M}$ to transform the structure to a new structure closer to the standard complex structure while $\\bar{M}$ is transformed to a new domain that is still strictly pseudoconvex.\n\nOur homotopy formula requires that $A$ and $\\bar{\\partial} A$ to be $\\Lambda^{r}$ for $r>0$. We need further initial conditions to derive estimates. Thus, we will assume the following initial conditions\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nt^{-\\alpha}|A|_{s}<1, \\quad \\alpha>1, s>0 \\\\\n|A|_{m} \\leq L_{m}, \\quad m>1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nEventually, we will need $s>1$ and $m>2$ as we carry out the required estimates. Here and in what follows, we write $|\\cdot|_{M, r}$ as $|\\cdot|_{r}$. Then\n\n$$\n|A|_{m^{\\prime}} \\leq C_{s, m^{\\prime}, m} t^{\\alpha\\left(1-\\frac{m^{\\prime}-s}{m-s}\\right)}|A|_{m}, \\quad m \\geq m^{\\prime} \\geq s\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is the parameter of the smoothing operator which will converge to 0 in the iteration. We shall later verify condition (7.3) at each induction step.\n\nWe will use $C_{m}$ (resp. $C_{s}, C_{r}$ etc.) to denote a constant depending on $m$, and which is stable under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of the domain $M$.\n\nWe apply the homotopy formula to $A$ on $\\bar{M}$ so that on $M$\n\n$$\nA=\\bar{\\partial} P A+Q \\bar{\\partial} A, \\quad A \\in \\Lambda^{r}, \\quad r>1\n$$\n\nwhere $P=R_{1}$ and $Q=R_{2}$ are given by Theorem 6.10. We have estimates\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n|P \\varphi|_{r+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{2} \\rho\\right)|\\varphi|_{r}, & r>0 \\\\\n|Q \\psi|_{r+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{2} \\rho\\right)|\\psi|_{r}, & r>0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHere $P A$ is a global vector field of type $(1,0)$ of class $\\Lambda^{r+1 / 2}$.\nOn $\\bar{M}$, we use the time-one flow of $v$ :\n\n$$\nF=F_{v}^{1} \\quad \\text { on } M, \\quad v:=-S^{t} P A \\in C^{\\infty}(\\overline{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)} ; \\Theta)\n$$\n\nwhere $S^{t}$ is the smoothing operator given by (3.15). We extend $v$ from $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$ to $\\mathcal{M}$ so that\n\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{\\mathcal{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}(M)\\|v\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M), r}, \\quad|v|_{\\mathcal{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}(M)|v|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M), r}\n$$\n\nHere $C_{r}$ is independent of $t$ and stable under small perturbations of $M$. To apply Proposition 4.2, we need\n\n$$\nC_{0}(M)\\|v\\|_{0} \\leq t, \\quad C_{1}(M)\\|v\\|_{1+\\varepsilon} \\leq \\delta_{1, \\varepsilon}, \\quad C_{2, \\varepsilon}(M)\\|v\\|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M), 2+\\varepsilon} \\leq \\delta_{2, \\varepsilon}\n$$\n\n(Here the parameter $\\varepsilon$ will be determined only via (7.25)-(7.26) below.) Thus, the above conditions hold since $C|v|_{s+1 / 2} \\leq C C_{s}|A|_{s} \\leq C C_{s} t^{\\alpha}<t$ for $\\alpha>1$ and $t \\in\\left[0, t_{0}^{*}\\right]$, where $t_{0}^{*}>0$ is fixed. This allows us to replace all norms $|v|_{r}^{*}$ in Proposition 4.2 by $|v|_{\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M) ; r}$. Then Proposition 4.2 gives us\n\n$$\nM^{1}=F(M) \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0}}(M), \\quad F_{v}^{-1}: \\mathcal{N}_{C_{n}\\|v\\|_{0}}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}_{C_{n}\\left(C_{n}+1\\right)\\|v\\|_{0}}(M)\n$$\n\nand $F^{-1}=\\left.F_{v}^{-1}\\right|_{M^{1}}$. Furthermore, we can use the estimates in Proposition 4.2.\nIn local charts $\\left(U_{k}, \\psi_{k}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\nF_{k}=I+f_{k}, \\quad f_{k}=v_{k}+w_{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $v_{k}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=\\left(-S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}, z_{k}=\\psi_{k}$, and $w_{k}$ regarded as smaller than $v_{k}$ is given as in Proposition 4.2. Thus, $w_{k}$ is defined on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}\\left(D_{k}\\right)$, where $D_{k}=\\psi_{k}\\left(U_{k} \\cap M\\right)$. Here by an abuse of notation, we denote $w_{k}(\\cdot, 1)$ by $w_{k}(\\cdot)$. We have\n\n$$\nA_{k}=\\sum A_{k, \\bar{\\partial}}^{\\alpha} d \\bar{z}_{k}^{\\beta} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{k}^{\\alpha}}, \\quad f_{k}=\\left(f_{k}^{1}, \\ldots, f_{k}^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 4.1, the new structure $A^{\\prime}$ takes the form\n\n$$\nA_{k}^{\\prime} \\circ F_{k}=\\left(I+\\overline{\\partial f}_{k}+A_{k} \\bar{\\partial} f_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(A_{k}+\\bar{\\partial} f_{k}+A_{k} \\partial f_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus on $D_{k}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{k} & +\\bar{\\partial} f_{k}+A_{k} \\partial f_{k}=A_{k}-\\bar{\\partial}\\left(S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}-A_{k} \\partial\\left(S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}+A_{k} \\partial w_{k}+\\bar{\\partial} w_{k} \\\\\n& =A_{k}-\\left(S^{t} \\bar{\\partial} P A\\right)_{k}-A_{k} \\partial\\left(S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}+A_{k} \\partial w_{k}+\\bar{\\partial} w_{k}+\\left(\\left[S^{t}, \\bar{\\partial}\\right] P A\\right)_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe now apply the homotopy formula for a second time as in [17], by writing\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} P A=A-Q \\bar{\\partial} A\n$$\n\nWe obtain for $A \\in \\Lambda^{r}$ with $r>1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{k} & +\\bar{\\partial} f_{k}+A_{k} \\partial f_{k} \\\\\n& =A_{k}-\\left(S^{t} A\\right)_{k}+\\left(S^{t} Q \\bar{\\partial} A\\right)_{k}-\\left(A \\partial S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}+A_{k} \\partial w_{k}+\\bar{\\partial} w_{k}+\\left(\\left[S^{t}, \\bar{\\partial}\\right] P A\\right)_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe shall use the following notation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{1} & =\\left[\\left(I-S^{t}\\right) A\\right]_{k}, \\quad I_{2}=\\left[S^{t} Q \\bar{\\partial} A\\right]_{k}, \\quad I_{3}=\\left[\\left[S^{t}, \\bar{\\partial}\\right] P A\\right]_{k} \\\\\nI_{4} & =-\\left(A \\partial S^{t} P A\\right)_{k}, \\quad I_{5}=A_{k} \\partial w_{k}+\\bar{\\partial} w_{k}, \\quad \\mathcal{K}_{k}=\\overline{\\partial f_{k}}+A_{k} \\bar{\\partial} f_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe remark that among $I_{1}, \\ldots, I_{4}$, only $I_{2}$ requires $A \\in \\Lambda^{r}$ with $r>1$. The other terms are well-defined for $A \\in \\Lambda^{r}$ with $r>0$. Of course, $I_{j}$ depend on $k$. Consequently, we can rewrite (7.6) as\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}_{k}=\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{5} I_{j}\\right), \\quad \\tilde{A}_{k}=A_{k}^{\\prime} \\circ F_{k}\n$$\n\nWe first estimate the $I_{j}$-s.

Thus\n\n$$\n\\left|[A, A]\\right|_{r-1} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|A|_{\\varepsilon}|A|_{r}, \\quad r>1\n$$\n\nSince $M$ is strongly pseudoconvex, we have by Theorem 6.10\n\n$$\n|Q \\bar{\\partial} A|_{r+\\frac{1}{2}} \\leq C_{r}|\\bar{\\partial} A|_{r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\|A\\|_{\\varepsilon}|A|_{r+1}, \\quad r>0\n$$\n\nApplying Lemma 3.9, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|I_{2}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r} & =\\left|S^{t} Q \\bar{\\partial} A\\right|_{r} \\leq C_{r} t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|Q \\bar{\\partial} A|_{r-\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\n& \\leq C_{r}^{\\prime} t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|\\bar{\\partial} A|_{r-1} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}^{\\prime} t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}|A|_{\\varepsilon}|A|_{r}, \\quad r>1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|I_{2}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s} \\leq C_{s} t^{-\\frac{1}{2}+2 \\alpha}<t^{d \\alpha}\n$$\n\nby the last inequality in (7.8), provided\n\n$$\n2 \\alpha-\\frac{1}{2}>d \\alpha+\\varepsilon, \\quad s>1\n$$\n\nHere we emphasize that (7.11) requires $s>1$.

Using the formula $\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}=\\left[\\operatorname{det}\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)\\right]^{-1} B$, where $B$ is the adjugate matrix of $I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}$, we see that every entry in $\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}$ is a polynomial in $\\left[\\operatorname{det}\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$ and entries of $\\mathcal{K}_{k}$. By using the product and quotient rules (3.2)-(3.3), and (7.17) and (7.19), we get\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s}<C_{s, \\varepsilon}, \\quad\\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon} t^{-1 / 2}|A|_{r}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1} I_{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s} \\leq C_{s, \\varepsilon}\\left|I_{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s} \\leq C_{s, \\varepsilon}^{\\prime} t^{d \\alpha} \\\\\n& \\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1} I_{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}(\\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)\\right|_{r}\\left|I_{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s}+\\left|\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)\\right|_{D_{k} ; s}\\left|I_{j}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r}\\right) \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|A|_{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\widetilde{A}_{k}=\\left(I+\\mathcal{K}_{k}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{5} I_{j}\\right)$ satifies\n\n$$\n|\\widetilde{A}|_{s} \\leq C_{s, \\varepsilon} t^{d \\alpha}, \\quad|\\widetilde{A}|_{r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|A|_{r}, \\quad r>1\n$$\n\nprovided (7.8) holds.\nFinally, we estimate the norms of $A^{\\prime}=\\widetilde{A} \\circ G$, where $G=F^{-1}$. Let $G_{k}=I+g_{k}$. Then $g_{k}=-(v)_{k}+\\tilde{w}_{k}$ with $\\tilde{w}_{k}(\\cdot)=w_{k}(\\cdot,-1)$. Set\n\n$$\nD_{k}^{1}:=\\psi_{k}\\left(U_{k} \\cap M_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy Proposition 4.2, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}\\right|_{D_{k} ; r+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}^{\\prime} ; r+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}|A|_{r}\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|f_{k}\\right|_{D_{k} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; s+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon} t^{\\alpha} \\\\\n& \\left|f_{k}\\right|_{D_{k} ; m+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; m+1 / 2} \\leq C_{m, \\varepsilon}|A|_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWith (7.8), we already require $m>2$. Thus, via interpolation,\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}\\right|_{D_{k} ; 2}+\\left|g_{k}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; 2} \\leq C_{s, m, \\varepsilon} t^{\\frac{m-4 / 2}{m-s}}|\\alpha| \\frac{2 / 2-s}{m}\n$$\n\nThis will allow us to control the $C^{2}$ norm of $\\rho \\circ G$ of the new domain $M^{\\prime}=F(M)$.\nBy estimate (3.5) for composition, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|_{M^{1}, r}=|\\widetilde{A} \\circ G|_{M^{1}, r} \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(|\\widetilde{A}|_{r}\\left(1+|G|_{M^{1}, 1+\\varepsilon}^{2}\\right)+\\|\\widetilde{A}\\|_{1+\\varepsilon}|G|_{M^{1}, r}+\\|\\widetilde{A}\\|_{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing estimates (7.20) for $\\widetilde{A}$ and (7.21)-(7.22) for $g_{k}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|_{M^{1}, s} & \\leq C_{s, \\varepsilon} t^{d \\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|_{M^{1}, m} & \\leq C_{m, \\varepsilon}|A|_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe now determine the parameters. For (7.8), (7.12), (7.18) to hold, we need\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd \\alpha<m-s-2 \\varepsilon, \\quad d \\alpha<2 \\alpha-\\frac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon, \\quad m>2+2 \\varepsilon \\\\\nC_{s, m, \\varepsilon} L_{m} t^{\\varepsilon} \\leq 1, \\quad C_{s} t^{-1 / 2+\\alpha}<1 / 2\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSo we take $d=1+\\varepsilon, \\alpha=1+\\varepsilon, s=1+\\varepsilon$. Fix a small $\\varepsilon>0$. Thus, it is easy to check that conditions (7.25)-(7.26) are satisfied by\n\n$$\nm=2+C \\varepsilon, \\quad 0<t \\leq t_{0}^{*}\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{0}^{*}$ depends on $C_{s, m}, C_{s}$ which in turn depends on $M$. Further, $t_{0}^{*}, C_{s, m}, C_{s}$ are stable under small $C^{2}$ perturbations of $b M$. We can write (7.23) as\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|_{s} \\leq t^{d \\alpha}\n$$\n\nwhich is possible provided $t_{0}^{*}$ is sufficiently small. Thus, we can rewrite (7.24) as\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|_{M^{1}, m} \\leq C_{m} L_{m}, \\quad m>1\n$$\n\nwhich is possible as $m, s, \\alpha, d, \\varepsilon$ are fixed now while $t_{0}^{*}>0$ can still be chosen sufficiently small.\n7.2. A preview for the sequence of embeddings. We now outline the iteration process in the next section. Set\n\n$$\nt_{j}=t_{j-1}^{d}=t_{0}^{d^{j}}, \\quad M^{0}=M, \\quad A^{0}=A \\in \\Lambda_{(0,1)}^{m}(M, \\Theta)\n$$\n\nBy shrinking $t_{0}^{*}$ further, we will find a sequence of strongly pseudoconvex domains $M^{j}$ in $\\mathcal{M}$, a sequence of complex structures defined by vector fields $X^{j}:=$ $\\left\\{X_{1}^{j}, \\ldots, X_{m}^{j}\\right\\}$ with an adapted frame determined by $A^{j} \\in \\Lambda_{(0,1)}^{m}\\left(M^{j}, \\Theta\\right)$, and a sequence of smooth mappings $F^{j}$ such that $M^{j+1}=F^{j}\\left(M^{j}\\right), F^{j}$ transforms $X^{j}$ into $X^{j+1}$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, s} & \\leq t_{j}^{s} \\\\\n\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, m} & \\leq L_{j, m} \\\\\nt_{j}^{s} C_{s, m, \\varepsilon} L_{j, m} & \\leq 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nprovided (7.27)-(7.29) hold for $j=0$. Further, $F_{k}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+f_{k}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ and $G_{k}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=$ $z_{k}+g_{k}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ with $G_{k}^{j}=\\left(\\left(F^{j}\\right)^{-1}\\right)_{k}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; s+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{s} t_{j}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; m+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; m+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{m}\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{m} \\\\\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, m} & \\leq C_{s, m}\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $D_{k}^{j}=\\psi_{k}\\left(M^{j} \\cap U_{k}\\right)$. Note that (7.32) shows that\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; m+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; m+1 / 2} \\leq C_{m}\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, m} \\leq C_{m, s}^{\\prime j+1}\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M, m}\n$$\n\nwhich grows slowly, whereas\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j}, s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1}, s+1 / 2} \\leq C_{s} t^{\\alpha d^{j}}\n$$\n\ndecays rapidly. Then the compositions $F^{j} \\circ \\cdots \\circ F^{0}$ converge in $\\Lambda^{m^{\\prime}}(M)$ norm for any $m^{\\prime}<m+1 / 2$.\n7.3. General case: $b M \\in \\Lambda^{s_{*}} \\cap C^{2}$ with $s_{*} \\geq 2$. When we deal with a domain $M$ whose boundary is less smooth, we first smooth defining function of the domain to get a smooth and larger domain. We then extend the formally integrable complex structure $A$ to the larger domain and smooth the structure. Of course, both the extension and smoothing destroy the formal integrability of the structure. Nevertheless, the failure of formal integrability can be measured by a commutator of $\\left[S^{t}, \\widetilde{\\partial}\\right]$ that has a good estimate on the larger domain $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$. This allows us to use the homotopy formula on the larger domain and construct smoothing diffeomorphism defined on a (larger) domain that contains $M$. Its restriction on the original $M$ will be used to transform the structure to new one that is still formally integrable on the new domain. Repeating this via a Nash-Moser iteration scheme, the composed diffeomorphism will transform the structure on $M$ to the standard complex structure on $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nWe apply smoothing to the defining function $\\rho$ of $M$ by setting\n\n$$\n\\rho_{\\hat{t}}=\\rho * \\chi_{\\hat{t}}, \\quad \\hat{t}=\\left(c_{*} t\\right)^{\\frac{1}{s_{*}}}, \\quad M_{\\hat{t}}^{t}=\\left\\{\\rho_{\\hat{t}}<t\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHere using $t^{\\frac{1}{s_{*}}}$ instead of $t$ reflects that $\\rho \\in \\Lambda^{s_{*}}$. See Yie [62] and [14] for similar uses. We now have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\rho_{\\hat{t}}-\\rho\\right\\|_{0} \\leq C_{2} \\hat{t}^{s^{*}}|\\rho|_{s^{*}} \\\\\n\\left\\|\\rho_{\\hat{t}}-\\rho\\right\\|_{2} \\leq \\varepsilon, \\quad \\hat{t}<\\hat{t}^{*}\\left(\\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right) \\\\\n\\left|\\rho_{\\hat{t}}\\right|_{b} \\leq C_{b, 2} \\hat{t}^{s_{*}-b}|\\rho|_{s_{*}}, \\quad b \\geq s_{*}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWe also have $\\hat{t}^{s_{*}}=c_{*} t$. When $c_{*}$ is sufficiently small, we have $C_{s_{*}} \\hat{t}^{s_{*}}\\|\\rho\\|_{s_{*}}<t / C$ by (7.34). Thus\n\n$$\nM \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{t / C_{*}}(M) \\subset M_{\\hat{t}}^{t} \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{C_{*} t}(M)\n$$\n\nWe emphasize that $\\hat{t}^{*}\\left(\\partial^{2} \\rho\\right)$ in (7.35) depends on the modulus of continuity of $\\partial^{2} \\rho$. When $s_{*}=2,|\\rho|_{s_{*}}$ needs be replaced by $\\|\\rho\\|_{2}$. Then we can replace all norms in (7.34)-(7.36), which are stronger inequalities.\n\nTo simplify formulas, we set\n\n$$\n\\mu(a)=\\frac{\\left(a-s_{*}\\right)_{+}}{s_{*}}\n$$\n\nThen (7.36) becomes $\\left\\|\\rho_{\\bar{I}}\\right\\|_{b} \\leq C_{b} t^{-\\mu(b)}\\|\\rho\\|_{s_{*}}$, where $C_{b}$ depends on $s_{*}$ also.\nTo limit the loss of derivatives, we will use $M_{t}^{t} \\subset \\mathcal{N}_{C_{*}, t}(M)$, which allows us to apply the estimates of $S^{t} v$ and $\\left|\\bar{\\partial}, S^{t}\\right| v$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{C_{*}, t}(M)$, as well as the homotopy formula on the smooth subdomain $M_{t}^{t}$ of $\\mathcal{N}_{C_{*}, t}(M)$. Note that the original $S^{t} v$ is defined on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$. Replacing $S^{t} v$ by $S^{t / C} v$ which is still denoted it by $S^{t} v$, we may assume that $S^{t} v$ and its estimates in Lemma 3.6 hold on $\\mathcal{N}_{C_{*}, t}(M)$ for any given $C_{*}$. We will also have\n\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{C^{0}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)\\right)}<t / C\n$$\n\nSince $M_{t}^{t}$ contains $\\mathcal{N}_{t / C_{*}}(M)$, the time-one map $F$ of $v$ is well-defined on the original domain $M$; consequently, we can define a new almost complex structure $A$ on $M^{\\prime}=F(M)$ that is still formally integrable.\n\nWe have homotopy operators satisfying\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|P_{M_{t}^{t}} \\varphi\\right|_{M_{t}^{t}, r} & \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho_{\\bar{I}_{I}} \\nabla^{2} \\rho_{\\bar{I}}\\right)\\left(\\left|\\varphi\\right|_{M_{t}^{t}, r-1 / 2}+\\left|\\rho_{\\bar{I}}\\right|_{r+2}\\left|\\rho_{\\bar{I}}\\right|_{2+\\varepsilon}^{b}\\left|\\varphi\\right|_{M_{t}^{t}, \\varepsilon}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq C_{r, \\varepsilon}\\left(\\nabla \\rho_{\\bar{I}}, \\nabla^{2} \\rho_{\\bar{I}}\\right)\\left(\\left|\\varphi\\right|_{M_{t}^{t}, r-1 / 2}+t^{-\\mu(r+2)-b \\varepsilon} L_{0}\\left|\\varphi\\right|_{M_{t}^{t}, \\varepsilon}\\right), \\quad r>1 / 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe same estimate holds when $P_{M_{t}^{t}}$ is replaced by $Q_{M_{t}^{t}}$.\nFor the rest of this section, we denote $P_{M_{t}^{t}}, Q_{M_{t}^{t}}$ by $P, Q$.\nRecall that $S^{t} A$ is smooth on $\\mathcal{N}_{t / C_{*}}(M)$ and it depends only on the values of $A$ on $M$. To ease notation, replace $S^{t}$ by $S^{C_{*} t}$, we may assume that $S^{t} A$ is defined on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$. Thus, we set $v=-P S^{t} A$, which is well-defined on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$ without further extension. Notice that unlike the strongly pseudoconvex case, $S^{t}$ is applied to $A$ directly. Let $F$ be the time-one map of $v$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t}(M)$. We have $f_{k}=v_{k}+w_{k}$.\n\nIn the following, we will denote by $\\partial$ a partial derivative of order 1.

We need $r_{0}>2$ even for the strongly pseudoconvex case since we have to use flows to construct the diffeomorphism $F$.\n(c) (8.2) can be restated as\n\n$$\n|A|_{1+\\varepsilon_{0}} \\leq \\min \\left\\{\\tilde{t}_{0}^{\\beta},\\left[\\min \\left\\{|A|_{r_{0}},\\|\\rho\\|_{2}, \\quad|\\rho|_{s_{*}}\\right\\}\\right]^{-\\beta / \\varepsilon_{1}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProof of Theorem 8.2. Assume that $H^{1}(M, \\Theta)=0$. Let $A \\in \\Lambda_{(0,1)}^{r}(M, \\Theta)$ define a formally integrable almost complex structure on $\\bar{M}$, where $2<r \\leq \\infty$. We need to find a diffeomorphism $F$ from $M$ onto $M^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathcal{M}$, which transforms the complex structure defined by $A$ into the given complex structure of $\\mathcal{M}$. To derive the estimates, let us assume that $r<\\infty$.\n8.1. Convergence for the strongly pseudoconvex case. Fix any finite $r_{0}>2$. Let us recall how $\\varepsilon$ is choosen. Set $\\alpha=1+\\varepsilon, d=1+\\varepsilon$ and $s=1+\\varepsilon$. When $\\varepsilon>0$ is sufficiently small, we have\n\n$$\nd \\alpha<r_{0}-s-2 \\varepsilon, \\quad d \\alpha<2 \\alpha-1-\\varepsilon, \\quad r_{0}>2+C \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nAfter $\\varepsilon$ is chosen. We then choose $t_{0}$ such that\n\n$$\n0<t_{0}<1, \\quad C_{s, r_{0}} t_{0}^{\\varepsilon}<1, \\quad C_{s} t_{0}^{-1 / 2+\\alpha}<1 / 2\n$$\n\nWe now define $t_{j+1}=t_{j}^{d}$.\nWe are given a formally integrable almost complex structure $A^{0} \\in C^{1}\\left(\\overline{M^{0}}, \\Theta\\right)$. Assume that\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, s} \\leq t_{0}^{\\alpha}, \\quad\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, r_{0}} \\leq L_{0, r_{0}}\n$$\n\nWe now apply the homotopy formula\n\n$$\nA^{0}=\\bar{\\partial} H_{0} A^{0}+H_{1} \\bar{\\partial} A^{0}, \\quad \\text { on } M_{0}\n$$\n\nThis gives a vector field $v^{0}=-H_{0} A^{0} \\in \\Lambda^{s+1 / 2}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$. We now apply Moser's smoothing operator $S^{t_{0}}$ and define\n\n$$\n\\tilde{v}^{0}=\\chi E_{\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M^{0}\\right)} S^{t_{0}} v^{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi=1$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$ and $\\chi$ is compact support on $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe extension and cut-off allow us to define a time-one map $F^{0}$ on the whole space $\\mathcal{M}$ that is the identity map away from the support of $\\tilde{v}^{0}$. Since $\\tilde{v}^{0}=S^{t_{0}} v^{0}$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M_{0}\\right)$, then $\\left.F^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}}$ agrees with the time-one map of the flow of $S^{t_{0}} v^{0}=$ $-S^{t} P_{0} A^{0}$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0} / C}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$. Therefore, $F^{0}$ transforms the almost complex structure defined by $A^{0}$ into a almost complex structure defined by $A^{1} \\in \\Lambda^{r_{0}}\\left(M^{1}, \\Theta\\right)$ where $M^{1}=F^{0}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$.\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\tilde{v}^{0}\\right|_{\\mathcal{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}\\left|v^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, r}\n$$\n\nFurther, $F_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+f_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ and $G_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+g_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ with $G_{k}^{0}=\\left(\\left(F^{0}\\right)^{-1}\\right)_{k}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nt_{0}^{\\varepsilon} L_{0, r_{0}} & \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{0} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{0+1} ; s+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{s} t_{0}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{0} ; r_{0}+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{i} ; r_{0}+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{r_{0}}\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{r_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we may need to adjust $t_{0}$.\nThis gives us for $j=0$ the following\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, s} & \\leq t_{j+1}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, r_{0}} \\leq C_{r_{0}}\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M_{0}, r_{0}} & \\leq C_{r_{0}} L_{j, r_{0}} \\\\\nt_{j+1}^{\\alpha} L_{j+1, r_{0}} & \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; s+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{s} t_{j}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; r_{0}+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; r_{0}+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{r_{0}} L_{j, r_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe iteration can be repeated when $j$ is replaced by $j+1$, if we have\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j}, 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1}, 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{2}}{(j+1)^{2}}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 8.1, the latter implies that the stability of constants in various estimates holds for $M^{j+1}: \\rho^{j+1}=\\rho^{j} \\circ G^{j}$ with $G^{j}=\\left(F^{j}\\right)^{-1}$. Then (8.9) implies that we can repeat the procedure to construct the sequence of $\\left\\{M^{j}, F^{j}, \\rho^{j+1}\\right\\}_{j=0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nBy (8.12), we have $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; s+1 / 2} \\leq C_{s} t_{j}^{\\alpha} \\leq C_{s} t_{0}^{d^{j}}$. This shows that $\\hat{F}^{j}=F^{j} \\circ \\cdots \\circ F^{0}$ converges to $\\hat{F}$ and $\\hat{G}^{j}=G^{0} \\circ \\cdots G^{j}$ converges in $\\Lambda^{s}$ norm. By (8.13), we have $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; r_{0}+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; r_{0}+1 / 2} \\leq C_{r_{0}} L_{j, r_{0}} \\leq C_{t_{0}}^{j} L_{0, r_{0}}$. Using interpolation, we know that $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{r_{\\theta}}$ converges rapidly in $\\Lambda^{r_{\\theta}}$ norm for $r_{\\theta}=$ $(1-\\theta) s+\\theta r_{0}+1 / 2$ for any $0<\\theta<1$.\n\nWe now apply a standard bootstrapping argument. For the above fixed parameters, we want to show that $F$ is actually in $\\Lambda^{\\ell}$ for any $\\ell<m+1 / 2$, provided\n\n$$\nr_{0}<m<\\infty, \\quad A^{0} \\in \\Lambda^{m}\\left(M_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this case, define $L_{j, m}=\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M^{j}, m}$ Then (8.10), (8.13) still hold for $j \\geq 0$, if we replace $r_{0}$ by $m$. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, m} \\leq C_{m} L_{j, m}, \\quad\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; m+1 / 2} \\leq C_{m} L_{j, m}\n$$\n\nConsequently, $L_{j+1, m} \\leq C_{m} L_{j, m} \\leq C_{m}^{j+1} L_{0, m}$ and $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; m+1 / 2} \\leq C_{m}^{j} L_{0, m}$. We know that $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; s+1 / 2}$ converges rapidly. By interpolation, we conclude that $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j}, \\ell}$ converges rapidly for any $\\ell<m+1 / 2$.\n8.2. Convergence in finite many derivatives for the general case. Let us recall the choice of parameters in subsection 6.4.

Thus, we assume\n\n$$\nr_{0}>\\max \\left\\{2, \\frac{5 / 2}{s_{*}-1}\\right\\}, \\quad s_{*} \\geq 2\n$$\n\nWe now define $t_{j+1}=t_{j}^{d}$ and choose $t_{0}$ such that\n\n$$\n0<t_{0}<1, \\quad C_{s, r_{0}} t_{0}^{\\varepsilon}<1, \\quad C_{s} t_{0}^{-1 / 2+\\alpha}<1 / 2\n$$\n\nWe are given a formally integrable almost complex structure $A^{0} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{1}\\left(\\overline{M^{0}}, \\Theta\\right)$. Assume that\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, s} \\leq t_{0}^{\\alpha}, \\quad\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, r_{0}} \\leq L_{0, r_{0}}\n$$\n\nWe now apply the homotopy formula\n\n$$\nA^{0}=\\bar{\\partial} P_{0} A^{0}+Q_{0} \\bar{\\partial} A^{0}, \\quad \\text { on } M_{0}^{t_{0}}\n$$\n\nHere $M_{0}^{t_{0}}=\\left(M^{0}\\right)^{t_{0}}, P_{0}=P_{M_{0}^{t_{0}}}$ and $Q_{0}=Q_{M_{0}^{t_{0}}}$. This yields a vector field $v_{0}=-P_{0} A_{0} \\in \\Lambda^{s+1 / 2}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$. We now apply Moser's smoothing operator $S^{t_{0}}$ and define\n\n$$\n\\bar{v}^{0}=\\chi E_{\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M^{0}\\right)} S^{t_{0}} v^{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi=1$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$ and $\\chi$ is compact support on $\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe extension and cut-off allow us define a time-one map $F^{0}$ on the whole space $\\mathcal{M}$ that is the identity map away from the support of $\\bar{v}^{0}$. Since $\\bar{v}^{0}=S^{t_{0}} v^{0}$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0}}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$, then $F^{0}\\left\\lvert\\,_{M^{0}}\\right.$ agrees with the time-one map of the flow of $S^{t_{0}} v^{0}=$ $-S^{t_{0}} P_{0} A^{0}$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{t_{0} / C}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$. Therefore, $F^{0}$ transforms the almost complex structure defined by $A^{0}$ into a almost complex structure defined by $A^{1} \\in \\Lambda^{m}\\left(M^{1}, \\Theta\\right)$ where $M^{1}=F^{0}\\left(M^{0}\\right)$.\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\bar{v}^{0}\\right|_{\\mathcal{M}, r} \\leq C_{r}\\left|v^{0}\\right|_{M^{0}, r}\n$$\n\nFurther, $F_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+f_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ and $G_{k}^{0}\\left(z_{k}\\right)=z_{k}+g_{k}^{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)$ with $G_{k}^{0}=\\left(\\left(F^{0}\\right)^{-1}\\right)_{k}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|f_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{0} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; s+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{s} t_{0}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{0} ; r_{0}+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{0}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; r_{0}+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{r_{0}}\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{r_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis give us for $j=0$ the following\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, s} & \\leq t_{j+1}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M^{j+1}, r_{0}} \\leq C_{r_{0}}\\left|A_{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, r_{0}} & \\leq L_{j+1, r_{0}} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{1} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; s+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{s} t_{j}^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; r_{0}+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; r_{0}+1 / 2} & \\leq C_{m} L_{j, r_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe iteration can be repeated when $j$ is replaced by $j+1$, if we have\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{2}}{(j+1)^{2}}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 8.1, the latter implies that the stability of constants in various estimate holds for $M^{j+1}: \\rho^{j+1}=\\rho^{j} \\circ G^{j}$. Then (8.17) implies that we can repeat the procedure to construct the sequence of $\\left\\{M^{j}, F^{j}, \\rho^{j+1}\\right\\}_{j=0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nBy (8.19), we have $\\left|f_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j} ; s+1 / 2}+\\left|g_{k}^{j}\\right|_{D_{k}^{j+1} ; s+1 / 2} \\leq C_{s} t_{j}^{\\alpha} \\leq C_{s} t_{0}^{j^{j}}$.

Theorem 8.2 holds if we assume additionally\n\n$$\n\\rho \\in \\Lambda^{r+1 / 2}\n$$\n\nfor its last assertion.\n\nIn next two subsections, we will remove the extra condition (8.24). Then the proof of Theorem 8.2 is complete.\n8.3. Improving regularity away from concave boundary. It is well-known that by the classical Newlander-Nirenberg theorem that $F_{0}$ gains one derivative on $M$. To improve the regularity of $F_{0}$ in a neighborhood of the strongly pseudoconvex boundary $b_{n-1}^{+} M$, we only need to slightly modify the arguments in the previous subsection.\n\nFix a neighborhood $\\omega^{+}$of $b_{n-1}^{+} M$ in $\\bar{M}$ and a neighborhood $\\omega^{-}$of $b_{2}^{-} M$ in $\\bar{M}$ so that $\\overline{\\omega^{+}} \\cap \\overline{\\omega^{-}}=\\emptyset$. Recall that using Grauert bumping, we have\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{j}=\\varphi_{j-1}-\\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\chi_{j} H_{U_{j}, q} \\varphi_{j-1}\\right)-\\chi_{j} H_{U_{j}, q+1} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{j-1}, \\quad j=1, \\ldots, N\n$$\n\nWe can choose $\\omega_{j}, \\omega_{j}^{\\prime}$ so that $\\omega_{j}^{\\prime} \\subset \\omega^{+}$(resp. $\\omega_{j}^{\\prime} \\subset \\omega^{-}$) if $\\omega_{j} \\cap b_{n-1}^{+} M \\neq \\emptyset$ (resp. $\\omega_{j} \\cap b_{2}^{-} M \\neq \\emptyset$ ). Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\varphi_{N}\\right|_{\\omega^{+}, a} \\leq C_{a}|\\varphi|_{M, a}, \\quad\\left|\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{N}\\right|_{\\omega^{+}, a} \\leq C_{a}|\\bar{\\partial} \\varphi|_{M, a}\n$$\n\nfor any $a>0$ even if $b M$ is merely $C^{2}$.\nWe still use (6.17)-(6.18). Hence, we still have all estimates the previous subsection. Next, we improve and in fact simplify the estimates away from $b_{2}^{-} M$, using (6.19) on subdomains of $\\omega^{+}$containing $b_{n-1}^{+} M$.\n\nRecall that $M$ is defined by $\\rho<0$. Set\n\n$$\nM_{j, \\varepsilon}=M^{j} \\backslash\\left\\{\\rho^{j} \\geq-\\varepsilon+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{j+2}}\\right\\}, \\quad M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{ \\pm}=M^{j} \\backslash\\left\\{\\rho_{j} \\geq-\\varepsilon+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{j+1 \\mp 1 / 2}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is a small positive number. We have\n\n$$\nM_{j+1, \\varepsilon}^{+} \\subset M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{-} \\subset M_{j, \\varepsilon} \\subset M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{+} \\quad F^{j}\\left(M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{-}\\right) \\supset M_{j+1, \\varepsilon}^{+} \\quad j>\\ell_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nConsequently, $G^{\\ell_{\\varepsilon}} \\cdots G^{\\ell}: M_{\\ell_{\\varepsilon}+1, \\varepsilon}^{+} \\rightarrow M_{\\ell, \\varepsilon}^{+}$is well-defined.\nWe now have\n\n$$\n\\left|v^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}, r+1 / 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{r}}{(j+1)^{2}}\\left(\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{+}, r}+\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M^{j}, 0}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis allows us to carry over the estimates for strongly pseudoconvex domains. Further, we only need to improve estimates for the highest order derivatives. We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|f^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{-}, m+1 / 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{m}(j+1)^{m+C}}{\\varepsilon^{m+C}}\\left(\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m}+\\left\\|A^{j}\\right\\|_{M^{j}, 0}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left|g^{j}\\right|_{M_{j+1, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m+1 / 2} \\leq \\frac{C_{m}(j+1)^{m+C}}{\\varepsilon^{m+C}}\\left(\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m}+\\left\\|A^{j}\\right\\|_{M^{j}, 0}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M_{j+1, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m} \\leq \\frac{C_{m}(j+1)^{m+C}}{\\varepsilon^{m+C}}\\left(\\left|A^{j}\\right|_{M_{j, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m}+\\left\\|A^{j}\\right\\|_{M^{j}, 0}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (8.27) and the rapid convergence of $\\left|A_{j+1}\\right|_{s}$ via (8.17), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left|A^{j+1}\\right|_{M_{+}^{j+1, \\varepsilon}, m}+\\left\\|A^{j+1}\\right\\|_{M^{j}, 0} \\leq C_{m} \\varepsilon^{-m-C}(j+1)\\left)^{j}\\left(\\left|A^{0}\\right|_{M_{i, \\varepsilon}^{+}, m}+\\left\\|A^{0}\\right\\|_{M^{0}, 0}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy (8.26), (7.52), and interpolation, we see that $\\left|g^{j}\\right|_{M_{+}^{j+1}, a}$ converges rapidly for any $a<m+1 / 2$. This shows that $\\lim _{\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty} G^{\\ell_{\\varepsilon}} \\cdots G^{\\ell}$ is in $\\Lambda^{a}\\left(M_{\\ell_{\\varepsilon}+1, \\varepsilon}^{+}\\right)$. Therefore, $F_{\\infty}$ is in $\\Lambda^{a}$ on a neighborhood of $b_{n-1}^{+}(M)$ in $\\bar{M}$ for any $a<r+1 / 2$.\n\n8.4. Improving regularity near concave boundary via Hartogs extension. Let us summarize the results we have proved so far when $r_{0}, s_{*}$ satisfy (8.1)-(8.2).

We also have $F \\in C^{2}(\\bar{M}) \\cap$ $\\Lambda^{\\ell}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{\\ell}\\left(b_{1}^{+} M\\right)\\right)$ for any $\\ell<r_{0}+1 / 2$. Further, $F(M)$ is still an $a_{1}^{+}$domain.\n(b) Suppose $m>r_{0}$. Suppose $\\bar{M}$ with $b \\bar{M} \\in \\Lambda^{m+1 / 2}$ is a small $C^{2}$ perturbation of $b M$ and $\\tilde{A} \\in \\Lambda^{m}(\\bar{M})$ defines a formal integrable almost complex structure with $|\\tilde{A}|_{r_{0}}$ being sufficiently small. There is a global coordinate map $\\tilde{F} \\in$ $\\Lambda^{\\ell}(\\bar{M})$ for $\\tilde{A}$, for any $\\ell<r+1 / 2$. Furthermore, $\\|\\tilde{F}-\\mathrm{id}\\|_{2}<\\delta$ and $\\tilde{F}(M)$ is still an $a_{1}^{+}$domain.\nWe want to show that without requiring $b_{1}^{+} M$ to be more smooth, the $F$ in $(a)$ is actually in $\\Lambda^{\\ell}(M)$ for any $\\ell<m+1 / 2$, assuming $A \\in \\Lambda^{m}$. Here we apply Hartogs's extension. This technic has been used recently in [14] for solving the $\\bar{\\partial}$ problem.\n\nSuppose $\\zeta \\in b M$. By Lemma 6.2, we can find a smoothly bounded subdomain $M_{\\zeta}^{*}$ of $M$ that is a small perturbation of $M$ in class $C^{2} \\cap \\Lambda^{s_{*}}$ such that $\\zeta \\in b M_{\\zeta}^{*}$. Since $M_{\\zeta}^{*}$ is a subdomain of $M,(8.28)$ implies that\n\n$$\n\\left.t_{0}^{\\alpha}\\left|A\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}}\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}, s} \\leq 1, \\quad t_{0}^{-\\varepsilon}\\left|A\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}}\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}, r_{0}} \\leq 1\n$$\n\nTherefore, we can apply (b) and find a coordinate map $F_{\\zeta}$ for $\\left.A\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}}$ that is smooth on $\\overline{M_{\\zeta}^{*}}$ such that $\\left|F_{\\zeta}-\\right.$ id $\\left.\\right|_{M_{\\zeta}^{*}}<\\varepsilon$. It is clear that\n\n$$\nM=\\bigcup_{\\zeta \\in b_{1}^{-} M} M_{\\zeta}^{*}\n$$\n\nTo apply Hartogs's extension theorem, we take a local homomorphic coordinate map $\\phi$ from a small neighborhood $U_{\\zeta}$ of $\\zeta$ onto $P_{\\delta, \\varepsilon}=\\Delta_{\\delta}^{n-1} \\times([-\\delta, \\delta]+i[-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon])$. We may assume that $\\phi(\\zeta)=0$.

In our main results on the global Newlander-Nirenberg problem, we only use estimate in Theorem 1.2 for $\\delta=1 / 2$ when $b M$ has the concave component.

Inductively, we can verify that\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{h}^{M}(f \\chi)(x)=\\sum_{i, j, k} \\sum_{j \\leq i, j \\leq M-k} C_{i, j, k} \\Delta_{h}^{i} \\tilde{f}(x+j h) \\Delta_{h}^{M-i} \\chi(x+k h)\n$$\n\nTherefore, $\\left|\\Delta_{h}^{M}(f \\chi)(x)\\right| \\leq C_{s} \\sum_{i, 0}^{M}|h|^{s-M+i}\\left|\\tilde{f}\\right|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s-i}}|h|^{M-i}\\|\\chi\\|_{C^{M-i}}$. On $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, it is well-known that $\\|\\tilde{f}\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{a}} \\leq C_{a, b}\\|\\tilde{f}\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{b}}$ for $a<b$. This shows that $\\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{U}}^{s}(\\Omega)}^{*} \\leq$ $C_{s}\\|\\tilde{f}\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}} \\leq 2 C_{s}\\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}(\\Omega)}$.\n\nFor the other inequality, we start with\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}(\\Omega)}=\\left\\|\\sum \\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}(\\Omega)} \\leq \\sum\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}(\\Omega)} \\leq \\sum\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}\\left(\\Omega_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{E}_{j}$ be the Rychkov extension for $\\Omega_{j}$. We have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{j}\\left(\\chi_{j} f\\right)=\\sum_{k} \\psi_{j, k} *\\left(\\varphi_{j, k} *\\left(\\chi_{j} f\\right)\\right)_{\\Omega_{j}}\n$$\n\nBy Theorem A. 6 (b), we have $\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}\\left(\\Omega_{j}\\right)} \\leq\\left\\|\\mathcal{E}_{j}\\left(\\chi_{j} f\\right)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\leq C_{s}\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}\\left(\\Omega_{j}\\right)}$. By Theorem A. 7 for special Lipschitz domains, we get $\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}^{s}\\left(\\Omega_{j}\\right)} \\leq\\left\\|\\chi_{j} f\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{U}}^{s}\\left(\\Omega_{j}\\right)}$. Hence $\\|f\\|_{C^{s}(\\Omega)} \\leq C_{s}\\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{U}}^{s}(\\Omega)}^{*}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[1] O.V. Besov, V.P.
