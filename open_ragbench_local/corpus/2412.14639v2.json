Transparency in AI has become a topic of substantial regulatory importance worldwide. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides citizens the right to explanations for impactful automated decisions which relate to personal data [1]. More recently, in 2024, the European Union enacted the AI act. The AI act provides individuals, in the context of high-risk AI systems, the right to an explanation for: (i) the use of an AI system in the decision-making process; (ii) the most important elements of that decision [2]. In the United States, the Maintaining American Leadership in AI executive order tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with developing a plan for robust and safe research and development in AI [3]. NIST's plan listed explainability as an aspect of trustability, which is one of their key areas of focus.

Without specialized tools, AI developers often cannot understand the reasoning of their models. There are several paths one can take to satisfy the new need for model explanations, the most popular approach is to create post hoc explanations for black-box models. Post hoc explanations have the advantage that we can continue to use powerful black box models, such as computer vision models, without being entirely blind to their inner workings.\n\nThis paper ${ }^{1}$ focuses on additive explanations, which indicate inputs with the largest effect on a particular output [6]. For example, if one were to apply for a bank loan and be rejected, an additive explanation would quantify the impact of features such as income, location, and debt on the application's rejection. When applied to AI models, these explanations describe which inputs are most important in making a particular decision. Several methods have been proposed for generating additive explanations; however, only one satisfies the important properties of local accuracy, missingness, and consistency [6]. This method is based on the Shapley value, a solution concept from cooperative game theory often used in economic game theory.\n\nIn game theory, the Shapley value is a weighted average of the contribution provided by a player to every possible coalition of other players. To apply Shapley values to the analysis of AI models, we simply consider each feature a player and interpret a player being included or excluded from a coalition as a feature being on or off. Unfortunately, the direct calculation of Shapley values is NP-Hard. This means it takes an exponential number of operations [7, 8]. Outside of some special cases, random sampling is the only option for approximation [9].\n\nIn parallel to the growth in AI, we have seen an emergence of quantum computation and quantum AI [10]. Due to the fickle nature of quantum information, the problem of explainability is amplified since measuring a quantum system destroys information. As a result, many quantum algorithms act as ultra-black boxes, where their internal workings are impossible to comprehend or even fully measure. Though the field of eXplainable Quantum AI (XQAI) is still emerging, there exists some work into finding the Shapley values of quantum algorithms [11, 12], and a bit into other additive methods such as LIME [13]. Existing methods for Shapley-based explanations either rely on knowing the algorithm's structure as a quantum circuit or random sampling. By Chebyshev's inequality, random sampling is quadratic in complexity, twice the precision is four times the work [14]. Fortunately, it is often possible to do better in by leveraging quantum effects.\n\nIn this paper, we detail an efficient algorithm for calculating the Shapley values of the input qubits of a quantum circuit. In some cases, our method provides a quadratic speedup, up to polylogarithmic factors, when compared to Monte-Carlo methods. With a fixed likelihood for success and a fixed range of outputs, we can have an arbitrarily accurate Shapley value approximation where the quantum query complexity grows inversely to precision.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background and preliminaries on Shapley values. Section 3 is composed of Subsection 3.1, which introduces a guiding example problem, and Subsection 3.2, which provides a simple example of Shapley Values use in explainability. Sections 4 and 5 present our algorithms. The error and complexity analysis are covered in Appendix D. Section 6 demonstrates the application of our methods to the problem discussed in section 3. Section 7 provides an improved version of our quantum algorithm for Shapley value approximation. Section 8 surveys related work. Section 9 concludes the article.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The work presented in this paper extends early research [5].\n    Manuscript submitted to ACM TQC", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 BACKGROUND \n\nThis section presents preliminaries on Shapley values, including the notation used, as defined in Table 1, and formal definitions.\n\nTable 1. Notation and symbols used in this section\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nCooperative game theory is the study of coalitional games. In this article, we are most interested in Shapley values. We now list some definitions and preliminaries,\n\nDefinition 1 (Coalitional game). A coalitional game is a tuple $G=(F, V) . F=\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ is a set of $n+1$ players. $V: \\mathcal{P}(F) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a value function with $V(S) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ representing the value of a given coalition $S \\subseteq F$, with the restriction that $V(\\emptyset)=0$.\n\nDefinition 2 (Payoff Vector). Given a game $G=(F, V)$, there exists a payoff vector $\\Phi(G)$ of length $n+1$. Each element $\\Phi(G, i) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ represents the utility of player $i \\in F$. The value function determines a payoff vector. Player $i$ 's payoff value $\\Phi(G, i)$ is determined by how $V(S), S \\subseteq F$, is affected by $i$ 's inclusion or exclusion from $S$.\n\nThere are a variety of solution concepts for constructing payoffs [15]. We focus on the Shapley solution concept, which returns a payoff vector [16]. Each element of the payoff vector $\\Phi(G, i)$, is called player $i$ 's Shapley value. Shapley values have various interpretations depending on the game being analyzed.\n\nShapley values are derived using one of several sets of axioms. We use the following four [16]. Suppose we have games $G=(F, V)$ and $G^{\\prime}=\\left(F, V^{\\prime}\\right)$, and a payoff vector $\\Phi(G)$, then:\n(1) Efficiency: The sum of all utility is equal to that of the grand coalition (the coalition containing all players),\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\Phi(G, i)=V(F)\n$$\n\n(2) Equal Treatment: Players $i, j$ are said to be symmetrical if for all $S \\subseteq F$, where $i, j \\notin S$ we have that $V(S \\cup\\{i\\})=V(S \\cup\\{j\\})$. If $i$ and $j$ are symmetric in $G$, then they are treated equally, $\\Phi(G, i)=\\Phi(G, j)$.\n(3) Null Player: Consider a player $i \\in F$, if for all $S \\subseteq F$ such that $i \\notin S$, we have $V(S)=V(S \\cup\\{i\\})$, then $i$ is a null player. If $i$ is a null player, then $\\Phi(G, i)=0$.\n(4) Additivity: If a player is in two games $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$, then the Shapley values of the two games are additive\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(G+G^{\\prime}, i\\right)=\\Phi(G, i)+\\Phi\\left(G^{\\prime}, i\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere a game $G+G^{\\prime}$ is defined as $\\left(F, V+V^{\\prime}\\right)$, and $\\left(V+V^{\\prime}\\right)(S)=V(S)+V^{\\prime}(S), S \\subseteq F$.\n\nThese axioms lead to a single unique and intuitive division of utility [16]. The values of the payoff vectors can be interpreted as the responsibility of the respective players for the final outcome [17]. When player $i$ has a small payoff $\\Phi(G, i)$, then player $i$ has a neutral impact on the final outcome. When player $i$ has a large payoff, then player $i$ greatly impacts the final outcome.\n\nDefinition 3 (Shapley value [18]). Let $G=(F, V)$, for notational simplicity, we write $\\Phi(G, i)$ as $\\Phi(i)$. The Shapley value of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ player is,\n\n$$\n\\Phi(i)=\\Phi^{+}(i)-\\Phi^{-}(i)\n$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\Phi^{+}(i)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|) V^{+}(S), & V^{+}(S)=V(S \\cup\\{i\\}), \\text { and } \\\\\n\\Phi^{-}(i)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|) V^{-}(S), & V^{-}(S)=V(S)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nGiven $n=|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|$\n\n$$\n\\gamma(n, m)=\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{m}!(n+1)}\n$$\n\nRemark 1. The Shapley value is equivalently written as,\n\n$$\n\\Phi(i)=\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|)(V(S \\cup\\{i\\})-V(S))\n$$\n\nThe Shapley value of $i$ is the expected marginal contribution to a random coalition $S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}$, where the marginal contribution is equal to $V(S \\cup\\{i\\})-V(S)$ [17]. Each player's Shapley value can be interpreted as a weighted average of their contributions. Where the weights, $\\gamma(n, m)$, have an intuitive interpretation: the factor $1 /\\binom{n}{m}$ results in each possible size of $S$ having an equal impact on the final value. Since, given $|S|=m$, there would be $\\binom{n}{m}$ summands contributing to the final value. The multiplicand $1 /(n+1)$ averages between the different sizes of $S$.\n\nLemma 1. We have that $\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|)$ is equal to one.\nProof. Let us define $H_{m}=\\{S \\in \\mathcal{P}(F \\backslash\\{i\\}):|S|=m\\}$. We can rewrite $\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|)$ as,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{S \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m)\n$$\n\nPlugging in the definition for $\\gamma$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{S \\in H_{m}} \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{m}(n+1)}=\\frac{1}{n+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{m}} \\sum_{S \\in H_{m}} 1\n$$\n\nSince there are $n$ choose $m$ possible subsets of size $m$ and hence $n$ choose $m$ possible subsets in $H_{m}$, it follows that we have,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{m}}\\binom{n}{m}\n$$\n\nHence, the result holds.\nWe develop algorithms for general games and demonstrate them for a monotonic game.\nManuscript submitted to ACM TQC\n\nDefinition 4 (Monotonic game). A game is monotonic if for all $S, H \\subseteq F$, we have, $V(S \\cup H) \\geq V(S)$. Note that when a game is monotonic, every summand in Equation (1) is non-negative.\n\nA naive approach to finding the $i^{\\text {th }}$ player's Shapley value is through direct calculation using the Shapley Equation (1), completing the task in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{n}\\right)$ assessments of $V$. For structured games, it may be possible to calculate Shapley values more efficiently. Otherwise, another option is random sampling [9]. Substantial trade-offs exist in each case. We propose a quantum algorithm with some substantial advantages in the following sections.", "tables": {"table_0": "| $G=(F, V)$ | : | Coalitional game, $F$ being a set of players and $V$ a function which assigns a value to each subset of players (Definition 1) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\Phi(G, i), \\Phi(i)$ | : | Player $i$ 's payoff, or Shapley value, which represents how important they are in the game $G$ (Definitions 2, 3) |\n| $\\Phi^{\\Sigma}(i)$ | : | $\\Phi^{-}(i)$ is a weighted average of the value of each subset not including player $i$ (Definition 3) |\n|  | : | $\\Phi^{+}(i)$ is a weighted average of the value of each subset including player $i$ (Definition 3) |\n|  | : | The difference $\\Phi^{+}(i) \\sim \\Phi^{-}(i)$ is equal to the $i$ th player's Shapley value $\\Phi(i)$ (Definition 3) |\n| $V^{\\Sigma}$ | : | $V^{-}$is the value of a subset excluding player $i$ (Definition 3) |\n|  | : | $V^{+}$is the value of a subset including player $i$ (Definition 3) |\n| $\\gamma(n, m)$ | : | The weights used to calculate $\\Phi^{\\Sigma}(i)$ (Definition 3) |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 CLASSICAL SHAPLEY VALUE APPLICATIONS\n### 3.1 Weighted Voting Games\n\nLet us model a player's voting power as a weighted count of instances in which the player has the deciding vote. The Shapley values correspond to voting power. Three friends sit around a table. They are deliberating a grave matter. Should they get Chinese food for the second weekend in a row? They decide to take a vote. Alice just got a promotion at work. To celebrate this, their friends agreed to give them three votes. Bob, the youngest of the group, also had good news, an incredible mark on their latest assignment! Everyone decided Bob should get two votes. Charley, who had nothing to celebrate, and who is generally disliked, gets one vote. The group decides to go out for Chinese food if there are four yes votes. In the end, all the friends vote for Chinese food.\n\nAt the restaurant, they run into their friend David, a mathematician. David is intrigued when they hear about their vote. David begins to wonder how much power each friend had in the vote. The intuitive answer is that Alice had the most voting power, Bob had the second most, and Charley had the least. However, David notices something strange. Bob does not seem to have a more meaningful influence than Charley. There are no cases where Bob's two votes would do more than Charley's single vote. David concludes, there must be a more nuanced answer. David heard of cooperative game theory and Shapley values. David might be able to answer the question.\n\nHow can Definition 3 be applied to David's problem? Consider the game $G=(F, V)$. The players are Alice (0), Bob (1), and Charley (2) represented as the set $F=\\{0,1,2\\}$. Denote each player's voting weight as $w_{0}=3, w_{1}=2$, and $w_{2}=1$. Recall that the vote threshold is $q$ equal to four. Then, for any subset $S \\subseteq F$, we can define $V$ as:\n\n$$\nV(S)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } \\sum_{j \\in S} w_{j} \\geq q \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$V(S)$ is one when the sum of players' votes in $S$ reaches the threshold of four. Otherwise, the vote fails and $V(S)$ is zero. This is called a weighted voting game [7]. One could easily add more players with arbitrary non-negative weights and thresholds. Note that weighted voting games fall into the family of monotonic games (Definition 4).\n\nIn this context, the terms in the Shapley value equation have an intuitive meaning. Take player $i$, and consider a set $S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}$. If $V(S \\cup\\{i\\})-V(S)=1$, then the $i^{\\text {th }}$ player is a deciding vote for the set of players $S$. Otherwise, player $i$ is not a deciding vote.\n\nThus, for weighted voting games, player $i$ 's Shapley value represents a weighted count of how many times $i$ is a deciding vote. We can work out the Shapley values by hand, noting that,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V(\\emptyset)=0, \\quad V(\\{0\\})=0, \\quad V(\\{1\\})=0, \\quad V(\\{0,1\\})=1, \\\\\n& V(\\{2\\})=0, \\quad V(\\{0,2\\})=1, \\quad V(\\{1,2\\})=0, \\quad V(\\{0,1,2\\})=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom this, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi(0)= & \\sum_{S \\subseteq F(j i)} \\gamma\\{|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|) \\cdot(V(S \\cup\\{i\\})-V(S)) \\\\\n= & \\gamma(2,0) \\cdot(V(\\{0\\})-V(\\emptyset))+\\gamma(2,1) \\cdot(V(\\{0,1\\})-V(\\{1\\})) \\\\\n& +\\gamma(2,1) \\cdot(V(\\{0,2\\})-V(\\{2\\}))+\\gamma(2,2) \\cdot(V(\\{0,1,2\\})-V(\\{1,2\\})) \\\\\n= & 2 \\cdot \\gamma(2,1)+\\gamma(2,2)=\\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis can be repeated to get $\\Phi(1)$ and $\\Phi(2)$ equal to $1 / 6$.\nIn the case of Alice, Bob, and Charley's voting game, it is trivial to calculate their respective Shapley values. However, what if one hundred colleagues were choosing a venue for a party, all with different numbers of votes? In that case, a direct calculation would take $2^{100}$ assessments of $V$ ! For this more general case, we need to be clever.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3.2 Explainability and Shapley Values of Binary Classifiers \n\nExplainable AI can be broken into two categories, inherent explainability, and post-hoc explainability [4]. Inherently explainable models rely on algorithms which are easy to interpret, such as small decision trees or linear models. Ideally, every application would use inherently explainable models [4]; however, contemporary models tend to be black boxes which are very large and non-linear, e.g., deep neural networks. As a result, post-hoc methods, which attempt to explain black box decisions, have become an important form of harm-reduction. A promising research direction looks at using counterfactuals, questions of the form \"what is the smallest change that can be made to the input to change the output,\" as explanations $[19,20]$. This paper focuses primarily on additive explanations, which assign importance to each input of a model [6].\n\nThere are multiple approaches to producing model explanations, one of the most promising being based on Shapley Values [6]. We introduce a simplified but rigorous method to leverage Shapley Values for explainability. Suppose we have a binary classifier $C:\\{0,1\\}^{r \\times r} \\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, which classifies binary strings of length $r^{2}$. This could, for example, represent a classifier which takes a $r$ by $r$ black and white medical scan and decides whether a patient has a cancerous tumour [21]. This is easily translated to a cooperative game. We consider each input bit (respectively pixel) to be a player in $F=\\left\\{0, \\cdots, r^{2}-1\\right\\}$. Each binary string $h=h_{r^{2}-1} \\cdots h_{1} h_{0} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{r \\times r}$ represents a coalition $S_{h}$ where player $j$ is included if and only if $h_{j}$ is one (or equivalently, the $j$ th pixel is white),\n\n$$\nS_{h}=\\left\\{j: h_{j}=1, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{r}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe can then define our value function $V_{C}: \\mathcal{P}(F) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ to correspond to the classifier $C$,\n\n$$\nV_{C}\\left(S_{h}\\right)=C\\left(h_{r^{2}-1} \\cdots h_{1} h_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing this change in perspective we can now leverage tools from cooperative game theory. In particular, we can now assign each input bit $h_{j}$ an importance, its Shapley value $\\Phi_{j}$. For our tumour classifier example, this would give us a heat map of where the classifier focuses on the most when it makes decisions. This represents a global explanation, which gives a general idea of which features (a.k.a., players or pixels) are most important for decision-making generally.\n\nWe can also define a method which gives local explanations. This gives an idea of which features were most important for a particular decision. Suppose we want to understand why classifier decided that $C(x)=y$, where $x=x_{r^{2}-1} \\cdots x_{1} x_{0} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{r \\times r}$ and $y \\in\\{0,1\\}$. We define a new value function, as follows:\n\n$$\nV_{C, x}\\left(S_{h}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2^{\\left|F \\backslash S_{h}\\right|}} \\sum_{Q \\subseteq F \\backslash S_{h}}\\left|V_{C}\\left(S_{x}\\right)-V_{C}\\left(\\left(S_{x} \\cap S_{h}\\right) \\cup Q\\right)\\right|\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Manuscript submitted to ACM TQC\n\nFor a given set $Q \\subseteq F \\backslash S_{h}$, player $k \\in F$ is in $\\left(S_{x} \\cap S_{h}\\right) \\cup Q$ if either: $k \\in Q$ which implies $k \\notin S_{h}$; or if $k \\in S_{h}$ and $S_{x}$. In more simple terms, when $k$ is in $S_{h}$, its inclusion in $\\left(S_{x} \\cap S_{h}\\right) \\cup Q$ is based on its inclusion in $S_{x}$, otherwise, it is based on its inclusion in $Q$. We average the change in classification across every possible $Q \\subseteq F \\backslash S_{h}$. In effect, our value function fixes a subset of features $S_{h}$ in $x$, and every feature in $F \\backslash S_{h}$ is replaced with noise. The Shapley values derived from $V_{C, x}$ describe the importance of features in the decision of $C(x)=y$. Note that local explanations could be described differently, but this particular definition is highly compatible with the quantum algorithm described in the following sections.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4 QUANTUM ALGORITHM FOR SHAPLEY VALUE APPROXIMATION \n\nTable 2. Notation and symbols used in sections 4, 5 and 7\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nWe represent the Shapley value calculation problem in the quantum context. Consider an $n+1$ player game $G$ represented by the pair $(F, V)$, where $F=\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $V: \\mathcal{P}(F) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, with $V(\\emptyset)=0$. Table 2 gives an overview for the notation in this and the next section (Sections 4 and 5). We define $V_{\\max }$ as an upper bound and $V_{\\min }$ as the lower bound of the value function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V_{\\max } \\geq \\max _{S \\subseteq F} V(S), \\text { and } \\\\\n& V_{\\min } \\leq \\min _{S \\subseteq F} V(S)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe goal is to implement a quantum version of $V(S)$ and apply it on a superposition representing all possible subsets $S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}$ and $S \\cup\\{i\\}$. We first define two quantum registers, the player and utility registers. The player register Pl represents player coalitions and requires $n$ qubits. Meanwhile, the utility Ut register requires one qubit, and in its probability amplitude, represents the output of $V$ given a player coalition.\n\nDefinition 5. To encode coalitions in the player register, consider the selection binary sequence $h=h_{n} \\cdots h_{i+1} h_{i-1} \\cdots$ $h_{0} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$. Let $S_{h}$ be the set of all players $j \\in F$ such that $h_{j}=1 . S_{h}$ can represent any player coalition that excludes the player $i$ given the corresponding $h$.\n\nIn the player register, the computational basis states represent different subsets of players, where the $j$ th qubit represents the $j$ th player. In this encoding, the $j$ th qubit being $|1\\rangle$ represents $j$ 's inclusion in the subset. $|0\\rangle$ represents its exclusion. Thus, every possible subset of players excluding player $i$ has a corresponding basis state. It follows that representing every subset of players simultaneously in a quantum superposition is possible. The one-qubit utility register encodes the output of $V$.\n\nNext, we define a function that maps $V$ to the interval $[0,1]$,\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}^{S}(h):=\\frac{V^{S}\\left(S_{h}\\right)-V_{\\min }}{V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }}\n$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\nV^{*}(h):=\\frac{V\\left(S_{h} \\cup\\{i\\}\\right)-V_{\\min }}{V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad V^{-}(h):=\\frac{V\\left(S_{h}\\right)-V_{\\min }}{V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }}\n$$\n\nWe define the following $2^{n+1}$ by $2^{n+1}$ block diagonal matrix:\n\n$$\nB^{ \\pm}=\\bigoplus_{h=0}^{2^{n}-1} \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\gamma\\left(n,|h|_{H}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(h)}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma\\left(n,|h|_{H}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(h)}} \\quad \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma\\left(n,|h|_{H}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(h)}}{-\\sqrt{1-\\gamma\\left(n,|h|_{H}\\right) \\cdot \\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(h)}},\n$$\n\nwhere $|h|_{H}$ is the Hamming distance between $h$ and 0 in $n$ bits, or the number of ones in the binary representation of $h$.

The player register stores a superposition of all possible player coalitions. A player is excluded or included from a coalition if the bit in the player register with position corresponding to their number, is 0 or 1 .

See Appendix B.\nThe beta function and, by extension, the Shapley weights are approximated with Riemann sums. The sums represent the area under the function $x^{m}(1-x)^{n-m}$ using partitions of the interval $[0,1]$. We demonstrate the function $x^{m}(1-$ $x)^{n-m}$ can be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer.\n\nDefinition 7 (Riemann sum). A Riemann sum [23, page 276] of a function $f$, with respect to a partition $P=\\left(t_{0}, \\ldots, t_{s}\\right)$ of the interval $[a, b]$, is an approximation of the integral of $f$ from a to $b$ of the form:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1}\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k}\\right) \\cdot f\\left(x_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{k+1}-t_{k}$ is the width of the subinterval, and $f\\left(x_{k}\\right)$ is the height, $x_{k} \\in\\left[t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right]$.\nWe begin with the initial quantum state:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\psi_{0}\\right\\rangle=|0\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}^{\\otimes f} \\otimes|0\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}^{\\otimes n} \\otimes|0\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Ut}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{Pt}, \\mathrm{Pt}$, and Ut denote the partition, player, and utility registers. We leverage Pt to prepare the $\\gamma(n, m)$ weights.

Let the number of qubits in the player register be $n$, one qubit per player excluding player $i$. Note, in practice, there will often be a qubit to represent player $i$; however, we omit this qubit for simplicity. Let the number of qubits in the utility register be one.\n\nConsider the partition,\n\n$$\nP_{\\ell}=\\left(t_{\\ell}(k)\\right)_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nof the interval $[0,1]$, leveraged for Riemann sums in Figure 2, where,\n\n$$\nt_{\\ell}(k):=\\sin ^{2}\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2^{\\ell+1}}\\right), \\text { with } k=0,1, \\ldots, 2^{\\ell}\n$$\n\nThis partition is computationally simple to implement on a quantum computer.

Thus, $D_{\\ell}$ can be implemented as a unitary. Any approximation of Equation (20), with a maximum error for $w_{\\ell}(k)$ of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(4^{-n}\\right)$, is compatible with the error analysis in Appendix D.\n\nDefinition 8. We denote $C_{D}(\\ell)$ as the complexity to implement $D_{\\ell}$ such that it satisfies,\n\n$$\n\\max _{k \\in\\{0,1\\}^{2}}\\left|\\left\\langle k \\mid D_{\\ell} \\mid 0\\right\\rangle^{\\otimes \\ell}-w_{\\ell}(k)\\right| \\leq O\\left(4^{-\\ell}\\right)\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, approximating a state to such a high accuracy is currently computationally intensive to implement. It is still an area of active research [24]. At the very least, $D_{\\ell}$ can be implemented without error in $(23 / 24) 2^{\\ell}$ CNOT gates [25].

Note that the value of $t_{t}^{\\prime}(k)$ is always somewhere in the range $\\left[t_{t}(k), t_{t}(k+1)\\right]$ (Appendix C).\n\nUnitary $R_{j}$ is performed on each qubit in the player register, controlled by the partition register. The sum of all applications of $R_{j}$ can be performed with $n t$ gates in $\\mathcal{O}(\\max (n, t))$ layers and yields the quantum state:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\psi_{1 b}\\right\\rangle & =\\prod_{j=0}^{n}\\left(R_{j} \\otimes I\\right)\\left|\\psi_{1 a}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1} \\sqrt{w_{t}(k)}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}\\left(\\sqrt{1-t_{t}^{\\prime}(k)}|0\\rangle+\\sqrt{t_{t}^{\\prime}(k)}|1\\rangle\\right)_{\\mathrm{P} 1}^{\\otimes n}|0\\rangle_{i t \\mathrm{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRecall that the player register is of size $n$ qubits. By performing $R_{j}$ on each qubit, given a particular $|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}$, each player qubit has been rotated by $t_{t}^{\\prime}(k)$. The reason for doing this is non-trivial and justified in Lemma 2. In short, this operation is equivalent to sampling the heights of the $b_{n, m}$ function in every subinterval of the partition $P_{t}$. We use the resulting values in a Riemann sum approximation of the special beta function.\n\nLemma 2. Let $H_{m}$ be the set of binary numbers of hamming distance $m$ from 0 in $n$ bits, such that $h \\in H_{m}$ implies $|h|_{H}=m$ (Equation (11)).

Applying our approximation for $\\gamma(n, m)$ and tracing out the player and partition registers, we have,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathrm{Pt}, \\mathrm{P} 1}\\left(\\left|\\psi_{2}^{ \\pm}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_{2}^{ \\pm}\\right|\\right) \\approx \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m)\\left|V^{ \\pm}(h)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Ut}}\\left\\langle V^{ \\pm}(h)\\right|_{\\mathrm{Ut}}\n$$\n\nFinally, suppose we measure the utility register on a computational basis. This yields the following expected value with error less than $\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) \\sqrt{n} / 2^{f-3}$ (Appendix D),\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m) \\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(h)\n$$\n\nComparing the expected values of measuring the utility registers for $\\left|\\psi_{2}^{ \\pm}\\right\\rangle$and $\\left|\\psi_{2}^{-}\\right\\rangle$gives,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m) \\hat{V}^{+}(h)-\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m) \\hat{V}^{-}(h)\n$$\n\nPlugging in the definition for $\\hat{V}^{ \\pm}$, we have,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }} \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m)\\left(V\\left(S_{h} \\cup\\{i\\}\\right)-V\\left(S_{h}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nNotice that in the $S_{h}$ encoding, $H_{m}$ represents each subset of $F \\backslash\\{i\\}$ of size $m$. As a result, the equation is in effect, summing over each subset of $F \\backslash\\{i\\}$ with corresponding $\\gamma$ weights, Definition 3. Thus, multiplying the previous equation by $\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)$, we obtain,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{S \\subseteq F \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\gamma(|F \\backslash\\{i\\}|,|S|) \\cdot(V(S \\cup\\{i\\})-V(S))\n$$\n\nThis expected value is precisely the Shapley value $\\Phi(i)$ to some error analytically upper-bounded in Appendix D. With the ability to craft these states, we can now extract the required information to find a close approximation to the Shapley value. Assuming we could get the expected value instantly, we would have an error of less than $16\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) \\sqrt{n} / 2^{f}$. However, it takes some work to approximate an expected value. This can be achieved with accuracy $\\epsilon$ with some chosen\n\nconfidence using amplitude estimation as described by Montanaro [22], resulting in a circuit which repeats Steps 1 and 2 in the order of $O\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ times.\n\nTo conclude, by Appendix D Theorem 8, we have time complexity in $O\\left\\{\\lambda\\left(C_{D}\\left(\\left\\lceil\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right\\rceil\\right)+C_{V}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)+n \\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right)\\right\\}$. Where $\\lambda$ is equal to $\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) / \\epsilon, \\epsilon$ is the desired maximum error with fixed likelihood of success, $C_{D}\\left(\\left\\lceil\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right\\rceil\\right)$ is the complexity of implementing $D_{\\left\\lceil\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right\\rceil}$ with max error $O\\left(\\lambda^{-2} n^{-1}\\right)$ (Definition 8), and $C_{V}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)$ is the complexity of implementing $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$with maximum error of $\\lambda^{-1}$ (Appendix D, Definition 12). Assuming a case where $C_{V}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)$ is proportional to or larger than $C_{D}\\left(\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right)+n \\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})$, the difference $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$ is proportional to $\\sigma$ and $C_{V}\\left(\\epsilon /\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\right)$ is proportional to $C_{V}(\\epsilon)$, we have a quadratic improvement over Monte-Carlo methods.

Subsection 3.1) using our quantum approach. We intend to apply the method presented in Section 5 for weighted voting games. Additional results, together with the simulation code, are available in a companion GitHub repository [28]. Let us approximate each player's Shapley value, $\\Phi(i)$. We have a game $G=(F, V)$, where $F=\\{0,1,2\\}, n=2$, and $V$ is defined in Equation (4). Let the voting weights be $w_{0}=3, w_{1}=2$, and $w_{2}=1$. Thus, we can define $V^{ \\pm}(h), h \\in\\{0,1\\}^{2}$, where $h$ represents an element in $\\mathcal{P}(F \\backslash\\{i\\})$,\n\n$$\nV^{-}(h)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } \\sum_{s \\in S_{h}} w_{s} \\geq q \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases} \\quad V^{+}(h)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } \\sum_{s \\in S_{h} \\cup\\{i\\}} w_{s} \\geq q \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNote that, $V^{ \\pm}(h)$ is either 0 or 1 . Thus, we can take $V_{\\max }=1, V_{\\min }=0$. We define $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$to be:\n\n$$\nU_{V}^{ \\pm}|x\\rangle|0\\rangle=|x\\rangle \\otimes\\left\\{\\left(1-\\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(x)\\right)|0\\rangle+\\hat{V}^{ \\pm}(x)|1\\rangle\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe quantum circuit for the scenario is shown in Figure 3. Note that, much like with the figure, it is trivial to generate $V^{+}$and $V^{-}$if one has a quantum gate to compute $V$.\n\nWith $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$defined, all other steps are entirely agnostic to voting games. Let $\\ell$ be equal to 2 , and suppose we can instantly extract the expected value for simplicity's sake. This is not a realistic scenario, but it demonstrates how quickly the expected value of the utility register converges in Steps 1 and 2. With these parameters, we get the following approximations for the Shapley values:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\Phi}_{0} \\approx 0.6617, \\quad \\hat{\\Phi}_{1}, \\hat{\\Phi}_{2} \\approx 0.1616\n$$\n\nThe direct calculation for Alice can be seen in Appendix A.\nTo rigorously demonstrate efficacy, we performed many trials on random weighted voting games (Figure 4). Visual inspection confirms that the error from Step 1 decreases exponentially with respect to $\\ell$. Step 2 depends entirely on the game. However, if it is possible to implement on a classical computer, much like with Grover's algorithm, it can be implemented in a quantum setting [29]. Step 3 is well studied, it extracts the expected value of measuring the utility register with error $\\epsilon$, with a fixed probability of success. Use amplitude estimation as described in Section 5 with the techniques described in [22].\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFig. 3. Circuit of $U_{k}^{x}$ for a weighted voting game. This circuit takes an basis state input $\\left|h_{n}, \\ldots, h_{i+1}, x, h_{i-1}, \\ldots, h_{0}\\right\\rangle$ and outputs $\\left|V^{-}\\left(S_{h}\\right)\\right\\rangle$ when $x=0$ or $\\left|V^{+}\\left(S_{h}\\right)\\right\\rangle$ when $x=1$ to the utility register (Recall, $S_{h}$ is defined in Definition 5). The auxiliary register contains the total vote count. Just before the $\\geq q$ gate, the Aux register is in a basis state corresponding to the vote count of $S_{h}$, including or excluding player $i$ s vote depending on $x$. The $\\geq q$ gate uses the auxiliary register as an input and outputs whether the vote count exceeds threshold $q$ in the Ut register. After this gate, it is trivial to clear the Aux register by subtracting each player's contribution. Results and simulation code are available in a companion GitHub repository [28].", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-2.jpeg":

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# 6.2 Explainability and Shapley Values of Quantum Binary Classifiers \n\nThe local explanation method described in Subsection 3.2 is conveniently translated to the quantum context. Suppose we are given a quantum classifier $U_{C}$ that acts on two registers as follows, $U_{C}\\left|j\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}\\left|0\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Ut}} \\rightarrow|j\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}|C(j)\\rangle$, where $j \\in\\{0,1\\}^{c \\times r}$, and $C$ is defined in Subsection 3.2. To calculate the $i$ th player's Shapley value $\\Phi_{i}$ of $V_{C, x}$, Equation (5), and hence generate a local explanation for the model decision $C(x)=y$, we only need a simple modification to our method. We now give a sketch of the implementation. Suppose that, after Step 1 of the Section 5 algorithm, we have the approximate state,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathrm{Pt}}\\left|\\psi_{1 b}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_{1 b}\\right| \\approx \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} \\gamma(n, m)|h\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}\\langle h|_{\\mathrm{P} 1}\n$$\n\nignoring the Ut register. To craft the distribution which gives value function $V_{x, C}$, Equation (5), we add a second player register $|0\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}^{\\otimes n}$. We can then apply NOT gates to each qubit in P1. Next, apply controlled Hadamard gates between the previous and new player registers. In particular for each player $j$, the $j$ th qubit in the P1 register controls a Hadamard transform on the $j$ th qubit of the $\\mathrm{Pl}^{+}$register. We proceed with old player register P1 traced out. In the remaining Steps, we treat $\\mathrm{Pl}^{+}$as the player register. If we continue with the other steps of the algorithm, Steps 2 and 3, the output will be the Shapley value $\\Phi_{i}$ of corresponding to $V_{C, x}$.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFig. 4. This figure demonstrates the exponentially small error introduced in Step 1 with respect to $\\ell$. We generated 64 random weighted voting games for each condition, e.g., for each combination of $t$ and number of players. Random weights $w_{j} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ were assigned for each case such that $q \\leq \\sum_{j} w_{j}<2 q$. There were four primary scenarios: (1) Four players, voting threshold $q=8$; (2) Six players, voting threshold $q=16$; (3) Eight players, voting threshold $q=32$; and (4) Ten players, voting threshold $q=32$. We approximated every player's Shapley value for each scenario with our quantum algorithm using various $t$ 's, taking only Step 1's error into account. Next, we found the absolute error of our approximation by comparing each approximated Shapley value to its true value. The graphs show the mean and maximum absolute errors of each condition.

{"section_id": 10, "text": "# 7 IMPROVED QUANTUM ALGORITHM FOR SHAPLEY VALUE APPROXIMATION \n\nSection 5 describes an algorithm to estimate the Shapley values of cooperative games. Assuming a reasonable implementation of $D_{\\ell}(20)$, the algorithm is often more efficient than classical random sampling. However, an implementation of $D_{\\ell}$ may not be realistic in the short term, as it might require repeatedly calculating the square root of $\\sin [24]$. Additionally, current techniques may not converge quickly enough to $D_{\\ell}$ to give an advantage over classical methods. As a result, we want to avoid the use of $D_{\\ell}$.\n\nPreviously, the matrix $D_{\\ell}$ was used to compensate for the peculiar partition $P_{\\ell}$ (17), a consequence of using the circuit from Figure 1. If we can create a more reasonable partition, we will not need such expensive compensations. In particular, we can leverage the Quantum CORDIC algorithm for approximation of arcsin to sample from $b_{n, m}(x)$ uniformly [30]. This can be combined with the uniform partition,\n\n$$\nQ_{\\ell}=\\left(k 2^{-\\ell}\\right)_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nto approximate the $\\gamma$ Shapley weights, Definition 3 , The partition $Q_{\\ell}$ has the desirable property that each subinterval has a width equal to $2^{-\\ell}$, which is easily implemented with Hadamard gates.\n\nConsider the $n+1$ player game as defined in Section 5, we wish to find the Shapley value $\\Phi_{i}$ of the $i$ th player. By [30], leveraging $4 \\ell+\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\ell)$ zeroed auxiliary qubits, and using $\\mathcal{O}\\left(t^{2}\\right)$ CNOTs, we can perform the following operation,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{\\ell}}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{E}}}|0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{\\ell}}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{E}}}\\left(\\sqrt{1-r_{\\ell}(k)}|0\\rangle+\\sqrt{r_{\\ell}(k)}|1\\rangle\\right)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Manuscript submitted to ACM TQC\n\nwhere $r_{\\ell}(k)=(k+1 / 2) 2^{-\\ell}+\\epsilon_{k}$, and $\\left|\\epsilon_{k}\\right|$ is less than $2^{-(\\ell+1)}$. It follows that $r_{\\ell}(k) \\in\\left[k 2^{-\\ell},(k+1) 2^{-\\ell}\\right]$. This can be applied to each player qubit, yielding state,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{\\ell}}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}\\left(\\sqrt{1-r_{\\ell}(k)}|0\\rangle+\\sqrt{r_{\\ell}(k)}|1\\rangle\\right)_{\\mathrm{P} 1}^{\\otimes n}\n$$\n\nUsing a nearly identical argument to Lemma 2, and some rearrangement, this is equal to,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{H_{m}}^{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1} \\sqrt{\\frac{b_{n, m}\\left(r_{\\ell}(k)\\right)}{2^{\\ell}}}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}|h\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}\n$$\n\nwhere $b_{n, m}$ is defined in Definition 6, and $H_{m}$ is defined in the statement of Lemma 2. We next add the Ut register and perform $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$, Equation (14), giving state,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\phi^{ \\pm}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{H_{m}}^{2^{\\ell}-1} \\sqrt{\\frac{b_{n, m}\\left(r_{\\ell}(k)\\right)}{2^{\\ell}}}|k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Pt}}|h\\rangle_{\\mathrm{P} 1}\\left|V^{ \\pm}(h)\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{Ut}}\n$$\n\nSimilarly to Section 5, this yields the following expected value for measuring the utility register,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1} \\frac{b_{n, m}\\left(r_{\\ell}(k)\\right)}{2^{\\ell}}\\right) \\bar{V}^{ \\pm}(h)\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^{\\ell}-1} 2^{-\\ell} b_{n, m}\\left(r_{\\ell}(k)\\right)$ is a Riemann sum (Definition 7) approximation of $\\beta_{n, m}$ (Definition 6), which is equal to $\\gamma(n, m)$ (Theorem 3). Combining the reasoning of Corollary 3 and Lemma 11, our Riemann sum approximates $\\gamma(n, m)$ with absolute error less than $2^{1-\\ell} b_{n, m}(m / n)$. As a result, our final error using this method will be less than the bound for the previous algorithm described in Section 5, thus, the error analysis of Appendix D still applies for any given $\\ell$.\n\nTheorem 5. The expected value of the Ut register of $\\left|\\phi^{ \\pm}\\right\\rangle$, multiplying by $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$, and subtracting by $V_{\\min }$ yields,\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{i}+\\rho, \\quad \\rho \\in[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon], \\quad \\epsilon>0\n$$\n\nGiven a fixed probability of success, the operation takes,\n\n$$\nO\\left(\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta V\\left(\\Phi_{i}-V_{\\min }\\right)}}{\\epsilon}\\right] \\cdot\\left[\\log ^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta V n}{\\epsilon}\\right)+n \\log \\left(\\frac{\\Delta V n}{\\epsilon}\\right)+C_{V}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{4 \\Delta V}\\right)\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\noperations. Wherein, $\\Delta V=V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$, and $C_{V}(x)$ is the complexity of implementing $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$with maximum error bound $x$ (Definition 12).\n\nProof. Follows from Theorem 8 and the replacement of transformation $D_{\\ell}$ with the transformation described in [30]. In particular, we must perform $O\\left(\\epsilon^{-1} \\sqrt{\\Delta V\\left(\\Phi_{i}-V_{\\min }\\right)}\\right)$ iterations of amplitude estimation as described by Montanaro [22]. To prepare the $\\gamma$ distribution, each iteration requires that we apply arcsin as described in [30], requiring $O\\left(\\log ^{2}(\\Delta V n / \\epsilon)\\right)$ steps. The results are encoded in player amplitudes using $O(n \\log (\\Delta V n / \\epsilon))$ operations. Finally, each iteration requires a query to the value function $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$with maximum error $\\epsilon /(4 \\Delta V)$, taking $O\\left(C_{V}(\\epsilon /(4 \\Delta V))\\right)$ operations (Definition 12).\n\nWhen the range is not exponentially large, and $U_{V}$ is even somewhat complex with respect to number of players and error, the $\\gamma$ preparation steps can be ignored in the complexity analysis.\n\nTable 4. Complexity Comparison\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nCorollary 1. Suppose $C_{V}(\\varepsilon /(4 \\Delta V))$ is greater or equal to $O\\left(\\log ^{2}(\\Delta V n / \\varepsilon)+n \\log (\\Delta V n / \\varepsilon)\\right), \\Delta V=V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$. The expected value of the Ut register of $\\left|\\phi^{S}\\right\\rangle$, multiplying by $V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }$, and subtracting by $V_{\\min }$ yields,\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{I}+\\rho, \\quad \\rho \\in[-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon], \\quad \\varepsilon>0\n$$\n\nGiven a fixed probability of success, the operation takes,\n\n$$\nO\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta V\\left(\\Phi_{I}-V_{\\min }\\right)}}{\\varepsilon} C_{V}\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{4 \\Delta V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\noperations. $C_{V}(x)$ is defined in Definition 12. This is compared with Monte Carlo methods in Table 4.\nExample 1. Let us give a more concrete example, suppose we have a game $G=(F, V)$, where $F$ is an $n+1$ player game and we have a value function $V: \\mathcal{P}(F) \\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$. Then $V_{\\min }, V_{\\max }$ are 0 and 1 respectively. Suppose that $U_{V}^{S}$ is, as a result, implemented with no error.

Suppose we wish to find the ith player's Shapley value $\\Phi_{I}$. We proceed assuming $\\Phi_{I}$ is on the interval $[-1 / 2,1 / 2]$.

The post-hoc method of additive explanations in model agnostic contexts is addressed in Riberio et al.'s seminal work [31]. Riberio et al. introduced the model agnostic Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to assess the importance of each feature for particular decisions. It leveraged the fact that many classifiers, represent differential functions, and are hence locally linear. In addition to Riberio et al.'s work, various additive explanation methods have been introduced, such as layer-wise relevance propagation [32]. Lundberg and Lee [6] found that many of the newly introduced additive explanation methods were equivalent to finding the Shapley values of the input variables. Specifically, each explanation which satisfies a small set of properties is equivalent to a Shapley value approximation. The work culminated in Lundberg and Lee's widely used SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm. More recently, the particular implementation Manuscript submitted to ACM TQC\n\nof SHAP has come under scrutiny. According to Marques-Silva and Huang [33], there are no rigorous error guarantees for the most popular approximations of SHAP. More concerning, Marques-Silva and Huang claim SHAP's definition is not formally justified and demonstrates specific circumstances where exact SHAP produces undesirable results. Their criticisms do not necessarily translate to Shapley values but illustrate the need for deep care and caution for robust explainability.\n\nIn tandem with additive explanations, there are multiple approaches which aim to make AI more trustworthy. In the domain of post-hoc explanations, there is also the option of counterfactual explanations [19]. A counterfactual expresses how an outcome would be different given different initial conditions. A counterfactual explanation describes what minimal changes could be made to get a more desirable outcome, for example, \"your bank loan would have been accepted if your income had been $10 \\%$ higher\". On the other hand, some authors argue that, in high-stakes situations, black box models should be abandoned altogether in favour of inherently interpretable models [4,34]. These models include purely linear models, decision trees and more. While some believe black-box models have a performance advantage in many domains, Rudin [4] claims that interpretable models have similar potential in many relevant circumstances. Rudin argues that interpretable models allow for better iterative improvements, as their flaws are understandable and therefore easier to address. Additionally, when the data is structured, and effectively preprocessed, Rudin asserts that simple classifiers perform similarly to complex classifiers. However, London [35] argues that in cases where black-box models have higher accuracy, they should not be automatically discarded.\n\nBeyond explainable AI, Shapley values have been widely used to address multiple engineering problems, including regression, statistical analysis, and Machine Learning (ML) [36]. Finding Shapley values presents a difficult computational combinatorial problem. The deterministic computation of Shapley values in weighted voting games is at least as difficult as NP-Hard [7, 8]. Since voting games are some of the simplest cooperative games, this result does not bode well for more complex scenarios. In the context of Shapley values for machine learning, it has also been shown that the calculation of Shapley values is not tractable for regression models [37]. Similarly, on the empirical distribution, finding a Shapley value takes exponential time [38]. While the general case direct Shapley value calculation is extremely computationally complex, this is not the case if we weaken our requirements. Calculating the Shapley for specific games allows for optimizations which leverage the structure of the problem. This has been done, for instance, in the context of games on graphs [39]. The other approach, which is relevant to our work, is based on probabilistic approximations. Specifically, Castro et al. [9] describes a method based on Monte Carlo methods to approximate Shapley values in polynomial time. By Chebyshev's inequality, Monte Carlo methods have a query complexity of $O\\left(\\sigma^{2} / \\epsilon^{2}\\right)$, which is tenable when compared to naive and exponentially complex methods [22].\n\nSimultaneously, there has been a strong research effort into quantum AI. Quantum principal component analysis is an early example of an efficient quantum algorithm in the domain of AI [40]. This work lead Rebentrost et al.'s [41] algorithm for quantum support vector machines, which Rebentrost et al. claim is exponentially faster than known classical methods in some cases. It has been shown that training quantum neural networks is possible and that they are universal function approximations [42]. In response to the progress in quantum AI, there has been steady growth in the topic of Quantum Explainable AI. Treating the quantum algorithm as a black box allows for the use of LIME [13, 43]. In a similar vein, SHAP and Shapley values have both been leveraged to explain the behaviour of quantum circuits [11, 44], though these works do not leverage quantum effects to accelerate the computation.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# 9 CONCLUSION \n\nWe have introduced a quantum algorithm which allows for a more efficient approximation of Shapley values. The algorithm is often quadratically faster than is possible with classical Monte Carlo methods, up to polylogarithmic factors. In other words, doubling work yields double the precision. In contrast to the quadrupling of work required classically. The algorithm has two potential applications. First, it can be applied directly to accelerate the calculation of Shapley values in cooperative games. Second, we can leverage the algorithm to construct additive explanations of quantum circuits.\n\nFor future work, examining practical examples of the quantum algorithm for Shapley values is a source of various interesting problems. This is especially true in cases where the value function can be more efficiently computed on a quantum computer. In a similar vein, specific games can be analyzed so that their structure might be leveraged for larger quantum advantages. For quantum explainability, there are several useful directions to explore. An additional area of inquiry is whether certain models, such as quantum support vector machines, can have their Shapley values computed more efficiently. Finally, our algorithm can be used to better understand proposed quantum AIs.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "## REFERENCES\n\n[1] B. Goodman and S. Flaxman.

Let\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nM_{i}=\\sup _{x \\in\\left[z_{i}, z_{i+1}\\right]} f(x), \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\nm_{i}=\\inf _{x \\in\\left[z_{i}, z_{i+1}\\right]} f(x), \\quad i=0, \\ldots, r-1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe upper Darboux sum and the lower Darboux sum are:\n\n$$\nU(f, P)=\\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} M_{i}\\left(z_{i+1}-z_{i}\\right), \\quad L(f, P)=\\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} m_{i}\\left(z_{i+1}-z_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nCorollary 2. Given a partition $P=\\left(z_{0}, \\ldots, z_{r}\\right)$ of an interval $[a, b]$ and an integrable function $f:[a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, any Riemann sum (Definition 7) is greater than or equal to the lower Darboux sum and less than or equal to than the upper Darboux sum,\n\n$$\nL(f, P) \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} f\\left(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{i+1}-z_{i}\\right) \\leq U(f, P)\n$$\n\nwhere $z_{i}^{\\prime} \\in\\left[z_{i}, z_{i+1}\\right]$.\nLemma 5. Given a partition $P=\\left(z_{0}, \\ldots, z_{r}\\right)$ of an interval $[a, b]$ and an integrable function $f:[a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, the integral of $f$ from a to $b$ is greater than the lower Darboux sum and smaller than the upper Darboux sum.\n\n$$\nL(f, P) \\leq \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x \\leq U(f, P)\n$$\n\nProof. By the Mean Value Theorem [23, page 233], there exists an $p_{i} \\in\\left[z_{i}, z_{i+1}\\right]$, such that,\n\n$$\nf\\left(p_{i}\\right)=\\frac{1}{z_{i+1}-z_{i}} \\int_{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}} f(t) d t\n$$\n\nHence, we can create the following Riemann sum (Definition 7),\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1}\\left(z_{i+1}-z_{i}\\right) f\\left(p_{i}\\right)=\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} \\int_{z_{i}}^{z_{i+1}} f(x) d x=\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x\n$$\n\nThus, by Corollary 2, the result holds.\nLemma 6. Let $P=\\left(z_{0}, \\ldots, z_{r}\\right)$ be a partition of an interval $[a, b]$ and suppose the function $f:[a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is integrable. Then, the error of a Riemann sum is bounded by the difference of the upper and lower Darboux sums, that is, the difference between the Riemann sum and the integral is bounded by,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x-\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} f\\left(z_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{k+1}-z_{k}\\right)\\right| \\leq U(f, P)-L(f, P)\n$$\n\nwhere $z_{k}^{\\prime} \\in\\left[z_{k}, z_{k+1}\\right]$.\nManuscript submitted to ACM TQC\n\nProof. We must show that the absolute difference between any given Riemann sum and the integral from $a$ to $b$ is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the upper and lower Darboux sums. Without loss of generality, suppose the integral is greater than the Riemann sum. By Lemma 5,\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x-\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} f\\left(z_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{k+1}-z_{k}\\right) \\leq U(f, P)-\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} f\\left(z_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{k+1}-z_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, by Corollary 2,\n\n$$\nU(f, P)-\\sum_{k=0}^{r-1} f\\left(z_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{k+1}-z_{k}\\right) \\leq U(f, P)-L(f, P)\n$$\n\nLemma 6 allows us to bound the error of any Riemann sum approximation for an integral, giving us a sequence of boxes that bound the error for their respective subinterval. A convenient result of our method is that given only a partition; we can guarantee error bounds given any selection of samples.\n\nCorollary 3. Recall the function $b_{n, m}(x)=x^{m}(1-x)^{n-m}$ (Definition 6) and partition $P_{f}=\\left(t_{f}(0), \\ldots, t_{f}\\left(2^{f}\\right)\\right)$ of $[0,1]$. Lemma 6 implies that the error of a Riemann sum using $b_{n, m}$ and $P_{f}$ is upper bounded by,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{2^{f}-1} w_{f}(k)\\left(M_{k}-m_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\n$w_{f}(k)$ is defined in Equation (19) and $m_{k}, M_{k}$ are defined in Definition 9.\nIt is important to find a simple upper bound for the function $w_{f}(k)$ and the difference $M_{k}-m_{k}$.\nLemma 7. $w_{f}(k)$ is upper bounded by a function that depends solely on $f$ :\n\n$$\nw_{f}(k) \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2^{f+1}}\n$$\n\nProof. Recall Equation (19), $w_{f}(k)=\\sin ^{2}(a+b)-\\sin ^{2}(a)$, where $a=\\pi k / 2^{f+1}, b=\\pi / 2^{f+1}$. Then, we have,\n\n$$\nw_{f}(k)=[\\sin (a+b)+\\sin (a)][\\sin (a+b)-\\sin (a)]\n$$\n\nProceeding with common trigonometric identities yields,\n\n$$\nw_{f}(k)=\\left[2 \\sin \\frac{b}{2} \\cos \\frac{b}{2}\\right]\\left[2 \\sin \\frac{2 a+b}{2} \\cos \\frac{2 a+b}{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhich is equal to,\n\n$$\n\\sin (b) \\sin (2 a+b)\n$$\n\nSince $0 \\leq \\sin (2 a+b) \\leq 1$, and $\\sin x \\leq x$ when $x$ is non-negative, the result holds.\n\nRemark 2. It is helpful to note that $b_{n, m}(x)=b_{n, n-m}(1-x)$.\nLemma 8. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and suppose $m \\in\\{1, \\cdots, n-1\\}$, then the derivative of $b_{n, m}(x)$ is,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, m}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}=\\frac{(m-n x) b_{n, m}(x)}{x(1-x)}\n$$\n\nProof. Recall the definition of $b_{n, m}(x)=x^{m}(1-x)^{n-m}$, then by the product rule,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, m}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}=m x^{m-1}(1-x)^{n-m}-(n-m) x^{m}(1-x)^{n-m-1}\n$$\n\nPulling out the common terms yields,\n\n$$\nx^{m-1}(1-x)^{n-m-1}(m(1-x)-(n-m) x)\n$$\n\nCollecting like terms and rearranging gives,\n\n$$\n\\frac{(m-n x)\\left(x^{m}(1-x)^{n-m}\\right)}{x(1-x)}\n$$\n\nLemma 9. For $m=0, n$, the derivatives of $b_{n, m}$ are,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, 0}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}=n(1-x)^{n-1} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, n}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}=n x^{n-1}\n$$\n\nrespectively.\nLemma 10. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $m \\in\\{0, \\cdots, n\\}$, then for all $x$ in $[0,1]$,\n\n$$\nb_{n, m}(x) \\leq b_{n, m}(m / n)\n$$\n\nProof. Suppose $m=n$, then $b_{n, m}(x)=x^{n}$. Clearly, $x^{n}$ is increasing on the interval $[0,1]$, thus $b_{n, m}$ is maximized at $x=1=m / n$. By Remark 2, if $m=0$, the max of $b_{n, m}$ is also 1 and this occurs at $x=0=m / n$.\n\nFinally, if $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$, then $b_{n, m}(0)=b_{n, m}(1)=0$. Note that $b_{n, m}(x)$ is strictly positive for $x \\in(0,1)$, and there is only one critical point on that interval. Thus, the maximum must be the critical point $x$ between $(0,1)$. By Lemma 8 , this critical point satisfies $m-n x=0$. Therefore, $b_{n, m}(x)$ is maximized when $x=m / n$.\n\nCorollary 4. If $x<m / n$, then $b_{n, m}(x)$ is increasing at $x$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, m}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}>0\n$$\n\nand if $x>m / n$, then $b_{n, m}(x)$ is decreasing at $x$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} b_{n, m}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}<0\n$$\n\nDefinition 10 (Notation).

Note, for the sake of space, we omit the cases where $m=0$ and $m=1$, though they do follow the same bound. Suppose $m \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. By Corollary 3, we have,\n\n$$\n\\left|u_{\\ell}(n, m)\\right| \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{d}-1} w_{\\ell}(k)\\left(M_{k}-m_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nApplying Lemma 7 shows this is less than or equal to,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{2^{d+1}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{d}-1} M_{k}-m_{k}\n$$\n\nDefine $j_{k}, j_{k}$ to be in interval $\\left[t_{\\ell}(k), t_{\\ell}(k+1)\\right]$ such that $m_{k}=b_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right), M_{k}=b_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right)$.

Thus, the leftmost part of the subinterval $\\left[t_{\\ell}(k), t_{\\ell}(k+1)\\right]$ is the minimum with respect to $b_{n, m}(x)$ and the rightmost part is the maximum, so,\n\n$$\nb_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right)-b_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right)=b_{n, m}\\left(t_{\\ell}(k+1)\\right)-b_{n, m}\\left(t_{\\ell}(k)\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for $k$ such that $t_{\\ell}(k) \\geq m / n$, by Corollary $4, x \\in\\left(t_{\\ell}(k), t_{\\ell}(k+1)\\right)$ implies $\\frac{d}{d x} b_{n, m}(x)$ is strictly negative, so,\n\n$$\nb_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right)-b_{n, m}\\left(j_{k}\\right)=-\\left[b_{n, m}\\left(t_{\\ell}(k+1)\\right)-b_{n, m}\\left(t_{\\ell}(k)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nIf for some $k, t_{\\ell}(k)$ is equal to $m / n$, then we have described each interval. Supposing that for all $k, t_{\\ell}(k) \\neq m / n$, there exists one other subinterval $\\left[t_{\\ell}(s), t_{\\ell}(s+1)\\right]$ that is non-monotonic. Its absolute error is bounded by,\n\n$$\nb_{n, m}\\left(j_{s}\\right)-b_{n, m}\\left(j_{s}\\right)=\\max _{r \\in\\{0,1\\}} b_{n, m}(m / n)-b_{n, m}\\left(t_{\\ell}(s+r)\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, we have the following upper bound for the absolute error,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{2^{d+1}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{s-1}\\left(M_{k}-m_{k}\\right)+\\left(M_{s}-m_{s}\\right)+\\sum_{k=s+1}^{2^{d}-1}\\left(M_{k}-m_{k}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we take $s=0$ when there is no non-monotonic sub-interval.

The bound for odd $n$ is similar to finding a bound for an even $n$. We proceed assuming $n$ is equal to $2 k+1$ where $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.

By an almost identical calculation to that in Theorem 7, we find that,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\sum_{h \\in H_{m}} u_{\\ell}(n, m) \\delta_{h}\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\delta_{\\max } \\sqrt{n}}{2^{\\ell-3}}\n$$\n\nThus, the combined error introduced from Steps 1 and 2 is bounded by:\n\n$$\n\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2^{\\ell-3}} \\delta_{\\max }+\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2^{\\ell-3}}+\\delta_{\\max }\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that, no matter how large we make $\\ell$, the error persists if we are unable to also minimize $\\delta_{\\max }$.\nD. 3 Error - Step 3. For this step, we use a quantum subroutine for speeding up Monte Carlo Methods [22]. With a probability greater than $8 / \\pi^{2}$, the procedure succeeds. The process can be repeated $\\mathcal{O}(\\log (1 / p))$ times to improve the success probability to $1-p$. Suppose we perform $t$ iterations of amplitude estimation. If we are trying to extract value $\\mu$, and the result is $\\hat{\\mu}$, the error is bounded,\n\n$$\n|\\hat{\\mu}-\\mu| \\leq 2 \\pi \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu(1-\\mu)}}{t}+\\frac{\\pi^{2}}{t^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn our case, $\\mu=\\left(\\Phi_{i}-V_{\\min }\\right) /\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) \\in[0,1]$, so we can take the following more simple upper bound,\n\n$$\n|\\hat{\\mu}-\\mu| \\leq 2 \\pi \\frac{t \\sqrt{\\mu}+\\pi}{t^{2}}\n$$\n\nSince we are extracting the value $\\mu=\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\left(\\left.\\psi_{2}\\right|\\left(I^{\\otimes \\ell+n} \\otimes|1\\rangle\\langle 1|\\right)\\left|\\psi_{2}\\right\\rangle\\right.$, our final error is,\n\n$$\n\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2^{\\ell-3}} \\delta_{\\max }+\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{2^{\\ell-3}}+\\delta_{\\max }+2 \\pi \\frac{t \\sqrt{\\mu}+\\pi}{t^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nD. 4 Complexity. Suppose we want a total error of $\\epsilon$. This section finds an upper bound of complexity given a desired error. Let $\\sqrt{n} / 2^{\\ell-3}, \\delta_{\\max }, 2 \\pi(t \\sqrt{\\mu}+\\pi) / t^{2} \\leq \\epsilon^{\\prime}$ be less than or equal to 1 , then the error is bounded by,\n\n$$\n\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\left(\\left(\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+3 \\epsilon^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq 4\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right) \\epsilon^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nHence, an upper bound of error $\\epsilon$ can be achieved if, $\\epsilon^{\\prime} \\leq \\epsilon /\\left(4\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\right)$.\nFor notational simplicity, we define,\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }}{\\epsilon}\n$$\n\nto get $\\sqrt{n} / 2^{\\ell-3}$ less than $\\epsilon^{\\prime}$, a partition register of size,\n\n$$\n\\ell=\\left\\lceil\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right\\rceil+5\n$$\n\nis sufficient.\nRecall $C_{D}(\\ell)$ to be the complexity of implementing $D_{\\ell}$ (cf. Definition 8) with an error with respect to $w_{\\ell}(k)$ of less than $4^{-\\ell}, \\delta_{\\max }$ on the other hand depends on the complexity of computing $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$with max error $\\epsilon^{\\prime}$, which we write $C_{V}\\left(\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nDefinition 12. We denote the complexity to implement $U_{V}^{ \\pm}$, such that the maximum error $\\delta_{\\max }$ (Equations (35) and (36)) is upper bounded by $\\epsilon^{\\prime}$, as $C_{V}\\left(\\epsilon^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nAdditionally, to sufficiently bound the error introduced by Step 3, we must satisfy $2 \\pi(t \\sqrt{\\mu}+\\pi) / t^{2} \\leq \\epsilon /\\left(4\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)\\right)$. Suppose that we wish our absolute error $\\epsilon$ to be less than the difference $\\Phi_{i}-V_{\\min }$. Using the quadratic formula, we see\n\nit is sufficient to take $t$ equal to,\n\n$$\nt=\\left|\\frac{28 \\sqrt{\\left(\\Phi_{t}-V_{\\min }\\right)\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)}}{\\epsilon}\\right|\n$$\n\nFinally, with the upper bounds for these important factors in mind, let us consider the complexity in terms of CNOT gates given these upper bounds. Generating $\\left|\\psi_{1 a}\\right\\rangle$ is complexity $C_{D}(\\ell)$. Next, evolving to $\\left|\\psi_{1 b}\\right\\rangle$ takes $n \\ell$ controlled rotations, which can be implemented with $2 n \\ell$ CNOTs in $2 \\cdot \\max (n, \\ell)$ layers. From here, producing state $\\left|\\psi_{2}\\right\\rangle$ has complexity $C_{V}\\left(4^{-1} \\lambda^{-1}\\right)$. Next, Step 3 involves amplitude estimation, meaning the above steps are repeated $t$ times, followed by an Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform on $\\log _{2}(t)$ bits taking $O\\left(\\log _{2}^{2} t\\right)$ operation. Hence, the total complexity is bounded by,\n\n$$\nt \\cdot\\left(C_{D}(\\ell)+2 n \\ell+C_{V}\\left(\\frac{1}{4 \\lambda}\\right)\\right)+O\\left(\\log ^{2} t\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is defined in Equation (38), and conservative values for $\\ell$ and $t$ are given in Equations (39) and 40 respectively.\nTheorem 8. Suppose there exists a constant real positive number $b$ such that $C_{V}(a \\epsilon)>(b / a) C_{V}(\\epsilon)$ for all real positive a. The total complexity of the algorithm is,\n\n$$\nO\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(\\Phi_{t}-V_{\\min }\\right)\\left(V_{\\max }-V_{\\min }\\right)}}{\\epsilon}\\left(C_{D}\\left(\\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})\\right)+n \\log _{2}(\\lambda \\sqrt{n})+C_{V}\\left(\\frac{1}{4 \\lambda}\\right)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nProof.
