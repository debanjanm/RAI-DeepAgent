InTRODUCTION\n\nA spacelike timeslice has the structure of a complete Riemannian three-manifold with an asymptotically flat end in the description of isolated gravitating systems in general relativity. Thus, in this paper, we are concerned with the so-called asymptotically Schwarzschild space. Precisely, a complete Riemannian manifold $(N, \\bar{g})$ is said to be an asymptotically Schwarzschild space, if $(N, \\bar{g})$ is a 3-manifold where $N$ is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\backslash B_{1}(0)$ and the metric $\\bar{g}$ is asymptotically flat, namely,\n\n$$\n\\bar{g}_{\\alpha \\beta}=\\left(1+\\frac{m}{2 r}\\right)^{4} \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}+P_{\\alpha \\beta}\n$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the Euclidean distance, $m>0$ is a constant representing the ADM mass and $P_{\\alpha \\beta}$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left|\\partial^{l} P_{\\alpha \\beta}\\right| \\leq C_{l+1} r^{-l-2}, \\quad 0 \\leq l \\leq 5\n$$\n\nwith $\\partial$ denoting partial derivatives with respect to the Euclidean metric $\\delta$.

It defines a natural coordinate system near infinity which is extensively used in spacetime, see [CK93].\n\nIn their seminal paper, Huisken-Yau ([HY96]) constructed a foliation of stable constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces in an asymptotically Schwarzschild space with $m>0$. These surfaces arise from the volume preserving mean curvature flow introduced by Huisken ([Hui87]). They also proved that the foliation is unique outside a large compact set depending on the mean curvature and defined the geometric center of mass based on their foliation. The uniqueness was further extended by Qing-Tian ([QT07]) saying that the foliation is actually unique outside of a fixed compact set, which we refer to as the global uniqueness. Corvino-Wu proved that the geometric center of mass of the foliation is the ADM center of mass if the metric is conformally flat at infinity in [CW08]. The conformal flatness condition later is removed by Huang in [Hua09].\n\nYe provided a different proof of the existence of CMC surfaces in [Ye96]. Metzger [Met07] later generalized Huisken-Yau's result to asymptotically flat manifolds with a slightly weaker asymptotic condition, namely, the metric $\\bar{g}$ in (1) satisfies $\\left|\\partial^{l} P_{\\alpha \\beta}\\right| \\leq C_{l+1} r^{-l-1-\\epsilon}, \\quad 0 \\leq l \\leq 2$ for $\\epsilon \\geq 0$. However, the metric there should be assumed to be rotationally symmetric while the ADM center of mass can be defined for asymptotically flat manifolds satisfying the Regge-Teitelboim (RT) condition, which is interpreted as an asymptotically symmetric condition. Huang relaxed the symmetric assumption and proved that the CMC foliation exists in the exterior region of an asymptotically flat manifold satisfying the RT condition in [Hua10]. Nerz extended the existence and uniqueness of CMC foliation in 3-dimensional asymptotically flat manifolds without asymptotic symmetry in [Ner15]. Furthermore, the corresponding result was established by EichmairMerzger for dimension greater than three in [EM13]. Finally, we also notice that the global uniqueness of the CMC foliation is characterized by Chodosh-Eichmair in [CE22].\n\nThe CMC foliation is not the only foliation utilized in mathematical general relativity. For instance, Lamm-Metzger-Schulze establish the existence of a foliation of the asymptotically Schwarzschild space with positive mass by surfaces which are critical points of the Willmore functional subject to an area constraint in [LMS11]. The geometric center of mass of the foliation by the area constrained Willmore surfaces is also shown to agree with the ADM center of mass if the scalar curvature is asymptotically vanishing [EK22].\n\nIn this paper, we will establish a novel foliation by surfaces of constant harmonic mean curvature in an asymptotically Schwarzschild space with $m>0$. These surfaces arise from the harmonic mean curvature flow (HMCF), which has been investigated in the Euclidean space [DH06][DS10]. For non-Euclidean space, Xu explored the unnormalized harmonic mean curvature flow in his thesis ([Xu10]). More general mixed volume preserving curvature flows are investigated in Euclidean space in [McC05] and in hyperbolic space in [WX14].\n\nDifferent from their attempt, we will examine the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow in asymptotically Schwarzschild spaces as a generalization of\n\nHuisken-Yau's result [HY96]. To be precise, we first introduce some fundamental notion. Let $S_{\\sigma}(0)$ be the coordinate sphere of radius $\\sigma$ centered at the origin in $(N, \\bar{g})$ given by a map\n\n$$\n\\phi_{0}^{\\sigma}: S^{2} \\rightarrow N, \\quad \\phi_{0}^{\\sigma}\\left(S^{2}\\right)=S_{\\sigma}(0)\n$$\n\nWe aim to find a one-parameter family of maps $\\phi_{t}^{\\sigma}=\\phi^{\\sigma}(\\cdot, t)$ solving the initial value problem\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\frac{d}{d t} \\phi^{\\sigma}(p, t) & =(f-F) \\nu(p, t), \\quad t \\geq 0, p \\in S^{2} \\\\ \\phi^{\\sigma}(0) & =\\phi_{0}^{\\sigma}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $F(p, t)=\\frac{H^{2}-|A|^{2}}{2 R}$ and $\\nu(p, t)$ represent the harmonic mean curvature and the outward unit normal vector of the surface $\\Sigma_{t}=\\phi_{t}^{\\sigma}\\left(S^{2}\\right)$ respectively. Here we denote $\\left|\\Sigma_{t}\\right|$ and $f(t)=\\frac{\\int_{\\Sigma_{t}} F d \\mu_{t}}{\\left|\\Sigma_{t}\\right|}$ the area and the average of the harmonic mean curvature.\n\nThe flow described by equation (2) preserves the volume of the region enclosed by $\\Sigma_{t}$ and $S_{\\frac{\\omega}{2}}(0)$. And we designate this flow (2) as the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow. It should be noted that, owing to the additional curvature terms, there is no monotonic quantity associated with this flow.\n\nThe first result of this paper establishes the long time existence and exponential convergence of the flow (2), which converges to a constant harmonic mean curvature surface.\n\nTheorem 1.1. If $(N, \\bar{g})$ is the asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold with metric (1), then there is $\\sigma_{0}$ depending only on $C_{0}$ such that for all $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow (2) has a smooth solution for all times $t \\geq 0$. As $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, the surfaces $\\Sigma_{t}$ converge exponentially fast to a surface $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ of constant harmonic mean curvature $f_{\\sigma}$.\n\nOnce establishing the existence of the constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces, we can further prove that they form a foliation of the asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold outside a large ball. For $\\sigma \\geq 1$ and $B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$ nonnegative numbers, we now define a set $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$ of nearly round surfaces in $(N, \\bar{g})$ by setting\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}:=\\left\\{M \\subset N\\left|\\sigma-B_{1} \\leq r \\leq \\sigma+B_{1},|\\hat{A}| \\leq B_{2} \\sigma^{-3},|\\nabla \\hat{A}| \\leq B_{3} \\sigma^{-4}\\right\\}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{A}$ is the traceless part of the second fundamental form.\nTheorem 1.2. There is $\\sigma_{0}$ depending only on $C_{0}$ and $c=c(n)$ such that for all $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, the constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ constructed in Theorem 1.1 form a proper foliation of $N \\backslash B_{\\sigma_{0}}(0)$.\n\nAs a consequence, we are able to define the center of mass $C_{H M}$.\n\nDefinition 1.3. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the family of surfaces constructed in Theorem 1.2 and $\\phi^{\\sigma}$ be the position vector. The center of gravity of $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ is defined by\n\n$$\nC_{H M}=\\lim _{\\sigma \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\int_{\\Sigma_{\\sigma}} \\phi^{\\sigma} d \\mu_{e}}{\\int_{\\Sigma_{\\sigma}} d \\mu_{e}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{e}$ is the volume element with respect to the Euclidean metric.\nOur last result in this paper shows that our definition of the center of mass agrees with the center of mass defined by the ADM formulation of the initial value problem for the Einstein equation, namely, the ADM center of mass.\n\nTheorem 1.4. If $(N, \\bar{g})$ is the asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold with metric (1), then $C_{H M}$ is exactly the $A D M$ center of mass.\n\nThe strategies of the proof for the main theorems follow the approach of Huisken-Yau ([HY96]) regarding the volume preserving mean curvature flow. More specifically, we initiate the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow (2) from a large coordinate sphere and provide the necessary a priori estimates of the second fundamental form together with the derivatives on the circular domain $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$. However, there are several crucial innovations in our paper:\n\nFirstly, in contrast to the volume preserving mean curvature flow, which is a quasilinear parabolic system, the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow is a fully nonlinear system. Consequently, this complicates the computations substantially. Secondly, the principal part of the linearized operator of the harmonic mean curvature $\\mathcal{L}$ is not in divergence form. Nevertheless, it is not avoidable to give a priori estimate for the non-divergence elliptic operator $\\mathcal{L}$ when proving the exponential convergence and the formation of foliation. In this context, we treat $\\mathcal{L}$ as a perturbation of the Laplacian operator and furnish the estimate for the error term. Thirdly, in order to prove that $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ forms a foliation, we need to derive that the lapse function has a sign. Since the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is not self-adjoint, many useful tools in functional analysis and PDE cannot be applied. In order to obtain the desired estimate, we consider the sum of $\\mathcal{L}$ and its adjoint operator $\\mathcal{L}^{*}$, and establish the eigenvalue estimates for such a self-adjoint operator. Then we apply the elliptic estimate for such an operator to obtain the desired information.\n\nEstablishing the global uniqueness of the constant harmonic mean curvature foliation, as presented in Section 5 of [HY96] or [QT07], poses significant challenges. We will demonstrate uniqueness in our forthcoming paper, focusing on asymptotically flat manifolds with mild decay metrics or those satisfying the RT condition, as discussed in [Hua10]. Furthermore, we believe the harmonic mean curvature foliation is also applicable to asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as outlined in [NT09][NT10].\n\nThe subsequent sections are organized as follows: Section 2 provides some preliminary materials and evolution equations of geometric quantities for the volume preserving harmonic mean curvature flow; in Section 3, we give the proof of the long time existence and exponential convergence of the flow; the construction of the foliation and definition of the center of mass is treated in Section 4.\n\nAcknowledgement.

Preliminaries \n\nIn this section, we present some fundamental concepts and also establish some useful lemmas. Let $\\Sigma_{t}$ be a family of hypersurfaces in $(N, \\bar{g})$ solving (2). Let $\\nu$ be the outward unit normal to $\\Sigma_{t}$ and $g$ be the induced metric on $\\Sigma_{t}$. Denote the covariant derivative on $\\Sigma_{t}$ and $N$ by $\\nabla$ and $\\bar{\\nabla}$, respectively. Then for a fixed time $t$, we choose an orthonormal frame $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\nu$ adapted to $\\Sigma_{t}$ such that the second fundamental form $A=\\left\\{h_{i j}\\right\\}$ is given by\n\n$$\nh_{i j}=\\left\\langle\\bar{\\nabla}_{e_{i}} \\nu, e_{j}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nLet $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}$ be the two principal curvatures on $\\Sigma_{t}$ and write\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nH=g^{i j} h_{i j}=\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2} \\\\\n|A|^{2}=h^{i j} h_{i j}=\\lambda_{1}^{2}+\\lambda_{2}^{2} \\\\\nF=\\frac{H^{2}-|A|^{2}}{2 H}=\\frac{\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}{\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nfor the mean curvature, the square norm of the second fundamental form, and the harmonic mean curvature on $\\Sigma_{t}$ respectively. Furthermore, let $\\hat{A}$ be the traceless second fundamental form such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\hat{h}_{i j}=h_{i j}-\\frac{1}{2} H g_{i j} \\\\\n|\\hat{A}|^{2}=|A|^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} H^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe curvature of $N$ together with the derivatives and the second fundamental form of $\\Sigma_{t}$ are related by the equations of Gauss and Codazzi:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{i j k l} & =\\bar{R}_{i j k l}+h_{i l} h_{j k}-h_{i k} h_{j l} \\\\\n-\\bar{R}_{3 i j k} & =\\nabla_{k} h_{i j}-\\nabla_{j} h_{i k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the index 3 indicates the $\\nu$ direction.

If $w_{i}=\\bar{R}_{3 l i l}$ denotes the projection of $\\bar{R} i c(\\nu, \\cdot)$ onto $\\Sigma_{t}$, we have for any $\\eta>0$ the inequality\n\n$$\n|\\nabla A|^{2} \\geq\\left(\\frac{3}{4}-\\eta\\right)|\\nabla H|^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\eta^{-1}-1\\right)|w|^{2}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, we have the higher order version, for $k=1,2,3, \\cdots$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\nabla^{k} A\\right|^{2} \\geq\\left(\\frac{3}{4}-\\eta\\right)\\left|\\nabla^{k} H\\right|^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\eta^{-1}-1\\right)\\left|\\nabla^{k-1} w\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nProof. The first result comes from [Hui86]. To show the second statement, we first consider $k=2$ and then utilize induction argument. Similar to [Hui86], we define\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE_{i j k l}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(H_{i l} g_{j k}+H_{j l} g_{i k}+H_{k l} g_{i j}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(w_{k l} g_{i j}-w_{i l} g_{j k}-w_{j l} g_{i k}\\right) \\\\\nF_{i j k l}=h_{i j, k l}-E_{i j k l}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWe find that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n|E|^{2}=\\frac{3}{4} H_{k l}^{2}-w_{k l} H_{k l}+w_{k l}^{2} \\\\\n\\left\\langle E_{i j k l}, h_{i j, k l}\\right\\rangle=|E|^{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThus, we conclude that $\\left\\langle E_{i j k l}, F_{i j k l}\\right\\rangle=0$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\nabla^{2} A\\right|^{2} & =\\left|\\nabla^{2} \\bar{A}\\right|^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\nabla^{2} H\\right|^{2} \\\\\n& =|E|^{2}+|F|^{2} \\geq|E|^{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{3}{4} H_{k l}^{2}-w_{k l} H_{k l}+w_{k l}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich implies that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\nabla^{2} A\\right|^{2} \\geq\\left(\\frac{3}{4}-\\eta\\right)\\left|\\nabla^{2} H\\right|^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\eta^{-1}-1\\right)|\\nabla \\omega|^{2}\n$$\n\nNext we state the Simons' identity of the harmonic mean curvature $F$ computed similarly as in [SSY75] and [BHMS99], and an important consequence of the Codazzi equations [Hui87] by considering $F$ as a function of $h_{j}^{i}=g^{i k} h_{j k}$.\n\nLemma 2.2.

LONG TIME EXISTENCE AND EXPONENTIAL CONVERGENCE \n\nIn this section, we show the long time existence and expoential convergence of the flow (2). We begin by recalling the following description of round surfaces in $N$ presented in [HY96].\n\nProposition 3.1. (Proposition 2.1 of [HY96]) Suppose $M$ is a hypersurface in $(N, \\bar{g})$ such that $r(y) \\geq \\frac{1}{16} \\max _{M} r=: r_{1}$ for all $y \\in M$ and such that for some\n\nconstants $K_{1}, K_{2}$,\n\n$$\n|\\hat{A}| \\leq K_{1} r_{1}^{-3}, \\quad|\\nabla \\hat{A}| \\leq K_{2} r_{1}^{-4}\n$$\n\nThen there is an absolute constant $c$ such that the curvature $A^{e}$ of $M$ with respect to the Euclidean metric satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left|\\hat{A}^{e}\\right| \\leq c\\left(K_{1}+C_{0}\\right) r_{1}^{-3}, \\quad\\left|\\nabla^{e} A^{e}\\right| \\leq c\\left(K_{2}+C_{0}\\right) r_{1}^{-4}\n$$\n\nprovided $r_{1} \\geq c\\left(C_{0}+K_{1}\\right)$. Moreover, there is a number $r_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and a vector $\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|\\lambda_{i}^{e}-r_{0}^{-1}\\right| \\leq c\\left(K_{1}+K_{2}+C_{0}\\right) r_{1}^{-3}, \\quad i=1,2 \\\\\n\\left|(y-\\vec{a})-r_{0} \\nu_{e}\\right| \\leq c\\left(K_{1}+K_{2}+C_{0}\\right) r_{1}^{-1} \\\\\n\\left|\\nu_{e}-r_{0}^{-1}(y-\\vec{a})\\right| \\leq c\\left(K_{1}+K_{2}+C_{0}\\right) r_{1}^{-2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHere $y$ and $\\nu_{e}$ are the position vector and the unit normal of $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, respectively.\nFor $\\sigma \\geq 1$ and $B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$ nonnegative numbers, we define a set $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$ of round surfaces in $(N, \\bar{g})$ by setting\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}:=\\left\\{M \\subset N \\mid \\sigma-B_{1} \\leq r \\leq \\sigma+B_{1},|\\hat{A}| \\leq B_{2} \\sigma^{-3},|\\nabla \\hat{A}| \\leq B_{3} \\sigma^{-4}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe following proposition provides the precise information regarding the mean curvature of surfaces in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$.\n\nProposition 3.2. (Proposition 2.2 of [HY96]) Let $M$ be a surface in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$. Suppose $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(B_{1}+B_{2}+C_{0}\\right)$ is such that all assumptions of Proposition 3.1 are satisfied and let $r_{0}$ and $\\vec{a}$ be as in that proposition. Then there is an absolute constant $c$ such that the principal curvatures and mean curvature of $M$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|\\lambda_{i}-\\frac{1}{r_{0}}+\\frac{2 m}{r_{0}^{2}}-\\frac{3 m\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e}}{r_{0}^{3}}\\right| \\leq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-3}, \\quad i=1,2 \\\\\n\\left|H-\\frac{2}{r_{0}}+\\frac{4 m}{r_{0}^{2}}-\\frac{6 m\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e}}{r_{0}^{3}}\\right| \\leq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-3}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nprovided $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}+C_{0}\\right)$.\nFor the proof of long time existence, we will first demonstrate $\\Sigma_{t}$ remains round during the flow (2).\n\nTheorem 3.3. There are constants $\\sigma_{0}, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$ depending only on $C_{0}$ such that for all $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, the solution $\\Sigma_{t}$ of (2) remains in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$ as long as it exists.\n\nWe will always assume that $\\sigma, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$ are chosen such that $\\Sigma_{0}=S_{\\sigma}(0)$ is strictly inside $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$. In the next two propositions we control the position of $\\Sigma_{t}$ during the evolution. Since the flow (2) preserves the volume of the region enclosed by $\\Sigma_{t}$ and a fixed surface $S_{1}(0)$, the proof of Proposition 3.4 follows similarly as in [HY96].\n\nProposition 3.4. (Proposition 3.4 in [HY96]) Suppose that $\\Sigma_{t}$ is a smooth solution of the flow (2) contained in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$. Assume that $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}+B_{1}+B_{2}\\right)$ is such that Proposition 3.1 applies and $r_{0}(t)$ is defined as in that result. Then there is an absolute constant $c$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|r_{0}(t)-\\sigma\\right| \\leq c\\left(C_{0}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nholds uniformly in $[0, T]$, provided that $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}+B_{1}+B_{2}\\right)$.\nProposition 3.5. Suppose that the solution $\\Sigma_{t}$ of (2) is contained in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$. Then there is an absolute constant $c$ such that\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\Sigma_{t}} r \\leq \\sigma+c\\left(m^{-1}+1\\right)\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nholds uniformly in $[0, T]$, provided that $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)$.\nProof. Let $D>0$ and assume $\\max _{\\Sigma_{t}} r<\\sigma+D$ is violated for the first time at $\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right), t_{0}>0$. At that point $r\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right)=\\max _{\\Sigma_{t}} r=\\sigma+D,\\left\\langle y_{0}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e}=r$ and $(f-F)\\left\\langle\\nu, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e} \\geq 0$. From Proposition 3.1, it follows that $\\left\\langle\\nu, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}|\\vec{a}|$ at $\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right)$ provided $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)$. So we have $F \\leq f$ at $\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right)$, but we get from Proposition 3.2 that\n$F=\\frac{H^{2}-|A|^{2}}{2 H}=\\frac{H}{4}-\\frac{|\\dot{A}|^{2}}{2 H}=\\frac{1}{2 r_{0}}-\\frac{m}{r_{0}^{2}}+\\frac{3 m\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e}}{2 r_{0}^{3}}+O\\left(\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-3}\\right)$,\nThus, we get at $\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF-f & =\\frac{3 m\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e}}{2 r_{0}^{3}}-\\frac{3 m}{2 r_{0}^{3}} \\oint_{\\Sigma_{t}}\\left\\langle\\vec{a}, \\nu_{e}\\right\\rangle_{e} d \\mu_{t}+O\\left(\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-3}\\right) \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{3 m|\\vec{a}|}{4 r_{0}^{3}}-c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-3} \\\\\n& \\geq\\left(\\frac{m|\\vec{a}|}{2}-c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)\\right) \\sigma^{-3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nprovided that $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)$. At $\\left(y_{0}, t_{0}\\right)$, in view of Proposition 3.4, we have\n\n$$\n|\\vec{a}| \\geq D-c\\left(C_{0}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining with (3), we finally get\n\n$$\n0 \\geq F-f \\geq\\left(\\frac{m}{2} D-\\left(\\frac{m}{2}+1\\right) c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)\\right) \\sigma^{-3}\n$$\n\nwhich yields a contradiction if $D>c\\left(m^{-1}+1\\right)\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)$.\nLemma 3.6. Let $\\Sigma_{t}$ be a smooth solution of (2) contained in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$, for $t \\in[0, T]$. Then there is an absolute constant $c$ such that for $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}+B_{2}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\left|\\lambda_{i}-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\right|+|F-f| \\leq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right) \\sigma^{-2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{2 f}{H^{3}}\\left(|A|^{4}-H \\operatorname{tr}\\left(A^{3}\\right)\\right) \\leq-\\frac{1}{8}|\\hat{A}|^{2} \\\\\n\\frac{f}{H^{2}}\\left|\\check{h}_{i j} \\check{R}_{i 3 j 3}\\right| \\leq c C_{0}|\\hat{A}| \\sigma^{-3} \\\\\n\\left|F^{k l}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right)\\left(h_{j m} \\check{R}_{m k i l}-h_{l m} \\check{R}_{i m j k}\\right)\\right| \\leq c C_{0}|\\hat{A}|^{2} \\sigma^{-3} \\\\\n\\left|F^{k l}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right)\\left(\\bar{\\nabla}_{l} \\check{R}_{3 j k i}+\\bar{\\nabla}_{i} \\check{R}_{3 k l j}\\right)\\right| \\leq c C_{0}|\\hat{A}| \\sigma^{-5} \\\\\n\\left|F^{k l, p q}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right) \\nabla_{i} h_{k l} \\nabla_{j} h_{p q}\\right| \\leq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}+B_{3}^{2}\\right)|\\hat{A}| \\sigma^{-7}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nProof. The first inequality is from Proposition 3.2, 3.4. To see the second inequality, observe that\n\n$$\n|A|^{4}-H \\operatorname{tr}\\left(A^{3}\\right)=-\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)^{2}=-2 \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}|\\hat{A}|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhich implies that\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 f}{H^{3}}\\left(|A|^{4}-H \\operatorname{tr}\\left(A^{3}\\right)\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{8}+c \\sigma\\right)\\left(-2 \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}|\\hat{A}|^{2}\\right) \\leq-\\frac{1}{8}|\\hat{A}|^{2}\n$$\n\nNow recall that the Riemann curvature tensor on a three-dimensional manifold can be expressed by the Ricci curvature:\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta}=\\left(\\bar{R}_{\\alpha \\delta} \\bar{g}_{\\beta \\gamma}-\\bar{R}_{\\alpha \\gamma} \\bar{g}_{\\beta \\delta}-\\bar{R}_{\\beta \\delta} \\bar{g}_{\\alpha \\gamma}+\\bar{R}_{\\beta \\gamma} \\bar{g}_{\\alpha \\delta}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\bar{R}\\left(\\bar{g}_{\\alpha \\gamma} \\bar{g}_{\\beta \\delta}-\\bar{g}_{\\alpha \\delta} \\bar{g}_{\\beta \\gamma}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\check{h}_{i j} \\check{R}_{i 3 j 3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)\\left(\\bar{R}_{11}-\\bar{R}_{22}\\right)\n$$\n\nBut from Proposition 3.1, we get $\\left|\\bar{R}_{11}-\\bar{R}_{22}\\right| \\leq c C_{0} \\sigma^{-4}$ for $\\sigma \\geq c\\left(C_{0}+B_{1}+B_{2}+B_{3}\\right)$ as desired. The fourth estimate follows from the following\n\n$$\nF^{k l}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right)\\left(h_{j m} \\check{R}_{m k i l}-h_{l m} \\check{R}_{i m j k}\\right)=\\frac{\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)^{2} \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}{H^{2}} \\bar{R}_{1212}\n$$\n\nFinally using (4) again, we obtain\n\n$$\nF^{k l}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right)\\left(\\bar{\\nabla}_{l} \\check{R}_{3 j k i}+\\bar{\\nabla}_{i} \\check{R}_{3 k l j}\\right)=\\frac{\\left(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1}\\right) \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}{H^{2}}\\left(\\bar{\\nabla}_{2} \\check{R}_{32}-\\bar{\\nabla}_{1} \\check{R}_{31}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo see the last inequality, we calculate as follows,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F^{k l, p q}\\left(h_{i j}-\\frac{|A|^{2}}{H} g_{i j}\\right) \\nabla_{i} h_{k l} \\nabla_{j} h_{p q} \\\\\n= & \\frac{\\lambda_{2}\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right)}{H} F^{k l, p q} \\nabla_{1} h_{k l} \\nabla_{1} h_{p q}+\\frac{\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1}\\right)}{H} F^{k l, p q} \\nabla_{2} h_{k l} \\nabla_{2} h_{p q}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\left|F^{k l, p q}\\right| \\leq c C_{0} \\sigma$ and from Lemma 2.1,\n\n$$\n|\\nabla A|^{2} \\leq 5|\\nabla \\hat{A}|^{2}+4|\\omega|^{2} \\leq c\\left(C_{0}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}+B_{3}^{2}\\right) \\sigma^{-8}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the last inequality.\nWe are now ready to prove an a priori estimate for the difference between the principal curvatures.\n\nProposition 3.7.

Exponential convergence follows by standard interpolation inequalities, completing the proof of Theorem 1.1.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4. The Foliation \n\nIn this section, we prove the existence of the foliation by constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces. We begin by providing a sufficient condition that guarantees a family of surfaces form a foliation.\n\nLemma 4.1. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}=\\phi^{\\sigma}\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{2}\\right) \\hookrightarrow N$ be a family of surfaces parametrized by $\\sigma \\in\\left[\\sigma_{0}, \\infty\\right)$. Define the lapse function by $u=\\left\\langle\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\sigma} \\phi^{\\sigma}, \\nu\\right\\rangle$, where $\\nu$ is the unit outer normal to $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$. If furthermore $u>c>0$, then this family of surfaces will foliate the ambient space in $N \\backslash B_{2 \\sigma_{0}}$.\n\nProof. We will prove that the union of this family of surfaces will pass through any points in $N \\backslash B_{2 \\sigma_{0}}$. In other words, for any $x \\in N \\backslash B_{2 \\sigma_{0}}$, there exists some surface $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$, for $\\sigma>\\sigma_{0}$ such that $x \\in \\Sigma_{\\sigma}$. It is important to note that it is not true generally that the radial exponential map is a global diffeomorphism. And thus rather than proving the global diffeomorphism, we will prove that there exists a positive constant $\\delta_{0}$ such that for any $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the map defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nF_{i}:\\left[i \\delta_{0},(i+1) \\delta_{0}\\right] \\times \\partial B_{2 \\sigma_{0}+i \\delta_{0}} \\longrightarrow N \\backslash B_{2 \\sigma_{0}} \\\\\n(t, p) \\longrightarrow \\exp _{p}^{N}\\left(t \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nis a local diffeomorphism. Indeed, we can take\n\n$$\n\\delta_{0}=\\inf _{p}\\left\\|\\left(\\exp _{p}^{N}\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|=\\inf _{p, X_{p} \\in\\left(\\exp _{p}^{N}\\right)^{-1}\\left(W_{p, i}\\right)}\\left\\|X_{p}\\right\\|\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{p, i}=\\operatorname{Img}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ is the tubular neighbourhood of the surface $\\partial B_{2 \\sigma_{0}+i \\delta_{0}}$.\nClaim 4.1. $F_{i}$ is a local diffeomorphism, and the constant $\\delta_{0}$ must be positive.\nProof of claim. The first statement can be seen as an application of the inverse function theorem. Hence we calculate the differential of the map $F_{i}$ as for any fixed $\\left(t_{0}, p_{0}\\right)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.d F_{i}\\right|_{(0, p_{0})}(t, v) & =\\left.\\frac{d}{d s}\\right|_{s=0}\\left[\\exp _{\\gamma(s)}\\left((t+s) \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\left(d \\exp _{p}\\right)_{t \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)+U(0, t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma(s)$ is a curve starting at $p$ with $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=v_{p}$ and $U(0, t)$ is the variational field along the curve $\\xi(t)=\\exp _{p}\\left(t \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)$. We then find that at $s=0, U(0,0)=\\dot{\\gamma}(0)=v$, thus\n\n$$\n\\left.d F_{i}\\right|_{\\left(0, p_{0}\\right)}(0, v)=v_{p}+\\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $d F_{i}$ is a local diffeomorphism. And the inverse function theorem gives some positive constant $\\delta_{i}$ such that\n\n$$\nG_{i}: W_{i} \\longrightarrow\\left[-\\delta_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right] \\times \\partial B_{2 \\sigma_{0}+\\delta_{i-1}}\n$$\n\nis a diffeomorphism. We now prove that there exists some positive constant $\\delta_{0}$ such that $2 \\delta_{i} \\geq \\delta_{0}$. Fix some $p \\in \\partial B_{2 \\sigma_{0}+\\delta_{i}}$, let $l_{i}$ be the length of the curve $\\xi(t)=\\exp _{p}\\left(t \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)$ and $\\theta_{i}$ the angle between $\\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}$ and $\\nu$ at $p$, then we have\n\n$$\n\\delta_{i} \\geq \\operatorname{dist}\\left(q_{i}, \\partial B_{2 \\sigma_{0}+\\delta_{i}}\\right) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} l_{i} \\cos \\theta_{i} \\geq \\frac{1}{2} c\n$$\n\nHere $q_{i}=\\exp _{p}\\left(l_{i} \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{\\sigma}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right)$ is the end point of $\\xi(t)$. Here $l_{i}$ has a lower bound, which is due to the positivity of the injectivity radius.\n\nOnce the claim is established, we can then glue all the local diffeomorphisms together. It is noted that possibly the gluing part of $F_{i}$ and $F_{i+1}$ would be non-smooth, but this issue can be addressed by slightly modifying the map, this completes the proof.\n\nConsider the smooth operator $\\mathscr{F}: C^{3}\\left(S^{2}, N\\right) \\rightarrow C^{1}\\left(S^{2}\\right)$ which assigns to each embedding $\\phi: S^{2} \\rightarrow N$ the harmonic mean curvature $\\mathscr{F}(\\phi)$ of the surface $\\Sigma=$ $\\phi\\left(S^{2}\\right)$. Given a variation vector field $V$ on a constant harmonic mean curvature surface $\\Sigma$, we could compute directly that the first variation of the $\\mathscr{F}$ operator at $\\Sigma$ in direction $V$ is given by\n\n$$\nd \\mathscr{F}(\\phi) \\cdot V=-\\left(\\mathcal{L}+F^{i j} h_{j k} h_{i k}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}\\right)\\langle V, \\nu\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi: S^{2} \\rightarrow N$ is the embedding of the constant harmonic mean curvature surface. From (8), we know $F^{i j} h_{j k} h_{i k}=2 F^{2}$. Define the linearized harmonic mean curvature operator $L$ on $\\Sigma$\n\n$$\nL=-\\left(\\mathcal{L}+2 F^{2}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince the operator $L$ is not self-adjoint, many useful tools in functional analysis and PDE cannot be applied to it. To proceed further, we consider the adjoint operator $L^{*}$ of $L$. By direct computation, we see that\n\n$$\nL^{*} u=L u-2 F_{, i}^{i j} u_{j}-F_{, i j}^{i j} u\n$$\n\nThen the operator\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS u & :=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(L+L^{*}\\right) u=L u-F_{, i}^{i j} u_{j}-\\frac{1}{2} F_{, i j}^{i j} u \\\\\n& =-\\left(\\mathcal{L} u+2 F^{2} u-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j} u+F_{, i}^{i j} u_{j}+\\frac{1}{2} F_{, i j}^{i j} u\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=-\\left(F^{i j} u_{j}\\right)_{, i}-\\left(2 F^{2}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}+\\frac{1}{2} F_{, i j}^{i j}\\right) u\n$$\n\nis a self-adjoint operator.\nDenote\n\n$$\n\\mu_{0}:=\\inf \\left\\{\\int_{\\Sigma} u S u d \\mu:\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}=1, \\int_{\\Sigma} u d \\mu=0\\right\\}>0\n$$\n\nThen we have the following lower bound for $\\mu_{0}$ :\nLemma 4.2. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the constant harmonic mean curvature hypersurface constructed in Theorem 1.1. Then for $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mu_{0} \\geq \\frac{3 m}{2} \\sigma^{-3}-c \\sigma^{-4}\n$$\n\nProof. We denote $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ by $\\Sigma$ for any $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$. By (8) and (9), we see that\n\n$$\n2 F^{2}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}=\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^{2}}-\\frac{5 m}{2 \\sigma^{3}}+O\\left(\\sigma^{-4}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing Lemma 3.9 and Proposition 3.10, we also have\n\n$$\nF_{, i j}^{i j}=O\\left(\\sigma^{-4}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor any $u$ with $\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}=1, \\int_{\\Sigma} u d \\mu=0$, by Lemma 3.11, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Sigma} u S u d \\mu & =\\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[-u \\mathcal{L} u-\\left(2 F^{2}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}\\right) u^{2}-\\left(F_{, i}^{i j} u_{j} u+\\frac{1}{2} F_{, i j}^{i j} u^{2}\\right)\\right] d \\mu \\\\\n& \\geq \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[-u \\mathcal{L} u-\\left(2 F^{2}-F^{i j} \\bar{R}_{3 i 3 j}\\right) u^{2}\\right] d \\mu-c \\sigma^{-4} \\\\\n& \\geq\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^{2}}-\\frac{m}{\\sigma^{3}}+c \\sigma^{-4}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^{2}}-\\frac{5 m}{2 \\sigma^{3}}+c \\sigma^{-4}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{3 m}{2 \\sigma^{3}}-c \\sigma^{-4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLemma 4.3. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the constant harmonic mean curvature hypersurface constructed in Theorem 1.1. For $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, the operator $S$ is invertible, and $\\left|S^{-1}\\right| \\leq c m^{-1} \\sigma^{3}$.\nProof. We denote $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ by $\\Sigma$ for any $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$. Let $\\eta_{0}$ be the lowest eigenvalue of $S$ without constraints, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\eta_{0}=\\inf _{\\left\\{u:\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}=1\\right\\}} \\int_{\\Sigma} u S u d \\mu=\\inf _{\\left\\{u:\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}=1\\right\\}} \\int_{\\Sigma} u L u d \\mu\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 3.11, for $u$ with $\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}=1$ and $\\int_{\\Sigma} u d \\mu=0$, there holds, for $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int_{\\Sigma} u \\mathcal{L} u d \\mu \\\\\n\\leq-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}-c \\sigma^{-2}\\right) \\int_{\\Sigma}|\\nabla u|^{2} d \\mu+c \\sigma^{-4}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\leq c \\sigma^{-4}\n$$\n\nBy (14), we have\n\n$$\n\\eta_{0} \\geq-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^{2}}+\\frac{5 m}{2 \\sigma^{3}}-c \\sigma^{-4}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, if we replace $u$ by a constant, we obtain the reverse inequality.

There is $\\sigma_{0}$ depending only on $C_{0}$ such that for all $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, the constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ constructed in Theorem 1.1 constitute a proper foliation of $N \\backslash B_{\\sigma_{0}}(0)$.\n\nProof. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the family of constant harmonic mean curvature surfaces constructed in Theorem 1.1 with $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$, and $\\phi^{\\sigma}: S^{2} \\rightarrow N$ be the embedding for each $\\sigma$.\n\nFor any $\\sigma_{2}>\\sigma_{1} \\geq \\sigma_{0}$ such that $\\Sigma_{\\sigma_{1}} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right), i=1,2, \\Sigma_{\\sigma_{2}}$ can be represented by a normal variation over $\\Sigma_{\\sigma_{1}}$ of the form\n\n$$\n\\phi^{\\sigma_{2}}=\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}+u(p) \\nu(p), \\quad p \\in S^{2}\n$$\n\nWe will show that $u$ has a sign; in particular, $u$ cannot be zero. In the following, we denote $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ by $\\Sigma$.\n\nLet $V=\\phi^{\\sigma_{2}}-\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}$. By the Taylor theorem, there is some $\\sigma \\in\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{2}}\\right) & =\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}\\right)+L u+\\frac{1}{2} d^{2} \\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma}\\right)(V, V) \\\\\n& =\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}\\right)+S u+(L-S) u+\\frac{1}{2} d^{2} \\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma}\\right)(V, V)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{2}}\\right)$ and $\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}\\right)$ are constants. Note that the second variation of the harmonic mean curvature operator involves the second fundamental form and higher derivatives of the metric, this leads to\n\n$$\n\\left\\|d^{2} \\mathscr{F}(V, V)\\right\\| \\leq c \\sigma^{-3}\\|V\\|^{2} \\leq c \\sigma^{-3}\\|u\\|_{C^{2}}\n$$\n\nWe also have from the definition of $S$ that\n\n$$\n|(L-S) u|=\\frac{\\left|\\left(L-L^{*}\\right) u\\right|}{2}=\\left|F_{, i}^{i j} u_{j}+\\frac{1}{2} F_{, i j}^{i j} u\\right| \\leq c \\sigma^{-3}\\|u\\|_{C^{1}}\n$$\n\nHence, $u$ satisfies the following elliptic equation\n\n$$\nS u=\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{2}}\\right)-\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\phi^{\\sigma_{1}}\\right)+E_{1}\n$$\n\nwith the error term satisfying $\\left|E_{1}\\right| \\leq c \\sigma^{-3}\\|u\\|_{C^{2}}$.

Finally, an application of Lemma 4.1 completes the proof.\n\nWe will now define the \"center of gravity\" as the constant harmonic mean curvature foliation approaches infinity. Following the way of Corvino-Wu in [CW08], we will show that the center of mass defined by the constant harmonic mean curvature foliation is equivalent to the ADM center of mass. We first present some definitions and necessary propositions.\n\nThe second derivative of the second fundamental form can be similarly estimated as Proposition 3.10, see the appendix in [CW08]. Together with Lemma 2.1, we can derive the following lemma.\n\nLemma 4.5. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the constant harmonic mean curvature surface constructed in Theorem 1.1. Then, for all $t \\geq 0$ and $\\sigma \\geq \\sigma_{0}$ large enough,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\nabla^{2} F\\right| \\leq c \\sigma^{-5}\n$$\n\nwhere $c$ depends on $C_{0}, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}$.\nDefinition 4.6. Assume $(M, g)$ be an asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold with metric $g_{i j}=\\left(1+\\frac{m}{2|x|}\\right)^{4} \\delta_{i j}+O_{2}\\left(|x|^{-2}\\right)$, the $A D M$ center of mass is defined by\n\n$$\nC^{k}=\\frac{1}{16 m \\pi} \\lim _{R \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{|x|=R}\\left[\\sum_{i} x^{k}\\left(g_{i j, i}-g_{i i, j}\\right) v_{e}^{j} d \\mu_{e}-\\sum_{i}\\left(g_{i k} v_{e}^{i}-g_{i i} v_{e}^{k}\\right) d \\mu_{e}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu_{e}$ is the normal vector with respect to the Euclidean metric $\\delta, k=1,2,3$.\nConsider an exterior region in an asymptotically flat manifold, and assume that there is an asymptotically flat chart in which $g_{i j}=\\left(1+\\frac{m}{2|x|}+\\frac{B_{k} x^{k}}{|x|^{k}}\\right)^{4} \\delta_{i j}+$ $O_{5}\\left(|x|^{-3}\\right)$ with $m>0$. By direct calculation, the ADM center of mass is\n\n$$\nC^{k}=\\frac{2 B_{k}}{m}\n$$\n\nDefinition 4.7. Let $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ be the family of surfaces constructed in Theorem 4.4 and $\\phi^{\\sigma}$ be the position vector. The center of gravity of $\\Sigma_{\\sigma}$ is defined as\n\n$$\nC_{H M}=\\lim _{\\sigma \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\int_{\\Sigma_{\\sigma}} \\phi^{\\sigma} d \\mu_{e}}{\\int_{\\Sigma_{\\sigma}} d \\mu_{e}}\n$$\n\nWe note that translating the coordinates by a vector $a^{k}$ shifts both the ADM center of mass and the center $C_{H M}$ by $a^{k}$. Thus, we can adjust the coordinates to set the ADM center of mass vector to be zero, which results in $B_{k}=0$ in this chart by (26). To prove Theorem 1.4 saying that $C_{H M}$ is equivalent to the ADM center of mass, it suffices to consider the following case.\n\nTheorem 4.8. Consider an exterior region in an asymptotically flat manifold, and assume that there is an asymptotically flat chart in which $g_{i j}=\\left(1+\\frac{m}{2|x|}\\right)^{4} \\delta_{i j}+$ $O_{5}\\left(|x|^{-3}\\right)$ with $m>0$. Then $C_{H M}=0$.\nProof. By the Sobolev embedding inequality ((3.1) in [CW08]), for $r>2$ and all $t \\geq 0$, there is a constant $c(r)$, such that\n\n$$\n\\|F-f\\|_{C^{0}} \\leq c \\sigma^{-\\frac{2}{4}}(\\sigma\\|\\nabla F\\|_{L^{q}}+\\|F-f\\|_{L^{r}}^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\|F-f\\|_{L^{2}}^{\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4}}{2}})\n$$\n\nwhere $q=\\frac{r}{2}+1$ and norms are calculated on $\\Sigma_{t}$ which is a solution to (2) contained in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\sigma}\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}\\right)$. At $t=0$, we are working in a coordinate system that $g_{i j}-g_{i j}^{S}=O_{5}\\left(|x|^{-3}\\right)$, with $g_{i j}^{S}$ being the Schwarzschild metric. Thus, the difference between the second fundamental form of $\\Sigma_{t}$ is\n\n$$\nh_{i j}-h_{i j}^{S}=O\\left(|x|^{-4}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich implies that $|F-f|=O\\left(\\sigma^{-4}\\right)$.

We demonstrate the long-time existence and\nexponential convergence of this flow with a coordinate sphere of large radius\nserving as the initial surface in the asymptotically flat end, which eventually\nconverges to a constant harmonic mean curvature surface. We also establish that\nthese surfaces form a foliation of the space outside a large ball. Finally, we\nutilize this foliation to define the center of mass, proving that it agrees\nwith the center of mass defined by the ADM formulation of the initial data set.", "updated": "2025-04-19T15:17:47Z", "published": "2024-12-22T13:59:17Z"}
