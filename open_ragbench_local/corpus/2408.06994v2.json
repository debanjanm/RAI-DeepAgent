This duality implies a natural isomorphism between the homeomorphism group of the space and the automorphism group of the algebra. We introduce a complex of cuts on which these groups act, and prove that when the algebra is countable and the space has at least five points, that these groups are the full automorphism group of the complex.\n\n\nA Boolean algebra is a nonempty set $B$ equipped with a pair of binary operations $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$, special elements 0 and 1 , and a unary operation $\\neg$ that satisfy simple axioms inspired by the algebra of logical statements (where $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ are \"or\" and \"and\", 0 is \"false\" and 1 is \"true\" and $\\neg$ is \"not\", respectively) or the algebra of subsets of a set (where 0 is the empty set, 1 is the entire set, and the operations are union, intersection and complementation). Boolean algebras turn out to be partially ordered-in fact, lattices; in the cases where the elements of the algebra are subsets of a set, the partial order is inclusion.\n\nA Stone space $E$ is a topological space which is compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected. Stone spaces have a basis of clopen (that is, closed and open) sets.\n\nFrom a Stone space, one can produce a Boolean algebra, namely the algebra of clopen sets. Since unions, intersections and complements of clopen sets are clopen, this really is a Boolean algebra.\n\nConversely, from a Boolean algebra $B$, one can produce (in the presence of the Axiom of Choice) a Stone space $E(B)$, namely the space of ultrafilters on the algebra. A basis of open sets is given by sets of the form\n\n$$\nU_{b}=\\{\\omega: b \\in \\omega\\}\n$$\n\nIt turns out that the complement of $U_{b}$ is $U_{\\neg b}$ (because ultrafilters have the maximality property: for each $b \\in B$ and ultrafilter $\\omega$, either $b \\in \\omega$ or $\\neg b \\in \\omega$ but not both). Therefore these sets are clopen, making the space $E(B)$ totally disconnected. It is also an easy exercise to verify that this basis of open sets generates a topology which is Hausdorff, since distinct ultrafilters must disagree on some element of $B$. Compactness requires the Axiom of Choice.\n\nIn [Sto36], Stone proved that given a Boolean algebra $B$, the map $b \\mapsto U_{b}$ is an isomorphism from $B$ to the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of $E(B)$.\n\nFrom this fundamental fact, several observations are possible.\n\n1. The group of homeomorphisms of $E(B)$ and the group of isomorphisms of $B$ are abstractly isomorphic. In fact, there are natural topologies to equip Homeo $(E)$ and $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ with, and these topologies really are the same topology.\n2. Since closed subsets of compact sets are compact, every clopen subset of $E$ is covered by finitely many clopen basis elements, so $E(B)$ is second countable if and only if $B$ is countable.\n\n3. In the case that either $E$ is second countable or $B$ is countable, we have that $E$ is a closed subset of the Cantor set and (by Stone duality) that $B$ is a quotient of the countable free Boolean algebra (which we might suppose we knew already by countability).\n4. Again assuming countability of $B$ or second countability of $E$, we have that Homeo $(E)=$ Aut $(B)$ are non-Archimedean Polish groups, being the automorphism group of a countable structure, namely $B$. As such, they are closed subgroups of $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$, the group of bijections of a countable set.\n\nIn this paper, inspired by the curve complex on a surface (particularly the case of a surface of infinite topological type) we introduce a complex we call the complex of cuts $\\mathcal{C}$ on which Homeo $(E)=\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ acts.\n\nTheorem A. Suppose $E$ is second countable and contains at least five points. The group of automorphisms of $\\mathcal{C}$, equipped with the permutation topology, is topologically isomorphic to Homeo $(E)=$ Aut $(B)$.\n\nWhen $E$ is finite, the diameter of the finite graph $\\mathcal{C}$ is at most four, while when $E$ is infinite, $\\mathcal{C}$ is a countably infinite graph which has diameter two. In particular, it is connected.\n\nBriefly a cut in $E$ is a partition of $E$ into two disjoint clopen sets $U \\sqcup V$. A cut is peripheral if either $U$ or $V$ has 0 or 1 element. Two cuts $U \\sqcup V$ and $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$ cross if all four of the pairwise intersections $U \\cap U^{\\prime}, U \\cap V^{\\prime}, V \\cap U^{\\prime}$ and $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$ are nonempty, otherwise they are compatible. The complex of cuts has as vertices the non-peripheral cuts in $E$, with two cuts being adjacent in $\\mathcal{C}$ when they are compatible. To think of $\\mathcal{C}$ as a complex, one may, as is standard with simplicial graphs, add a simplex when its 1 -skeleton is present.\n\nFor a second countable Stone space $E$, we may embed $E$ in the sphere $S^{2}$ and draw a Jordan curve which separates points in $U$ from points in $V$ and similarly for $U^{\\prime}$ and $V^{\\prime}$. Compatibility, one checks, is equivalent to being able to draw these curves disjointly.\n\nAlthough we will attempt to prefer the Stone space perspective, it is instructive to consider the Boolean algebra perspective as well: there a cut in $B$ is a pair $\\{a, \\neg a\\}$, a cut is peripheral if either of $a$ or $\\neg a$ is 0 or an atom, that is, an immediate successor of 0 in the partial order on $B$. Two cuts $\\{a, \\neg a\\}$ and $\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, \\neg a^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ cross if none of the meets $a \\wedge a^{\\prime}, a \\wedge \\neg a^{\\prime}, \\neg a \\wedge a^{\\prime}, \\neg a \\wedge \\neg a^{\\prime}$ are 0 , otherwise they are compatible.\n\nSince homeomorphisms or automorphisms preserve complements, we see that Homeo $(E)=$ Aut $(B)$ acts on $\\mathcal{C}$ by the rule that $\\Phi(U \\sqcup V)=\\Phi(U) \\sqcup \\Phi(V)$, or that $\\Phi(\\{a, \\neg a\\})=\\{\\Phi(a), \\neg \\Phi(a)\\}$.",

      "text": "# 1 Stone duality\n### 1.1 Preliminary definitions\n\nDefinition 1. A Boolean algebra is a nonempty set $B$ with distinguished elements 0 and 1 , and three operations $\\vee, \\wedge$ and $\\neg$, satisfying the following axioms.\n\n1. The binary operations $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ are associative and commutative.\n2. For all $a$ and $b$ in $B$, we have $a \\vee(b \\wedge a)=a$ and $a \\wedge(b \\vee a)=a$.\n3. 1 is an identity for $\\wedge$, while 0 is an identity for $\\vee$.\n4. $\\vee$ distributes over $\\wedge$ and vice versa.\n5. $a \\vee \\neg a=1$ while $a \\wedge \\neg a=0$.\n\nThe algebra $B$ is at the same time a lattice, a partially ordered set with \"meets\" $a \\wedge b$ and \"joins\" $a \\vee b$, where we say that $a \\leq b$ when $a \\vee b=b$.\n\nDefinition 2. A homomorphism of Boolean algebras $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is a map $f: A \\rightarrow B$ of sets which preserves meets and joins, and sends $1 \\in A$ to $1 \\in B$ and $0 \\in A$ to $0 \\in B$. It follows from the axioms that $f(\\neg a)=\\neg f(a)$ as well. Thus there is a category of Boolean algebras and homomorphisms. The terminal Boolean algebra is $\\mathbb{1}=\\{0=1\\}$, while the initial one is $\\mathcal{2}=\\{0,1\\}$.\n\nDefinition 3. A filter $\\omega$ on a Boolean algebra $B$ is a proper, nonempty subset which is meet closed in the sense that if $a$ and $b$ are in $\\omega$, then so is $a \\wedge b$, and also upward closed in the sense that if $a \\in \\omega$ and $a \\leq b$ (that is, $a \\vee b=b$ ) then $b \\in \\omega$.\n\nDefinition 4. A filter (which we require to be a proper subset, recall) is called an ultrafilter when it is maximal with respect to inclusion. For a Boolean algebra, this is equivalent to the condition that for each $b \\in B$, either $b \\in \\omega$ or $\\neg b \\in \\omega$, but not both.\n\nLemma 5. Assuming Zorn's Lemma, every filter $\\omega$ on a Boolean algebra $B$ may be extended to an ultrafilter. A filter is an ultrafilter if and only if, for each $b \\in B$, either $b \\in \\omega$ or $\\neg b \\in \\omega$, but not both. If $f: B \\rightarrow 2$ is a homomorphism, the collection of $b \\in B$ for which $f(b)=1 \\in 2$ is an ultrafilter. Finally, suppose that $S \\subset B$ is a subset with the property that every ultrafilter on $B$ contains an element of $S$. Then $S$ has a finite subset $S_{0}$ with the same property.\n\nProof. Suppose first that $\\omega$ is a filter. The collection of filters which contain $\\omega$ as a subset is partially ordered by inclusion. Supposing $\\omega_{1} \\leq \\omega_{2} \\leq \\cdots$ is a chain of filters containing $\\omega$, set $\\omega_{\\infty}=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\omega_{n}$. This is a proper nonempty subset of $B$, (since each $\\omega_{n}$ is a proper subset, none of the $\\omega_{n}$ contain 0 , for instance). If $a \\in \\omega_{\\infty}$ and $b \\in \\omega_{\\infty}$, then they are each contained in some $\\omega_{n}$, which contains $a \\wedge b$ on account of being a filter. Similarly we see that $\\omega_{\\infty}$ is upward closed, so $\\omega_{\\infty}$ is a filter which is an upper bound for our given chain. By Zorn's lemma, our poset then has maximal elements, which are ultrafilters by definition.\n\nSupposing $\\omega$ is a filter with the property that for each $b \\in B$, eithe $b \\in \\omega$ or $\\neg b \\in \\omega$ but not both, we see that if a set $S$ properly contains $\\omega$, it must contain both $b$ and $\\neg b$ for some $b \\in B$. Such a set cannot be a filter, since the meet closed property forces it to contain 0 and the upward closed property forces it to then fail to be a proper subset of $B$; therefore $\\omega$ is an ultrafilter.\n\nGiven a homomorphism $f: B \\rightarrow 2$, the algebra of 2 implies that the preimage of 1 under $f$ is a filter such that for each $b \\in B$, either $f(b)=1$ or $f(\\neg b)=1$ but not both.\n\nNote that for any element $b \\in B$, note that the set $F(b)=\\{a \\in B: b \\leq a\\}$ is a filter on $B$ provided $b \\neq 0$, and that if $a \\leq B$, then $F(a) \\supset F(b)$. Supposing that $S \\subset B$ has the property that every ultrafilter on $B$ contains an element from $S$, given a finite subset $S_{0}=\\left\\{b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\} \\subset S$, consider the set $F\\left(S_{0}\\right)=F\\left(\\neg b_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\neg b_{n}\\right)$. If this set is a filter, it will fail to contain any $b_{n}$; indeed $S_{0}$ will fail to be our sought-for finite subset of $S$ precisely when $F\\left(S_{0}\\right)$ is a filter. Supposing towards a contradiction that every $F\\left(S_{0}\\right)$ is a filter, letting $S_{0}$ vary among the finite subsets of $S$, we see that this collection of filters is partially ordered: when $S_{0} \\subset S_{0}^{\\prime}$, we have $F\\left(S_{0}\\right) \\subset F\\left(S_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)$. Since we saw that unions of chains of filters are filters, appealing to Zorn's lemma again, we see that actually there is an ultrafilter $\\omega$ containing no element of $S$, providing the contradiction we seek.",

      "text": "# 1.2 Stone Duality Theorem \n\nThe collection of ultrafilters on $B$ is a Stone space $E(B)$, (that is, it is compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected) where the basic clopen sets are of the form $U_{b}=\\{\\omega: b \\in \\omega\\}$.\n\nNotice that since an ultrafilter defines a map $\\omega: B \\rightarrow 2$, we see that if $g: A \\rightarrow B$ is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras and $\\omega \\in E(B)$ is a point of the associated Stone space, we naturally\n\nobtain a point $g^{*} \\omega$ in $E(A)$ by the rule that $g^{*} \\omega$ is the ultrafilter corresponding to the composition\n\n$$\nA \\xrightarrow{g} B \\xrightarrow{\\omega} 2 .\n$$\n\nIndeed, the assignment $\\omega \\mapsto g^{*} \\omega$ yields a continuous map $g^{*}: E(B) \\rightarrow E(A)$ : we compute that the preimage $\\left(g^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left(U_{a}\\right)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left(g^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left(U_{a}\\right)=\\left\\{\\omega \\in E(B): a \\in g^{*} \\omega\\right\\}=\\{\\omega \\in E(B): g(a) \\in \\omega\\}=U_{g(a)}\n$$\n\nThis defines a contravariant functor $E$ from the category of Boolean algebras and homomorphisms to the category of Stone spaces and continuous maps sending $B$ to $E(B)$ and $g: A \\rightarrow B$ to $g^{*}: E(B) \\rightarrow E(A)$.\n\nConversely, if $S$ is a Stone space, it has a basis of clopen sets, and the clopen sets of $S$ organize into a Boolean algebra $\\Omega(S)$. If $f: S \\rightarrow T$ is a continuous map, observe that if $U \\subset T$ is open (respectively closed), then $f^{-1}(U)$ is open (respectively closed) in $S$ by continuity, so we have a map $f^{-1}: \\Omega(T) \\rightarrow \\Omega(S)$, and this assignment defines a contravariant functor $\\Omega$ from Stone spaces to Boolean algebras.\n\nTheorem 6 (Stone duality). The functors $E$ and $\\Omega$ are (contravariant) equivalences of categories, in the sense that there exist isomorphisms $\\eta: B \\rightarrow \\Omega(E(B))$ and $\\epsilon: E(\\Omega(S)) \\rightarrow S$ natural in their arguments.\n\nConsequently the (abstract) group of automorphisms of a Boolean algebra $B$ is isomorphic to the group of homeomorphisms of $E(B)$, and moreover, the permutation topology on $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ and the compact-open topology on $\\operatorname{Homeo}(E(B))$ agree.\n\nBefore turning to the proof, let us recall quickly the topologies in question in the \"moreover\" statement above. Since in order to understand the topology on a group one needs only to know what a neighborhood basis of the identity is, we give only neighborhoods of the identity.\n\nFor the permutation topology (on a set, say), the sets $\\operatorname{Stab}(b)=\\{\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(B): \\varphi(b)=b\\}$ are declared open and form a subbasis for the topology. Put another way, a basic open set is a finite intersection of stabilizers, or a set of the form $\\left\\{\\varphi: \\varphi\\left(b_{i}\\right)=b_{i}\\right\\}$ for some finite set $\\left\\{b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ in $B$.\n\nFor the compact-open topology on a (compact, say) topological space $S$, the sets $V(K, U)=$ $\\{\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Homeo}(S): \\varphi(K) \\subset U\\}$ are declared open, where $K$ is compact, $U$ is open, and this set is an identity neighborhood when $K \\subset U$. Since we assume that $S=E(B)$ is compact, this always gives Homeo $(S)$ the structure of a topological group. (In general with this topology it is possible for inversion to fail to be continuous [Dij05]). When $S$ itself has a subbasis of open sets, we may restrict ourselves to choosing $U$ from this subbasis to produce a subbasis for the compact-open topology.\n\nWith respect to the compact-open topology on a compact space $S$, the map ev: Homeo $(S) \\times$ $S \\rightarrow S$ defined as $(\\varphi, x) \\mapsto \\varphi(x)$ is continuous. In fact it is the strongest (or coarsest, pace Arens, meaning it has the fewest open sets) such topology [Are46a, Are46b].\n\nNow we turn to the proof.\nProof. The map $\\eta: B \\rightarrow \\Omega(E(B))$ sends an element $b$ to the basic open set $U_{b}$; the distinguished elements 0 to $\\varnothing$ and 1 to $E(B) \\subset E(B)$.\n\nWe claim that $U_{a} \\cap U_{b}=U_{a \\wedge b}$, and that $U_{a} \\cup U_{b}=U_{a \\vee b}$. Indeed, since ultrafilters are upward closed, the inclusions $U_{a \\wedge b} \\subset U_{a}$ and $U_{b}$ are clear, as are the containments $U_{a \\vee b} \\supset U_{a}$ and $U_{b}$. Conversely, because ultrafilters are meet closed, we see that $U_{a} \\cap U_{b} \\subset U_{a \\wedge b}$ and similarly $U_{a} \\cup U_{b} \\supset U_{a \\vee b}$. Therefore $\\eta$ is a homomorphism.\n\nFor each $b \\in B$ not equal to 0 , the set $F(b)=\\{a \\in B: a \\geq b\\}$ is a filter which contains $b$. By Lemma 5 , we have that $F(b)$ is contained in an ultrafilter. By considering the element $a \\wedge \\neg b$, from this fact it is clear that if $a \\neq b$, then $U_{a} \\neq U_{b}$, so the map $\\eta$ is injective.\n\nConversely, suppose that $U \\subset E(B)$ is clopen. Since the $U_{a}$ (by definition) form a basis for the topology on $E(B)$, since $U$ is open, it contains some $U_{a_{0}}$. Since $U_{a_{0}}$ is closed, $U-U_{a_{0}}$ is open and therefore contains $U_{a_{1}}$ for some $a_{1}$. Proceeding inductively we have a cover of $U$ by disjoint open sets. By compactness of $E(B)$ and hence of the closed subset $U$, finitely many of them cover, hence $U$ is equal by the previous observation to $U_{a_{0} \\vee \\cdots \\vee a_{n}}$. In other words, the map $\\eta$ is surjective.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that $S$ is a Stone space. An element of $E(\\Omega(S))$ is an ultrafilter on $\\Omega(S)$, that is, it is a filter, i.e. a collection of nonempty clopen sets which is closed under (finite) intersections and directed unions, which is maximal with respect to inclusion. Since the clopen subsets of our ultrafilter are nonempty, we have that this collection $\\omega$ has the finite intersection property, and hence by compactness of $S$, there exists at least one point in the intersection of all $U \\in \\omega$.\n\nWe claim that in fact there is exactly one point in this intersection. Indeed, suppose $x$ is contained in $\\bigcap_{U \\in \\omega} U$. Since $S$ is Hausdorff, for any $y \\neq x$, there is an open (in fact clopen) neighborhood $V$ of $x$ not containing $y$. By maximality of $\\omega$, we must have that $V$ is contained in $\\omega$, and so $y$ is not in $\\bigcap_{U \\in \\omega} U$.\n\nIf $x$ is the unique point of $\\bigcap_{U \\in \\omega} U$, let $\\epsilon: E(\\Omega(S)) \\rightarrow S$ be the map $\\omega \\mapsto x$. Notice that if $\\omega \\neq \\omega^{\\prime}$, then there is a clopen set $U \\subset S$ such that $U \\in \\omega$ but $S-U$ is in $\\omega^{\\prime}$. It follows that $\\epsilon(\\omega) \\neq \\epsilon\\left(\\omega^{\\prime}\\right)$. It follows that the map $\\epsilon$ is injective.\n\nIf $x \\in S$ is a point, observe that the collection of all clopen subsets of $S$ containing $x$ is an ultrafilter on $\\Omega(S)$ : it is clearly a filter, and it is maximal because $S$ is Hausdorff and totally disconnected. It follows that the map $\\epsilon$ is surjective.\n\nFinally, supposing that $U \\subset S$ is clopen, consider $\\epsilon^{-1}(U)$. This is the collection of all ultrafilters whose unique points of total intersection lie in $U$. But this is exactly the set of ultrafilters containing the clopen set $U$. It follows that $\\epsilon$ is continuous. To see that is open (and thus a homeomorphism), suppose that $U \\subset E(\\Omega(S))$ is a basic open set, say $U=U_{V}=\\{\\omega \\in E(\\Omega(S)): V \\in \\omega\\}$. It is clear that $\\epsilon(U) \\subset V$. In fact, each point of $V$ is, by our proof of surjectivity of $\\epsilon$, hit by some element of $E(\\Omega(S))$ which is clearly contained in $U$, so we conclude that $\\epsilon$ is open.\n\nThat the maps $\\eta$ and $\\epsilon$ are natural in their argument is the statement that for each map (in the correct category) $A \\rightarrow B$ or $S \\rightarrow T$, the following diagrams commute\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nThis is not hard to see; for example, suppose that $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras. The map $f^{*}: E(B) \\rightarrow E(A)$ sends an ultrafilter $\\omega$ on $B$ to the ultrafilter $f^{*} \\omega=\\{a \\in$ $A: f(a) \\in \\omega\\}$ on $A$. This is a continuous map, and the preimage of $U_{a}$ under this map is the set of ultrafilters $\\left\\{\\omega: f^{*} \\omega \\in U_{a}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\omega: a \\in f^{*} \\omega\\right\\}=\\{\\omega: f(a) \\in \\omega\\}=U_{f(a)}$, which shows that the left-hand square commutes. The right-hand square is similar; we leave it to the reader.\n\nThe first part of the \"consequently\" statement is just the standard observation that the functors $E$ and $\\Omega$ carry isomorphisms to isomorphisms (being equivalences of categories), and in fact yield isomorphisms of the categorical automorphism groups under consideration.\n\nFinally, we prove the \"moreover\" statement. Suppose that $K$ is compact and contained in the clopen set $U=U_{a}$. Notice that this containment means that for all $\\omega \\in K$, we have that $a \\in \\omega$. If $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ stabilizes $a$, we see that $\\varphi^{*}\\left(U_{a}\\right)=U_{\\varphi(a)}=U_{a}$, so in particular, we have that $\\varphi^{*}(K) \\subset U$-in other words, the identity neighborhood $V(K, U)$ in the compact-open topology on $\\operatorname{Homeo}(E) \\cong \\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ contains the identity neighborhood $\\operatorname{Stab}(a)$ in the permutation topology.\n\nConversely, suppose that $f$ is a homeomorphism of $E$ contained in the identity neighborhood $V\\left(U_{a}, U_{a}\\right)$. Then $f^{-1}\\left(U_{a}\\right)=U_{a}$ by definition, so as a homomorphism of Boolean algebras, we have that $f^{-1}: \\Omega(E) \\rightarrow \\Omega(E)$ stabilizes $a$. That is, we see that the identity neighborhood $\\operatorname{Stab}(a)$\n\nin the permutation topology contains the identity neighborhood $V\\left(U_{a}, U_{a}\\right)$ in the compact-open topology.",

      "text": "# 1.3 Non-Archimediean Polish groups \n\nConsider the case when $B$ is countable, $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ is non-Archimedean and Polish. Since a Boolean algebra $B$ is, in particular, a poset, we may consider the 1 -skeleton of its geometric realization, a simplicial graph we will call $\\Gamma_{B}$. Vertices of $\\Gamma_{B}$ are thus elements of $B$, and we have a directed edge from $a$ to $b$ (which we assume distinct) if $a \\leq b$ in the partial order. In terms of the Boolean algebra, this is the case when $a \\vee b=b$. When $B$ is countable, this is a countable graph and we see immediately that the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ on the vertex set of $\\Gamma_{B}$ is faithful.\n\nThis action on a countable set yields a representation $\\operatorname{Aut}(B) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$, the group of permutations of a countable set. Now, the group $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ is Polish, meaning it has a countable dense subset and is completely metrizable.\n\nTo see this, we claim that the (normal!) subgroup of finitely supported permutations is dense. Indeed, given $\\Phi$ a permutation of $\\mathbb{N}$ and $F \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ finite, extend the action of $\\Phi$ on $F$ to a bijection $\\varphi_{F}$ of $F \\cup \\Phi(F)$ by for example setting $\\varphi_{F}(x)=\\Phi^{-1}(x)$ if $x \\in \\Phi(F)-F$. Extend $\\varphi_{F}$ to all of $\\mathbb{N}$ by acting as the identity on the complement. As we enlarge the set $F$, the elements $\\varphi_{F}^{-1} \\Phi$ approach the identity. Put another way, every open neighborhood of $\\Phi$ contains an element of the form $\\varphi_{F}$ in the permutation topology, so $\\Phi$ is in the closure of the finitely supported permutations of $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nDefine a metric on $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ as follows: if $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are bijections of $\\mathbb{N}$, let $\\delta(\\Phi, \\Psi)=2^{-n}$, where $n$ is the smallest element of $\\mathbb{N}$ for which $\\Phi(n) \\neq \\Psi(n)$. Although this defines a left-invariant metric on $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$, this metric is not complete [Cam96]. Define instead $d(\\Phi, \\Psi)=\\min \\left\\{\\delta(\\Phi, \\Psi), \\delta\\left(\\Phi^{-1}, \\Psi^{-1}\\right)\\right\\}$. This metric is complete: if $\\Phi_{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence, one can show that $\\Phi_{n}(k)$ and $\\Phi_{n}^{-1}(k)$ stabilize for large $n$, and therefore define a map (which turns out to be a bijection) $\\Phi: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ by the rule that $\\Phi(j)=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\Phi_{n}(j)$.\n\nLet us return to Boolean algebras. Since the operations of meet and join are recoverable from the poset structure (for example $a \\wedge b$ is the greatest lower bound of $a$ and $b$ ), if an element of $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$ preserves directed edges, we claim that actually it comes from an element of $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$. Indeed, since 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum element of $B$, we have that an element of $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$ preserving directed edges preserves $0,1, \\wedge$ and $\\vee$, hence comes from an automorphism of $B$. In general (i.e. for Boolean algebras satisfying $0 \\neq 1$ ), an element of $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$ must either fix 0 (and hence fix 1 ) or swap them, so we have that $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ is an index-two subgroup of $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$ (in general). In the permutation topology on $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$, we see that $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)=\\operatorname{Stab}(0)$ is open (hence closed by general theory of topological groups).\n\nSince $\\Gamma_{B}$ is simplicial, the edge relation on $\\Gamma_{B}$ is described by a subset of the set of unordered pair of vertices of $\\Gamma_{B}$. The group $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ acts continuously on the vertex set of $\\Gamma_{B}$ when given the discrete topology, hence continuously on the set of unordered pairs. An element of $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\Gamma_{B}\\right)$ is precisely an element of $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ that preserves the edge relation. Like all subsets of the (discrete) set of unordered pairs, the edge relation is closed. Since $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ acts continuously, we see that for each unordered pair $[x, y]$, the map $\\Phi \\mapsto[\\Phi(x), \\Phi(y)]$ is continuous, hence the subgroup of $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$ preserving the edge relation is closed in $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$. Thus we see that $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ is a closed subgroup of $\\operatorname{Sym}(\\mathbb{N})$.\n\nClosed subspaces of complete metric spaces are complete, and subspaces of separable metric spaces are separable, so we see that $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ is again a Polish group, provided that $B$ is countable.",

A cut is non-peripheral if $U$ and $V$ each contain at least two points, or,\n\nequivalently, if neither $a$ nor $\\neg a$ are 0 or an atom, that is, an immediate successor of 0 in the partial order.\n\nWe see immediately that if $B$ admits non-peripheral cuts, then the space $E$ has at least four points.\n\nDefinition 8. Two cuts $U \\sqcup V$ and $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$ cross if each of the four pairwise intersections $U \\cap U^{\\prime}$, $U \\cap V^{\\prime}, V \\cap U^{\\prime}$ and $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$ are nonempty. In terms of the algebra, this says that $[a, \\neg a]$ and $[b, \\neg b]$ cross if none of the elements $a \\wedge b, a \\wedge \\neg b, \\neg a \\wedge b$ or $\\neg a \\wedge \\neg b$ are 0 .\n\nIf two cuts do not cross, we say that they are compatible.\nObserve that peripheral cuts are compatible with every cut, and that if $B$ admits a pair of compatible non-peripheral cuts, then $E$ has at least five points.\n\nWe come now to the main definition.\nDefinition 9. The complex of cuts in $B$ (or $E$ ) is the simplicial graph $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ whose vertices are the non-peripheral cuts in $B$ (or $E$ ), with an edge between distinct cuts whenever they are compatible.\n\nThe group $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)$ clearly acts on $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ continuously. Our main result is the following.\nTheorem 10. Suppose $E$ is second countable and has at least five points. The group $\\operatorname{Aut}(B)=$ Homeo $(E)$ is isomorphic as a topological group to $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$.\n\nAs already mentioned, the complex $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is empty when $E$ has three or fewer points. When $E$ is a four-point set, the complex $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is a set of three points (with no edges), and the map Homeo $(E) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$ is the exceptional map $S_{4} \\rightarrow S_{3}$ whose kernel is the Klein 4-group generated by the products of disjoint transpositions. When $E$ is a five-point set, the graph $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is the Petersen graph (cuts are in one-to-one correspondence with two-element subsets of five points, and edges between cuts correspond to disjointness of the two-element subsets), which is well-known to have automorphism group $S_{5}$.\n\nRecall that in the classification of infinite-type surfaces [Ric63], a fundamental invariant is the nested triple of Stone spaces $E_{n}(S) \\subseteq E_{g}(S) \\subseteq E(S)$, where $E_{n}(S)$ is the space of ends accumulated by crosscaps and $E_{g}(S)$ is the space of ends accumulated by genus. Motivated by this example, we make the following definition.\n\nDefinition 11. A Stone space system is a properly nested collection of Stone spaces $E_{n} \\subseteq E_{n-1} \\subseteq$ $\\cdots \\subseteq E_{2} \\subseteq E_{1}$ for some $n \\geq 2$. A cut of a Stone space system is a cut of $E_{1}$. A homeomorphism of Stone space systems is a homeomorphism of $E_{1}$ which preserves each $E_{k}$ for $2 \\leq k \\leq n$. The number $n$ is called the length of the Stone space system.\n\nWhen is a cut of a Stone space system \"non-peripheral\"? There are two definitions we consider.\nDefinition 12. Let $E=\\left(E_{1}, \\ldots, E_{n}\\right)$ be a Stone space sytem. A cut of $E$ is weakly non-peripheral if each part of the partition either contains at least two points or at least one point of $E_{2}$. The weak complex of cuts $\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)$ is the complex whose vertices are weakly non-peripheral cuts and whose edges correspond to compatibility.\n\nIntuitively, we think of the surface $S$ obtained by removing $E_{1}$ from a sphere and gluing infinite rays of handles or crosscaps at each point of $E_{2}$. Then a weakly non-peripheral cut of $E$ is roughly analogous to a simple closed curve of $S$ which is not contractable or homotopic to a puncture.\n\nWe can immediately see that the main result does not extend to the weak cut complex for Stone space systems with length at least 3. Consider the Stone space system $E=\\left(E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}\\right)$ where\n\n$$\nE_{1}=\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E_{2}=\\{a, b\\} \\\\\n& E_{3}=\\{a\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe cuts $A=\\{a\\} \\sqcup\\{b, c, d, e\\}$ and $B=\\{b\\} \\sqcup\\{a, c, d, e\\}$ are both weakly non-peripheral. Both of these cuts are compatible with all other cuts. Hence, there exists an automorphism of the weak complex of cuts $\\phi: \\mathcal{C}_{w}(E) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)$ such that $\\phi(A)=B$. But a homeomorphism of $E_{1}$ which induces $\\phi$ must take $a$ to $b$, and hence fails to be a homeomorphism of the Stone space system.\n\nIn fact, the result fails even for the weak complex of pairs of Stone spaces.\nLemma 13. Let $E_{1}$ be a Stone space with at least five points, let $k \\in E_{1}$ be an isolated point, and let $E$ be the Stone space system $\\left(E_{1},\\{k\\}\\right)$. Then $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{C}\\left(E_{1}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nIn particular, suppose $E_{1}$ is a discrete finite set with $n \\geq 5$ points. Then $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)\\right) \\cong$ $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{C}\\left(E_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cong S_{n}$, but the homeomorphism group of $E$ is isomorphic to $S_{n-1}$.\n\nProof. Let $\\kappa$ be the cut $\\{k\\} \\sqcup E_{1}-\\{k\\}$. Then $\\kappa$ is weakly-non-peripheral by definition. Moreover, all weakly-non-peripheral cuts except for $\\kappa$ are non-peripheral as cuts in $E_{1}$. Hence, $\\mathcal{C}\\left(E_{1}\\right)$ is the full subgraph of $\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)$ obtained by removing the vertex $\\kappa$.\n\nEvery cut is compatible with $\\kappa$, hence $\\kappa$ is adjacent to every other vertex of $\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)$. No other vertices have this property: thus $\\kappa$ is fixed by the automorphism group of $\\mathcal{C}_{w}(E)$, so removing $\\kappa$ does not change the automorphism group.\n\nDefinition 14. Let $E=\\left(E_{1}, \\ldots, E_{n}\\right)$ be a Stone space system. A cut of $E$ is strongly nonperipheral if each part of the partition contains at least two elements of $E_{n}$. The strong cut-complex $\\mathcal{C}_{s}(E)$ is the full subgraph of $\\mathcal{C}\\left(E_{1}\\right)$ comprising the strongly non-peripheral vertices.\n\nOnce again, the main result does not generalize to strong cut complexes for Stone space systems of length at least 3. Consider the system $E=\\left(E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}\\right)$ with\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE_{1}=\\{a, b, c, d, e, f, g\\} \\\\\nE_{2}=\\{a, b, c, d, e, f\\} \\\\\nE_{3}=\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nConsider the homeomorphism $\\phi: E_{1} \\rightarrow E_{1}$ given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\phi(f)=g \\\\\n\\phi(g)=f \\\\\n\\phi(x)=x, \\quad \\text { for } \\quad x \\in E_{3}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\phi$ is not a homeomorphism of the Stone space system, since it swaps an element of $E_{2}$ with an element of $E_{1} \\backslash E_{2}$. However, $\\phi$ induces an automorphism on the strong cut-complex. To see this, note that the strongly non-peripheral property depends only on the elements of $E_{3}$, which are all fixed pointwise by $\\phi$. Hence, a cut $X$ is strongly non-peripheral if and only if $\\phi(X)$ is strongly non-peripheral.\n\nQuestion 15. If $E=\\left(E_{1}, E_{2}\\right)$ is a Stone space pair, do we have that Homeo $(E) \\cong \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{s}(E)\\right)$ ?\nLemma 16. The graph $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is connected if $E$ has at least five points. Moreover if $E$ is finite, then $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ has diameter at most four, while if $E$ is infinite, $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ has diameter two.\n\nProof. Suppose that $E$ is finite but has at least five points. Any choice $U_{\\gamma}$ of two points from $E$ determines a cut $U_{\\gamma} \\sqcup\\left(E-U_{\\gamma}\\right)$, and any cut $\\gamma$ is compatible with a cut $\\gamma^{\\prime}$, one of whose sets $U_{\\gamma^{\\prime}}$ has size two. So beginning with cuts $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$, replace them with compatible cuts $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$ respectively whose smaller subset $U_{\\gamma^{\\prime}}$ and $U_{\\eta^{\\prime}}$ has size two. If $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$ are compatible (or equal), then we are done. If not, then $U_{\\gamma^{\\prime}} \\cup U_{\\eta^{\\prime}}$ has size three, and since $E$ has at least five elements, this determines a cut compatible with both $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$. This proves that $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ has diameter at most four when $E$ is finite.\n\nSupposing instead that $E$ is infinite, note that at least one of the subsets determined by a cut $\\gamma$ is infinite. If $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ and $\\eta=U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$ are cuts that cross, then each of the four intersections is nonempty and at least one must be infinite. That intersection determines a cut, since its complement contains at least three points (one for each of the remaining pairwise intersections), and this cut is compatible with both $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$. This proves that $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ has diameter two.",

However, there are natural full subgraphs which have infinite diameter [AFP17]. One could ask whether such a subcomplex exists for the cut complex. The next lemma shows that we cannot hope to get such a subcomplex for arbitrary Stone spaces.\n\nLemma 17. Let $K$ be a Cantor set, and let $G$ be a nonempty, Homeo $(K)$-invariant full subgraph of $\\mathcal{C}(K)$. Then $G$ has diameter 2 .\n\nProof. First, we show $G$ has diameter at least two. Since $G$ is non-empty, there exists a vertex $x \\in V(G)$ corresponding to the non-peripheral cut $A \\sqcup(K \\backslash A)$ of $K$. Since $G$ is Homeo $(K)$-invariant, $G$ contains $f(x)$ for all homeomorphisms $f \\in \\operatorname{Homeo}(K)$.\n$A$ is a nonempty proper clopen subset of a Cantor set, so $A$ is also homeomorphic to $K$. If we represent $K$ as the set of all infinite binary sequences, we may assume without loss of generality that $A$ is the set of binary sequences whose first term is 0 .\n\nLet $f: K \\rightarrow K$ be the homeomorphism that sends the sequence $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, \\ldots\\right)$ to the sequence $\\left(a_{2}, a_{1}, a_{3}, a_{4}, \\ldots\\right)$. Observe that $x$ and $f(x)$ cross: $A \\cap f(A)$ is the set of sequences beginning with two $0 \\mathrm{~s} ; A \\cap(K \\backslash f(A))$ is the set of sequences beginning with a zero followed by a one. Hence, $d_{G}(x, f(x)) \\geq 2$.\n\nNow we show $G$ has diameter at most two. Suppose $x=A \\sqcup(K \\backslash A)$ and $y=B \\sqcup(K \\backslash B)$ are two vertices of $G$. If $x$ and $y$ are adjacent, then we are done. Otherwise, $A \\cap B$ is a nonempty clopen proper subset of $K$ different from $A$ or $B$, and hence there exists a homeomorphism $f: K \\rightarrow K$ such that $f(A)=A \\cap B$. Thus $f(x)=(A \\cap B) \\sqcup(K \\backslash(A \\cap B))$ is also a vertex of $G$, and $f(x)$ is adjacent to both $x$ and $y$.",

      "text": "## 2 Pants Decompositions\n\nOur proof of Theorem 10 is motivated by the analogy between $E$ and the end spaces of infinitetype surfaces, in particular the papers [HMV18, HMV19]. Motivated by pants decompositions of surfaces, we introduce the following definition.\n\nDefinition 18. Let $\\left\\{\\gamma_{n}\\right\\}$ be a countable collection of non-peripheral cuts. We say that $\\Gamma=\\left\\{\\gamma_{n}\\right\\}$ is a pants decomposition of $E$ if it satisfies the following conditions.\n\n1. Any two cuts $\\gamma_{i}$ and $\\gamma_{j}$ in $\\Gamma$ are compatible.\n2. If $\\gamma$ is a cut not in $\\Gamma$ but in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$, then there exists some cut $\\gamma_{j} \\in \\Gamma$ which crosses $\\gamma$.\n\n3. Moreover the collection of $j$ such that $\\gamma$ crosses $\\gamma_{j}$ is finite.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is a simplicial graph, we may think of it as a (flag) simplicial complex by adding a simplex whenever its 1 -skeleton is present. The first two properties say that $\\Gamma$ is the set of vertices of a maximal simplex in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$.\n\nIf $E$ is finite, the third condition is vacuous, since $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is a finite graph. If $E$ is infinite, we have the following result.\n\nLemma 19. Suppose that $E$ is second countable (or equivalently that $B$ is countable) and that $E$ has at least four elements. Pants decompositions of $E$ exist.\n\nProof. We begin with a particular example. Recall the construction of the standard middle-thirds Cantor set $\\mathcal{C}$ : one begins with the unit interval $[0,1]$ and then at the $k^{\\text {th }}$ level of the construction for $k \\geq 1$, a number $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ remains in the set provided none of the first $k$ digits after the decimal of $x$ expressed as a number in base 3 are 1 . (We represent 1 as $0 . \\overline{2}$.) There are $2^{k}$ sequences of length $k$ drawn from the alphabet $\\{0,2\\}$; each choice of a sequence $s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}$ determines a cut $\\gamma_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}}=U_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}} \\sqcup V$, where $U_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}}$ is the clopen subset of $\\mathcal{C}$ comprising those $x \\in \\mathcal{C}$ whose first $k$ digits expressed as a number in base 3 are $0 . s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}$, and $V$ is its complement in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe collection of finite sequences in the alphabet $\\{0,2\\}$ is countable, and cuts in $\\mathcal{C}$ corresponding to distinct finite sequences are compatible; we claim that the collection $\\Gamma=\\left\\{\\gamma_{\\vec{s}}: \\vec{s}=s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}, s_{i} \\in\\right.$ $\\{0,2\\}\\}$ is a pants decomposition of $\\mathcal{C}$. Let $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ be a cut not in $\\Gamma$. Since the sets $U_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}}$ form a neighborhood basis for $\\mathcal{C}$, using compactness we may write $U$ and $V$ each as a disjoint union of finitely many of these sets, say $U=U_{1} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup U_{n}$ and $V=V_{1} \\sqcup \\cdots V_{m}$. Any cut $\\gamma_{\\vec{s}}$ for which the sequence $\\vec{s}=s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}$ has a prefix equal to the string associated to some $U_{i}$ or $V_{j}$ will be compatible with $\\gamma$. Since there is a bound to the length of strings appearing in the lists associated to $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n}$ and $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{m}$ and $U \\sqcup V$ is a cut so that every $\\vec{s}$ longer than that bound has such a prefix, there are only finitely many $\\gamma_{\\vec{s}}$ which may cross $\\gamma$. Thus $\\Gamma$ is a pants decomposition of the Cantor set.\n\nNow suppose that $E$ is a second-countable Stone space. By Stone duality, $E$ is (homeomorphic to) a closed subset of $\\mathcal{C}$, and each cut $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$ restricts to a cut $\\bar{\\gamma}=\\bar{U} \\sqcup \\bar{V}$, where $\\bar{U}=E \\cap U$ and $\\bar{v}=E \\cap V$. Now, these cuts may not all be non-peripheral. We restrict ourselves to $\\Gamma_{E}=\\{\\bar{\\gamma}$ : $\\bar{\\gamma}$ is nonperipheral and $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma\\}$. It is clear that this collection of cuts is countable and pairwise compatible. We claim that it is a pants decomposition of $E$.\n\nNow, by the definition of the subspace topology, every cut $\\bar{U} \\sqcup \\bar{V}$ in $E$ is the restriction $\\bar{\\gamma}$ of a cut $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. A nonperipheral cut in $E$ will belong to $\\Gamma_{E}$ if and only if it is equal to $\\bar{\\gamma}$ for some cut $\\gamma$ in $\\Gamma$. (It may also be equal to $\\bar{\\gamma}^{\\prime}$ where $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ is not in $\\Gamma$.) Therefore if a cut does not belong to $\\Gamma_{E}$, then for every expression of that cut as $\\bar{\\gamma}$, we have that the cut $\\gamma$ is not in $\\Gamma$. Fixing such a cut $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$, write $U=U_{1} \\sqcup \\cdots U_{n}$, where each $U_{i}$ is $U_{\\vec{s}_{i}}$ for some finite sequence $\\vec{s}_{i}$. Since $\\bar{\\gamma}$ is nonperipheral, at least two of these $U_{i}$ contain points of $E$, say $\\vec{s}_{i}$ and $\\vec{s}_{j}$ and since $\\gamma$ cannot be chosen from $\\Gamma$, if $\\vec{s}$ is a common prefix with both $\\vec{s}_{i}$ and $\\vec{s}_{j}$, then we may assume without loss of generality that $U_{\\vec{s}}$ contains a point of $\\bar{V}$. By paying similar attention to $V$, we may choose such a $\\vec{s}$ such that the complement of $U_{\\vec{s}}$ contains at least two points of $\\bar{V}$, so that $\\bar{\\gamma}_{\\vec{s}}$ is nonperipheral as a cut of $E$ hence belongs to $\\Gamma_{E}$ and crosses $\\bar{\\gamma}$. This establishes the second property of pants decompositions. For the third, note that if a cut crosses $\\bar{\\gamma}_{\\vec{s}} \\in \\Gamma_{E}$, then every representation of that cut as $\\bar{\\gamma}$ for $\\gamma$ a cut in $\\mathcal{C}$ will cross $\\gamma_{\\vec{s}}$, so since $\\Gamma$ is a pants decomposition, the set of $\\bar{\\gamma}_{\\vec{s}}$ crossing a given cut $\\bar{\\gamma}$ not in $\\Gamma_{E}$ is finite, since it is contained in the finite set of cuts in $\\Gamma$ crossing $\\gamma$, even though a priori infinitely many choices of such a $\\gamma$ are possible.\n\nDefinition 20. If $\\Gamma$ is a pants decomposition, two cuts $\\gamma_{i}$ and $\\gamma_{j}$ of $\\Gamma$ are adjacent if there exists a cut $\\gamma$ in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ such that $\\gamma$ crosses $\\gamma_{i}$ and $\\gamma_{j}$ but no other cut in $\\Gamma$.\n\nThe adjacency graph of $\\Gamma$, written $A(\\Gamma)$, is the simplicial graph with vertex set $\\Gamma$, with an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding cuts $\\gamma_{i}$ and $\\gamma_{j}$ are adjacent in $\\Gamma$.\n\nBecause adjacency is preserved by isomorphisms, we have the following result.\nLemma 21. Suppose $\\Phi: \\mathcal{C}(E) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ is an isomorphism. Then for any pants decomposition $\\Gamma$ of $E, \\Phi(\\Gamma)$ is a pants decomposition of $E^{\\prime}$ and $\\Phi$ induces an isomorphism of graphs $A(\\Gamma) \\rightarrow A(\\Phi(\\Gamma))$.\n\nDefinition 22. A cut in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is said to be outermost if at least one component of the corresponding partition of $E$ contains exactly two points.\n\nLemma 23. Suppose that $E$ has at least seven elements. A cut $\\gamma$ in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ is outermost if and only if for each pants decomposition $\\Gamma$ of $E$ containing $\\gamma$, the vertex $\\gamma$ has at most valence two in $A(\\Gamma)$.\n\nNotice that the lemma is not true for $E$ having six points, the reason being that maximal simplices in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ are of dimension two in this case, each maximal simplex is a pants decomposition $\\Gamma$, and the graph $A(\\Gamma)$ is connected. Each such graph $A(\\Gamma)$ has three vertices, so each vertex of the graph has at most valence two, regardless of whether it is outermost, and there exist nonoutermost cuts in $E$ in this case. However, the corollary that we will derive from it, namely that isomorphisms of complexes of cuts send outermost cuts to outermost cuts, is still true for $E$ having between four and six elements; this is because either every cut is outermost (for four and five) or outermost cuts are distinguished in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ from others by their valence in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ (for six).\n\nProof. Suppose that $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ is a cut in $E$ which is not outermost. Then since $E$ has at least seven elements, we have that $U$ has at least three and $V$ at least four (up to swapping them). In particular $U$ contains a clopen subset $U^{\\prime}$ with at least two elements and $V$ contains disjoint clopen subsets $V^{\\prime}$ and $V^{\\prime \\prime}$ whose union is $V$ and for which each subset contains at least two elements. These sets yield cuts $\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2}$ and $\\gamma_{3}$. We claim that $\\gamma$ is adjacent to each of these cuts in some pants decomposition containing all four. Indeed, by definition, we may further divide $U^{\\prime}$ into clopen subsets $U^{\\prime+}$ and $U^{\\prime-}$ with at least one element, and one sees directly that $U^{\\prime+} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$ is half a cut which crosses $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_{1}$, and that by using the clopen complement of $U^{\\prime}$ in $U$ together with halves of $V^{\\prime}$ and $V^{\\prime \\prime}$, we can construct cuts that cross $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_{2}$ and cuts that cross $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_{3}$. By choosing these halves to be sides of cuts in our pants decomposition if necessary, we can show that these cuts cross only those elements, showing that $\\gamma$ is adjacent to $\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2}$ and $\\gamma_{3}$ as desired.\n\nNow suppose that $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ is outermost with $U$ containing two elements. Since $E$ contains at least seven elements, in any pants decomposition $\\Gamma$ of $E$ containing $\\gamma$, every cut $\\gamma_{n} \\in \\Gamma$ has a side $V_{n}$ contained in $V$. Moreover, we have that the poset of clopen subsets $V_{n}$ properly contained in $V$ has at most two maximal elements with respect to inclusion. Indeed, if it had three, say $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$ and $V_{3}$, then $V_{1} \\sqcup V_{2}$ would determine a cut compatible with every cut in $\\Gamma$, in contradiction to the assumption that $\\Gamma$ is a pants decomposition. Arguing as before, we can show that $\\gamma$ is adjacent to the cuts determined by $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ and no others.\n\nDefinition 24. A pair of cuts $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are said to form a peripheral pair if they are compatible and if, thinking of them as partitions $U \\sqcup V$ and $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$, one of the sets $U \\cap U^{\\prime}, U \\cap V^{\\prime}, V \\cap U^{\\prime}$ or $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$ is a singleton. Notice that since $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are compatible, after relabeling, we may assume that $U \\cap U^{\\prime}=\\varnothing$, from which it follows that the singleton must be $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$.\n\nObserve that in any pants decomposition $\\Gamma$ of $E$ containing the peripheral pair $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$, these cuts $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are adjacent in $\\Gamma$. The simplest example happens when $E$ is a set of five points, say $E=\\left\\{\\star, a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}\\right\\}$. One such peripheral pair has $\\gamma=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}\\right\\} \\sqcup\\left\\{\\star, b_{1}, b_{2}\\right\\}$ and $\\eta=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}\\right\\} \\sqcup\\left\\{\\star, a_{1}, a_{2}\\right\\}$. One requisite cut demonstrating adjacency is $\\kappa=\\left\\{a_{1}, b_{1}\\right\\} \\sqcup\\left\\{\\star, a_{2}, b_{2}\\right\\}$.\n\nWe have the following pair of lemmas.\nLemma 25. Suppose that $\\gamma$ is an outermost cut and that $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ form a peripheral pair. Then in any pants decomposition $\\Gamma$ containing $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$, we have that $\\gamma$ has valence one in $A(\\Gamma)$.\n\nProof. Indeed, suppose $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ is adjacent to $\\eta=U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$, where $U=\\{y, z\\}$ has size two and $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ form a peripheral pair. We may suppose that $U^{\\prime}=U \\sqcup\\{x\\}$. Suppose $\\gamma$ is adjacent to another cut $\\delta=U^{\\prime \\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime \\prime}$ in $\\Gamma$. Then without loss of generality $U^{\\prime} \\subset U^{\\prime \\prime}$. Both sides of any cut $\\kappa$ witnessing the adjacency of $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ must have nonempty intersection with $U$ and with $V$. The only nonperipheral choices for such a $\\kappa$ force one side of $\\kappa$ to be either $\\{x, y\\}$ or $\\{x, z\\}$, since any other choice produces a cut which crosses $\\eta$. But these choices produce cuts $\\kappa$ which fail to cross $\\delta$. This contradiction shows that $\\eta$ is the only cut in $\\Gamma$ to which $\\gamma$ is adjacent.\n\nDefinition 26. For a simplicial graph like $\\mathcal{C}(E)$, if $\\gamma$ is a vertex, we define the link $L(\\gamma)$ of $\\gamma$ to be the full or induced subgraph comprising those vertices of $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ which are adjacent to $\\gamma$, with an edge between two vertices of the link when the corresponding vertices of $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ are connected by an edge.\nDefinition 27. Given a simplicial graph $L(\\gamma)$, its opposite graph $L(\\gamma)^{\\perp}$ is the graph on the same vertex set but with an edge between vertices when there is no edge in $L(\\gamma)$.\n\nObserve that if $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ is a cut in $E$, we may form two new Stone spaces, namely $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$ and $V \\sqcup\\{U\\}$ by alternately collapsing all points in $V$ to a singleton or collapsing all points in $U$. Observe that every non-peripheral cut in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ compatible with $\\gamma$ yields a non-peripheral cut in one of these Stone spaces but not both, and conversely, every non-peripheral cut in one of these Stone spaces yields a cut in $E$ compatible with $\\gamma$. Indeed, it is not hard to see that $L(\\gamma)$ is isomorphic to the join of the graphs $\\mathcal{C}(U \\sqcup\\{V\\})$ and $\\mathcal{C}(V \\sqcup\\{U\\})$. If $\\gamma$ is not outermost, then both of these graphs are nonempty and we see that $L(\\gamma)^{\\perp}$ has two components.\n\nHere is some intuition. Imagine embedding $E$ into $S^{2}$ (this is, of course, possible if and only if $E$ is second countable) and realizing a cut $\\gamma$ as a Jordan curve (also called $\\gamma$ ) in $S^{2}-E$ which separates points of $U$ from those of $V$. The cut $\\gamma$ is peripheral if and only if one of the two components of $S^{2}-(E \\cup \\gamma)$ contains exactly one point of $E$ (i.e. is homeomorphic to an open annulus). Every cut in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ compatible with yet distinct from $\\gamma$ may be drawn on $S^{2}$ disjoint from $\\gamma$; thus it is contained in one of the two components of $S^{2}-(E \\cup \\gamma)$. One such component is homeomorphic to the complement in $S^{2}$ of the Stone space $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$, while the other is homeomorphic to the complement of $V \\sqcup\\{U\\}$. If $\\eta$ is a nonperipheral cut in $E$ compatible with $\\gamma$, it is a nonperipheral cut in one component of the complement and does not appear in the other.\n\nConversely, every nonperipheral cut in $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$ or $V \\sqcup\\{U\\}$ yields, under the homeomorphism of complements above, a nonperipheral cut in $E$ compatible with $\\gamma$. Nonperipheral cuts, recall, exist in every Stone space with at least four points, so $\\mathcal{C}(U \\sqcup\\{V\\})$, say, will be empty only when $U$ is a two-point set. Since one forms the join $\\Gamma \\star \\Gamma^{\\prime}$ of two graphs $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ by beginning with the disjoint union and connecting every vertex of $\\Gamma$ to every vertex of $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$, we have that $\\left(\\Gamma \\star \\Gamma^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\perp}=\\Gamma^{\\perp} \\sqcup \\Gamma^{\\prime \\perp}$, which has at least two connected components when $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ are nonempty. Indeed, in the case of $L(\\gamma)^{\\perp}$, this graph has exactly two components, since in every Stone space with at least four points, for any two compatible cuts it's easy to see there is a third which crosses both of them.\nLemma 28. Suppose that $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are compatible cuts but that neither $\\gamma$ nor $\\eta$ is outermost. Then we have that $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ form a peripheral pair if and only if the opposite graph of the full subgraph on the intersection of their links, that is, $(L(\\gamma) \\cap L(\\eta))^{\\perp}$, has two connected components.\n\nProof. From the foregoing discussion, we may think of a cut $\\delta$ in $L(\\gamma)$ as coming from a cut in one of the Stone spaces $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$ or $V \\sqcup\\{U\\}$, where $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$. If $\\delta$ also belongs to $L(\\eta)$, then $\\delta$ also corresponds to a cut in $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup\\left\\{V^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ or in $V^{\\prime} \\sqcup\\left\\{U^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Since $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are compatible, we may suppose that $U \\cap U^{\\prime}=\\varnothing$, or in other words, that there are no cuts in $L(\\gamma) \\cap L(\\eta)$ corresponding to cuts in both $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$ and $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup\\left\\{V^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. If $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ form a peripheral pair, if follows that $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$ is a one-point set, and that there is again no cut $\\delta$ which is distinct from $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ but which corresponds to a cut in both $V \\sqcup\\{U\\}$ and $V^{\\prime} \\sqcup\\left\\{U^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, while if $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ do not form a peripheral pair, there is such a cut $\\delta$.\n\nThe intuition of Jordan curves on $S^{2}$ is helpful again: a priori $(L(\\gamma) \\cap L(\\eta))^{\\perp}$ has a maximum of three components, one for each connected component of $S^{2}-(E \\cup \\gamma \\cup \\eta)$ when $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are compatible. If neither $\\gamma$ nor $\\eta$ is outermost, both $U \\sqcup\\{V\\}$ and $U^{\\prime} \\sqcup\\left\\{V^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ admit nonperipheral cuts, so there are at least two components in $(L(\\gamma) \\cap L(\\eta))^{\\perp}$. Assuming that $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$, that $\\eta=U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$, and that $U \\cap U^{\\prime}=\\varnothing$, cuts in the third complementary component of $S^{2}-(E \\cup \\gamma \\cup \\eta)$ correspond to cuts in the Stone space $\\left(V \\cap V^{\\prime}\\right) \\sqcup\\left\\{U, U^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. This space has nonperipheral cuts precisely when $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ do not form a peripheral pair. Therefore $(L(\\gamma) \\cap L(\\eta))^{\\perp}$ has two connected components if and only if the non-outermost cuts $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ form a peripheral pair.\n\nThe foregoing lemmas have the following corollary.\nCorollary 29. If $\\Phi: \\mathcal{C}(E) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ is an isomorphism of complexes of cuts, then $\\Phi$ sends peripheral pairs to peripheral pairs.\n\nWe need a slight strengthening of Lemma 28. If the cuts $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ are merely pairwise compatible, rather than a pants decomposition notice that we may still define an adjacency graph for these cuts.\n\nLemma 30. Suppose $E$ is second countable. Let $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ be pairwise compatible cuts. The graph $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ has at most $k+1$ components. Moreover, if it has exactly $k+1$ components, then the following statements hold:\n\n1. No cut $\\gamma_{i}$ is outermost.\n2. No pair $\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}$ is peripheral.\n3. For every triple $\\gamma_{i}=U_{i} \\sqcup V_{i}, \\gamma_{j}=U_{j} \\sqcup V_{j}, \\gamma_{k}=U_{k} \\sqcup V_{k}$, if the adjacency graph $A\\left(\\left\\{\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}\\right)$ is a triangle, then we may write each cut so that $U_{i} \\cap U_{j}=U_{i} \\cap U_{k}=U_{j} \\cap U_{k}=\\varnothing$, and moreover the triple intersection $V_{i} \\cap V_{j} \\cap V_{k}$ is nonempty.\n\nProof. Although the statement is likely true for Stone spaces which are not second countable, the proof is again more straightforward if one considers an embedding of $E$ in $S^{2}$. Then each of the cuts $\\gamma$ in $\\left\\{\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ may be represented by a Jordan curve in $S^{2}$. Compatibility says these curves may be drawn disjoint from each other, and the complement of $S^{2}$ minus these $k$ curves has $k+1$ components.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to see this is to form the graph dual to this system of Jordan curves on $S^{2}$. That is, place a vertex for each complementary component and connect components via an edge when they border the same curve. This graph is a tree, since $S^{2}$ is simply connected and any loop in the dual graph would be homotopically nontrivial in the surface. It is a standard fact that a tree with $k$ edges has $k+1$ vertices.\n\nSimilar to the case of one or two cuts, the closure of each component of $S^{2}-\\left(E \\cup \\gamma_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\gamma_{k}\\right)$ will contain an essential simple closed curve (which corresponds to a non-peripheral cut) provided it is not homeomorphic to a sphere with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components with $n+k \\leq 3$.\n\nTranslating this into the language of cuts, we see that if each complementary surface contains an essential simple closed curve, then $\\gamma_{i}$ cannot be outermost (for then one component of $\\left(S^{2}-E\\right)-\\gamma_{i}$ would be a disc with two punctures), no pair $\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}$ can be peripheral (this would yield a component which is a sphere with one puncture and two boundary components) and the third condition also holds: the adjacency graph is a triangle exactly when one component of $S^{2}-\\left\\{\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ is a sphere with three boundary components; that sphere corresponds to $V_{i} \\cap V_{j} \\cap V_{k}$, and is therefore a sphere with three boundary components in $\\left(S^{2}-E\\right)-\\left\\{\\gamma_{i}, \\gamma_{j}, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ when this triple intersection is empty.",

      "text": "# 3 Realizing Automorphisms \n\nWe prove one piece of Theorem 10 in the following slightly stronger form.\nTheorem 31. Suppose $\\Phi: \\mathcal{C}(E) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ is an isomorphism, where the spaces $E$ and $E^{\\prime}$ have at least four points and are second countable. Then there exists a homeomorphism $f: E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$ inducing the isomorphism $\\Phi$.\n\nFor use in the proof, we introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 32. A sphere in $E$ with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components: is a collection of $k$ pairwise-compatible non-peripheral cuts $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ in $E$, thought of as partitions $U_{1} \\sqcup V_{1}$ through $U_{k} \\sqcup V_{k}$ such that each $U_{i} \\cap U_{j}$ for $i$ and $j$ distinct is empty and the total intersection $V_{1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap V_{k}$ is a finite set of size $n \\geq 0$. The cuts $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ are said to be the boundary components of the sphere $S$, and the points of the total intersection are said to be punctures. A cut $\\gamma$ distinct from each of the $\\gamma_{i}$ is said to be in the interior of such a sphere $S$ is whenever a side of $\\gamma$ contains a point of $U_{i}$, it contains $U_{i}$ completely. Said another way, in this situation, one of the components of $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ corresponds to nonperipheral cuts in the Stone space $\\left(V_{1} \\cap \\cdots \\cap V_{k}\\right) \\sqcup\\left\\{U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{k}\\right\\}$; a cut $\\gamma$ is interior provided it corresponds to a nonperipheral cut in this Stone space.\n\nObserve that if $\\gamma$ is a cut in the interior of a sphere with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components, then $\\gamma$ may be thought of as dividing $S$ into two spheres $S^{\\prime}$ and $S^{\\prime \\prime}$ whose total number of punctures is $n$ and whose total number of boundary components is $k+2$.\n\nDefinition 33. A principal spherical exhaustion of $E$ is a collection of spheres $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots$ satisfying the following conditions.\n\n1. (Increasing) Each boundary component of $S_{i}$ is an interior cut in $S_{i+1}$.\n2. (Exhaustion) Each cut $\\gamma$ in $E$ is interior to some $S_{n}$.\n3. (Complexity) Each sphere formed from a boundary component of $S_{i}$ together with those from $S_{i+1}$, supposing it has $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components, satisfies $n+k \\geq 5$.\n4. (Infinite Complement) For each boundary component $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ of $S_{n}$ where $U$ is chosen in the notation as above, the clopen set $U$ is infinite.\n\nBy beginning with a pants decomposition of $E$ and forgetting certain pants curves, one sees that principal spherical exhaustions exist whenever $E$ is infinite and second countable. For each sphere $S_{i}$ in the exhaustion, let $\\bar{S}_{i}$ be a finite set with $n+k$ points, one for each puncture and boundary component of $S_{i}$. Then observe that there exist continuous maps $E \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ and $\\bar{S}_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ : for the former, one collapses each clopen set $U$ for each boundary component in $S_{i}$ to a single point; continuity follows because $U$ is clopen. The same argument works for the latter case by thinking of each boundary component of $S_{i}$ as yielding a clopen set in $\\bar{S}_{i+1}$. We have that for each $i$, the following triangle commutes\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nThe maps $\\bar{S}_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ form a directed system of finite discrete spaces, and we have the following lemmas.\n\nLemma 34. $E$ is canonically homeomorphic to the inverse limit of this system.\nProof. Indeed, by abstract nonsense, from the existence and compatibility of the maps $E \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$, we know that there exists a continuous map $\\Phi: E \\rightarrow \\lim _{\\rightarrow \\rightarrow \\infty} \\bar{S}_{i}$. Since $E$ and the inverse limit are compact and Hausdorff, it suffices to show that $\\Phi$ is a bijection.\n\nRecall that if $\\varphi_{i}: \\bar{S}_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ is the map above, a point of the inverse limit is a tuple $\\left(x_{i}\\right)$ in the product $\\prod_{i} \\bar{S}_{i}$ with the property that for each $i$, we have $\\varphi_{i}\\left(x_{i+1}\\right)=x_{i}$. If $\\left(x_{i}\\right)$ is such a sequence, we may think of it in $E$ as a choice, for each $i$, of a puncture or boundary component of $S_{i}$ with the compatibility property that the puncture or boundary component chosen at the $(i+1)$ st stage is contained in the boundary component chosen at the $i$ th stage (or equal to if the $i$ th choice is a puncture). This yields a chain of nonempty clopen subsets of $E$, say $U_{1} \\supset U_{2} \\supset \\cdots$. Any point in the total intersection of these sets will be mapped by $\\Phi$ to the sequence $\\left(x_{i}\\right)$, so the map $\\Phi$ is surjective. By the (Exhaustion) property, if $x \\neq y$ in $E$, every curve $\\gamma$ which separates $x$ from $y$ is interior to some $S_{i}$, and thus the $\\Phi$-images of $x$ and $y$ are distinct.\n\nLemma 35. Suppose that $E$ is infinite and second countable. If $\\Phi: \\mathcal{C}(E) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ is an isomorphism of complexes of cuts and $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots$ is a principal spherical exhaustion of $E$, the cuts comprising each sphere $S_{i}$ assemble into a sphere in $E^{\\prime}$ with the same number of punctures and boundary components. Moreover, these spheres are a principal spherical exhaustion $\\Phi\\left(S_{1}\\right), \\Phi\\left(S_{2}\\right), \\ldots$ of $E^{\\prime}$, which is also infinite and second countable.\n\nProof. The graphs $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ and $\\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ have the same cardinality, which is countably infinite just when $E$ (or $E^{\\prime}$ ) is infinite and second countable.\n\nWe claim that a collection $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ of pairwise-compatible cuts in $E$ is actually a sphere $S$ in $E$ with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components satisfying $n+k \\geq 4$ and the (Infinite Complement) hypothesis if and only if the following statements hold.\n\n1. The adjacency graph $A\\left(\\left\\{\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}\\right)$ is complete.\n2. $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ has $k+1$ components, exactly one of which is finite.\n3. If $k>1$, then for each cut $\\gamma_{i}=U_{i} \\sqcup V_{i}$, both $U_{i}$ and $V_{i}$ are infinite.\n\nEmbed $E$ in $S^{2}$ and realize $\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}$ by disjoint Jordan curves. It is straightforward to see that these cuts form a sphere with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components exactly when $S^{2}-\\left\\{\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of $k$ discs and a sphere with $k$ boundary components and the intersection of $E$ with the sphere component is a finite discrete set of size $n$. In this situation the adjacency graph is complete. Supposing further that this sphere satisfies (Infinite Complement), we see by Lemma 30 that $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ has $k+1$ components and that exactly one component is finite. When $k>2$, (Infinite Complement) moreover implies the third item above, while when $k=2$, we have a sphere with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components when it is the disc complements in $S^{2}$ which have infinitely many points of $E$. Therefore if we have a sphere, then the conditions above hold.\n\nSuppose now that the conditions above hold. It is clear that these conditions are sufficient when $k=1$, so suppose $k>1$. Since both $U_{i}$ and $V_{i}$ are infinite for each $\\gamma_{i}$, if we have a sphere system, it will satisfy (Infinite Complement). Drawing the cuts as Jordan curves on $S^{2}$, observe that the hypothesis on the adjacency graph implies that we have that $S^{2}-\\left\\{\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of $k$ discs and a sphere with $k$ boundary components. Since we assume one component of $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ is finite, the assumption that each $U_{i}$ and $V_{i}$ are infinite implies that that component must correspond to the sphere with $k$ boundary components. As we saw in the proof of Lemma 28, in order for $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ to have the full $k+1$ components, the closure of the component of $S^{2}-\\left(E \\cup \\gamma_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\gamma_{k}\\right)$ corresponding to this finite\n\ncomponent of the opposite graph must have an essential simple closed curve, which requires a total number of punctures and boundary components satisfying $n+k \\geq 4$.\n\nNow, each of the three conditions above is, one sees, preserved by $\\Phi$, so the image of a collection of cuts in $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ forming a sphere in $E$ with $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components is a sphere with $k$ boundary components. In fact, the quantity $n+k$ is preserved, since it can be read off of the dimension of the flag completion of the opposite graph of the finite component of $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ : we have $n+k-4$ is equal to that dimension.\n\nTherefore if $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots$ is a principal spherical exhaustion of $E$, we have spheres $\\Phi\\left(S_{1}\\right), \\Phi\\left(S_{2}\\right), \\ldots$ in $E^{\\prime}$. The properties (Increasing) and (Exhaustion) and (Complexity) are clearly preserved by $\\Phi$, and the lemma follows.\n\nProof of Theorem 31. Observe that the graphs $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ are finite if and only if $E$ is finite, so we may suppose that either both $E$ and $E^{\\prime}$ are finite or both are infinite.\n\nSuppose at first that $E$ and $E^{\\prime}$ are finite. Since the dimension of $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ as a simplicial complex is $|E|-4$ when $E \\geq 4$, we see that $|E|=\\left|E^{\\prime}\\right|$. We want to produce from $\\Phi$ a bijection $f: E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$ whose action on cuts agrees with $\\Phi$.\n\nIn the case when $|E|=\\left|E^{\\prime}\\right|=4$, the \"graphs\" $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ and $\\mathcal{C}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ are finite sets of three points, each of which corresponds, after choosing a basepoint $\\star$ in $E$ and $\\star^{\\prime}$ in $E^{\\prime}$ to a two-element set containing $\\star$ or $\\star^{\\prime}$, respectively. There is therefore a bijection of $E$ with $E^{\\prime}$ sending $\\star$ to $\\star^{\\prime}$ and the point $a$ making up, for example the cut $\\{\\star, a\\}$ to the element $a^{\\prime}$ making up the cut corresponding to $\\Phi\\left(\\left\\{\\star, a^{\\prime}\\right\\}\\right)$. Therefore the theorem holds for $E$ having size four; we therefore assume that $|E| \\geq 5$.\n\nLet $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ be outermost cuts which are not compatible, say $\\gamma=\\{a, b\\} \\sqcup(E-\\{a, b\\})$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}=\\{a, c\\} \\sqcup(E-\\{a, c\\})$, and consider the peripheral pair $\\delta=\\{b, c\\} \\sqcup(E-\\{b, c\\})$ and $\\eta=$ $\\{a, b, c\\} \\sqcup(E-\\{a, b, c\\})$. In fact, notice that $\\eta$ forms a peripheral pair with $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ as well.\n\nNow, because $\\Phi$ sends outermost cuts to outermost cuts and peripheral pairs to peripheral pairs and preserves compatibility, we conclude that $\\Phi(\\gamma)=\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup E^{\\prime}-\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, that $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup$ $E^{\\prime}-\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, that $\\Phi(\\eta)=\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup E^{\\prime}-\\left\\{a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ and therefore that $\\Phi(\\delta)=\\left\\{b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup E-\\left\\{b^{\\prime}, c^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. In other words, the pattern of intersection of $\\gamma, \\gamma^{\\prime}$ and $\\delta$ is faithfully preserved by $\\Phi$. Define, therefore, a map $f: E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$ by the rule that $f(a)=a^{\\prime}$, where $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ are outermost cuts such that the intersection of the smaller sides of $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ in $E$ is the singleton $\\{a\\}$ and whose $\\Phi$-images intersect in the singleton $\\left\\{a^{\\prime}\\right\\}$.\n\nObserve that this is well-defined independent of the choice of $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$. For indeed, if $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma_{1}^{\\prime}$ are two other cuts whose smaller sides intersect in $\\{a\\}$, observe that under $\\Phi$, the smaller sides of $\\Phi(\\gamma)$ and $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right)$ as well as $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ must intersect. In fact, the point of intersection must be $a^{\\prime}$ : if $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right)=\\left\\{b^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup\\left(E^{\\prime}-\\left\\{b^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\}\\right)$ and $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left\\{c^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\} \\sqcup\\left(E^{\\prime}-\\left\\{c^{\\prime}, a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\}\\right)$, notice that $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right)$ is compatible with $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)$, in contradiction to what is true of $\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\gamma^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe map $f$ must be injective and therefore a bijection: if $f(a)=f(b)$, we would have that the smaller sides of $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\Phi(\\delta)$ as well as the smaller sides of $\\Phi(\\gamma)$ and $\\Phi(\\delta)$ intersect in the same point, namely $f(a)=f(b)$. But from this, we must conclude that $\\Phi\\left(\\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi(\\delta)$, since otherwise we would have that $f(c)$ is not well-defined. This contradicts the fact that $\\Phi$ is an isomorphism.\n\nIndeed, we see from the construction of $f$ and the proof that it is injective that in fact the push-forward action of $f$ on cuts agrees with $\\Phi$.\n\nSo much for the finite case. Suppose that $E$ is infinite and second countable. Then $E^{\\prime}$ is as well. Let $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots$ be a principal spherical exhaustion of $E$. By Lemma 35 , the boundary cuts of each sphere assemble into a principal spherical exhaustion $\\Phi\\left(S_{1}\\right), \\Phi\\left(S_{2}\\right), \\ldots$\n\nConsider $S_{i+1}$ and choose a boundary component of $S_{i}$; it divides $S_{i+1}$ into two spheres. By (Complexity) if this sphere $S^{\\prime}$ has $n$ punctures and $k$ boundary components, we have $n+k \\geq 5$. If $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{k}$ are the \"outer sides\" of the boundary components of this sphere, Consider the space $\\bar{S}^{i}$ formed from $E$ by collapsing each of these $U_{i}$ to a point. This is a finite discrete space of size $n+k$. The same is true for $\\overline{\\Phi\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)}$. If $K^{\\perp}$ is the finite component of $\\left(L\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$, the\n\naction of $\\Phi$ restricts to an isomorphism between $K=\\left(K^{\\perp}\\right)^{\\perp}$ and $\\Phi(K)$, the opposite graph of the finite component of $\\left(L\\left(\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cap \\cdots \\cap L\\left(\\Phi\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$.\n\nThe graph $K$ is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\bar{S}^{\\prime}\\right)$, as $\\Phi(K)$ is to $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\overline{\\Phi\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)$. By the finite case, the isomorphism $\\left.\\Phi\\right|_{K}: K \\rightarrow \\Phi(K)$ is induced by a bijection $\\varphi^{\\prime}: \\bar{S}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Phi\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)}$.\n\nIndeed, a similar story holds true for each $S_{i}$ directly-namely, there is a bijection $\\varphi_{i}: \\bar{S}_{i} \\rightarrow$ $\\overline{\\Phi\\left(S_{i}\\right)}$ inducing the isomorphism of finite components. We claim that the maps $\\varphi_{i}$ are compatible with the restrictions $\\bar{S}_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ in the sense that the following diagrams commute\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nConsider the collection of cuts formed by the boundary components of $S_{i+1}$ and $S_{i}$, and let $A$ denote the adjacency graph of these cuts. By Lemma 30, the subgraph comprising the boundary components of $S_{i}$ is complete, as is each of the subgraphs comprising one of the spheres $S^{\\prime}$ as above. Since by (Complexity) each boundary component of $S_{i}$ divides $S_{i+1}$ into two spheres, the corresponding vertex of $A$ is a cut vertex-removing it disconnects the graph into two components. In fact, one may argue directly that after replacing each of these vertices with two vertices, the graph $A$ is a disjoint union of $k+1$ complete graphs, where $k$ is the number of boundary components of $S_{i}$. Similarly one may argue that $L^{\\perp}$, the opposite graph of the intersection of links, has $k+1$ finite components, one corresponding to $S_{i}$, and $k$ corresponding to the boundary components of $S_{i}$. Each component of the cut vertex decomposition of $A$ corresponds uniquely to a finite component of $L^{\\perp}$.\n\nLet $\\pi$ denote the map $\\bar{S}_{i+1} \\rightarrow \\bar{S}_{i}$ and the map $\\overline{\\Phi\\left(S_{i+1}\\right)} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Phi\\left(S_{i}\\right)}$. This map is \"the identity\" on punctures in the domain which come from punctures in the range. Otherwise, if $x$ is a puncture or boundary component in the domain which does not come from a puncture in the range, there is a unique boundary component in the range whose \"outer side\" contains $x$, and the map $\\pi$ picks the point corresponding to that \"outer side\".\n\nThe maps $\\varphi_{i}$ and $\\varphi_{i+1}$ send points corresponding to boundary components to points corresponding to boundary components and thus points corresponding to punctures to punctures. Moreover, $\\Phi$ and thus $\\varphi_{i+1}$ preserves the properties of $A$ and $L^{\\perp}$ discussed above, so arguing as in the finite case, we see that the diagram above commutes.\n\nSince by Lemma 34 , the spaces $E$ and $E^{\\prime}$ are inverse limits of these principal spherical exhaustions and we have bijections $\\varphi_{i}$ which are compatible with the restriction maps, these bijections assemble into a homeomorphism $\\varphi: E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$. By the (Exhaustion) property, the agreement of the action of $\\varphi$ with $\\Phi$ on each cut may be checked in some finite sphere, so follows from the finite case.",

      "text": "# 4 Faithfulness of the Action \n\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 10, we need to show that Homeo $(E)$ acts faithfully on $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ when $E$ has at least five elements. This, together with the foregoing theorem, shows that the map Homeo $(E) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$ is a continuous bijective homomorphism. To show that it is an isomorphism of topological groups, we need to know that the map is open.\n\nOne way to show this latter property is to say that if $K \\subset U$ is compact and $U$ is open, there exists a finite collection $G=\\left\\{\\gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{k}\\right\\}$ of vertices of $\\mathcal{C}(E)$ such that $V(K, U)$ contains $\\operatorname{Stab}(G)$; that is, if $f \\in \\operatorname{Homeo}(E)$ maps $K$ into $U$, then actually the action of $f$ on cuts fixes each $\\gamma_{i}$ as well.\n\nSeeing that Homeo $(E)$ acts faithfully is not hard: supposing that $f \\in \\operatorname{Homeo}(E)$ is not the identity but acts by the identity on $\\mathcal{C}(E)$, there exists some $x \\in E$ such that $f(x) \\neq x$. Because $E$ has at least five elements, there exist compatible non-peripheral cuts $\\gamma=U \\sqcup V$ and $\\eta=U^{\\prime} \\sqcup V^{\\prime}$ with the following properties:\n\n1. $x \\in U$ and $f(x) \\in U^{\\prime}$.\n2. $U \\cap U^{\\prime}=\\varnothing$,\n3. $V \\cap V^{\\prime} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nBecause $f(x) \\neq x$, we have that if $f(\\gamma)=\\gamma$ and $f(\\eta)=\\eta$, then in fact $f(U)=V$ and similarly $f\\left(V^{\\prime}\\right)=U^{\\prime}$, hence $f\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$ and $f(V)=U$. But this is impossible, since $U \\cap U^{\\prime}$ is empty while $V \\cap V^{\\prime}$ is not.\n\nProof of Theorem 10. By the remarks above, we have that Homeo $(E) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$ is continuous and bijective. By Lemma 36 below, it is also open, hence a homeomorphism. (When $E$ is finite, we have a continuous bijection between discrete (finite) groups, which is clearly a homeomorphism.)\n\nLemma 36. Suppose that $E$ is second countable and infinite. If $K$ is compact and $U$ is clopen such that $K \\subset U$, there exists a finite subset $G \\subset \\mathcal{C}$ such that $V(K, U)$ in Homeo $(E)$ contains $\\operatorname{Stab}(G)$.\n\nProof. Since $K$ is compact, we may cover it with finitely many disjoint clopen sets $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n}$. We may assume that these sets lie within $U$. Each of the sets $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{n}$ and $\\bigcup_{i} U_{i}$ (which we may assume without loss by shrinking $U$ is actually $U$ ) is half of a cut in $E$, but not all of these cuts are non-peripheral. Considering only those cuts which are non-peripheral, we see we have a sphere $S$ in $E$. When the complexity of this sphere is at least 5 , we claim that if an element $f$ of Homeo $(E)$ fixes each boundary cut of $S$ and each interior cut of $S$, then $f \\in V(K, U)$. (Indeed, some smaller finite number of cuts should suffice, but we have no need for optimality.)\n\nTo see this, note that if $f$ fixes each boundary cut of $S$, it clearly descends to an automorphism of the interior cuts in $S$, hence a permutation of the set of punctures and boundary components of $S$. Since the total number of these is at least five, we have by the faithfulness of the action that the permutation induced by $f$ is trivial. It follows that $f \\in V(K, U)$, for $f$ must send each $U_{i}$, which corresponds either to a puncture or a boundary component of $S$, to itself, hence clearly inside $U$.\n\nSupposing that $S$ has smaller complexity, we need to add additional cuts in order to guarantee that $f \\in V(K, U)$. If $K$ is infinite, we may simply choose a finer collection of disjoint clopen sets $U_{i}$ in order to make the complexity of the sphere grow. If $K$ (and without loss of generality $U$ ) is finite, add for each point of $K$ a peripheral pair. Any element of Homeo $(E)$ fixing the peripheral pair, we have seen, fixes the point. Repeating for each point of $K$, we conclude.",
