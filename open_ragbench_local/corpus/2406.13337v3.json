To our knowledge, our Vietnamese real-world dataset is the largest spoken NER dataset in the world regarding the number of entity types, featuring 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we present baseline results using various state-of-the-art pre-trained models: encoder-only and sequence-to-sequence; and conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis. We found that pre-trained multilingual models generally outperform monolingual models on reference text and ASR output and encoders outperform sequence-to-sequence models in NER tasks. By translating the transcripts, the dataset can also be utilised for text NER in the medical domain in other languages than Vietnamese. All code, data and models are publicly available ${ }^{1}$.",

      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) targets extracting named entities (NE) from text and categorizing them into types like person, location, organization, etc. Initially studied in written language, recent attention has turned to study spoken NER (Cohn et al., 2019; Shon et al., 2022), which aims to extract semantic information from speech. However, spoken NER has limited literature compared to NER on written text data (Yadav et al., 2020).\n\nSpoken NER is particularly challenging, firstly due to the impact of word segmentation on results. The medical vocabulary poses difficulties with numerous confused monosyllabic and polysyllabic words. For instance, the word \"\u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\" alone could\n\n[^0]denote \"sugar\" (chemical), \"street\" (location), or be part of a compound word like \"\u0111\u01b0\u1eddng ti\u00eau h\u00f3a\" - \"gastrointestinal\" (anatomy). This confusion has also been reported in Chinese spoken NER by Chen et al. (2022). Further, data quality control and annotation consistency have been problematic, with some entities tagged in one sentence but not in others, and full NEs inconsistently tagged as multiple sub-NEs (Huyen and Luong, 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018, 2020; Truong et al., 2021). Finally, obtaining accurate medical NER from natural speech is challenging due to the lack of punctuation (Ertop\u00e7u et al., 2017), speech disfluencies (Kim and Woodland, 2000), context, and the complexity of medical terms.\n\nAs for the medical domain, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset available for medical spoken NER. The only related work we found, (Cohn et al., 2019), published a NER evaluation benchmark using an English general-domain conversational dataset, Switchboard (Godfrey et al., 1992) and Fisher (Cieri et al., 2004), for the task of audio de-identification specifically targeting Personal Health Identifiers.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce VietMedNER, a medical spoken NER dataset built on the real-world medical Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset VietMed (Le-Duc, 2024), featuring 18 medically-defined entity types. In the era of the advanced in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-level text-to-speech technologies, the dataset, with entity positional labels maintained during translation, is applicable not only to Vietnamese but also to other languages (see Appendix C). This enables various real-world applications, including: search engines (R\u00fcd et al., 2011), content classification for news providers (Kumaran and Allan, 2004), medical ASR error correction (Mani et al., 2020), audio\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/ master/VietMed-NER\n\nde-identification (Cohn et al., 2019) and content recommendation systems (Koperski et al., 2017).\n\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\n- We present VietMed-NER - the first publiclyavailable medical spoken NER dataset.\n- We present baselines on several state-of-theart pre-trained models\n- We conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis for medical spoken NER in Vietnamese\n\nAll code, data and models are published online ${ }^{1}$.",

      "text": "## 2 Related Works\n\nTraditionally, spoken NER has been done using a pipeline methodology, also known as cascaded approach, starting with an ASR stage, followed by NER applied to the generated transcriptions (Jannet et al., 2017; Benaicha et al., 2024). Another variant of the cascaded approach involves embedding specific entity expressions into the lexicon, thereby improving the language model's ability to accurately recognize these expressions (Hatmi et al., 2013).\n\nBesides, end-to-end NER has recently garnered some attention within the research community. This approach seeks to optimize ASR and NER processes simultaneously, offering a potentially more efficient alternative to traditional pipeline methods by harnessing the ability of trainable acoustic features. However, its accuracy advantage over the cascaded approach remains a subject of debate, and the end-to-end training setup introduces additional complexity (Tomashenko et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2020).",

We annotate the Vietnamese version with the methodology described in Section 3.2 and automatically translate the transcripts to English together with transferring the NE annotation.",

      "text": "### 3.2 Annotation Process\n\nThe annotation of medical NEs from real-world speech is challenging because of the missing punctuation, special characters and capitalized words in ASR transcripts, disfluencies and required medical knowledge. Entirely manual annotation of NEs like in VLSP dataset (Huyen and Luong, 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018, 2020) and PhoNER_COVID19 (Truong et al., 2021) requires a large number of working hours, not to mention the difficulties in quality control and inconsistency as we found in their corpora. These inconsistencies include: i) Some entities tagged in one sentence are not tagged in another sentence, and ii) Full NEs are inconsistently tagged as multiple sub-NEs. The best approach to tag nested NEs is the subject of ongoing debate (Muis and Lu, 2017; Li et al., 2021a). For simplicity, higher consistency and to reduce the annotation effort, we only annotate the largest and outermost full entity span.\n\nMoreover, using fine-tuned models for pretagging doesn't apply to specific medical entity types. Similarly, using prompt engineering with large language models like GPT-4 for pre-tagging did not achieve acceptable accuracy. Training a seed model with a gazetteer list requires initial training time, subsequent repetitive training schedules, and may prove unreliable due to its statistical reliance on a small amount of low-resource data (Kozareva, 2006).\n\nTo tackle these problems, we conduct a humanmachine annotation approach, as described below:\n\n1. Annotate and categorize a set of initial entities, then add them to a gazetteer list.\n2. Sort entities by character length from highest to lowest, to distinguish between sub-NEs and full NEs, ensuring full NEs are mapped before sub-NEs. Time complexity $=O(k \\cdot \\log (k))$ where $k$ is the number of NEs. For example, \"tooth pain\" should be mapped before \"pain\".\n3. Automatically map entities from the gazetteer list to the transcript. Time complexity $=O(m \\cdot$ $n$ ), where $m$ is the number of NEs in gazeeter list, $n$ is the number of sentences. Pseudo code:\n\n```\nfor NE in gazetteer_list:\n    for sen in sentences:\n        if NE in sen:\n            annotate(NE, sen)\n```\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Entity definition and its statistics in our dataset. \"Uni.\" means the number of unique entities.\n4. Annotators review each sentence to include correctly labeled NEs and ignore mislabeled NEs\n5. Annotators add new NEs not in the gazetteer list during manual annotation. Steps 2 and 3 generate pre-tagged labels in the next sentences. Annotators repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the entire corpus is annotated.\n\nWe experience faster annotation by allowing annotators to foresee possible NEs in upcoming utterances based on previously annotated ones. Annotators can accept or reject these suggestions, saving time with correct suggestions and easily ignoring incorrect ones. Unlike training a seed model with a gazetteer, which requires initial training time and may be unreliable for low-to-mid resource languages, our method avoids these issues and eliminates the need to correct incorrect NEs.",

The pre-trained multilingual model XLM-R_large achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.74 on reference text and 0.58 on ASR output, while XLM$R_{\\text {_base }}$ performed worse than PhoBERT_base-v2. This gap is explained by the larger pre-training data (2.5TB multilingual data for XLM-R vs. 140GB monolingual data for PhoBERT_base-v2). Our results with PhoBERT_base-v2 and XLM-R_large confirmed that pre-trained multilingual representations improve performance on medical spoken NER tasks, similar to other language-specific downstream tasks by Conneau et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2020). However, multilingual models may face a Transfer-dilution Trade-off (Conneau et al., 2020), where they lack the capacity to learn effective multilingual representations. In other words, for a fixed sized model, the per-language performance decreases as we increase the number of languages (Gurgurov et al., 2024). To address this trade-off, multilingual models should possess sufficient capacity, necessitating an adequately large model size (Chen and Chen, 2024). This is evident in the performance comparison between PhoBERT_base-v2 and XLM-R_base, as seen in other language-specific downstream tasks by Conneau et al. (2020); Arivazhagan et al. (2019).\n2.

      "text": "### 6.2 Qualitative\n\nA common error was confusion between LOCATION and ORGANIZATION, due to the inherent ambiguity where the same entity can function as either depending on context. An organization-related entity may be labelled as LOCATION if it implies a patient visited there, but this inference requires external knowledge about the entity. Another confusion involved DRUGCHEMICAL and FOODDRINK. Both categories share similar names, descriptors, and consumption contexts (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, sugar). Insufficient context length often causes errors, especially with ambiguous terms like \"vitamin,\" \"cordyceps,\" or \"sea daffodils,\" which can refer to both supplements and nutrients depending on context. Another case is DIAGNOSTICS,\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Scatter plot of NER results on ASR output by entity types using various pre-trained language models and evaluation variants, created by Tables 25-44.\n\nTREATMENT, and SURGERY. For example, a \"biopsy\" can be both a diagnostic and treatment, while \"radiation therapy\" may be linked to surgery.\n\nA common error in NER involves incorrect entity spans, which fall into two types: (1) correct label but wrong span, and (2) wrong label but correct span. The first type often occurs with multi-word entities in the medical domain, like ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, or DISEASESYMPTOM. For example, \"high blood pressure\" (BDISEASESYMPTOM, I-DISEASESYMPTOM, I-DISEASESYMPTOM) may be misrecognized as \"high blood\" (B-DISEASESYMPTOM, IDISEASESYMPTOM, O), keeping the meaning but shortening the span. The second type occurs when compound-word entities are split, such as \"vagina cells\" (B-ORGAN, I-ORGAN) being misrecognized as \"vagina\" and \"cells\" (B-ORGAN, B-ORGAN).",

Our dataset contains 18 entity types, including both conventional and newly defined entity types for real-world medical conversations. Our results show that pre-trained multilingual models typically outperform monolingual models on both reference text and ASR output if the multilingual models are sufficiently large to learn multilingual representations. Additionally, encoders generally demonstrate better performance than seq2seq models in the NER task. Finally, while pre-trained audio data impacts ASR output, it does not significantly impact NER performance in the cascaded setting.",

      "text": "## 8 Limitations\n\nOur annotation approach: Our annotation approach has some advantages over the fully manual approach. First, it allows annotators to not spend extra time tagging the entities that have been tagged in previous sentences. Second, it prevents that annotators miss entities that have been tagged in previous sentences, improving the consistency of the entire dataset. During our work, we experienced a faster annotation by using our approach compared to fully manual annotation. However, in the scope of this paper, we have not done extensive experiments to give a quantitative number of how much time has been saved and the method's impact on annotation quality.\nEvaluation metrics for medical terms: ASR system performance is commonly evaluated using WER, which quantifies the ratio of word insertion, substitution, and deletion errors in a transcript relative to the total number of spoken words. However, various spoken language understanding tasks, such as spoken NER, rely on accurately identifying key terms within transcripts. In medical ASR, it is critical to account for the disproportionate importance of medical terms in doctor-patient interactions, as they hold significantly more weight than general vocabulary, as discussed in Section B in the Appendix. We believe that other domainspecific spoken NER tasks follow a similar pattern. Consequently, future comprehensive investigations into evaluation metrics are needed to determine the most appropriate metric for spoken NER in the medical and other domains.",

      "text": "## General rules:\n\n- If 2 or more entities overlap, label the resulting entity as the longest, including overlapping component entities. In other words, a full NE might contain 2 or more sub-NEs. A full NE should be tagged instead of multiple sub-NEs. For example: \"b\u00e1c s\u0129 x\u01b0\u01a1ng kh\u1edbp\" (orthopedic doctor) should be tagged as a whole instead of 2 distinct NEs \"b\u00e1c s\u0129 \" (doctor) and \"x\u01b0\u01a1ng kh\u1edbp\" (orthopedic).\n- We adhere to the conventional approach of annotating overlapping NE components as a whole, utilizing the BIO encoding scheme. In recent years, research on overlapping and discontinuous NER has introduced alternative annotation frameworks to solve NE overlapping, such as BILOU encoding, which represents \"Beginning, Inside, and Last tokens of multi-token chunks, Unit-length chunks, and Outside\" (Strakov\u00e1 et al., 2019; Duan et al., 2017). Another approach by Li et al. (2021b) introduces a novel span-based model capable of jointly recognizing both overlapping and discontinuous entities. The model operates in two primary stages. First, entity fragments are identified by systematically traversing all possible text spans, enabling the detection of overlapping entities. Second, a relation classification step determines whether a given pair of entity fragments exhibits an overlapping or successive relationship. This approach facilitates the recognition of discontinuous entities while simultaneously verifying overlapping entities.\n- Do not assign spaces at the beginning and at the end of entities.\n- All words in the ASR transcript are lowercase, without punctuations and special characters. Treat every word as lowercase or uppercase, with or without punctuations and special characters based on the context of each utterance.\n- Each utterance should be treated as an independent utterance. The additional context given by other utterances should not influence the annotation of each utterance.",

However, various spoken language understanding tasks, such as spoken NER, depend on identifying keywords in transcripts. Moreover, it's essential to recognize that in medical ASR, medical terms carry much higher significance in doctor-patient conversations and should not be treated equally to regular words. KER is often used to evaluate on keywords but is not a directly comparable metric with WER.\n\nThe purpose to introduce NEER aims to bridge the gap between WER and KER. However, it is not intended to replace WER or KER as a standard metric for evaluating domain-specific ASR performance. Instead, NEER serves as a complementary metric, facilitating a more in-depth analysis of ASR errors in specific domains, such as the medical field.",

We hypothesize that employing many-shot learning, extending the context length of instructions, and more advanced LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-4o) could yield even more enhanced results.\n\nRecent research in text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved human-level performance in aspects such as naturalness and emotional expressiveness (Tan et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Consequently, the application of TTS to translated NER transcripts could generate realistic audio data, facilitating further research in additional languages.",

This involves computing precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide insights into the model performance at both an individual label level (per entity) and across all labels (overall).\n\nWe introduce a \"dummy\" token strategy to replace the actual NEs. This approach upholds the focus on the classification of entities rather than the extraction of verbatim phrases, which is suitable for cases where ASR errors might skew the recognition of entities in spoken transcripts.\n\nLet's take an example:\n\n- Reference text: \"I have a tooth pain\"\n- BIO encoding of reference text: [0, 0, 0, B-DISEASESYMTOM, IDISEASESYMTOM]\n- ASR output: \"Has teeth pain\"\n- BIO encoding of ASR output: [0, B-DISEASESYMTOM, IDISEASESYMTOM]\n\nIn the SLUE toolkit, the format (NE type, NE) is used to compare reference text and ASR output, e.g. (DISEASESYMTOM, \"tooth pain\") and (DISEASESYMTOM, \"teeth pain\"). This format gives an F1 score of 0.0 although entity type is correctly recognized. In our \"dummy\" token strategy, we modify the format as (NE type, \"dummy\"), turning reference text and ASR output to (DISEASESYMTOM, \"dummy\") and (DISEASESYMTOM, \"dummy\") respectively. The modified format gives a correct F1 score of 1.0 .\n\n[^0]We compute two types of overall metrics: micro and macro averages. The micro average metrics aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric, while the macro average computes per-entity type metrics and averages them, without considering the frequency of each entity type. The micro average is therefore influenced by the class distribution and will be dominated by the performance on more frequent entity types. In contrast, macro averages treat all entity types equally, providing a measure of the system's performance across different types of NEs, regardless of their frequency in the dataset.\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval\n    ${ }^{3}$ https://github.com/asappresearch/slue-toolkit",

  "abstract": "Spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract named entities from\nspeech and categorise them into types like person, location, organization, etc.\nIn this work, we present VietMed-NER - the first spoken NER dataset in the\nmedical domain. To our knowledge, our Vietnamese real-world dataset is the\nlargest spoken NER dataset in the world regarding the number of entity types,\nfeaturing 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we present baseline results using\nvarious state-of-the-art pre-trained models: encoder-only and\nsequence-to-sequence; and conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis.\nWe found that pre-trained multilingual models generally outperform monolingual\nmodels on reference text and ASR output and encoders outperform\nsequence-to-sequence models in NER tasks. By translating the transcripts, the\ndataset can also be utilised for text NER in the medical domain in other\nlanguages than Vietnamese. All code, data and models are publicly available:\nhttps://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/VietMed-NER.",
