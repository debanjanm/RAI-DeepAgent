And, if this is the case, can one indicate a rate of decay? Of particular interest is whether there is polynomial decay, that is, whether there exists some $\\alpha>0$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{q}(g \\nu)\\right|=O\\left(\\frac{1}{|q|^{\\alpha}}\\right)$. If such an $\\alpha$ does exist, it is an even more challenging problem to try and evaluate it more precisely.\n\nBeyond intrinsic interest, such estimates are known to have many applications in various fields. This includes e.g. the uniqueness problem in harmonic analysis [38], the study of normal numbers [20], spectral theory of transfer operators [35], and the fractal uncertainty principle [14], to name just a few examples. We refer to Lyons's survey [39] for an overview on the Rajchman property, and to Mattila's book [40] for a general introduction to the role of Fourier analysis in geometric measure theory. The very recent survey of Sahlsten [49] contains a broad account of recent results and breakthroughs in the context of dynamically defined measures, which are the focus of our work. More specifically, in this paper we will study the Fourier decay problem for self-conformal measures on the plane; let us now recall their definition.\n\nWe first define self-conformal sets. Let $\\Phi=\\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{n}\\right\\}$ be an IFS, an abbreviation for Iterated Function System, defined on $\\mathbb{C}$ (for us working in $\\mathbb{C}$ or in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ makes little difference). We assume each $f_{i} \\in \\Phi$ is a strict injective contraction of the closure of an open set $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$. In this paper we always assume every $f_{i}$ is $C^{\\omega}(D)$, though IFSs that are only $C^{\\alpha}$ smooth, $\\alpha \\geq 1$, are also of great interest. Under these assumptions, there is a unique compact set $\\emptyset \\neq K=K_{\\Phi} \\subseteq D$ so that\n\n$$\nK=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}(K)\n$$\n\nWe call $K$ the attractor of $\\Phi$ or the self-conformal set corresponding to $\\Phi$. We always assume that $K$ is infinite; to this end, it suffices to suppose the fixed point of $f_{i}$ is not the same as the fixed point of $f_{j}$ for two elements in $\\Phi$. This will thus be always assumed throughout the paper. We call the IFS $\\Phi$ uniformly contracting if\n\n$$\n0<\\inf \\left\\{\\left|f^{\\prime}(x)\\right|: f \\in \\Phi, x \\in D\\right\\} \\leq \\sup \\left\\{\\left|f^{\\prime}(x)\\right|: f \\in \\Phi, x \\in D\\right\\}<1\n$$\n\nWe proceed to define the coding map. Let $\\mathcal{A}=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, and let $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. For any $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ let\n\n$$\nf_{\\omega \\mid m}:=f_{\\omega_{1}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{\\omega_{m}}\n$$\n\nLet us prefix some point $x_{0} \\in \\bar{D}$. The coding map $\\pi$ is the surjective map $\\pi: \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\rightarrow K$ defined as\n\n$$\n\\omega \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\mapsto x_{\\omega}:=\\lim _{m \\rightarrow \\infty} f_{\\omega \\mid m}\\left(x_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now define self-conformal measures. Let $\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}\\right)$ be a probability vector; in particular, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}=1$, and we always assume each $p_{i}>0$. We will denote $\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}\\right)$ by $\\mathbf{p}$. Next, we define the infinite product measure $\\mathbb{P}=\\mathbf{p}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ on $\\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. The projected measure $\\nu=\\nu_{\\mathbf{p}}=\\pi \\mathbb{P}$ onto $K$ is called the self conformal measure corresponding to $\\mathbf{p}$. The assumptions that $K$ is infinite and $\\mathbf{p}$ is strictly positive ensure that $\\nu$ is non-atomic. Alternatively, $\\nu_{\\mathbf{p}}$ can be defined as the unique Borel probability measure supported on $K$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} \\cdot f_{i} \\nu\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{i} \\nu$ is the push-forward of $\\nu$ by the map $f_{i}$. In the special case when every $f_{i}$ is affine, $\\Phi$ is called a self-similar IFS. In this case we call $\\nu$ a self-similar measure.\n\nWe are now in position to state the main result of this paper. We say that a $C^{r}$ IFS $\\Phi$ is conjugate to an IFS $\\Psi$ if they are the same up to a $C^{r}$ change of coordinates; that is, if $\\Phi=\\left\\{h \\circ g \\circ h^{-1}\\right\\}_{g \\in \\Psi}$ where $h$ is a $C^{r}$ diffeomorphism.\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let $\\Phi$ be a uniformly contracting $C^{\\omega}(D)$ IFS, defined on the closure of the unit disc $D=\\overline{B_{1}(0)}$. Assume:\n\n1. $\\Phi$ is not conjugate to a self-similar IFS; and\n2. $K_{\\Phi}$ is not a subset of an analytic planar curve.\n\nThen for every self-conformal measure $\\nu$ there exist $\\alpha=\\alpha(\\nu)$ and $C=C(\\nu)>0$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{q}(\\nu)\\right| \\leq C \\cdot \\frac{1}{|q|^{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nBefore putting Theorem 1.1 in the context of recent research, let us first discuss its various assumptions.\n\n1. Regarding the domain, recall that such IFSs may be defined more generally on the closure of an open set, whereas we restrict ourselves to IFSs defined on closed discs. This is done for technical convenience as the proof is already quite involved even in this case. It is likely that by combining our technique with that of Leclerc [33] (specifically, his use of the Koebe 1/4-Theorem) one can significantly relax this assumption, at least to the closure of a simply connected domain. This seems to be the minimal requirement since at several points in the proof we require the existence of branches of $\\log f^{\\prime}$ for certain diffeomorphisms $f$, e.g. in Claim 2.2.\n\n2. The assumption that $\\Phi$ is not conjugate to self-similar is formally necessary since the conjugating map may be affine, in which case the result might be false, see [47]. Nonetheless, in dimension 1 it is known that a strictly convex $C^{2}$ image of a self-similar measure always has polynomial decay (this was proved in increasing generality by Kaufman [31], MosqueraShmerkin [42], and in the general case independently by Algom-Chang-Wu-Wu [2] and BakerBanaji [8]). Thus, in dimension 1 it is known that just having one non-affine map in a $C^{\\omega}$ IFS suffices for polynomial decay $[4,8,2]$. In the plane, the only currently known version of Kaufman's Theorem [31] is for homogeneous (equicontractive) self-similar IFSs, due to Mosquera-Olivo [41]. If this result could be extended to all irreducible self-similar measures (i.e. those that don't live on hyperplanes) then we can replace assumption (1) in Theorem 1.1 with the assumption that $\\Phi$ contains a non-affine map, similarly to the one dimensional case. In fact, after we completed this paper we became aware of an on-going project by Banaji and Yu [12] that aims to study such higher dimensional versions of Kaufman's Theorem.\n3. The assumption that $K_{\\Phi}$ is not a subset of an analytic planar curve is also formally necessary, since the conclusion of Theorem 1.1 clearly fails if $K_{\\Phi}$ belongs to a hyperplane. However, in the presence of some curvature the situation becomes much more interesting. Here, following the initial work of Orponen [45], there have been several papers [19, 21, 46] that prove quantitative Fourier decay estimates on average for (not necessarily dynamically defined) measures supported on such curves; however, we are not aware of such examples where pointwise estimates have been established.\n\nLet us now place Theorem 1.1 within current literature. It is a planar counterpart of recent results obtained simultaneously by the authors and Baker-Sahlsten [4, 10] for IFSs on the line. Prior work on the Fourier decay problem had always assumed some additional algebraic, dynamical, or fractal geometric assumptions, and $[4,10]$ were essentially the first results to achieve polynomial decay (and spectral gap that we discuss in the next section) in a stripped down axiomatic setting. Previous related results include the work of Jordan-Sahlsten [29] about invariant measures for the Gauss map; Bourgain-Dyatlov [14] and Khalil [32] for some Patterson-Sullivan measures; the various works by Li $[35,34]$ about Furstenberg measures; the work of Sahlsten-Stevens [50, Theorem 1.1] about a class of stationary measures with respect to non-linear $C^{\\omega}(\\mathbb{R})$ IFSs with strong separation (that is, the union (1) is disjoint); and, it improved our previous result [3, Theorem 1.1] by improving the decay rate from logarithmic to polynomial. We do note that $[4,10]$ say nothing about selfsimilar measures, which is an important case. For recent progress on decay for self-similar measures we refer to $[18,52,59,5,42,16,17,57,47]$ and references therein.\n\nTheorem 1.1 also has counterparts in higher dimensions. With the exception of the very recent work of Baker-Khalil-Sahlsten [9], these results all prove polynomial decay in various more specialized algebraic or geometric settings. We remark that a version Theorem 1.1 for Gibbs measures projected to the attractor assuming only a positive Lyapunov exponent would give a unified proof of many of these results; this is left for future research. Now, Li-Naud-Pan [36] extended the results of Bourgain-Dyatlov [14] for limits of general Kleinian Schottky groups. This was later further generalized by Baker-Khalil-Sahlsten [9], relaying only on additive methods rather than on sum-product estimates. Leclerc, building on the methods of Sahlsten-Stevens and Oh-Winter [44], proved polynomial decay for Juila sets for hyperbolic rational maps of $\\hat{\\mathbb{C}}$. We note that Theorem 1.1 has non-trivial yet non-full overlap with virtually all of these results; and, if the Gibbs-version previously alluded to can be established then it would formally cover all of them. Very recently, Baker-Khalil-Sahlsten [9, Theorems 1.14 and 1.17] obtained polynomial decay for certain stationary measures on self-conformal IFSs, also in higher dimensions. Some of their assumptions are less restrictive than ours, e.g. they only ask that the IFS be $C^{2}$ and can treat the more general class of\n\nGibbs measures; but some are more restrictive, e.g. they require the underlying IFS to be strongly separated and that the measures be affinely non-concentrated (see e.g. [58]). The paper [9] also contains results regarding Fourier decay for carpet like non-conformal IFSs; these seem to have no formal relations with Theorem 1.1.\n\nFinally, we briefly survey some known results about Fourier decay for self-similar and selfaffine measures in higher dimensions. This includes the work of Li-Sahlsten [37] and Solomyak [53] for self-affine measures, the work of Rapaport [47] classifying those self-similar measures that are Rajchman, and the work of Varj\u00fa about poly-logarithmic decay of self-similar measures discussed in [49]. Baker-Khalil-Sahlsten [9] recently obtained new examples of self-similar measures with poly-logarithmic decay assuming certain Diophantine conditions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 1.2 Spectral gap via a cocycle version of a technique of Oh-Winter, and the $C^{2}$ case \n\nThe key step towards Theorem 1.1 is the proof of a spectral gap type estimate for the derivative cocycle. This result, which is the main technical result of our paper, is of intrinsic interest due to the many applications it has. In our case, we will use it to show that certain random walks that arise by re-normalizing the derivative cocycle equidistribute exponentially fast towards an absolutely continuous measure (Theorem 3.1); this is the key step towards Theorem 1.1. More precisely, our spectral gap estimate (Theorem 2.7) implies a renewal theorem with exponential speed (Proposition 3.3) in the spirit of Li [35], and it is this result that leads to the desired equidistribution result Theorem 3.1. The proof of Fourier decay given Theorem 3.1 is similar to [5, 4]; and the proof of Theorem 3.1 given the renewal Theorem with exponential speed is similar to e.g. the work of Li-Sahlsten [37] or to our work [4]. So, we focus our attention in this sketch on the proof of the spectral gap, which is our chief innovation.\n\nOur strategy is adapted, in general terms, from our one dimensional paper [4]. However, there are deep changes due to the higher dimensional setup. Thus, it would be instructive to first briefly recall our method from [4].\n\nSo, assuming say condition (1) of Theorem 1.1 holds for a one dimensional real-analytic IFS, we aimed to prove spectral gap (Theorem 2.7) for the transfer operator defined by the norm derivative cocycle and $\\mathbf{p}$ ((9) and Definition 2.3). This is based on Dolgopyat's method [22, 24] as originally brought into the setting of self-conformal sets by Naud [43], see also [56, 55, 6, 7, 11]. However, given our stripped down setting, we were met with three main obstacles: the union (1) may not correspond to a Markov partition; the doubling (Federer) property might not be satisfied by the measure $\\nu$; and that $\\Phi$ must the satisfy Dolgopyat's (UNI) condition, see Claim 2.2). We note that condition (1) suffices to ensure that (UNI) does indeed hold, which follows from our discussion in [3]. The other obstructions are, however, much more substantial.\n\nTo get around them, we introduced a cocycle version of Dolgopyat's method: we wrote $\\nu$ as an integral over a certain family of random measures, and re-wrote the transfer operator as a corresponding weighted sum over smaller parts of itself. This was based upon a technique from [1], though it had been used in several previous papers with various goal in mind [27, 30, 48, 54]. Here, these measures exhibit some stationary behaviour, have strong separation in an appropriate sense, and have the doubling property. The (UNI) condition was satisfied by all the different pieces of the transfer operator in this decomposition, which was critically important. We were thus able to run Naud's version of Dolgopyat's method by \"jumping\" between the various conditional measures (hence the term \"cocycle\").\n\nIn the present paper a major departure from [4] is that now the derivative cocycle comprises of the norm cocycle (9) (as before) but also of an angle cocycle (10). In particular, the transfer\n\noperator, in Definition 2.3, also takes the angle into account, and \"couples\" the two cocycles. To prove spectral gap we rely on the analysis of Oh-Winter [44] that was done for certain Julia sets. However, we are again faced with the lack of a Markov partition and the lack of the Federer property for $\\nu$. Furthermore, we also require what Oh-Winter refer to as the NCP (non-concentration property), see e.g. Theorem 2.4 Part (6), which is a type of UNI but for the angle cocycle. It is not hard to show that the set $K_{\\Phi}$ satisfies this condition due to assumption (2) in Theorem 1.1.\n\nTo get around these issues we construct conditional measures and disintegrate the transfer operator accordingly. As the NCP for the angle cocycle plays a crucial role for the spectral gap argument, we must preserve it into every corresponding part of the transfer operator, while not losing separation or (UNI), which is non-trivial. The construction of these random measures and pieces takes place in the first few subsections of Section 2. After a standard $L^{2}$ reduction, the spectral gap result is reduced to the construction of certain Dolgopyat operators (Lemma 2.8). Its proof, in Section 2.5, which is the heart of the technical work in this paper, is a cocycle version of a method of Oh-Winter [44, Sections 5.3 - 5.5].\n\nFinally, let us discuss our $C^{\\omega}$ assumption compared with the $C^{2}$ assumptions we make in [4]. The issue is that to run the Oh-Winter proof scheme, that is, to obtain spectral gap, one requires something a-priori stronger than UNI. Namely, that a certain coupling of the norm and the angle cocycles defines a local diffeomorphism from small balls in $D$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}$; and, that moreover the $C^{2}$ norm of this map can be made uniform across the disc. This is Lemma 2.15, which critically uses the Cauchy-Riemann equations to derive information about the angle from information about the norm. While we believe the general outcome of Theorem 1.1 should follow if one assumes the outcome of this Lemma in the $C^{2}$ case, we do not see how to deduce it simply from a non-linearity condition as in the 1-dimensional case.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Spectral gap\n### 2.1 Some notations and conventions\n\nThroughout this paper we denote by $C^{\\omega}(D)$ the family of holomorphic functions on $D$, where $D$ is the closure of the unit disc. Often, we will work with real valued functions, in which case the gradient of $h: \\mathbb{C}=\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ will be denoted by $\\nabla h: \\mathbb{C}=\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. The Euclidean norm on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ will be denoted by $|\\cdot|$. We remark that occasionally we will consider complex valued functions that may not be holomorphic.

However, there are some non-trivial new subtleties, so we proceed with care. We remind the reader of our assumptions: $\\Phi$ is not conjugate to a self-similar IFS, and $K_{\\Phi}$ is not a subset of an analytic planar curve.\n\nProof. In this proof we work with branches of the complex $\\log f^{\\prime}$ defined on $D$ for certain diffeomorphisms $f$. They exists here since $D=\\widehat{B_{1}(0)}$ by our assumption.\n\nFix some $x_{0} \\in D$. For every $\\xi \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ we define a function $f_{\\xi}: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ via\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\xi}=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\log f_{\\xi \\mid n}^{\\prime}(x)-\\log f_{\\xi \\mid n}^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right), \\text { where } \\bar{\\xi}:=\\left(\\ldots . \\xi_{n-1}, \\ldots, \\xi_{2}, \\xi_{1}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{A}^{-\\mathbb{N}}\n$$\n\nJust to be clear, $f_{\\xi \\mid n}=f_{\\xi_{n}} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{\\xi_{1}}$. Let us first discuss the properties of this function. Similarly to the argument in [3, Claim 2.13], it is readily shown that for every $\\xi \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$,\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{a * \\xi}=\\log f_{a}^{\\prime}+\\varphi_{\\xi} \\circ f_{a}+c_{a * \\xi}\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" denotes concatenation of words (or of a word with a sequence), and $c_{a * \\xi} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is some constant. We also note that $\\varphi_{\\xi} \\in C^{\\omega}(D)$ and that the association $\\xi \\mapsto \\varphi_{\\xi}$ is continuous. Finally, we remark for future use that the definition of $\\varphi_{\\xi}$ coincides with the definition given in [3, Claim 2.13] when $\\xi$ is periodic (up to the removing the bar from $\\bar{\\xi}$ in its definition).\n\nWe next claim that there exist some $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and some $x_{1} \\in K$ such that\n\n$$\n\\Re\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\Im\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nIndeed, suppose towards a contradiction that this is not the case. Notice that\n\n$$\nx \\mapsto \\Re\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\Im\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right)(x)\n$$\n\nis an harmonic function, as it is equal to\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\Im\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right)(x)\n$$\n\nSo, our assumption towards a contradiction implies that $K$ lies on a level set (corresponding to the value 0 ) of this harmonic function. Since we are assuming that this is not the case, we conclude that for every $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$\n\n$$\n\\Im\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right)(x) \\equiv 0 \\text { on } D\n$$\n\nThis in turn implies that the holomorphic function $\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}{ }^{2}$ is a constant real number for every $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Thus, $\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}$ is an affine map for every such pair of parameters.\n\nOur next step is to show that this affine map is actually identically zero. Indeed, let $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and let $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Applying (6) twice, we see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\varphi_{a * \\xi}=\\log f_{a}^{\\prime}+\\varphi_{\\xi} \\circ f_{a}+c_{a * \\xi}, \\text { and } \\\\\n\\varphi_{a * \\zeta}=\\log f_{a}^{\\prime}+\\varphi_{\\zeta} \\circ f_{a}+c_{a * \\zeta}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{a * \\xi}-\\varphi_{a * \\zeta}=\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right) \\circ f_{a}+d_{\\xi, \\zeta, a}, \\text { where } d_{\\xi, \\zeta, a} \\in \\mathbb{C}\n$$\n\nNow, by our assumption there exists some $f_{a} \\in \\Phi$ that is not affine. Therefore, as $\\varphi_{a * \\xi}-\\varphi_{a * \\zeta}$ is affine, $\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}$ must be constant. Since both maps have a common zero at $x_{0}$ we conclude that this constant is 0 .\n\nThus, our assumption towards a contradiction has led us to conclude that for every $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\xi}=\\varphi_{\\zeta}\n$$\n\nThis is in particular true for 1-periodic elements. Thus, we may now argue as in [3, Claim 2.13] that the IFS $\\Phi$ is $C^{\\omega}$ conjugate to a $C^{\\omega}$ linear $\\Psi$ IFS, i.e., one such that $g^{\\prime \\prime}=0$ on its attractor\n\n$K_{\\Psi}$ for $g \\in \\Psi$. Since $\\Psi$ is $C^{\\omega}$ this forces $\\Psi$ to be self-similar. We thus see that $\\Phi$ is conjugate to self-similar, contradicting our assumptions.\n\nSo, we have shown that there exist some $\\xi, \\zeta \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and some $x_{1} \\in K$ such that\n\n$$\n\\Re\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\Im\\left(\\left(\\varphi_{\\xi}-\\varphi_{\\zeta}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nThus, there are $c^{\\prime}>0, x_{1} \\in K$ such that for all $n$ there are words $\\alpha=\\left.\\bar{\\xi}\\right|_{n}, \\beta=\\left.\\bar{\\zeta}\\right|_{n} \\in \\mathcal{A}^{n}$ such that\n\n$$\nc^{\\prime}<\\left|\\nabla\\left(\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\log \\left|f_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right|\n$$\n\nNote that here we are taking the usual forward composition when considering $\\alpha, \\beta$.

Moreover, the measure $\\nu$ is a self-conformal measure w.r.t $\\Phi^{N}$ and the corresponding probability vector $\\mathbf{p}^{N}$ on $\\mathcal{A}^{N}$. Therefore, by Claim 2.1, moving to an induced IFS $\\Phi^{N}$ for a suitable $N$, we may assume that already in our IFS $\\Phi$ there maps $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}, f_{4} \\in \\Phi$ such that:\n\n1.

The (free) semigroup $G$ that is generated by $\\left\\{f_{a}: 1 \\leq a \\leq n\\right\\}$ acts on $D$ by composition in the obvious way. We define the norm (derivative) cocycle $c: G \\times D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ via\n\n$$\nc(I, x)=-\\log \\left|f_{I}^{\\prime}(x)\\right|\n$$\n\nand the angle (derivative) cocycle $\\theta: G \\times D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ via\n\n$$\n\\theta(I, x)=\\arg \\left(f_{I}^{\\prime}(x)\\right) \\in \\mathbb{T}\n$$\n\nThus for all $x \\in D$ and $i \\in \\mathcal{A}$ we have\n\n$$\nf_{i}^{\\prime}(x)=e^{-c(i, x)+i \\theta(i, x)}\n$$\n\nWe can now define the transfer operator. Note that it differs from the one we use in [4, Definition 2.3], since the angle cocycle plays a role here as well.

There is an integer $N>0$, some $A>1$ and some $0<\\alpha<1$ such that for every $s=a+i b, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ where $|a|$ is small and $|b|+|\\ell|$ is large:\n\nFor all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ there is a finite set of bounded operators $\\left\\{N_{s, \\ell}^{J}\\right\\}_{J \\in \\mathcal{E}_{s, \\ell, \\omega}}$ on the space $C^{1}(D)$ satisfying:\n\n1.

The idea is that Lemma 2.8 implies the following $L^{2}$ contraction statement in Proposition 2.9. This Proposition, in turn, is known to imply Theorem 2.7: The proof that Proposition 2.9 implies Theorem 2.7 is similar to the corresponding argument in [4, Section 2.3]. The proof that Lemma 2.8 implies Proposition 2.9 is also similar to the one in [4, Section 2.4]. We thus omit the details.\n\nProposition 2.9. Suppose the assumptions of Theorem 2.7 are met. There exist $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and some $0<\\alpha<1$ so that for $s=a+i b$ where $|a|$ is small enough and $|b|+|\\ell|$ is large enough that satisfy: For all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\int\\left|P_{s, \\ell, \\omega, n N} W\\right|^{2} d \\mu_{\\sigma^{n N} \\omega} \\leq \\alpha^{n}\n$$\n\nfor every $W \\in C^{1}(D)$ such that $\\|W\\|_{(|b|+|\\ell|)} \\leq 1$.\nWe note that this is a randomized analogue of [44, Theorem 2.7] in Oh-Winter, the proof of which they attribute to Ruelle.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 2.5 Proof of Lemma 2.8\n### 2.5.1 Some preliminary Lemmas\n\nIn this Section we collect a few results that will be used in the proof of Lemma 2.8. Fix the model given by Theorem 2.4, and let us use freely its notations. First, we require the following standard covering result:\n\nLemma 2.10. For every $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ and every $\\epsilon>0$ there exist $q=q(\\omega, \\epsilon) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ points $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{q} \\in K_{\\omega}$ such that:\n\n1. $K_{\\omega} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^{q} B_{50 \\epsilon}\\left(x_{i}\\right)$.\n2. If $i \\neq j$ then $B_{10 \\epsilon}\\left(x_{i}\\right) \\cap B_{10 \\epsilon}\\left(x_{j}\\right)=\\emptyset$.\n\nProof. This follows a Vitali covering argument, see e.g. [25, Section 1.3] or [44, Section 5.3].\nWe also record the following useful and elementary Lemma. We use the notation $D^{\\prime}$ given by (11).\n\nLemma 2.11. (A-priori bounds) For some $C_{1}>0$, for all $|a|$ small enough and $|b|+|\\ell|$ large enough, for every $f \\in C^{1}(D)$, if $s=a+i b$, for all integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ell$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\nabla\\left(P_{s, \\ell}^{n} f\\right)\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leq C_{1}(|b|+|\\ell|) \\cdot\\left\\|P_{a}^{n} f\\right\\|_{\\infty}+\\rho^{n}\\left\\|P_{a}^{n}(|\\nabla f|)\\right\\|_{\\infty}, \\text { and also } \\\\\n\\left\\|\\nabla\\left(P_{s, \\ell, \\omega, n} f\\right)\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leq C_{1}(|b|+|\\ell|) \\cdot\\left\\|P_{a, \\omega, n} f\\right\\|_{\\infty}+\\rho^{n}\\left\\|P_{a, \\omega, n}(|\\nabla f|)\\right\\|_{\\infty}, \\text { for every } \\omega\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for some $C_{6}>0$, for every two integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ell$ and $s=a+i b$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|P_{s, \\ell}^{n}\\right\\|\\left\\|_{b|+|\\ell|} \\leq C_{6} \\cdot e^{n D^{\\prime}|a|}\\right.\n$$\n\nThis is similar to [4, Lemma 2.11] and [44, Lemma 5.1], so we omit the details.\nNext, we define cylinders inside our model construction:\nDefinition 2.12. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. For every $u \\in X_{n}^{(\\omega)}$ we define the corresponding cylinder via\n\n$$\nC_{u}:=f_{u_{1}}^{(\\omega_{1})} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{u_{n}}^{(\\omega_{n})}(D) \\subseteq D\n$$\n\nLet us now fix $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ for the subsequent discussion. We will be careful though to derive estimates that are uniform across all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Now, note that\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\omega}\\left(C_{u}\\right)=\\mu_{\\omega}\\left(f_{u_{1}}^{(\\omega_{1})} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{u_{n}}^{(\\omega_{n})}(D)\\right)=\\eta^{(\\omega)}\\left(\\left[u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{n}\\right]\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{p}_{u_{i}}^{(\\omega_{i})}\n$$\n\nIndeed, this follows Theorem 2.4 Part (4), the definition of $\\mu_{\\omega}$, and by (12).\nWe denote the diameter of a cylinder set by $\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|$. The following is similar to [43, Lemma 6.1]:\nLemma 2.13. For some $C>0$ and some $0<r_{1}, r_{2}<1$ that are uniform in $\\omega$, for every two nesting cylinders $C_{\\alpha} \\subseteq C_{\\beta}$ we have\n\n$$\nC^{-1} r_{1}^{|\\alpha|-|\\beta|} \\leq\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right| /\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right| \\leq C \\cdot r_{2}^{|\\alpha|-|\\beta|}\n$$\n\nProof. Put $\\alpha=\\beta * u$ assuming $|u|=|\\alpha|-|\\beta|$. Then, by (3) for some $x_{1} \\in D$\n\n$$\n\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|=\\left|f_{\\beta} \\circ f_{u}(D)\\right| \\leq\\left|f_{\\beta}^{\\prime} \\circ f_{u}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\cdot f_{u}^{\\prime}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right| \\cdot 2\n$$\n\nSimilarly, by (3), for some $y_{1}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right|=\\left|f_{\\beta}(D)\\right| \\leq\\left|f_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\left(y_{1}\\right)\\right| \\cdot 2\n$$\n\nIn addition, by Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives,\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{\\alpha}^{\\prime}(0)\\right| \\leq\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|, \\text { and }\\left|f_{\\beta}^{\\prime}(0)\\right| \\leq\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right|\n$$\n\nIndeed, invoking Cauchy's formula for the map $g(x)=f_{\\alpha}(x)-f_{\\alpha}(0)$ we obtain\n\n$$\nf_{\\alpha}^{\\prime}(0)=g^{\\prime}(0)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\int_{\\partial D} \\frac{g(z)}{z^{2}} d z\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{\\alpha}^{\\prime}(0)\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\cdot \\operatorname{length}(\\partial D) \\cdot \\sup _{z \\in \\partial D}|g(z)| \\leq\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|\n$$\n\nNote the use of the relation $g(x)=f_{\\alpha}(x)-f_{\\alpha}(0)$ in the last inequality.\nRecall the definition of $L$ from (4). So, since $f_{\\beta}$ is a composition of functions from $\\Phi$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot L^{-1}\\left(\\min _{i \\in I, f \\in \\Phi^{(i)}} \\min _{x \\in D}\\left|f_{i}^{\\prime}(x)\\right|\\right)^{|u|} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot L^{-1} \\cdot\\left|f_{u}^{\\prime}(0)\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|}{\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right|} \\leq 2 \\cdot L \\cdot\\left|f_{u}^{\\prime}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right| \\leq 2 \\cdot L \\cdot \\rho^{|u|}\n$$\n\nas claimed.\nWe also require the following Lemma.\nLemma 2.14. There is some uniform constant $B_{1}$ so that for every $x \\in K_{\\omega}$ and every $r>0$, there is a cylinder $C_{\\alpha}=f_{\\alpha}(D)$ so that\n\n$$\nC_{\\alpha} \\subseteq B_{r}(x) \\text { and we have } B_{1} r \\leq\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|\n$$\n\nProof. Let $C_{\\alpha}$ be a cylinder such that $x \\in C_{\\alpha} \\subseteq B_{r}(x)$, where $|\\alpha|$ is assumed to be minimal. Since $x \\in K_{\\omega}$ such a cylinder does indeed exist. Now put $C_{\\alpha} \\subseteq C_{\\beta}$ where $|\\beta|=|\\alpha|-1$. By the minimality of $|\\alpha|$ it is impossible that $C_{\\beta}$ is a subset of $B_{r}(x)$, and thus $\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right| \\geq r$. Invoking Lemma 2.13 we thus see that\n\n$$\nC^{-1} r_{1} r \\leq C^{-1} r_{1}\\left|C_{\\beta}\\right| \\leq\\left|C_{\\alpha}\\right|\n$$\n\nas claimed.\nFinally, we require the following Lemma, which is a version of [44, Lemma 3.2]. It is a reformulation on the (UNI) condition. For a $C^{1} \\operatorname{map} h$ regarded as a map $\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ we define its $C^{1}$ norm $\\|h\\|_{C^{1}}$ as $\\|h\\|_{\\infty}+\\|\\nabla h(u)\\|_{\\infty}$, usually restricted to $D$. We define its $C^{2}$ norm as the maximum of its $C^{1}$ norm and the supremum of $X^{2} h$ as $X$ ranges over all unit tangent vectors.\n\nLemma 2.15. (Reformulation of UNI) Let $m^{\\prime}, m>0$ and $N_{0} \\geq 0$ be such that for all $N \\geq N_{0}$, for every $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ there exist $\\alpha_{1}^{N}, \\alpha_{2}^{N} \\in X_{N}^{(\\omega)}$ such that\n\n$$\nm \\leq\\left|\\nabla\\left(\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)(x)\\right| \\leq m^{\\prime}, \\quad \\text { for all } x \\in D\n$$\n\nThen there exists some $\\delta_{2}>0$ such that for all $N \\geq N_{0}$, the map\n\n$$\nT_{N}:=\\left(\\left(\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right),\\left(\\arg f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}-\\arg f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right): D \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{T}\n$$\n\nis a local diffeomorphism satisfying $\\left\\|T_{N}\\right\\|_{C^{2}}<\\frac{1}{2 \\delta_{2}}$ and\n\n$$\n\\inf _{u \\in D}\\left|\\nabla T_{N}(u) \\cdot v\\right| \\geq \\delta_{2} \\cdot|v|, \\quad \\forall v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\n$$\n\nNote that the existence of the parameters as in (20) follows from Claim 2.2.\n\nProof. Let $\\alpha_{1}^{N}, \\alpha_{2}^{N} \\in X_{N}^{(\\omega)}$ be as in the statement of the Lemma. Then $h=f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime} / f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}$ is holomorphic. Furthermore, we can write\n\n$$\nh=\\exp \\left(\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|+i\\left(\\arg f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}-\\arg f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy $(20)$,\n\n$$\n(\\log h)^{\\prime} \\neq 0 \\text { on } D\n$$\n\nThus, for every $x \\in D$ the map $\\log h$ defines a local diffeomorphism from a neighbourhood of $x$ to some open subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Furthermore, we have global estimates about the Jacobian of $T_{N}$ since $\\log h$ is holomorphic and so\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det} \\nabla T_{N}=\\left|\\frac{d}{d x} \\log h\\right|^{2}=\\left|\\nabla\\left(\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{1}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\log \\left|f_{\\alpha_{2}^{N}}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)(x)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nWe can now simply apply (20).\nAs for the $C^{2}$ norm, we use a compactness argument: Let us denote the function $h$ as above by $h_{N, \\omega}$. Let\n\n$$\ns_{\\omega}:=\\sup _{N}\\left\\|\\log h_{N, \\omega}\\right\\|_{C^{2}}\n$$\n\nThen there exists a subsequence $N_{k}$ such that $\\left\\|\\log h_{N_{k}, \\omega}\\right\\|_{C^{2}} \\rightarrow s_{\\omega}$. Note that ${ }^{1} s_{\\omega}<\\infty$ for all $\\omega$ since the family of homomorphic functions $\\log h_{N_{k}, \\omega}$ is pre-compact by (20). This also implies that there exists a holomorphic function $H_{\\omega}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|H_{\\omega}\\right\\|_{C^{2}}=s_{\\omega}, \\quad \\text { and } \\sqrt{m} \\leq\\left|H_{\\omega}^{\\prime}(x)\\right| \\leq \\sqrt{m^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nFinally, let\n\n$$\nS=\\sup _{\\omega} s_{\\omega}\n$$\n\nThen there exists a subsequence $N_{\\ell}$ such that $s_{\\omega_{\\ell}} \\rightarrow S$. By (22) there is a further subsequence $N_{\\ell_{k}}$ such that $\\left\\|H_{\\omega_{N_{\\ell_{k}}}}\\right\\|_{C^{2}} \\rightarrow S$. Since the family $\\left\\{H_{\\omega}\\right\\}_{\\omega \\in \\Omega}$ is precompact by (22), there exists a holomorphic function $H$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|H\\|_{C^{2}}=S\n$$\n\nUnfolding the definition of $S$ we get the assertion about the $C^{2}$ norm, and the Lemma follows.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# 2.5.2 Construction of the Dolgopyat operators \n\nFix $\\omega$ and let $s=a+i b \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

Let $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be sufficiently large in the sense of Lemma 2.15; more conditions on the minimal length of $N$ will be given later.

In this paper will use it to derive an equidistribution result for the derivative cocycle (made up from (9) and (10)). Morally, it means that, if done correctly, a coupling of the re-centred norm cocycle with the angle cocycle equidistributes towards an absolutely continuous on $J \\times \\mathbb{T}$ where $J \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is some interval. This result will be instrumental when proving the Fourier decay bound from Theorem 1.1.

We also note that this is a conformal and smooth version of a result of Li-Sahlsten [37, Proposition 3.7] for self-affine IFSs.\n\nFor the proof, the main ingredient is a renewal Theorem with exponential speed, that we prove in the next subsection. In fact, once this result is established, one can derive Theorem 3.1 by what are nowadays standard arguments. Such arguments are originally due to Li [35], and have subsequently appeared in $[4,37,35,38]$, to name just a few examples. So, after our renewal Theorem is done (Section 3.1), we will discuss the only part that is different here compared with [4, proof of Theorem 4.1], which is the residue process. This discussion takes place in Section 3.2.

Out of all of our work in the previous Sections, we will only make essential use of the equidistribution Theorem 3.1.

Fix the constant $\\epsilon>0$ from Theorem 3.1 (the size of the strip where we have spectral gap in Theorem 2.7).

Its proof is similar to that of [5, Lemma 2.3].

These bounds depend implicitly on $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\Phi$. Also, we ignore global multiplicative constants, omitting big- $O$ notations.\n\nLinearization: For all $\\beta \\in(0,1)$ (that is up to us to choose),\n\n$$\n|q| e^{-\\left(k+\\frac{k \\epsilon}{18}\\right)-\\beta \\frac{k \\epsilon}{18}}\n$$\n\nEquidistribution:\n\n$$\ne^{-\\frac{i k}{2}}\\left(|q| \\cdot e^{-k}\\right)^{8}\n$$\n\nOscillatory integral: For all $r>0$\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r|q| e^{-\\left(k+\\frac{i k}{18}\\right)}}+\\sup _{y} \\nu\\left(B_{r}(y)\\right)\n$$\n\nChoice of parameters Given $|q|$ we pick $k=k(q)$ so that\n\n$$\n|q|=e^{k+\\frac{k_{0}}{17}}\n$$\n\nAlso, let $r=e^{-\\frac{k_{0}}{1000}}$ and pick $\\beta=\\frac{1}{2}$.
