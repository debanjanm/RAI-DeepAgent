When these individuals exhibit heterogeneous preferences, they can be grouped to reduce bias. Whilst current practice consists of fitting Plackett-Luce models separately for each group, there might be some commonalities between different groups of individuals, such that separate estimation implies a loss of information. We propose an extension of the Plackett-Luce model, the Sparse Fused Plackett-Luce model, that allows for joint learning from such heterogeneous rank data, whereby information from different groups is utilised to achieve better model performance. The observed rankings can be considered a function of variables pertaining to the ranked objects. As such, we allow for these types of variables, where information on the coefficients is shared across groups. Moreover, sparsity is imposed on the coefficients to improve interpretability, point estimation and prediction of the model. Simulations studies indicate competitive performance of the proposed method compared to alternative approaches. Usage and interpretation of the method is illustrated on a sweet potato consumer preference application.

Nevertheless, its origin lies in psychology, with the introduction of the law of comparative judgements by Thurstone (1927). This seminal paper has led to the rise of a wide variety of statistical models that aim to aggregate rankings made by individuals into a single ranking that corresponds to the underlying worth of the ranked objects. Aside from the Thurstonian model, some well-known models are the Babington Smith (Babington Smith, 1950), Bradley-Terry (Bradley \\& Terry, 1952), Mallows (Mallows, 1957) and Plackett-Luce (Luce, 1959; Plackett, 1975) models. In this article, the Plackett-Luce model is further explored, as it lends itself naturally to the statistical modelling of partial rankings, which is the type of data that we focus on.\n\nThe Plackett-Luce model is a so-called multistage model (Marden, 1996) and a generalisation of the Bradley Terry model for pairwise comparisons. It assumes that a ranking arises from a sequential process, where an individual assigns a rank to their preferred object before a lesspreferred object. As such, the most preferred object is ranked first, and their least preferred object is ranked last automatically, as no other objects are available for ranking. A worth parameter is estimated for each object, where objects with a higher worth are ranked higher.\n\nGiven that the model is approaching its 50 -year anniversary, a plethora of extensions have been proposed. A brief selection of these are: top- $k$ rankings (Caron et al., 2014), mixtures of Plackett-Luce models (Gormley \\& Murphy, 2006), object-variables (Cheng et al., 2010; Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al., 2020), penalised worths (Jeon \\& Choi, 2018) and time-varying worths (Hol\u00fd \\& Zouhar, 2022).\n\nEven though the Plackett-Luce model is broadly applicable to preference data, given its ability to handle partial preferences, its performance can be suboptimal in some scenarios. The scenario we will consider here is one where multiple groups of individuals exist within the data. Typically, real world data is not homogeneous: not all observations within the data are expected to originate from the same distribution. Concerning preference data, the data might comprise multiple known groups of individuals, where more or less similar preference patterns can be found within groups, but where the preference patterns differ between groups. Differing preference patterns frequently occur in, for example, marketing, where the practice of market segmentation aims to divide a potential consumer base into subgroups of consumers, based on some features (or preferences) of these consumers (Denizci Guillet \\& Kucukusta, 2016). When these groups are known, typically through substantive knowledge from previous research or experiments, or when interest in a specific grouping exists, a different model can be fitted for each group, thereby avoiding the bias that arises when a single model is fitted on the pooled data across all groups. Important is that within each group, the preference patterns are homogeneous, to avoid biasing the results. However, fitting a Plackett-Luce model separately per group does not make optimal use of information provided by individuals across all groups when there is some commonality of preferences, as can be expected often to be the case in practice. To the best of our knowledge, no work is done on efficient estimation of Plackett-Luce models (or other ranking models) on data consisting of multiple known groups of individuals, where within a group the individuals have more or less similar preference patterns, but where these preference patterns differ between groups. As such, we propose a novel extension of the Plackett-Luce model: the Sparse Fused Plackett-Luce (SFPL), that allows for joint learning from multi-group data. By borrowing information across known groups, more information is used, which in turn can lead to improved parameter estimates (Danaher et al., 2014; Dondelinger \\& Mukherjee, 2020; Hermes et al., 2024). Information sharing across known groups has been introduced before for the Gaussian graphical model (Danaher et al., 2014) and the multivariate regression model (Dondelinger \\& Mukherjee 2020). In line with these authors, we will penalise the likelihood to enforce joint learning of the model parameters. In addition to efficient joint learning from multi-group rank data, the proposed method makes use of objectvariables. Object-variables are variables that describe some property of the ranked objects that may affect their worth. Consequently, the worth parameters are modelled as a function of these variables, whereby the effects of each object variable can be group-specific. When the number of such variables is large, some form of variable selection is required, both because preference is likely determined by relatively few variables (Naik et al., 2008; Zhu \\& Liu 2023) and because reliable parameter estimates becomes problematic as the number of variables approaches or exceeds the number of observations. For this reason, additional penalisation is introduced that forces coefficients to zero, depending on the chosen value of a tuning parameter, such that bias is induced to reduce the variance. Even when the data are not high-dimensional, this shrinkage provides a predictive advantage by avoiding model overfitting. This is especially valuable in situations where rankings are difficult or costly to obtain, but information for the objects is ubiquitous; researchers can fit the proposed method on the items for which ranking data exist, and predict the rankings of the other objects using the available covariates, whilst reducing the bias that overfitting would accrue. An example for such costly to obtain data can be found in the context of medical science, where the grouping of individuals providing rankings occurs due to disease states (see e.g. Mollica \\& Tardella, 2014). Another example can be found in the\n\nfield of marketing science, which perhaps does not suffer from a low number of observations, but where instead both data and object-variables are more ubiquitous. Here, the proposed method can be used to predict consumer response to various advertising campaigns, whenever different target groups are approached (Hariharan et al., 2015; Shin \\& Yu, 2021). Even though shrinkage of object-variable coefficients has not been applied in Plackett-Luce models before, it has been imposed on Bradley-Terry models (Schaumberger \\& Tutz, 2017; 2019). Moreover, Jeon and Choi (2018) imposed a truncated lasso penalty on the Plackett-Luce model, that fuses the worths of similar objects together. Nevertheless, the fused-type group penalty has not been applied in ranking models before, nor have existing methods generalised the fitted model to predictive settings or demonstrated the model performance in terms of recovering the underlying rankings or coefficients.\n\nThe paper starts with a description of the Plackett-Luce model, before extending it to obtain the proposed method in Section 2. Parameter estimation of the model is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 consists of a simulation study that evaluates the performance of the proposed method in terms of rank aggregation accuracy and coefficient estimation accuracy. An application of the proposed method on preference data pertaining to sweet potatoes is provided in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the article and discusses some points of (future) interest.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Methodology \n\nBefore introducing the Plackett-Luce model, some notation is required. Assume that we are given $K$ groups of ranking data $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{\\Pi}^{(K)}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n_{k} \\times m}, 1 \\leq k \\leq K$, consists of $n_{k}$ individuals with preference patterns that are i.i.d., in which individual $i$ ranks $m$ objects from a total population of $M$ objects, with $m \\leq M$. Conversely, individuals contained in different groups $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$ may exhibit preference patterns that do not arise from the same distribution. The $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)}=\\left(\\pi_{i 1}^{(k)}, \\ldots, \\pi_{i m}^{(k)}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq n_{k}$, are permutations of $1, \\ldots, m$, such that $\\pi_{i j}^{(k)}$ denotes the rank of object $j$ according to individual $i$ in group $k$. Consequently, we have that $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)^{-1}}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{i}^{(k)}=\\left(\\sigma_{i 1}^{(k)}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{i m}^{(k)}\\right)$, where $\\sigma_{i j}^{(k)}$ indicates the object ranked $j$-th by individual $i$ in group $k$. Let the set of objects ranked by individual $i$ in group $k$ be denoted as as $\\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(k)}$, where $\\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(k)}$ need not equal $\\mathcal{O}_{i^{\\prime}}^{(k)}$ for $i \\neq i^{\\prime}$, although we do have that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n_{k}} \\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(k)}=\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { O }}$ for all $k$, with $|\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { O }}|=M$. In addition, we might have access to data consisting of $p$ object-variables: $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times p}$. These object-variables provide information about some properties of the objects under consideration. Even though we assume that each individual ranks the same number of objects for notational simplicity, the proposed method holds for the more general setting consisting of a different number of ranked objects per individual.\n\nFor a typical Plackett-Luce model \u2014 without object-variables \u2014 the probability of observing ranking $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(k)}\\right)=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\alpha_{\\alpha_{i j}^{(k)}}}{\\sum_{l=j}^{m} \\alpha_{\\alpha_{i l}^{(k)}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\alpha_{i j}^{(k)}}>0$ denotes the worth of the object ranked $j$-th by individual $i$ in group $k$. The superscript $(k)$ implies that the worth parameters may vary per group, as a consequence of the differing preference patterns between groups. By setting $\\alpha_{j}^{(k)}=\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{j} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right), \\boldsymbol{x}_{j}=$ $\\left(x_{1 j}, \\ldots, x_{p j}\\right)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}=\\left(\\beta_{1}^{(k)}, \\ldots, \\beta_{p}^{(k)}\\right)^{T}$, the model can be extended to incorporate $p$ objectvariables, whilst simultaneously ensuring that $\\alpha_{j}^{(k)} \\geq 0$. Therefore, given a set of object-\n\nvariables, the probability of observing ranking $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{i}^{(k)} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\hat{\\sigma}_{j j}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)}{\\sum_{l=j}^{m} \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\hat{\\sigma}_{j l}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)}\n$$\n\nAlthough object-variables have been included in Plackett-Luce models before (Cheng et al., 2010; Sch\u00e4fer \\& H\u00fcllermeister, 2018; Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al., 2020), the interpretation of the coefficients has not been addressed, meriting some discussion. Even though for any object $j$ we have that $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{j} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right) \\geq 0$, negative contributions of variables can occur in a relative manner. Suppose that $\\beta_{q}^{(k)}<0$, for $1 \\leq q \\leq p$. Then for any $x_{j q}>0$, the product $\\beta_{q}^{(k)} x_{j q}<0$, reduces the relative contributions of other variables, and in turn lowering the worth for object $j$ compared to objects $j^{\\prime}$ with $x_{j^{\\prime} q}<x_{j q}$. The contrary is true for positive coefficients. Finally, for $\\beta_{q}^{(k)}=0$, variable $q$ has no contribution to the worth of object $j$ relative to other objects, irrespective of the value of $x_{j q}$. Therefore, $\\beta_{q}^{(k)}=0$ can be interpreted as the individuals in group $k$ being indifferent to this particular property of the object.\n\nAssuming that obtained ranking data consists of $K$ known subgroups, where within a group $n_{k}$ i.i.d. full or partial rankings are observed, the following likelihood is obtained\n\n$$\nL(\\boldsymbol{B})=\\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\prod_{i=1}^{n_{k}} \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\hat{\\sigma}_{j j}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)}{\\sum_{l=j}^{m} \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\hat{\\sigma}_{j l}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{B}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(K)}\\right)^{\\top}$. Whenever the number of included object-variables is large, some variables might be expected to have no contribution to an individual's relative preference for an object. Forcing small but nonzero coefficients to zero could therefore greatly improve interpretation, in addition to increasing the (predictive) robustness of the model. This forcing of some coefficients to zero is called shrinkage and is often done by penalising the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameter of interest (Hastie et al., 2015). A second penalty term can be added to the likelihood when the goal is to enforce information sharing between different known subgroups. Whenever different groups in the data have some commonalities, either in their preference patterns or in the coefficients governing the preference patterns, information sharing improves parameter estimates (Danaher et al., 2014; Dondelinger \\& Mukherjee, 2020; Hermes et al., 2024). We propose these shrinkage and information sharing processes by means of the following Equations\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(\\boldsymbol{B})=\\lambda_{s} \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right\\|_{1}+\\lambda_{f} \\sum_{k<k^{\\prime}}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right\\|_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{s} \\in \\Lambda_{s}$ determines the level of shrinkage for the object-variable coefficients and $\\lambda_{f} \\in \\Lambda_{f}$ determines the overall level of information sharing (fusion) between groups. These penalty functions are subtracted from the likelihood, such that larger values of $\\lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$ result in more shrinkage and more information sharing between groups respectively, whereas for $\\lambda_{s}=\\lambda_{f}=0$ unpenalised maximum likelihood estimates are obtained.\n\nBefore moving on to the parameter estimation, the concept of rank prediction ought to be discussed. Without object-variables, the Plackett-Luce model specified in Equation (2) is unable to predict the rank of unseen objects. However, the method proposed in this article does incorporate object-variables. As such, contingent on that the same set of $p$ object-variables for unseen object $M+1$ is provided, the estimated worth of that object for any group $k$ is given by $\\hat{\\alpha}_{M+1}^{(k)}=\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{M+1} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^{(k)}\\right)$, where the rank of $M+1$ is given by the value of $\\hat{\\alpha}_{M+1}^{(k)}$, relative\n\nto the earlier estimated $\\hat{\\alpha}_{1}^{(k)}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\alpha}_{M}^{(k)}$. These rankings depend on the group whose estimated coefficients are used, as for the new object too, different groups imply different preferences.\n\nRank prediction directly relates to an important property of the Plackett-Luce model: the independence of irrelevant alternatives (Luce, 1959). Removing more objects from the data on which the model is fitted does not change the relative rank ordering for the remaining objects in this data, due to irrelevance of alternatives. That is, if someone prefers object $j$ over $j^{\\prime}$, then if $j^{\\prime \\prime}$ is introduced, it cannot be that $j^{\\prime}$ is preferred over $j$ by this same person. Therefore, the unseen objects do not change the preference order of the seen objects, but when multiple unseen objects are predicted, their relative ordering might change compared to the true order, as we have no ranking data on them, only covariates. Consequently, the validity of using a Plackett-Luce model with object-variables in a predictive setting is determined by the correctness of the assumption on whether or not the one-way deterministic relationship between the object-variables and the rankings is applicable to unseen objects.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Parameter estimation \n\nMaximum likelihood estimation permits no analytic solution for either the worth parameters or the object-variable coefficients. Therefore, research centring around Plackett-Luce models resort to iterative methods, such as the Generalized Method-of-Moments (Azari Soufiani et al., 2013), Luce Spectral Ranking (Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al., 2020), Majorization-Minimization (Hunter, 2004; Jeon \\& Choi, 2018) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (Cheng et al., 2010) approaches for maximum likelihood estimation. Usage and convergence of such methods is often contingent upon convexity of the penalised likelihood. We take the negative log likelihood of Equation (2) and impose Equation (3 to obtain the following penalised negative log likelihood\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell_{\\mathcal{P}}(\\boldsymbol{B})= & \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}} \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\{\\log \\left[\\sum_{l=j}^{m} \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\alpha_{i l}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)\\right]-\\boldsymbol{x}_{\\alpha_{i j}^{(k)}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right\\} \\\\\n& +\\lambda_{s} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{q=1}^{p}\\left|\\beta_{q}^{(k)}\\right|+\\lambda_{f} \\sum_{k<k^{\\prime}} \\sum_{q=1}^{p}\\left|\\beta_{q}^{(k)}-\\beta_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is convex in $\\boldsymbol{B}$. A proof of convexity for a similar (unpenalised) problem can be found in Sch\u00e4fer and H\u00fcllermeister (2018), whose extension to Equation (6) is straightforward, due to the convexity of the imposed penalty terms. Without these terms, we could use the New-ton-Raphson method to conduct maximum likelihood estimation. However, these penalty terms have a problem known as \"singularity at the origin\" (Fan \\& Li, 2001), implying that they do not have continuous second order derivatives, and hence cause typical gradient-based methods to be unsuitable for this problem. To overcome this problem, we utlise the majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm, where a surrogate function $S$ is introduced that is quadratic, and majorizes (bounds) the convex objective function from above, and hence easier to optimize than the function of interest $\\mathcal{P}$, see Equation (3). The algorithm minimizes the surrogate function iteratively, and given an estimate for iteration $h, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}$, the surrogate function has the property that $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)=S\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]} \\mid \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{P}(\\boldsymbol{B}) \\leq S\\left(\\boldsymbol{B} \\mid \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)$. As the MM algorithm has the property that $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h+1]}\\right) \\leq \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)$, our aim is to find a $\\boldsymbol{B}$ that minimizes $S\\left(\\boldsymbol{B} \\mid \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)$. Slightly modifying the surrogate function proposed by Yu et al. (2015) for a similar problem gives us the following\n\nsurrogate function for Equation (3)\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nS\\left(\\boldsymbol{B} \\mid \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}^{[h]}\\right)=\\lambda_{s} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{q=1}^{p}\\left[\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}\\right|-\\epsilon \\log \\left(1+\\frac{\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}\\right|}{\\epsilon}\\right)+\\frac{\\left(\\beta_{q}^{(k)}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}\\right)^{2}}{2\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}\\right|+\\epsilon\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n+\\lambda_{f} \\sum_{k<k^{\\prime}} \\sum_{q=1}^{p}\\left[\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)^{[h]}}\\right|-\\epsilon \\log \\left(1+\\frac{\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)^{[h]}}\\right|}{\\epsilon}\\right)+\\frac{\\left(\\beta_{q}^{(k)}-\\beta_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)^{[h]}}\\right)^{2}}{2\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)^{[h]}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)^{[h]}}\\right|+\\epsilon\\right)}\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere we set $\\epsilon=10^{-5}$ (c.f. Hunter \\& Li, 2005; Yu et al., 2015).

Convergence results for this method are provided by both Hunter and Li (2005) and Yu et al. (2015), and will not be repeated here, as their results hold for general convex and differentiable likelihoods.\n\nThe proposed method requires the selection of two penalty parameters: $\\lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$. Throughout this paper, these are selected in a data-driven fashion by means of 5 -fold cross-validation, where the proposed method is fitted across a variety of values for $\\lambda_{s} \\in \\Lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f} \\in \\Lambda_{f}$. Subsequently, the combination of $\\lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$ that maximizes a score function reflecting the number of correctly estimated rankings (the Rank Correctness Ratio, see Section 4), averaged across all 5 folds is selected as the \"optimal\" penalty parameter combination. The grid of $\\left|\\Lambda_{s} \\times \\Lambda_{f}\\right|$ penalty parameters is chosen such that for $\\min \\Lambda_{s}$ and $\\min \\Lambda_{f}$ we obtain the maximum likelihood estimates, whilst for $\\max \\Lambda_{s}$ we obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}=\\mathbf{0}$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq K$ and for $\\max \\Lambda_{f}$ we obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\left(k^{\\prime}\\right)}$ for all $k \\neq k^{\\prime}$.\n\nOn a different note, despite the attractiveness of the Plackett-Luce model with object-variables, the total set of objects $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { O }}$ considered in the ranking process should grow with the number of object-variables $p$ to ensure identifiability of the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$. More formally, the Plackett-Luce model is identifiable if and only if $\\operatorname{rank}(\\boldsymbol{X})=p$. This holds for both the proposed method, as well as for existing Plackett-Luce models with object-variables. Even though this is an important constraint on the model, it is not mentioned in the existing literature on Plackett-Luce models with object-variables (cf. Cheng et al., 2010; Sch\u00e4fer \\& H\u00fcllermeister, 2018; Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al., 2020), potentially misleading practitioners into believing the usefulness of their analyses, whilst in reality the estimated $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$ are non-unique if $\\operatorname{rank}(\\boldsymbol{X})=M<p$. A simple proof for this condition is provided in the Appendix.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 Simulation study \n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed method, both in absolute terms and relative to existing methods, a simulation study is conducted. In this simulation study, we evaluate how the methods perform in terms of recovering the true value of the object-variable coefficients, recovering the true rankings from data consisting of partial rankings, and predicting the rankings of new objects. We compare this method with two different approaches based on the Plackett-Luce model that include object-variables: (i) a approach that does assume heterogeneity between groups and therefore fits $K$ separate models, but does not allow for information sharing, called Plackett-Luce (PL) (cf. Cheng et al., 2010; Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al., 2020) and (ii) an approach that does not assume heterogeneity between groups and fits a single model on the pooled data, called Pooled Plackett-Luce (PPL). The greater the heterogeneity in preference patterns between groups, the worse the performance of PPL will be. Conversely, PL is expected to show subpar performance whenever the preference patterns are more homogeneous between groups.\n\nThe data is simulated in the following manner: for $p \\in\\{5,10,25\\}$ we sample a vector of object-variable coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)} \\sim U(-1,1)$, where group 1 is the baseline group. To induce sparsity, we randomly set $\\lfloor\\eta p\\rfloor$ of the coefficients in $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)}$ equal to 0 , where $\\eta \\in\\{0.2,0.8\\}$ denotes the (approximate) proportion of sparse coefficients. Subsequently, for $k=2, \\ldots, K$, with $K=4$, different object-variable coefficients are computed by sampling $\\lfloor\\delta p\\rfloor$ coefficients in $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(1)}$ from $U(-1,1)$, where $\\delta \\in\\{0.25,0.5\\}$ denotes the (approximate) proportion of heterogeneity in object-variable coefficients compared to the baseline group. The proportion of heterogeneity between subgroups $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$, where $k \\neq 1 \\neq k^{\\prime}$, is always at least as large as $\\delta$. Given the values of values of $\\eta$ and $\\delta$, these simulations are referred to the \"favourable\" simulations, as they reflect mild to strong sparsity and mild to average heterogeneity between groups. The \"unfavourable\" simulations consist of $\\eta \\in\\{0,0.2,0.8\\}$ and $\\delta \\in\\{0,1\\}$, which resemble scenarios consisting of no to strong sparsity and either no or complete heterogeneity between groups, and where respectively the PPL and PL approaches are expected to perform best. The objectvariables themselves are sampled as $\\boldsymbol{X} \\sim N_{p}(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{I})$, with identity matrix $\\boldsymbol{I}$. The true worths for group $k$ are then obtained from $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}\\right)$, whose order reflects the true ranking. To sample the ranking data, the probabilities for the $\\binom{M}{m}$ permutations for the partial rankings need to be computed. However, as $M$ grows, for any large $m$, it becomes impossible to compute the $\\binom{M}{m}$ permutations, due to the combinatorial explosion that occurs. Therefore, in this simulation study, whenever $p<25$, we limit ourselves to the scenario whereby individuals rank three out of 20 objects, corresponding to situations found in tricot analyses, which provide the application for the proposed method and are further described in Section 5, in which individuals only rank three objects from a total pool of $M>3$ objects, where the objects are randomly assigned to each individual. However, to ensure identifiability of the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$, we set $M=p$ whenever $p=25$. For each group $k$, the probabilities for all permutations are computed using Equation (1), which we subsequently use to sample $n_{k}$ partial rankings, where $n_{k} \\in\\{25,50,100,250\\}$. To account for the sampling variability of the data, for each combination of parameters, 50 different datasets are generated.\n\nWith the data created, the models can be fitted. Model performance is evaluated using three different metrics, each serving a different goal. The first of these is the well-known Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{p=1}^{p}\\left(\\beta_{q}^{(k)}-\\hat{\\beta}_{q}^{(k)}\\right)^{2}}{K p}}$, corresponding to the difference between the estimated and true values for the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$. The second metric is the $F_{1}$ score: $\\frac{2 \\mathrm{sp}}{2 \\mathrm{sp}+\\mathrm{fp}+\\mathrm{tn}}$, where tp stands for true positives, fp for false positives and tn for true negatives, and indicates how well\n\nthe model differentiates between signal $\\beta_{q}^{(k)} \\neq 0$ and noise $\\beta_{q}^{(k)}=0$. The third metric, the Rank Correctness Ratio (RCR): $\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\pi_{j}^{(k)}=\\bar{\\pi}_{j}^{(k)}\\right)}{M}$, is used to evaluate how well the true ranking is recovered by the model. For the RMSE, values closer to 0 indicate better performance, whilst the $F_{1}$ and RCR scores are indicative of better performance when they attain values closer to 1 .\n\nAs prediction is one of the discerning features of the Plackett-Luce model with objectvariables, and also the scenario where regularised methods tend to perform best, the simulations also evaluate the model performance on five new objects for which only object-variables and no observed rankings exist. Accordingly, the RCR is evaluated across $M+5$ objects. The results of the favourable simulations for the RCR are shown in Figure 1, whilst the results for the RMSE and $F_{1}$ score are shown in Table 1. Results for the RCR of the unfavourable simulations are shown in Table 2. Simulation results for the unfavourable RMSE, different values of $K$, more informative partial rankings, full rankings and misspecified $K$ are provided in the Appendix.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Boxplots for the RCR values obtained from 50 different favourable simulated datasets. The colors represent the method used: SFPL $\\square$, PL $\\square$ and PPL $\\square$. From left to right, the figures represent the results for $\\{\\delta=0.25, \\eta=0.2\\},\\{\\delta=0.5, \\eta=0.2\\},\\{\\delta=0.25, \\eta=0.8\\}$ and $\\{\\delta=0.5, \\eta=0.8\\}$, where $\\delta$ represents the approximate fraction of coefficients that differ across groups, and $\\eta$ represents the approximate fraction of sparse coefficients.\n\nTable 1: Results for the fitted Plackett-Luce models on favourable simulated data with $K=4, m=3, M=20$ if $p<25$ and $M=p$ otherwise.

Bold values represent the best result for that particular parameter combination across the three methods. SFPL represents the proposed method, whilst PL and PPL represent the regular and pooled Plackett-Luce methods respectively.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nThe results in Table 1 show that maximum likelihood estimates are unable to accurately estimate the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$ under high-dimensional settings, whilst the proposed method does not have this problem. In fact, the proposed method outperforms the alternatives the vast majority of the favourable simulated settings. Whilst this advantage is by and large also reflected in the estimation of the ranks in Figure 1, the advantage is diminished whenever the heterogeneity in the coefficients across groups is increased. This makes sense, as the method is less able to use the observations in the other groups to estimate the coefficients and therefore construct rankings based on this borrowed information. Moreover, the fact that the proposed method gains an even bigger comparative edge over the alternatives - both the RMSE and RCR improve - whenever the sparsity level is increased is not surprising either, as the other approaches do not impose any penalties for non-sparse coefficients. An interesting secondary observation from these results is that whilst pooling the data across groups can result in estimated object-variable coefficients that are close (in terms of RMSE) to those of the proposed method, this is not reflected by the estimated rankings of the pooled approach, which show consistent underperformance. What is more, the pooling of data appears to bias the estimates to the extend that the pooled approach seems unable to learn the rankings from the data. However, when the data generating mechanism is the same for all groups groups $(\\delta=0)$, pooling the data results in more accurate point estimation and prediction as judged by Table 2. Similarly, when the groups are completely dissimilar $(\\delta=1)$, fitting a Plackett-Luce model separately on each group tends to work best. However, for large $p$, or when the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$ are sparse, the proposed method outperforms the competing approaches, even under unfavourable conditions. Therefore, it appears that the fusion advantages exist primarily for low $n_{k}$ in relation to $p$. Conversely, the sparsity advantage is more robust for higher values of $n_{k}$. Overall, when the proposed method loses, it typically loses small compared to the best alternative. However, it has the potential to win big, and provides a \"safe\" choice: never being the worst performer, this in contrast to the alternative approaches.\n\nNext, we showcase the computation time of the proposed method, where the data is simulated in the same way as for the other simulations, except that in this case, we fix $\\delta=0.25$ and $\\eta=0.8$. The results in Figure 2 reflect the average (across 20 different attempts) time in minutes it takes the proposed method to estimate the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)}$ for a single combination of $\\lambda_{s}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$. The simulations were conducted using an AMD Ryzen 52600 3.4 Ghz processor with 16GB of RAM.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Computation time for the proposed method in minutes.

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5 Application to preference tricot data \n\nWe apply the proposed method on what is known as \"tricot\" - triadic comparisons of technologies - data. Originating from agricultural science, tricots are part of the citizen science approach, whereby citizens assist in the collection of crop variety data, such that ultimately, large quantities of preference data are collected. In brief, tricots proceed by researchers handing out three different objects to citizens from a larger pool of $M$ objects, where, subsequently, the citizens are asked to rank these objects from best to worst on one or multiple traits (van Etten et al., 2019; Olaosebikan et al., 2024). The aim of the researchers is then to construct a full ranking of the $M$ objects based on the partial ranking data, which is possible using PlackettLuce (van Etten et al., 2019). However, the lack of inclusion of object-variables in the analyses of tricot data limits the understanding of researchers concerning the determinants of the observed rankings and the ability to predict the rank of new objects for which object variable information exists. As a result of the imposed sparsity penalty, the ensuing variable selection facilitates ease of understanding the ranking process when many object-variables are included and causes prediction to be more robust against overfitting. The fusion penalty benefits the analysis of tricot data, as these data are typically gathered under heterogeneous conditions, e.g. different locations or different groups of individuals, potentially resulting in biased or highly variable parameter estimates when respectively either too much (pooling the data) or too little (fitting a separate model per group) information across groups is borrowed, provided that the groups share some commonalities.\n\nThe tricot data used in this application consists of a tasting experiment of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam.) that Moyo et al. (2021) performed to determine overall preferences for different varieties. Consumers in Ghana and Uganda were approached and asked to partake in the experiment. Upon agreeing, the consumers were provided with three different raw, unpeeled roots of sweet potato varieties. These three varieties were randomly selected from a pool of 21 Ghanaian varieties, consisting of the SARI-Diedi (Tu-Purple), PG17206-N5, CRI-Ligri, PG17265-N1, SARI-Nyumingre (Obare), PG17140-N2, CRI-Apomuden, PG17136-N1, PG17362-N1, CIP442162, SARI-Nan, PG17412-N2, PG17305-N1, PGN16024-27, PGN16021-39, PGN16024-28, PGN16030-30, PGN16092-6, PGN16130-4, PGN16203-18 and PGA14011-24 varieties. The PG-varieties are in the later stages of the breeding process whilst the others are released varieties. The consumers were instructed to prepare the roots following their usual preparation method, eat the roots and rank them based on their overall acceptability.\n\nThe data consists of 111 partial rankings, and was supplemented with 11 additional objectvariables from the SweetPotatoBase (http://sweetpotatobase.org) : the dry matter, sugar, beta-carotene, fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose contents, and the skin colour darkness, flesh colour darkness, root shape and root size. Each of these object-variables represent average scores that were obtained from hundreds of phenotyping trials. Even though some of the object-variables were evaluated using ordinal scales in individual phenotyping trials; namely skin colour darkness, flesh colour darkness and root shape, we only have access to the averaged (continuous) values for all object-variables. Whilst the consumers were only asked to state their overall preference in the experiment, in the form of a partial ranking, and therefore did not necessarily made a comparative evaluation of the three sweet potatoes on all object-variables, we do think that in general, the consumers did take into account these object-variables in their evaluation, as they are all sensory attributes. This is further confirmed by some comments made by the consumers, mentioning the taste and look of the sweet potatoes.\n\nFor this analysis, we created two groups of individuals: one group consisting of men and one consisting of women, where each group consists of 64 and 47 samples respectively. Not only is this particular grouping consistent with a recent research interest in the field of tricot data\n\n(Olaosebikan et al., 2024; Voss et al., 2023), based on marketing literature, gender appears to be a key determinant in differing consumer preferences (Moss \\& Colman, 2001; Pirlympou, 2017; Friedman \\& Lowengard, 2019). Not accounting for gender through grouping or by including only those partial rankings provided by either men or women is likely to result in heterogeneity within groups, and as a consequence biased results. In addition, we include only those partial rankings collected in the Nyankpala community in northern Ghana in this analysis to ensure that within groups the observations are i.i.d. (Olaosebikan et al., 2024). As such, this application aims to illustrate the differences between men and women from Nyankpala in how they evaluate certain properties of sweet potatoes, and how this, in turn, affects the overall rankings of the potatoes. After standardising the object-variables, the first step of this analysis consists of applying the cross-validation approach across a grid of $\\left|\\Lambda_{s} \\times \\Lambda_{f}\\right|$ penalty parameters, which is chosen in the same fashion as described in Section 3, in order to select the appropriate penalty parameters. Subsequently, using these selected parameters, the model is fitted on the data. The estimated coefficients are provided in Table 3. As we impose lasso-type penalties on the likelihood to improve point estimation and prediction, statistical inference is highly nontrivial due to the lack of valid confidence intervals (Kyung et al., 2010; Goeman et al., 2012). Whilst statistical inference for penalised models is an active field of research, variable selection probabilities can be computed using a (nonparametric) bootstrap.\n\nTable 3: Object variable coefficients estimated by the proposed method for the boiled sweet potato data. The selection probabilities based on the bootstrap are provided between brackets. All values are rounded to two decimals.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nThe estimates provided in Table 3 are for the most part non-sparse; only one out of the 12 coefficients was estimated to be zero for both men and women. Moreover, there seems to be a substantial amount of similarity between men and women in the relationship that the objectvariables have on the observed rankings, due to the information sharing between groups as is reflected by our selected penalties $\\lambda_{s}=0.01$ and $\\lambda_{f}=0.005$. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of the coefficients differ between the two groups, including three differences between the signs of the estimates.\n\nIn contrast to the Nyankpala women who seem to exhibit a preference for less dry sweet potatoes that is consistent with the literature (Martin \\& Rodriguez-Sosa, 1985; Moyo et al., 2021), the fact that the Nyankpala men strongly prefer dry sweet potatoes is remarkable. Conversely, the Nyankpala men do exhibit the more typical preference for the sweeter variants of the sweet potatoes, as is typically observed in the literature (Martin \\& Rodriguez-Sosa, 1985; Leksrisompong et al., 2012; Moyo et al., 2021). In addition to the sugar content, the data consists of measurements on four different kinds of sugar: fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose. Nevertheless, little is known about preferences with respect to the kinds of sugar, except that the positive effect of glucose for the Nyankpala men on the sweet potato preference might be\n\ndue to potatoes with a high glucose content tasting like brown sugar (Leksrisompong et al., 2012). Even though the object-variables related to the taste of the sweet potato are not always consistent with the existing literature, those related to the colour of the sweet potato are. Preferences for cream or orange coloured sweet potatoes over dark purple or brown ones are well-supported by the literature (Martin \\& Rodriguez-Sosa, 1985), corroborating the negative sign for the flesh colour darkness (ranking from light to dark) found in both Nyankpala men and women. There is little existing research on shape preferences for sweet potato, although a recent study found preferences for more round root shapes (Afuape et al., 2021), corresponding with the preferences of the Nyankpala women, but contradicting the negative sign obtained in the present analysis for the Nyankpala men, as this variable ranges from round to long shapes. In addition, larger root sizes are preferred. This is not only a recurring preference in the literature (Kapinga et al., 2003; Afuape et al., 2021; Ahoudou et al., 2023), but it can also be deduced from the fact that Ghana has a substantial amount of people who do not have access to enough food (Darfour \\& Rosentrater, 2016), and larger sweet potatoes can feed more mouths. What is remarkable is that this expected positive effect of root size on the preference of individuals holds more strongly for Nyankpala women than for Nyankpala men, who are almost indifferent to the root size.\n\nEven though no other sweet potatoes were ranked by the participants of this study, the sweetpotato catalogue for sub-Saharan Africa (Musembi et al., 2019) provides ample information for other sweet potato varieties. We introduce five other Ghanaian varieties here: Blue-Blue, Faara, CRI-Santom Pona, CRI-Okumkom and CRI-Patron. Covariate information not included in the catalogue was supplemented with data from the SweetPotatoBase (http://sweetpotatobase.org). The predicted ranks for these new varieties are included with the estimated ranks and ordered into an aggregated ranking list. This list is provided in Table 4. To evaluate the predictive accuracy of the fitted model, we apply a 5 -fold cross-validation procedure, where across each fold, the fitted model is used to predict the ratings of the test data. This results in a RCR of 0.53 , implying that just over half of the predicted rankings are correct.\n\nTable 4: Rankings estimated by the proposed method for the boiled sweet potato data consisting of both the objects for which ranking data are available and the objects for which there are not.\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nGiven that the differences in the estimated object variable coefficients between men and women are nontrivial, with two differing signs, the aggregated ranking lists provided in Table 4 are also quite different as well. Nevertheless, the mediocre value of the RCR (0.53) as obtained by the cross-validation procedure should be kept in mind when discussing these results. What is remarkable about this aggregated ranking list is most of the varieties in the later stages of the breeding process - the PG-varieties - are ranked at the bottom of the list. This in contrast to the well-established varieties that are preferred by the individuals. The low rankings for most of the PG-varieties can be explained by their high (low) values on properties deemed undesirable (desirable) by the individuals partaking in the experiment.", "tables": {"table_2": "|  | Estimate |  |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Variable | Men | Women |\n| Dry matter content | $0.57(0.99)$ | $-0.01(0.87)$ |\n| Sugar content | $0.44(0.02)$ | $0.00(0.87)$ |\n| Beta-carotene content | $0.00(0.76)$ | $0.00(0.82)$ |\n| Fructose content | $0.64(1.00)$ | $0.11(0.88)$ |\n| Glucose content | $0.10(0.77)$ | $-0.38(0.94)$ |\n| Sucrose content | $0.06(0.89)$ | $0.06(0.88)$ |\n| Maltose content | $0.00(0.85)$ | $-0.11(0.92)$ |\n| Skin colour darkness | $-0.27(0.96)$ | $-0.27(0.97)$ |\n| Flesh colour darkness | $0.01(0.78)$ | $0.00(0.72)$ |\n| Root shape | $-0.24(0.94)$ | $0.01(0.88)$ |\n| Root size | $0.04(0.91)$ | $0.21(0.94)$ |", "table_3": "| Variety | Men | Women |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| SARI-Diedi (To-Purple) | 25 | 23 |\n| PG17206-N5 | 7 | 6 |\n| CRI-Ligri | 22 | 5 |\n| PG17265-N1 | 6 | 24 |\n| SARI-Nyumingre (Obare) | 13 | 7 |\n| PG17146-N2 | 12 | 4 |\n| CRI-Apomaden | 2 | 18 |\n| PG17136-N1 | 3 | 9 |\n| PG17362-N1 | 17 | 11 |\n| CIP442162 | 18 | 10 |\n| SARI-Non | 11 | 17 |\n| PG17412-N2 | 1 | 14 |\n| PG17305-N1 | 15 | 12 |\n| PGN16024-27 | 21 | 21 |\n| PGN16021-39 | 16 | 26 |\n| PGN16024-28 | 24 | 22 |\n| PGN16030-30 | 9 | 20 |\n| PGN16092-6 | 23 | 15 |\n| PGN16130-4 | 26 | 25 |\n| PGN16203-18 | 8 | 19 |\n| PGA14011-24 | 4 | 8 |\n| Blue-Blue | 14 | 1 |\n| Faara | 20 | 13 |\n| CRI-Santom Pona | 19 | 3 |\n| CRI-Okumkom | 5 | 16 |\n| CRI-Patron | 10 | 2 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 6 Conclusion and discussion \n\nExisting statistical models that aim to aggregate the (partial) rankings of different objects into a single coherent ranking provide little attention to the properties of the objects under consideration, and, in turn, to how the observed rankings of these objects arise. In this contribution, we introduce a doubly penalised version of the Plackett-Luce model with object-variables; the Sparse Fused Plackett-Luce model, in order to improve point estimation, prediction and interpretation for sparse multi-group data. The model performs competitively to existing methods across a large variety of different datasets, illustrating the tangible benefits of the proposed method. Applying the model on tricot data - a new citizen science based approach to generate large quantities of ranking data - provides new insights into sweet potato preferences, which breeding companies can utilise to create a better match between new potato varieties and the desires of individuals.\n\nWhilst the proposed method shares some similarities with the mixture Plackett-Luce model (Gormley \\& Murphy, 2008), our method assumes a known group structure, perhaps motivated by substantive knowledge, utilises object-variables and provides penalisation on the coefficients between and within groups.\n\nOn another note, the fusion framework can be applied on the Plackett-Luce model without covariates. However, this model does not allow for predictions, and as such was not evaluated given the importance attached to prediction in this paper.\n\nFor future research, the proposed method can be extended by allowing for covariates corresponding to properties of the individuals, although this would complicate prediction. Another potential extension consists of the usage of mixture models to identify groups of individuals with similar preference patterns, when these groups are unknown a-priori. As the existing literature on theoretical analyses of the asymptotic properties of the Plackett-Luce model under different settings is very limited, this provides another avenue of future research. Finally, the development of statistical ranking models that are better able to deal with scenarios akin to the tricot scenario $m=3 \\ll M$, is another promising direction, as due to the ease and costeffectiveness of gathering tricot data, this type of data is expected to be more common in the future.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "## Appendix A: Additional simulation results\n\nTo showcase that the proposed method performs well under a myriad of different settings, some additional simulation results are shown in the tables below. The data are generated in the same manner as in Section. Note that for the simulations in Table 6 we restrict ourselves to $p \\leq 10$ due to the combinatorial explosion that occurs otherwise when simulation informative rankings.\n\nThe first set of additional simulations are those conducted with different values of $K$, namely 2 and 6 instead of 4 used in Section 4. Fixing $\\delta$ to 0.25 and $\\eta$ to 0.8 , the results are provided\n\nTable 5: Results for the fitted Plackett-Luce models on simulated data with $\\delta=0.25, \\eta=0.8$, $M=20$ and $m=3$. The RMSE (root mean square error), $F_{1}$ and RCR (rank correctness ratio) scores are averaged across 50 fitted models for each parameter combination and rounded to two decimals. The same holds for the RCR pred, which indicated the RCR on the aggregated list of the 20 objects with five new objects, whose rankings are predicted. Standard errors are provided between parentheses. Bold values represent the best result for that particular parameter combination across the three methods. SFPL represents the proposed method, whilst PL and PPL represent the regular and pooled Plackett-Luce methods respectively. Both metrics are provided for the SFPL, whilst only the RMSE is provided for the PL and PPL methods, as these do not allow for variable selection\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nThe results from Table 5 indicate that the proposed model remains competitive for different $K$. One thing of note is that increasing the value of $K$ does not necessarily improve parameter estimates, even though there are more observations in total that can be used to improve parameter estimation. The reason is probably related to the fact that we only use a single fusion penalty parameter $\\lambda_{f}$ rather than one penalty parameter per combination of groups $k$ and $k^{\\prime}$, with $k \\neq k^{\\prime}$ whose coefficients are fused, such that our fusion approach reflects an averaged fusion, rather than a group specific one if $K>2$.\n\nTable 6: Results for the fitted Plackett-Luce models on simulated data with $\\delta=0.25, \\eta=0.8$ and $K=4$. The RMSE (root mean square error), $F_{1}$ and RCR (rank correctness ratio) scores are averaged across 50 fitted models for each parameter combination and rounded to two decimals. The same holds for the RCR pred, which indicated the RCR on the aggregated list of the 20 objects with five new objects, whose rankings are predicted. Standard errors are provided between parentheses. Bold values represent the best result for that particular parameter combination across the four methods. SFPL represents the proposed method, whilst PL and PPL represent the regular and pooled Plackett-Luce methods respectively. Both metrics are provided for the SFPL, whilst only the RMSE is provided for the PL and PPL methods, as these do not allow for variable selection\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\nWhen more objects are compared simultaneously in the partial rankings, the performance of all three approaches increase, as shown in Table 6. Even though the number of observations does not increase, the observations themselves become more informative. Nevertheless, the proposed method still outperforms the alternative approaches in almost all cases for the RMSE and all cases for the RCR.\n\nTable 7: Results for the fitted Plackett-Luce models on simulated data with $K=4, m=3, M=20$ if $p<25$ and $M=p$ otherwise. The RMSE (root mean square error) are averaged across 50 fitted models for each parameter combination and rounded to two decimals. Standard deviations are provided between parentheses. Bold values represent the best result for that particular parameter combination across the three methods. SFPL represents the proposed method, whilst PL and PPL represent the regular and pooled Plackett-Luce methods respectively.\n\n![table_6](table_6)\n\nThe result for the RMSE of the three approaches in the unfavourable simulations are similar to those of the RCR, see Tables 7 and 2 respectively, with the RCR results having a slight comparative edge for the proposed method. The reason for this is likely that the fitted models are optimised for rank prediction because of the cross-validation framework, which selects the combination of penalty parameters that maximise the RCR.\n\nInstead of always assuming that $K$ is known in our simulations, we have also added some simulations containing a misspecified value of $K$. For these simulations, we either have that true $K=2$ and assume that misspecified $\\hat{K}=4$, or the other way around. If the number of assumed groups is incorrect, this not only influences the proposed method, but also influences the approach where we fit the Plackett-Luce model separately on each group.\n\nTable 8: Results for the fitted Plackett-Luce models on simulated data with $\\delta=0.25, \\eta=0.8$, $M=20$ and $m=3$. The RMSE (root mean square error), $F_{1}$ and RCR (rank correctness ratio) scores are averaged across 50 fitted models for each parameter combination and rounded to two decimals. The same holds for the RCR pred, which indicated the RCR on the aggregated list of the 20 objects with five new objects, whose rankings are predicted.

SFPL represents the proposed method, whilst PL and PPL represent the regular and pooled Plackett-Luce methods respectively. Both metrics are provided for the SFPL, whilst only the RMSE is provided for the PL and PPL methods, as these do not allow for variable selection.\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\nUnsurprisingly, model performance for both the proposed method and the separate PlackettLuce method suffer substantially when $K$ is misspecified, as judged from the results in Figure 1 and Table 1 versus those of Table 8. Nevertheless, the proposed method still manages to outperform the alternative approaches in most cases, both in terms of the RMSE and the RCR. This is an interesting result, as the pooled Plackett-Luce approach is expected to perform best, given that it is the only approach we evaluate that is not affected by a misspecified $K$. It appears that the gain from imposing sparsity and fusion is bigger than the loss incurred by the misspecification of $K$. Similar to the other simulated data, performance is dependent on both the sparsity and heterogeneity of the coefficients, as well as the dimensionality of the data. Whilst the pooled approach has a natural advantage for misspecified $K$ over the proposed method, for large enough $p$ and with sufficiently sparse coefficients that exhibit some heterogeneity, the proposed method is expected to outperform the alternative approaches.", "tables": {"table_4": "|  | $K=2$ |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | RMSE |  | $F_{1}$ |  | RCR

One of the most common\nmodels, the Plackett-Luce model, is frequently used to aggregate rankings from\nmultiple rankers into a single ranking that corresponds to the underlying\nquality of the ranked objects. Given that rankers frequently exhibit\nheterogeneous preferences, mixture-type models have been developed to group\nrankers with more or less homogeneous preferences together to reduce bias.\nHowever, occasionally, these preference groups are known a-priori. Under these\ncircumstances, current practice consists of fitting Plackett-Luce models\nseparately for each group. Nevertheless, there might be some commonalities\nbetween different groups of rankers, such that separate estimation implies a\nloss of information. We propose an extension of the Plackett-Luce model, the\nSparse Fused Plackett-Luce model, that allows for joint learning of such\nheterogeneous rank data, whereby information from different groups is utilised\nto achieve better model performance. The observed rankings can be considered a\nfunction of variables pertaining to the ranked objects. As such, we allow for\nthese types of variables, where information on the coefficients is shared\nacross groups. Moreover, as not all variables might be relevant for the ranking\nof an object, we impose sparsity on the coefficients to improve\ninterpretability, estimation and prediction of the model. Simulations studies\nindicate superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing\napproaches. To illustrate the usage and interpretation of the method, an\napplication on data consisting of consumer preferences regarding various sweet\npotato varieties is provided. An R package containing the proposed methodology\ncan be found on https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SFPL.", "updated": "2025-04-07T19:08:14Z", "published": "2024-07-15T15:59:55Z"}
