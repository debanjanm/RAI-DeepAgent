In this regard, the restrictiveness of the assumption that individual preferences be complete was early acknowledged, ${ }^{2}$ and was recently highlighted by empirical studies. ${ }^{3}$ We propose and characterize a new incomplete decision criterion according to which, in the face of Knightian uncertainty (Knight (1921)), agents both hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\n\nWe study preferences over acts $f: S \\rightarrow X$, which are mappings from states of the world to outcomes, and we introduce and axiomatize preferences $\\succ$ admitting the following representation:\n\n$$\nf \\succ g \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(g) d p \\\\\n\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(g) d p\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $u$ is a numerical representation of preferences over outcomes, and $C$ and $D$ are sets of probability distributions over the states, interpreted as sets of different scenarios. ${ }^{4}$ Thus, a decision maker (DM) following such a criterion ranks an act $f$ above an act $g$ if and only if $f$ provides a higher expected utility than $g$ in the worst-case scenario in $C$ as well as in the best-case scenario in $D$.\n\nOur criterion is based on the conjunction of an optimistic (or ambiguity-seeking) assessment and of a pessimistic (or ambiguity-averse) assessment. ${ }^{5}$ We then interpret a DM with such a preference as hoping for the best scenario to realize, while also preparing for the worst one to happen, when evaluating each option: we thus refer to a preference relation admitting such a representation as a hope-and-prepare preference. As a brief illustration, think\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ For instance, Aumann (1962) wrote: \"Of all the axioms of utility theory, the completeness axiom is perhaps the most questionable. Like others of the axioms, it is inaccurate as a description of real life; but unlike them, we find it hard to accept even from a normative viewpoint.\" Schmeidler (1989), commenting on his characterization of the maxmin criterion, depicted the completeness axiom as \"the most restrictive and demanding assumption.\"\n    ${ }^{3}$ See Cettolin and Riedl (2019), Nielsen and Rigotti (2022).\n    ${ }^{4}$ The function $u: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is non-constant, affine and unique up to positive affine transformation. The sets $C$ and $D$ are unique, non-disjoint, compact and convex.\n    ${ }^{5} C$ and $D$ being non-disjoint, the expected utility in the best-case scenario is higher.\n\nof a company considering launching a new product. Typically, such a dual policy of decision making would favor investment or production strategies that present promising profit opportunities, in case the product captures an important market share, and a substantial safeguard, in case the product does not.\n\nWe shall give special attention in our analysis to the concordant case in which $C=D$ -for which we also provide an axiomatization. Acts are then evaluated according to the interval of all expected utility levels that they induce across all possible scenarios. More precisely, an act $f$ is preferred to an act $g$ if and only if any expected utility level that is attainable from $g$ but not from $f$ is below any expected utility level that is attainable from $f$, and there exists at least one level that is indeed attainable from $g$ but not from $f$. This intuitive criterion for comparing ranges of expected utility levels works as a strict version of the strong set order, which is, arguably, the most common way to compare intervals.\n\nImportantly, hope-and-prepare preferences treat the optimistic and the pessimistic assessments symmetrically: therefore, they do not systematically display a particular attitude toward ambiguity, which is consistent with extensive empirical evidence (see Trautmann and van de Kuilen (2015) for a survey).\n\nThe conjunction of a best-case evaluation and of a worst-case evaluation at play in our criterion is akin to the one at play in the notion of obvious manipulation (Troyan and Morrill (2020)), defined for revelation games in which the uncertainty faced by an agent concerns others' messages. Accordingly, the significant practical relevance of the notion of obvious manipulation provides support for our criterion within uncertain strategic environments. This notion gives an explanation, for instance, of untruthful reporting strategies that have been consistently observed in the Immediate Acceptance mechanism, used to match students with schools. ${ }^{6}$\n\nThe scope for applications of our criterion goes beyond strategic interactions. The idea that both worst-case and best-case scenarios serve as reference points is recognized for various social and economic domains where ambiguity is present. In this regard, let us simply mention the evaluation of financial assets (Bossaerts et al. (2010), Schr\u00f6der (2011), Ahn et al. (2014)), or the evaluation of different medical treatments by physicians and patients (Back et al. (2003), Taylor et al. (2017)); we discuss a third example in more detail.\n\nIt is not unusual for practitioners, reporters or fans to evaluate \"young prospects\" participating in the annual Draft in North-American sports leagues - we take the example of the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ See Pathak and S\u00f6nmez (2008) and Dur et al. (2018).\n\nNational Basketball Association league (NBA)\u2014 according to \"ceiling and floor scenarios.\" ${ }^{7}$ This can be formulated in our framework. There is potentially a myriad of parameters that the agent considers relevant for the evaluation of prospects: a state is a particular configuration of parameters. ${ }^{8}$ In this complex environment, the agent faces ambiguity and must compare prospects on the basis of a set $C$ of probability distributions over configurations of parameters. Loosely speaking, each player is identified with an act $f$, indicating their overall performance in each state, which is then evaluated according to a utility function $u$, and, for every scenario $p \\in C$, the agent can compute the expectation of $u(f)$ according to $p$. Then, the incompleteness of a criterion such as ours reflects the necessity to have sufficient conviction when declaring that a player is more promising than an other one. On the other hand, a criterion should not be too incomplete; let us illustrate this point by comparing our criterion to two alternative ones. Given $u$ and $C$, the agent could require, for a \"player $f$ \" to be declared more promising than a \"player $g$ \", that, for each scenario in $C$, the expected utility associated with $g$ be lower than the expected utility level associated with $f$ (Bewley (2002)). One could even require that any expected utility level attainable from $g$ be lower than any expected utility level attainable from $f$ (Echenique et al. (2022)) -that the \"ceiling\" of $g$ be lower than the \"floor\" of $f$. Both of these conditions are stronger than condition (1), expressing a more demanding notion of sufficient conviction. However, it may very well be the case that only \"generational talents\" such as Victor Wembanyama, ${ }^{9}$ (who was present in the 2023 Draft) be distinguished from other players on the basis of these more conservative criteria, and that for rather homogeneous cohorts such as the 2024 cohort, the agent fail to rank any player above an other one. ${ }^{10}$ In practical terms, according to our criterion, a \"player $f$ \" is declared more promising than a \"player $g$ \" if and only if anything that $g$ could achieve and that $f$ could not is considered worse than anything $f$ could achieve. With hope-and-prepare preferences, which, in this case, compare players on the basis of the associated ranges of expected utility, in a way that is reminiscent of the strong set order, the trade-off between decisiveness and conviction is addressed in a way that is more favorable to\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ See, for example, James Hansen, \"What makes an NBA Draft prospect high ceiling or high floor?\", SLC Dunk, June 2023, and Kyle Boone, \"NBA Draft 2024 ceiling and floor scenarios: The best or worst case projections for five CBS Sports, June 2024. We note that the use of the expressions \"ceiling\" and \"floor\" suggests that any case lying \"in between\" is considered possible.\n    ${ }^{8} \\mathrm{~A}$ state may thus encompass the roasters of coaches and players, at the beginning of the season and after the winter \"trade\" period, of each franchise, their financial capacities, the performance of players already in the league, the progression of each of these prospects, the approach to officiating favored by the league's executives, etc.\n    ${ }^{9}$ See, for example, Sam Harris, \"Why 'alien' Wembanyama is France's next big thing - literally\", BBC Sports, July 2024.\n    ${ }^{10}$ See, for example, Adam Finkelstein, \"No stars have revealed themselves in the 2024 NBA Draft, but history tells us they CBS Sports, June 232024.\n\ndecisiveness.\nThe two original axioms involved in our characterization are interpreted along this line: we propose in Axiom 6 a relatively strong sufficient condition for incomparability - so that Axiom 6 is satisfied by the vast majority of incomplete criteria defined on single acts proposed in the literature - and a relatively weak sufficient condition for comparability in Axiom 7. Our axiomatization maintains the assumption that preferences are complete over constant acts, deemed as the simplest ones. Axiom 6 underscores the role of constant acts as benchmarks for decision making: if the DM is unable to compare the act $g$ to the constant act $x$ whenever she is unable to compare $x$ to $f$, then she is not able to compare $f$ and $g$. According to Axiom 7, if $i$ ) the DM cannot compare $f$ to the constant $x$, while she declares $x$ more desirable than $g$ and, on the other hand, $i i$ ) she cannot compare $g$ to the constant act $y$, while she declares $f$ more desirable than $y$, then she declares $f$ more desirable than $g$. Thus, two specific aligned pieces of evidence are enough to conclude that an act is better than an other one, and Axiom 7 may be seen as formulating a minimal departure from the completeness of a standard expected utility preference relation - we refer the reader to Section 3.1.1 for a more precise discussion.\n\nFurthermore, in order to account for typical situations in which agents have to choose between two options, even if they lack conviction to express a clear preference between them in the first place, we study the completion of hope-and-prepare preferences. ${ }^{11}$ We demonstrate that the invariant biseparable complete extension of a hope-and-prepare preference admits an asymmetric ${ }^{12} \\alpha$-maxmin expected utility ( $\\alpha-\\mathrm{MEU}$ ) representation \u2014and a standard $\\alpha$-maxmin representation if the hope-and-prepare preference is concordant. Notably, the asymmetric $\\alpha$-MEU retains much of the tractability of the standard $\\alpha$-MEU - which is beneficial for applications - while remaining flexible enough to accommodate mixed ambiguity attitudes (Chandrasekher et al. (2022)). ${ }^{13}$ Importantly, in the representation we obtain, the weight $\\alpha$ does not depend on the considered acts, and is unique whenever the extended hope-and-prepare preference is incomplete.\n\nFinally, answering two natural questions of comparative statics that emerge from the proposition of a new type of incomplete preference under ambiguity, we compare the degree of incompleteness of our criterion to that of Bewley preferences (Bewley (2002)) and of twofold preferences (Echenique et al. (2022)), and we provide a way to compare the ambi-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ From a theoretical point of view, studying a completion of an incomplete preference relation enables to use standard mathematical tools, for example for utility maximization and welfare analysis.\n    12 \"Asymmetric\" refers to the fact that best and worst cases may be taken on different sets of scenarios.\n    ${ }^{13}$ Specifically, it captures ambiguity-averse behavior for large/moderate-likelihood events, ambiguityseeking behavior for small-likelihood events, and source-dependent ambiguity attitudes (Chandrasekher et al. (2022)).\n\nguity attitudes of two hope-and-prepare preferences.\nOur paper is organized as follows: we define the formal framework and introduce our criterion in Section 2. In Section 3, we give the main representation result and explore the case in which the sets of scenarios used in the two assessments are equal. In Section 4, we investigate the completion of our criterion. Section 5 is dedicated to the comparative statics questions mentioned above. Section 6 provides an illustrative comparison of concordant hope-and-prepare preferences to Bewley preferences, in the context of the aggregation of opinions of experts. The conclusions are presented in Section 7. All proofs can be found in the appendix.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 1.1 Related literature \n\nA DM hoping for the best while also preparing for the worst responds to uncertainty by combining opposite ambiguity attitudes. In this perspective, one may interpret a DM with a hope-and-prepare preference as requiring that her optimistic (ambiguity loving) self and her pessimistic (ambiguity averse) self be unanimous for her to rank some act above an other one. The idea that the DM consists of multiple (strategic) selves appears frequently in behavioral economics, in particular in models of dynamic choice or choice within risky environments. ${ }^{14}$ In recent works, Chandrasekher et al. (2022) and Xia (2020) provided axiomatizations for preferences involving two selves, called by the former dual-self expected utility. Their representation differs from ours in that the agent's final decision is to be interpreted as the result of a specific leader-follower game between an optimistic self and a pessimistic self, whereas, in our representation, it is induced by a requirement of unanimity imposed by the agent herself on the assessments of her two selves. ${ }^{15}$\n\nOur representation is also motivated by the concept of obvious manipulation proposed in the context of mechanism design by Troyan and Morrill (2020). A revelation mechanism is said to be non-obviously manipulable if, for any agent and any potential untruthful report from her, revealing her own type leads to a more desirable outcome in both of the following cases: when the others' reports are the most favourable to her, and when they are the least favourable. In our model, in the same spirit, an option - such as an untruthful report in the previous example - is only abandoned for an alternative if this alternative leads to preferred\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ Thaler and Shefrin (1981), B\u00e9nabou and Pycia (2002), Fudenberg and Levine (2006), Brocas and Carrillo (2008).\n    ${ }^{15}$ At a hight-level, the difference of our approach with that of \"Preparing for the Worst but Hoping for the Best: Robust (Bayesian) Persuasion\" (Dworczak and Pavan (2022)) is similar to the difference with Chandrasekher et al. (2022): in the criteria studied in both of these papers, one of the (pessimistic or optimistic) evaluations constrains the other. It is not the case with hope-and-prepare preferences in which both evaluations are treated symmetrically.\n\noutcomes in both the best and the worst scenarios among given sets of probability measures. The relation of our contribution to the concept of non-obvious manipulation mirrors that of Echenique et al. (2022) to the concept of obvious dominance, due to Li (2017): informally, when the set of scenarios according to which all acts are evaluated is the simplex, act $f$ is preferred to act $g$ by a twofold multi-prior preference if and only if $f$ obviously dominates $g$, and, on the other hand, $f$ is preferred to $g$ by a hope-and-prepare preference if and only if $f$ dominates $g$ in the sense of Troyan and Morrill (2020). ${ }^{16}$\n\nHope-and-prepare preferences define a partial order on acts. Pioneering work by Aumann (1962), Bewley (2002) and Dubra et al. (2004) studied the representation of incomplete preferences under risk and uncertainty. Incomplete preferences in non-deterministic environments have been the object of a growing literature: see, for example, Nascimento and Riella (2011) Galaabaatar and Karni (2012), Efe et al. (2012), Faro (2015), Minardi and Savochkin (2015), Hill (2016), Karni (2020), Cusumano and Miyashita (2021) and Echenique et al. (2022). The closest model of incomplete preference to ours, apart from those studied in Bewley (2002) and Echenique et al. (2022), both compared to ours in the introduction, is introduced in Nascimento and Riella (2011). As a special case of their main result, they study a criterion in which the DM considers several sets of scenarios, in each of which the performance of an act is evaluated according to the worst-case expected utility level. Then, an act is preferred to an other one if and only if it performs better in each set of scenarios. Hope-and-prepare preferences enable to capture a different type of ambiguity attitude, through the consideration of the optimistic assessment. We discuss in more details how our work relates to Bewley (2002), Nascimento and Riella (2011) and Echenique et al. (2022) in the next sections.\n\nIn line with Hurwicz's approach for decision making under complete ignorance (Hurwicz (1951)), the $\\alpha$-MEU model was proposed to capture the idea that, under ambiguity, worst and best expected utility levels, over one set of probability measures, can serve as sufficient statistics for the DM: she then computes an $\\alpha$-weighted average of these levels (Marinacci (2002), Kopylov (2002), Ghirardato et al. (2004)). ${ }^{17}$ Among the recent explorations of (variants of) the $\\alpha$-maxmin model, ${ }^{18}$ the one of Frick et al. (2022) is particularly important for the way we characterize the asymmetric $\\alpha$-maxmin model as representing the completion of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ With this same set of scenarios, one can also recover the concept of strategy-proofness from Bewley preferences (Bewley (2002)).\n    ${ }^{17}$ Let us mention two alternatives to the standard $\\alpha$-MEU model. The geometric $\\alpha$-MEU model (Binmore (2009)) uses a geometric weighted average. More recently, Grant et al. (2020) introduced and characterized a general aggregation of best-case and worst-case expected utility representations, referred to as ordinal Hurwicz expected utility.\n    ${ }^{18}$ Chateauneuf et al. (2007), Eichberger et al. (2011), Gul and Pesendorfer (2015), Frick et al. (2022), Klibanoff et al. (2022), Hartmann (2023), Hill (2023), Chateauneuf et al. (2024).\n\nhope-and-prepare preferences. ${ }^{19}$ In the objective and subjective rationality framework proposed by Gilboa et al. (2010), they show that the invariant biseparable complete extension of a Bewley preference admits a standard $\\alpha$-MEU representation. We show that the asymmetric $\\alpha$-maxmin representation characterizes the invariant biseparable complete extension of a hope-and-prepare preference relation. It reduces to standard $\\alpha$-maxmin in the case of a concordant hope-and-prepare preference relation. Beyond the fact that we consider the completion of a new type of preferences, our result has three salient feature: the representation is asymmetric in general, $\\alpha$ does not depend on the considered acts, and is unique. ${ }^{20}$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Setup and representation\n### 2.1 Model\n\nOur analysis is conducted in the classical framework proposed by Anscombe and Aumann (1963). Uncertainty is modeled through a set $S$ of states of the world, endowed with an algebra $\\Sigma$ of subsets of $S$ called events, and a non-empty set of consequences $X$, which is a non-singleton convex subset of a real vector space. A simple act is defined as a function $f: S \\rightarrow X$ which takes finitely many values and is measurable with respect to $\\Sigma$; we denote by $\\mathcal{F}$ the set of all simple acts. The mixture of two simple acts $f$ and $g$, for any $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, denoted by $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g$, is then defined by setting, for each $s \\in S,[\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g](s)=$ $\\alpha f(s)+(1-\\alpha) g(s)$. With the usual slight abuse of notation, for all $x \\in X$, we use $x$ to denote the constant act defined by $f_{x}(s)=x$ for all $s \\in S$. We use $\\Delta$ to denote the set of all finitely additive probability distributions on $(S, \\Sigma)$, endowed with the weak* topology. ${ }^{21}$ We refer to a measure $p \\in \\Delta$ as a scenario according to which simple acts are evaluated. ${ }^{22}$\n\nWe consider a DM whose preference is represented by a binary relation $\\succ \\subseteq \\mathcal{F} \\times \\mathcal{F}$. It is a partial ranking over acts and we use the standard notation $f \\succ g$ to denote $(f, g) \\in \\succ$. If $f \\nrightarrow g$ and $g \\nrightarrow f$, we write $f \\bowtie g$, and say that $f$ and $g$ are incomparable. ${ }^{23}$ We interpret $f \\succ g$ as reflecting the fact that the DM considers that $f$ is more desirable than $g$ with sufficient conviction. In other words, in each pairwise comparison, one act ( $g$ in the previous notation) has the role of a default that would be abandoned only if the DM had enough\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ Recall that \"asymmetric\" refers to the fact that best and worst cases may be taken on different sets of scenarios.\n    ${ }^{20}$ More precisely, $\\alpha$ is unique whenever the considered hope-and-prepare preference relation is not complete.\n    ${ }^{21}$ The set of finitely additive bounded measures on $(S, \\Sigma)$ is the dual of the set of all measurable realvalued bounded functions on $(S, \\Sigma)$. Thus the weak* topology on $\\Delta$ is defined according to the following convergence notion: we say that a sequence $\\left\\{p_{n}\\right\\}$ of elements of $\\Delta$ converges to $p \\in \\Delta$ if for all measurable bounded function $\\varphi: S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, \\int \\varphi d p_{n}$ converges to $\\int \\varphi d p$.\n    ${ }^{22}$ From now on, we refer to simple acts as \"acts\".\n    ${ }^{23}$ Accordingly, we say that $f$ and $g$ are comparable if either $f \\succ g$ or $g \\succ f$.\n\nreasons to believe that the alternative performs better.\nWe denote the set of vectors whose $k$ elements are non-negative by $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}$, the set of vectors whose $k$ elements are positive by $\\mathbb{R}_{++}^{k}$, for any natural number $k$.

Let $\\succ$ be a hope-and-prepare preference relation with representation $(u, C, C)$. Then, the DM evaluates any act $f$ in terms of its range $R(f)=\\{\\int u(f) d \\mu: \\mu \\in C\\}$ of possible expected utility levels, which, as $C$ is convex and compact, is a closed interval. Consider an other act $g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and suppose that $R(f)=[a, b]$ and $R(g)=[c, d]$. Then $f$ is preferred to $g$ if and only if $a>c$ and $b>d$. This intuitive criterion for comparing ranges of expected utility levels works as an asymmetric version of the strong set order, applied to the special case of intervals: $f$ is preferred to $g$ if and only if any expected utility level that is attainable from $g$ but not from $f$ is below any expected utility level that is attainable from $f$, and there exists at least one level that is indeed attainable from $g$ but not from $f$.\n\nAt this point, it is interesting to describe how the way ranges are compared according to concordant hope-and-prepare preferences can be formally related to the way in which they are compared according to concordant twofold preferences, introduced and axiomatized by Echenique et al. (2022).\n\nDefinition 2. (Echenique et al.

One has $f \\succ_{T} g$ if and only if the interval $R(f)$ lies above the interval $R(g)$, and $f \\succ_{H} g$ if and only if $R(f) \\backslash R(g)$ is non-empty and lies above the interval $R(g) \\backslash R(f)$, also non-empty.\n\nAccordingly, given a set of scenarios, for a concordant hope-and-prepare preference and a concordant twofold preference, of which the restrictions to outcomes (constant acts) are\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ In a previous version of this work, hope-and-prepare preferences were called unanimous dual-self preferences.\n    ${ }^{27}$ They obtain the uniqueness, up to affine transformation, of $u$, and the uniqueness of $C$ and $D$ in their axiomatization.\n\nequal, the former is always more complete than the latter, in the sense that it is an order extension of it - a general statement, beyond the case of concordant preferences, is given in Proposition 1. This observation is the basis on which we compared concordant hope-and-prepare preferences to concordant twofold preferences in the NBA example of the introduction, and a similar comparison to Bewley preferences should be made (again, see Proposition 1):\n\nDefinition 3.

That is, our criterion still reflects the necessity for DM to have sufficient conviction when declaring an act more desirable than an other one, while it induces more choices. The two original axioms involved in our characterization are interpreted along this line in Section 3.1.1.\n\nWhen the preference relation $\\succ$ is not concordant, different collections of scenarios are considered under the optimistic evaluation and under the pessimistic one. The fact that hope and preparation in our criterion involve different scenarios can capture the influence of non payoff-relevant elements. In practical decisions, DMs may have subjective views on what constitutes \"good\" and \"bad\" states, beyond the outcomes that acts yield in these states. Then, when thinking optimistically, they tend to favor beliefs that assign higher probabilities to \"good\" states, while, when thinking pessimistically, they tend to focus on beliefs assigning higher probabilities to \"bad\" states. When hoping, a DM may, for instance, only consider scenarios in which states where the weather is \"nice\" have a high probability, even if the weather does not affect their monetary payoffs.\n\nTaking the dual-self interpretation more literally, a DM with non-concordant preferences does not simply combine the evaluations of two selves with opposite ambiguity attitudes, but also with different beliefs. Yet, both selves must agree on at least one belief; this common prior may represent the scenario that the DM considers as the most plausible, or, more generally, a reference scenario.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{28}$ Similarly to the expression we used for our criterion, we will say that the twofold preference $\\succ_{T}$ admits the unique representation $\\left(u, C_{T}, D_{T}\\right)$, and that the Bewley preference $\\succ_{B}$ admits the unique representation $\\left(u, C_{B}\\right)$ to refer to the fact that $u$ is unique up to affine transformation, and $C_{T}, D_{T}$ and $C_{B}$ are unique.\n\nIn addition, the special case in which the discrepancy between the sets of scenarios takes the form of inclusion reflects the difference between the degree of preference for uncertainty of the optimistic evaluation and the degree of aversion to uncertainty of the pessimistic one (see Proposition 2 in Section 5). Let $\\succ$ be a hope-and-prepare preference relation with representation $(u, C, D)$, such that $D \\subset C$ : the pessimistic evaluation is more pessimistic than the optimistic evaluation is optimistic.\n\nA special case of the preferences studied in Nascimento and Riella (2011) is, as ours, defined by the conjunction of different assessments. These preferences are pre-orders, ${ }^{29}$ in contrast to hope-and-preferences, in general. We thus adapt their definition - see Theorem 4 in Nascimento and Riella (2011)\u2014 by replacing weak inequalities by strict inequalities.\n\nDefinition 4. (Nascimento and Riella (2011)) A binary relation $\\succ$ is a $N \\& R$ preference if\n\n$$\nf \\succ g \\Longleftrightarrow \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(g) d p \\text { for all } C \\in \\mathcal{C}\n$$\n\nwhere $u$ is a non-constant affine function defined on $X, \\mathcal{C}$ is a class of non-empty compact and convex subsets of $\\Delta$.\n\nOur approach and criterion differ from those of Nascimento and Riella (2011) in several aspects. In terms of methodology, in contrast to them, we provide an axiomatization directly on the domain of simple acts. ${ }^{30}$ In addition, in our representation result, the pair of sets of probability measures is unique. ${ }^{31}$\n\nFurthermore, while the set $\\mathcal{C}$ may be infinite in their model - the DM then takes decisions based on the unanimity of an arbitrary, potentially infinite, number of selves - our criterion requires the conjunction of merely two evaluations.\n\nFrom a behavioral perspective, N\\&R preferences are based on the unanimity of a collection of MEU representations, while hope-and-prepare preferences capture a mixture of different ambiguity attitudes. Moreover, we emphasized the importance of the special case of concordant hope-and-prepare preferences, defined by a very intuitive comparison of ranges of expected utility: this has no counterpart in their model.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ That is, reflexive and transitive binary relations.\n    ${ }^{30}$ Their result is obtained on the set of lotteries on simple acts.\n    ${ }^{31}$ In their representation, $\\mathcal{C}$ is not unique.

Axioms 1, 2, 3 and 5 express common requirements, Axiom 4 was proposed in Echenique et al. (2022), Axioms 6 and 7 are original to this work.\n\nLet us insist on the fact that all these axioms (except Axiom 2), in which constant acts play a central role, are grounded on the basic idea that constant acts, because they are simpler, are relevant reference points for decision making.\n\nAxiom 1. Relation $\\succ$ is asymmetric and transitive, and the restriction of $\\succ$ to $X$ is nontrivial and negatively transitive. ${ }^{32}$\n\nAxiom 2. For all triple $(f, g, h) \\in \\mathcal{F}^{3}$, the sets $\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\succ h\\}$ and $\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: h \\succ \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g\\}$ are open.\n\nAxiom 3. For all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}, x \\in X$, and $\\alpha \\in(0,1), f \\succ g$ if and only if $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ$ $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nThe interpretation of the assumptions in Axiom 1 is well-known. In particular, on $X$, $\\succ$ is the asymmetric part of a complete and transitive relation. Axiom 2 is the standard Archimedean continuity condition adopted in models of decision under uncertainty. Axiom 3 is the independence axiom proposed by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) in their seminal paper as a weakening of the independence axiom at play in the characterization of subjective expected utility.\n\nAxiom 4. For all $x \\in X$, the sets $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}: f \\succ x\\}$ and $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}: x \\succ f\\}$ are convex.\n\nAxiom 4 is identical to Axiom 4 in Echenique et al. (2022), which states that comparisons to a given constant act should not be sensitive to hedging. Recall that since $\\succ$ is asymmetric and incomplete, in general, $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}: f \\succ x\\}$ is interpreted as the set of acts for which the DM has sufficient conviction to consider them more desirable than the constant act $x$. The convexity of $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}: f \\succ x\\}$ is interpreted in terms of uncertainty aversion: an act obtained through hedging between two acts that provide sufficient evidence to be declared more desirable than the constant act $x$ is also considered more desirable than $x$ with sufficient conviction. The convexity of $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}: x \\succ f\\}$ is interpreted in terms of preference\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{32}$ Negative transitivity of $\\succ$ means that for all $x, y, z \\in X$, if $x \\nrightarrow y$ and $y \\nrightarrow z$ then $x \\nrightarrow z$.\n\nfor uncertainty: when the DM has sufficient conviction to declare two uncertain acts less desirable than the constant act $x$, then the DM also considers with sufficient conviction that an act obtained through hedging between the two is less desirable than $x$.\n\nAxiom 5. For all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, if $f(s) \\succ g(s)$ for all $s \\in S$, then $f \\succ g$.\nAccording to Axiom 5, if the outcome of an act is considered more desirable than the outcome of an other act in each state of the world, then the first act is preferred to the second one. In other words, according to a preference relation satisfying Axiom 5, the state-wise dominance of an act $f$ over an act $g$ provides sufficient conviction to rank $f$ above $g$. In the perspective of the trade-off between decisiveness and conviction, we see this property as an intuitive limitation of incomparability. While it is imposed in most approaches close to ours, the strong degree of conservatism, or indecisiveness, of twofold preferences is rooted in the fact that they violate it. ${ }^{33}$\n\nWe propose in Axiom 6 a relatively strong sufficient condition for incomparability \u2014 equivalently, a relatively weak necessary condition for comparability - so that Axiom 6 is satisfied by almost all (the asymmetric part of) the incomplete criteria comparing single acts mentioned in Section 1.1, that is, almost all the incomplete criteria defined in a classical Anscombe-Aumann framework mentioned in Section 1.1. More precisely, the (asymmetric part of) the criteria proposed in Bewley (2002), Nascimento and Riella (2011), Efe et al. (2012), Faro (2015), Cusumano and Miyashita (2021) and Echenique et al. (2022) all satisfy Axiom 6 (see Appendix A). ${ }^{34}$ On the other hand, we impose a relatively weak sufficient condition for comparability in Axiom 7.\n\nWe jointly discuss these axioms after we briefly present them.\nAxiom 6. For all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, if for all $x \\in X, f \\bowtie x$ implies $g \\bowtie x$, then $f \\bowtie g$.\nAxiom 6 underscores the role of constant acts as benchmark acts based on which comparisons of more complex acts are made: for the DM to express a preference between the acts $f$ and $g$, it is necessary that there exists a constant act $x$ that the DM prefers to either $f$ or $g$, while she cannot compare $x$ with the other act. ${ }^{35}$\n\nAxiom 7. For all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and for all $x, y \\in X$, if $f \\bowtie x, x \\succ g, g \\bowtie y$ and $f \\succ y$ then $f \\succ g$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{33}$ See Cusumano and Miyashita (2021) and Echenique et al. (2022).\n    ${ }^{34}$ There is one incomplete criterion mentioned in Section 1.1 that is defined on single acts and that may not satisfy Axiom 6, the one proposed in Hill (2016).\n    ${ }^{35}$ Note that we do not impose that whenever there exists $x \\in X$ such that $f \\bowtie x$ and $g \\bowtie x$, then $f \\bowtie g$ (which is Axiom 5 in Echenique et al. (2022)). Actually, our criterion does not satisfy this property in general.\n\nWhile the DM cannot compare $f$ to the constant $x$, she declares $x$ more desirable than $g$. On the other hand, while she cannot compare $g$ to the constant act $y$, she declares $f$ more desirable than $y$. Axiom 7 implies that in the presence of such consonant conclusions as to the comparison of $f$ and $g$, the DM considers $f$, with sufficient conviction, more desirable than $g$.\n\nAs we already highlighted, given the complexity involved in the evaluation of uncertain acts, constant acts, which are the simplest acts, are likely to be used as comparison devices. A straightforward way to use them in comparing two acts, when preferences may be incomplete, then consists in looking for a constant act that is incomparable to one of them and comparable to the other one. Each such constant act then provides a piece of evidence as to the comparison between the two uncertain acts - the question is then to determine what are sufficient pieces of evidence.\n\nConsequently, given two acts $f$ and $g$, the DM we model compares to $g$ all constant acts that are incomparable to $f$, and vice versa. This process gives rise to three possible cases:\n(i) for all $x \\in X$ such that $f \\bowtie x, g \\bowtie x$;\n(ii) for all $x \\in X$ such that $g \\bowtie x, f \\bowtie x$; and\n(iii) there are $x, y \\in X$ such that $[f \\bowtie x$ and $g$ and $x$ are comparable $]$ and $[g \\bowtie y$ and $f$ and $y$ are comparable $]$.\n\nIn the first two cases, there is no piece of evidence on which the DM may base her comparison: Axiom 6 implies that $f$ and $g$ are incomparable.\n\nIn the last case, there are four possible situations; it suffices to consider the following two, to which the other ones are symmetric:\n(a) $[f \\bowtie x$ and $x \\succ g]$ combined with $[y \\succ f$ and $g \\bowtie y]$; and\n(b) $[f \\bowtie x$ and $x \\succ g]$ combined with $[f \\succ y$ and $g \\bowtie y]$.\n\nIn case (a), the first piece of evidence favors $f$ while the second favors $g$. In contrast, in case (b), the two pieces of evidence go in the same direction, favoring $f$ : according to Axiom 7 , this is sufficient to conclude that $f$ is more desirable than $g$.\n\nThere is a sense in which Axiom 7 expresses, for an asymmetric and incomplete preference relation, a minimal departure from the completeness of weak orders for which all acts admit a certainty equivalent. ${ }^{36}$ Using the previous formulation, for these weak orders, one piece of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{36}$ That is, binary relations $\\gtrsim$ which are reflexive, transitive and complete, such that, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, there is $x \\in X$ such that $f \\sim x$.\n\nevidence is sufficient: if $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ has a certainty equivalent $x \\in X$ and $x$ is strictly preferred to $g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $f$ is strictly preferred to $g$. For an asymmetric and incomplete preference relation, Axiom 7 involves no more than one piece of evidence based on a constant act incomparable to $f$ and one piece of evidence based on a constant act incomparable to $g$.\n\nAxiom 7 is violated by twofold preferences, Bewley preferences and N\\&R preferences in general. Through the satisfaction of both Axioms 6 and 7, in particular, hope-and-prepare preferences address the trade-off between decisiveness and conviction in a new way.\n\nWe sometimes refer to the classical Axioms 2, 3 and 5 as continuity, certainty independence and monotonicity.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 3.1.2 First characterization theorem \n\nTheorem 1.

In that perspective, the following two lemmas are crucial.\n\nLemma. For all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the set $\\{x \\in X: x \\bowtie f\\}$ is non-empty.\nLemma. For all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and $x, y, z \\in X$, if $x \\bowtie f, f \\succ y$, and $z \\succ f$, then $z \\succ x \\succ y$.\nThis second result has an interesting interpretation. While the DM cannot assert with sufficient conviction that $f$ is more desirable than the constant act $x$, she considers with\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{37}$ The following lemmas are not presented here in the order in which they are proved.\n\nsufficient conviction that $f$ is more desirable than the constant act $y$ and worse than the constant act $z$. We show that in such a case, the DM considers, with sufficient conviction, that $z$ is more desirable than $x$, and that $x$ is more desirable than $y$.\n\nFrom the original relation $\\succ$, we define two preference relations on $\\mathcal{F}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& g \\succ_{p} f \\Longleftrightarrow g \\succ x \\text { and } x \\bowtie f \\text { for some } x \\in X \\\\\n& g \\succ_{o} f \\Longleftrightarrow x \\bowtie g \\text { and } x \\succ f \\text { for some } x \\in X\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe subscripts $p$ and $o$ are used to denote respectively a pessimistic and an optimistic assessment, based on $\\succ$, where these two terms are justified given the way the incomparability to a constant act is treated. Let us describe the interpretation of $\\succ_{p}$ : this relation is pessimistic in the sense that for the default act $f$, whenever there is a constant act $x$ such that $f$ cannot be compared with sufficient conviction to $x$, while $g$ is considered more desirable than $x$ with sufficient conviction, then $\\succ_{p}$ declares $f$ to be worse than $g$.\n\nWe then proceed by showing that $\\succ_{p}$ and $\\succ_{o}$ are asymmetric and negatively transitive. This enables us to define $\\sim_{p}$ by $f \\sim_{p} g$ if and only if $f \\nmid_{p} g$ and $g \\nmid_{p} f$, for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and to define $\\gtrsim_{p}$ by $f \\gtrsim_{p} g$ if and only if either $f \\succ_{p} g$ or $f \\sim_{p} g$, for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$. We define in the same way $\\sim_{o}$ and $\\gtrsim_{o}$. Then it is clear that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ and $\\gtrsim_{o}$ are weak orders, ${ }^{38}$ and we show that they are continuous and monotone, that they satisfy the classical properties of certainty independence, and, respectively, aversion to ambiguity and preference for ambiguity. ${ }^{39}$\n\nAs a consequence, $\\gtrsim_{p}$ can be represented by the function $f \\mapsto \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u_{p}(f) d p$, and $\\gtrsim_{o}$ can represented by the function $f \\mapsto \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u_{o}(f) d p$, where $C$ and $D$ are non-empty convex compact subsets of $\\Delta$, and $u_{p}$ and $u_{o}$ are two affine functions on $X$. We conclude that there is no loss of generality in assuming $u_{p}=u_{o}=u$, and that $C \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$, using the separating hyperplane theorem on these subsets of $\\Delta$ endowed with the weak* topology.\n\nNote that in this sketch of proof, the relation between $\\succ$ and the two weak orders $\\succ_{p}$ and $\\succ_{o}$ is established before the minmax and maxmax representations of $\\succ_{p}$ and $\\succ_{o}$ : Axioms 1-3 and Axioms 5-7 are necessary and sufficient for a general representation that we describe in Appendix B.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{38}$ They are non-trivial asymmetric and negatively transitive binary relations.\n    ${ }^{39}$ Definitions of these properties for weak orders are provided in the appendix.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 3.2 Characterization of concordant hope-and-prepare preferences\n### 3.2.1 Axioms\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions identified in Echenique et al. (2022) for the identity $C=D$ to hold in their twofold multiprior preference representation are also necessary and sufficient in our representation. ${ }^{40}$ Before introducing them, let us specify that, as suggested in the sketch of the proof of Theorem 1, when $\\succ$ satisfies Axioms 1-3, we define on $X$ the relation $\\gtrsim$ by $x \\gtrsim y$ if and only if $y \\nrightarrow x$ for all $x, y \\in X$. Clearly, $\\gtrsim$ on $X$ is asymmetric and negatively transitive; and $\\bowtie$ is equivalent to $\\sim$, the symmetric part of $\\gtrsim$, on $X$.\n\nWe use the notion of complementary acts ( $\\operatorname{Siniscalchi}$ (2009) ) to identify comparisons that are, under Axioms 1-7, characteristic of the uncertainty aversion of the agent's pessimistic evaluation, and of the preference for uncertainty of her optimistic evaluation, respectively.

If $f$ and $g$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ are complementary, then $f \\succ \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$ implies $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g \\succ g$.\nConsider two complementary $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and a preference $\\succ$ with representation $(u, C, D)$ on $\\mathcal{F}$. Assume $f \\succ \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$, as in Axiom 8 and let $x \\in X$ denote a constant act such that $x \\sim \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$. It cannot be the case that $g \\succ \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$, because this would imply $f \\succ x$ and $g \\succ x$, and thus $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g \\succ x$-a contradiction.\n\nIn other words, if $f \\succ \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$, then either $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g \\bowtie g$ or $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g \\succ g$. Axiom 8 requires that the second case hold, and this requirement is interpreted as a consequence of the simplicity of constant acts. Indeed, by transitivity, in this second case, one has, by transitivity, $f \\succ g$, so that Axiom 8 states that whenever $f \\succ \\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$, one has $f \\succ g$, that is, it should always be easier for the DM to assess whether $f$ is more desirable than the essentially constant act $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$ than to assess whether $f$ is more desirable than $g$.\n\nThe interpretation of Axiom 9 is similar: it states that for complementary acts $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, it should always be easier for the DM to assess whether the essentially constant act $\\frac{1}{2} f+\\frac{1}{2} g$ is more desirable than $g$ than to assess whether $f$ is more desirable than $g$.\n\nAxiom 9.

Given two preference relations $\\succ_{1}$ and $\\succ_{2}$ on $\\mathcal{F}$,\n(i) $\\succ_{1}$ is more ambiguity averse than $\\succ_{2}$ if, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $x \\in X, f \\succ_{1} x$ implies $f \\succ_{2} x$.\n\n(ii) $\\succ_{1}$ is more ambiguity loving than $\\succ_{2}$ if, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $x \\in X, x \\succ_{1} f$ implies $x \\succ_{2} f$.\n\nAn agent is more ambiguity averse than an other one if she is less inclined to choose an uncertain act $f$ over a constant act $x$. On the other hand, an agent is more uncertainty loving than an other one if she is more inclined to stick to an uncertain act $f$ than to switch to a constant act $x$. The next result characterizes ambiguity attitudes for hope-and-prepare preferences.\n\nProposition 2. Let $\\succ_{1}$ and $\\succ_{2}$ be two hope-and-prepare preference relations with unique representation $\\left(u, C_{1}, D_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(u, C_{2}, D_{2}\\right)$, respectively.

More precisely, the relationship $C_{2} \\subseteq C_{1}$ means that, in the worst scenario, the level of welfare attained by the agent if she has preference relation $\\succ_{1}$ is lower than the one attained if she has preference relation $\\succ_{2}$. Similarly, $D_{2} \\subseteq D_{1}$ means that, in the best scenario, the level of welfare attained by the agent if she has preference relation $\\succ_{1}$ is higher than the one attained if she has preference relation $\\succ_{2}$.\n\nBased on Proposition 2 (i), by comparing the concordant preference $\\succ$ with representation $(u, C, C)$ to the non-concordant preference $\\succ_{1}$ with representation $\\left(u, C_{1}, C\\right)$, with $C_{1} \\subset C$, we can say that $\\succ_{1}$ is more ambiguity averse than it is ambiguity loving. Similarly, the nonconcordant representation $\\succ_{2}$ with representation $\\left(u, C, D_{2}\\right)$, with $D_{2} \\subset C$, can be said to be more ambiguity loving than it is ambiguity averse. Then, a DM with concordant preferences is as ambiguity loving as she is ambiguity averse, or, in other words, her pessimistic evaluation is as pessimistic as her optimistic evaluation is optimistic.\n\nWe end this subsection by briefly discussing the relation between the degree of conservatism of a hope-and-prepare preference relation and the attitude towards ambiguity that it displays. It is easy to see that if $\\succ_{1}$ and $\\succ_{2}$ are hope-and-prepare preferences, and if $\\succ_{1}$ is more conservative than $\\succ_{2}$, then $\\succ_{1}$ is both more ambiguity averse and more ambiguity loving than $\\succ_{2}$. Does the converse statement hold? This question is all the more natural that if $\\succ_{1}$ and $\\succ_{2}$ are twofold preferences, then $\\succ_{1}$ is more conservative that $\\succ_{2}$ if, and only if, $\\succ_{1}$ is more ambiguity averse and more ambiguity loving than $\\succ_{2} .{ }^{42}$ An example in Appendix C shows that the answer is negative for hope-and-prepare preferences.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{42}$ See Corollary 1 in Echenique et al.

Following Danan et al. (2016), we assume that experts have Bewley preferences, which expresses, given a set of plausible scenarios, the need of experts to have a strong conviction in order to report to the planner (the DM) that an option is better than an other one: ${ }^{43}$\n\"[...] a given individual may also consider more than one model to be plausible-or have an imprecise belief. For such an individual, which of two policies yields the highest expected utility may depend on the model considered. When a policy yields a higher expected utility than another one for all plausible models, we say that the individual unambiguously prefers the former policy to the latter. Unambiguous preferences are thus robust to belief imprecision.\"\n\nLet $N=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ be a finite set of experts. Expert $j \\in N$ has a preference $\\succ_{j}$ on $\\mathcal{F}$. We use $\\succ_{0}$ to denote the DM's preference on $\\mathcal{F}$. We suppose that, for all $i \\in N$, expert $i$ 's preference is a Bewley preference with unique representation $\\left(u, C_{i}\\right)$. We thus assume in particular that there is no diversity of preferences over outcomes, which is a distinctive element of the theory of the aggregation of opinions, compared to the theory of the aggregation of preferences. We study how $\\succ_{0}$ should depend on $\\left(\\succ_{j}\\right)_{j \\in N}$ and impose the two following conditions:\n\nAxiom 10 (Pareto). For all $f, g \\in F$, if $f \\succ_{i} g$ for all $i \\in N$, then $f \\succ_{0} g$.\nAxiom 11 (Caution for incomparability). For all $f \\in F$ and $x \\in X$, if there exists $i \\in N$ such that $f \\bowtie_{i} x$, then $f \\bowtie_{0} x$.\n\nThe Pareto condition is the standard one. It asserts that the DM should follow the comparisons expressed by experts when they are unanimous: if all experts prefer act $f$ to act $g$,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{43}$ In particular, given this set of scenarios, the condition under which they have sufficient conviction that an option is better than an other one is stronger than if they had a concordant hope-and-prepare preference relation.\n\nthe DM should also favor $f$ over $g$. Caution for incomparability focuses on situations without clear comparisons. Based on the idea that the reason why the DM wants to rely on the opinions of experts to take decisions is that the issue at hand is crucial to her, it states that if some experts struggle to compare act $f$ to a constant act $x$, while comparisons involving at least one constant act are simpler, the DM should treat these acts as incomparable.\n\nInterestingly, the result below demonstrates that these two axioms imply that the rule for aggregating the beliefs of experts is the same when the DM adopts a Bewley criterion as when she adopts a concordant hope-and-prepare one: the set of plausible scenarios considered by the DM is the same. The relative merits of the two criteria then depend on the view of the DM as to the trade-off between conviction and decisiveness. If the DM wants to be more decisive, she should adopt the hope-and-prepare criterion. Conversely, if the DM prioritizes having stronger conviction in her decisions, the Bewley criterion, as considered by Danan et al.

Also, $u$ is non-constant as $\\succ$ is non-trivial.\n\nLet us now introduce intermediary results on which our proof is based.\nLemma 1. For all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and $x, y, z \\in X$, if $f \\bowtie x$, and $f \\succ y$, and $z \\succ f$, then $z \\succ x \\succ y$.\nProof. We prove $x \\succ y$, as $z \\succ x$ is similarly shown. Assume $x \\nrightarrow y$, by contradiction. Having $y \\succ x$ would contradict $f \\bowtie x$ by the transitivity of $\\succ$. Thus, $y \\sim x$. There are three possibilities:\n\nCase 1: There exists $x^{\\prime} \\in X$ such that $f \\bowtie x^{\\prime}$ and $x \\succ x^{\\prime}$. Then $y \\succ x^{\\prime}$ since $y \\sim x$. So $f \\succ y$, and $y \\succ x^{\\prime}$ which implies $f \\succ x^{\\prime}$, a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: There exists $x^{\\prime} \\in X$ such that $f \\bowtie x^{\\prime}$ and $x^{\\prime} \\succ x$. Then, $f \\bowtie x^{\\prime}, x \\sim y, f \\succ y$, and $x^{\\prime} \\succ x$.

By contradiction, assume that $f \\nrightarrow y$, then either $y \\succ f$ or $y \\bowtie f$. If $y \\succ f$, then $y \\succ x$ by transitivity, which contradicts the assumption that $x \\gtrsim y$. If $y \\bowtie f$, it follows from Lemma 1 that $y \\succ x$; a contradiction.\n\nLemma 4.

From Axiom 3 and Lemma 2, $\\alpha f(s)+(1-\\alpha) z \\gtrsim \\alpha g(s)+(1-\\alpha) z$ for all $s \\in S$ and all $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$. Let $f^{\\alpha}=\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) z$, $g^{\\alpha}=\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) z$, and $x^{\\alpha}=\\alpha x+(1-\\alpha) z$. Note that $f^{\\alpha}(s) \\gtrsim g^{\\alpha}(s)$ for all $s \\in S$.

Now, fix $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ such that $y \\succ g^{\\alpha}(s)$ for all $s \\in S$ and define, for all $\\beta \\in(0,1), f_{\\beta} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ by $f_{\\beta}(s)=\\beta f^{\\alpha}(s)+(1-\\beta) y$ for all $s \\in S$.

Then, by Axiom $5, g^{\\alpha} \\nrightarrow \\beta x^{\\alpha}+(1-\\beta) y$ for all $\\beta \\in(0,1)$. However, as $g^{\\alpha} \\succ x^{\\alpha}$, if $\\beta$ is close enough to 1 , Axiom 2 implies that $g^{\\alpha} \\succ \\beta x^{\\alpha}+(1-\\beta) y$, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 5. For all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the set $\\{x \\in X: x \\bowtie f\\}$ is non-empty.\nProof. By definition of a simple act, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, there are $x^{*}$ and $x_{*}$ in $X$ such that $x^{*} \\gtrsim f(s) \\gtrsim x_{*}$ for all $s \\in S$. Since $f(s) \\gtrsim x_{*}$ for all $s \\in S$ and $x_{*} \\bowtie x_{*}$, Lemma 4 implies that $x_{*} \\nrightarrow f$. One obtains similarly that $f \\nrightarrow x^{*}$. Consider the sets $\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: f \\nrightarrow$ $\\left.\\alpha x^{*}+(1-\\alpha) x_{*}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: \\alpha x^{*}+(1-\\alpha) x_{*} \\nrightarrow f\\right\\}$ which are non-empty and closed relative to $[0,1]$ by the continuity of $\\succ$. Clearly, their union is $[0,1]$, and the connectedness of $[0,1]$ in turn implies that their intersection is non-empty: there is $\\alpha^{*} \\in[0,1]$ such that $\\alpha^{*} x^{*}+\\left(1-\\alpha^{*}\\right) x_{*} \\bowtie f$.\n\nFrom the original relation $\\succ$, we define two preference relations as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f \\succ_{p} g \\Longleftrightarrow f \\succ x \\text { and } x \\bowtie g \\text { for some } x \\in X \\\\\n& f \\succ_{o} g \\Longleftrightarrow f \\bowtie x \\text { and } x \\succ g \\text { for some } x \\in X\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep 1. $\\succ_{p}$ and $\\succ_{o}$ are asymmetric and negatively transitive.\nWe only prove that $\\succ_{p}$ has these properties, as the argument for $\\succ_{o}$ is similar.\nAssume by contradiction $f \\succ_{p} g$ and $g \\succ_{p} f$ for some $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$. That is, there are some $x, y \\in X$ such that $f \\succ x, x \\bowtie g, g \\succ y$, and $y \\bowtie f$. By Lemma 1, one concludes that $y \\succ x$ since $f \\succ x$ and $y \\bowtie f$ and $x \\succ y$ as $g \\succ y$ and $x \\bowtie g$. This is impossible since $\\succ$ is asymmetric. As a consequence, $\\succ_{p}$ is asymmetric.\n\nNow, assume by contradiction that for some $f, g, h \\in \\mathcal{F} f \\nrightarrow_{p} g, g \\nrightarrow_{p} h$, and $f \\succ_{p} h$. By definition of $\\succ_{p}$, there is $x \\in X$ such that $f \\succ x$ and $x \\bowtie h$. Since $g \\nrightarrow_{p} h$, the following\n\nholds: $f \\succ x \\succ g$. Let $y \\in X$ such that $g \\bowtie y$. From Lemma 1, $x \\succ y$, implying $f \\succ y$. But then, $f \\succ_{p} g$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $\\succ_{p}$ is negatively transitive.\n\nStep 2. $f \\succ g$ if and only if $f \\succ_{p} g$ and $f \\succ_{o} g$.\nLet us first prove that for $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $f \\succ g$, one has $f \\succ_{p} g$ and $f \\succ_{o} g$, giving the explicit argument exclusively for $f \\succ_{p} g$, as $f \\succ_{o} g$ is proved symmetrically. By contradiction, assume that $f \\nrightarrow_{p} g$, then for all $x \\bowtie g$, one has $f \\nrightarrow x$, that is, either $f \\bowtie x$ or $x \\succ f$. But if $x \\succ f$, then $x \\succ g$ by transitivity, which contradicts $x \\bowtie g$. Thus, for all $x \\in X$, if $x \\bowtie g$, then $x \\bowtie f$. By Axiom $6, g \\bowtie f$, a contradiction. We have thus proved $f \\succ_{p} g$.\n\nSuppose now $f \\succ_{p} g$ and $f \\succ_{o} g$, and let us show $f \\succ g$. By definition of $\\succ_{p}$ and $\\succ_{o}$, there exist $x \\in X$ such that $f \\succ x$ and $x \\bowtie g$, and $y \\in X$ such that $y \\bowtie f$ and $y \\succ g$. Axiom 7 then implies $f \\succ g$.\n\nDefine $\\sim_{p}$ by $f \\sim_{p} g$ if and only if $f \\nrightarrow_{p} g$ and $g \\nrightarrow_{p} f$, for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and define $\\gtrsim_{p}$ by $f \\gtrsim_{p} g$ if and only if either $f \\succ_{p} g$ or $f \\sim_{p} g$, for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$. The relations $\\sim_{o}$ and $\\gtrsim_{o}$ are similarly defined. It is clear that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ and $\\gtrsim_{o}$ are complete and transitive. We say that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ (resp. $\\gtrsim_{o}$ ) is continuous if $\\succ_{p}$ (resp. $\\succ_{o}$ ) is continuous, which is equivalent to the closedness of $\\left\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\gtrsim_{p} h\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: h \\gtrsim_{p} \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g\\right\\}$.\n\nStep 3. $\\gtrsim_{p}$ and $\\gtrsim_{o}$ are continuous and satisfy monotonicity and certainty independence. ${ }^{46}$\nWe only provide the proof that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ is continuous and satisfies monotonicity and certainty independence, where monotonicity, when allowing for indifference, means that for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $f(s) \\gtrsim_{p} g(s)$ for all $s \\in S, f \\gtrsim_{p} g$, and certainty independence means that for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, all $x \\in X$, and all $\\alpha \\in(0,1), f \\gtrsim_{p} g$ if and only if $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\gtrsim_{p} \\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nWe first show that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ is continuous. Let $f, g, h \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $x \\in X$; denote $A_{x}$ the set of $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$ such that $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\succ x$ and $x \\bowtie h$. Either $A_{x}$ is empty or it coincides with $\\{\\lambda \\in[0,1]: \\lambda f+(1-\\lambda) g \\succ x\\}$. Then $A_{x}$ is open by Axiom 2. Therefore, $\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: \\alpha f+(1-$ $\\alpha) g \\succ_{p} h\\}=\\cup_{x \\in X} A_{x}$ is open. Similarly, one can show that $\\left\\{\\alpha \\in[0,1]: h \\succ_{p} \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g\\right\\}$ is open; thus, $\\gtrsim_{p}$ is continuous.\n\nNext, we prove that $\\gtrsim_{p}$ satisfies monotonicity. Let $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $f(s) \\gtrsim_{p} g(s)$ for all $s \\in S$, which clearly implies $f(s) \\gtrsim g(s)$ for all $s \\in S$. Suppose $g \\succ_{p} f$, which means that there exists $x \\in X$ such that $g \\succ x$ and $x \\bowtie f$. This is a direct contradiction as, by Lemma 4 , for any $x^{\\prime} \\in X$ such that $x^{\\prime} \\bowtie f, g \\nrightarrow x^{\\prime}$. Thus, $f \\gtrsim_{p} g$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{46}$ The definition of these properties for a weak order are reminded in the following lines.\n\nLastly, we establish that $\\approx_{p}$ satisfies certainty independence. Let $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}, x \\in X$, and $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$. We first show that $f \\approx_{p} g$ implies $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\approx_{p} \\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x$. Since $\\approx_{p}$ is a weak order, $f \\approx_{p} g$ is equivalent to $g \\nmid_{p} f$, which holds if, and only if, for all $y \\in X$ such that $g \\succ y, f$ and $y$ are comparable. Under Axiom 3, it is sufficient to prove that, for all $y \\in X$ such that $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ y, \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x$ and $y$ are comparable. Let $y \\in X$ such that $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ y$ and suppose by contradiction $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\bowtie y$.\n\nClaim: For such $y \\in X$, there is $\\underline{z} \\in\\{z: z \\bowtie f\\}$ with $u(\\underline{z})=\\inf \\{u(z): z \\bowtie f\\}$ such that $y \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nWe have shown in Step 2 that there exists $\\underline{z} \\in\\{z \\in X: z \\bowtie f\\}$ such that $u(\\underline{z})=\\inf \\{u(z)$ : $z \\bowtie f\\}$. Since $\\bowtie$ satisfies certainty independence (Lemma 2), $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\bowtie \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nWe claim $y \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$. Indeed, if there exists $z \\in X$ such that $\\underline{z} \\succ z$, then it follows from Axiom 3 and Lemma 1 that $f \\succ z_{\\beta}:=\\beta \\underline{z}+(1-\\beta) z$ for all $\\beta \\in(0,1)$. Using Axiom 3 again yields $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ \\alpha z_{\\beta}+(1-\\alpha) x$. It then follows from Lemma 1 that $y \\succ \\alpha z_{\\beta}+(1-\\alpha) x$ for all $\\beta \\in(0,1)$. Letting $\\beta$ tend to 1 , one concludes, since $u$ is affine, that $y \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$. If $z \\geq \\underline{z}$ for all $z \\in X$, then $\\alpha f(s)+(1-\\alpha) x \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$ for all $s \\in S$ (otherwise, Axiom 3 implies $\\underline{z} \\succ f(s)$, which is a contradiction). Since $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\bowtie y$, Lemma 4 implies $\\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x \\nmid y$, which is equivalent to $y \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nSince $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ y$ and $y \\geq \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x$, Lemma 3 implies\n\n$$\n\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ \\alpha \\underline{z}+(1-\\alpha) x\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to $g \\succ \\underline{z}$ by Axiom 3. Hence, by definition of $\\underline{z}, g \\succ_{p} f$, a contradiction. Therefore, $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x$ and $y$ are comparable, which yields $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x \\approx_{p} \\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x$.\n\nWe now show the converse implication. For $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, and any two $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}, \\alpha f+(1-$ $\\alpha) x \\approx_{p} \\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x$ if, and only if, for all $y \\in X$ such that $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ y, \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x$ and $y$ are comparable. Let $y \\in X$ such that $g \\succ y$, then one has $\\alpha g+(1-\\alpha) x \\succ \\alpha y+(1-\\alpha) x$ by Axiom 3. Thus, $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) x$ and $\\alpha y+(1-\\alpha) x$ are comparable, implying that $f$ and $y$ are comparable by Axiom 3. Hence, $g \\nmid_{p} f$, which is equivalent to $f \\approx_{p} g$. We have proved that $\\approx_{p}$ satisfies certainty independence.\n\nStep 4. An agent with preferences $\\approx_{p}$ on $\\mathcal{F}$ is averse to ambiguity, i.e., for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $f \\sim_{p} g$ implies $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\approx_{p} f$. An agent with preferences $\\approx_{o}$ on $\\mathcal{F}$ loves ambiguity, i.e., for all $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}, f \\sim_{p} g$ implies $f \\approx_{o} \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g$.\n\nWe only prove that $\\approx_{p}$ displays ambiguity aversion. Let $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $f \\sim_{p} g$, i.e., $f \\nmid_{p} g$ and $g \\nmid_{p} f$. In other words, for all $x \\in X$ with $f \\succ x, x$ is comparable with $g$, and for all $x \\in X$ with $g \\succ x, x$ is comparable with $f$. Let $x \\in X$ such that $f \\succ x$.\n\nIf $x \\succ g$, then $f \\succ g$, and then, by Step $2, f \\succ_{p} g$, which is a contradiction; thus, one must have $g \\succ x$. This implies $\\{x \\in X: f \\succ x\\} \\subseteq\\{x \\in X: g \\succ x\\}$. Analogously, $\\{x \\in X: g \\succ x\\} \\subseteq\\{x \\in X: f \\succ x\\}$; therefore, $\\{x \\in X: f \\succ x\\}=\\{x \\in X: g \\succ x\\}$.\n\nLet $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, we claim that $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\gtrsim_{p} f$. Since $\\gtrsim_{p}$ is a weak order, it is sufficient to prove $f \\nrightarrow_{p} \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g$, which holds if, for all $x \\in X$ such that $f \\succ x, \\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\succ x$. Yet, we have just proved that $f \\succ x$ if and only if $g \\succ x$. Axiom 4 then directly entails $\\alpha f+(1-\\alpha) g \\succ x$; which concludes.\n\nConclusion. It is well-known since Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) that a weak order defined on $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfying the properties stated in Step 3 can be represented by $f \\mapsto$ $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u_{p}(f) d p$ if it displays ambiguity aversion, such as $\\gtrsim_{p}$, and by $f \\mapsto \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u_{o}(f) d p$ if it displays love for ambiguity, such as $\\gtrsim_{o}$, where $C$ and $D$ are unique non-empty convex compact subsets of $\\Delta, u_{p}$ and $u_{o}$ are two affine functions on $X$, unique up to positive affine transformation. Clearly, for all $x, y \\in X, x \\gtrsim_{p} y$ if and only if $x \\gtrsim y$, and $x \\gtrsim_{o} y$ if and only if $x \\gtrsim y$. Thus, $u_{p}$ and $u_{o}$ are positive affine transformations of $u$, and one may assume that $u_{p}=u_{o}=u$. Finally, it remains to prove that $C \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nClaim: $C$ and $D$ are non-disjoint if, and only if, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}, \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq$ $\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$.\n\nWe only prove the if part, the other direction being trivial. We proceed by contraposition. Suppose that $C \\cap D=\\emptyset$. By the separating hyperplane theorem, there exists a bounded measurable function $\\varphi: S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int \\varphi d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int \\varphi d p$. Yet, there exists a sequence of simple functions $\\left\\{\\varphi_{n}\\right\\}$ that converges (in supnorm topology) to $\\varphi$. Since both $\\hat{\\varphi} \\mapsto \\min _{p \\in C} \\int \\hat{\\varphi} d p$ and $\\hat{\\varphi} \\mapsto \\max _{p \\in D} \\int \\hat{\\varphi} d p$ are continuous, there is $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int \\varphi_{n} d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int \\varphi_{n} d p$. As $a \\varphi_{n}+b$ also satisfies this last inequality for all $a>0$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$, one can choose $a>0$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $a \\varphi_{n}(s)+b \\in u(X)$ for all $s \\in S$, which implies $\\varphi_{n}=u(f)$ for some $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ :\n\n$$\n\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, the fact that, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}, \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$, implies $C \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nBased on this claim, it remains to prove that $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ in order to conclude that $C$ and $D$ are not disjoint.\n\nLet us show that the inequality $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$ holds for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ if and only if, for all $x \\in X$, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}, f \\succ_{p} x$ implies $f \\succ_{o} x$.\n\nSuppose that for all $x \\in X$, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}, f \\succ_{p} x$ implies $f \\succ_{o} x$. Suppose, by\n\ncontradiction, that there is $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$. Clearly, one has $u\\left(x_{*}\\right) \\leq \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq u\\left(x^{*}\\right)$, where $x_{*}$ and $x^{*}$ are defined as in the proof of Lemma 5. Then, since $u(X)$ is convex, $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p$ belongs to $u(X)$. Similarly, one can deduce that $\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$ lies in $u(X)$. Then, the convexity of $u(X)$ implies that there exists $x \\in X$ such that\n\n$$\n\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>u(x)>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction as it implies, as $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(x) d p=\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(x) d p=u(x), f \\succ_{p} x$ and $x \\succ_{o} f$. The other direction of the equivalence is trivial.\n\nIt remains to show that, indeed, $f \\succ_{p} x$ implies $\\succ_{o} x$, for all $x \\in X$, and all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Yet, $f \\succ_{p} x$ implies $f \\succ x$. Indeed, $f \\succ_{p} x$ if and only if there exists $y \\in X$ such that $f \\succ y$ and $y \\bowtie x$; then Lemma 3 implies $f \\succ x$. By Step 2, we conclude that $f \\succ_{o} x$.\n\nWe have thus proved that $\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p \\leq \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and, thus, that $C$ and $D$ are non-disjoint.\n\nIf part. Assume that $\\succ$ admits a hope-and-prepare representation. One can readily check that Axioms 1 to 5 are satisfied.\n\nFor all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, denote $\\bar{p}_{f} \\in \\arg \\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p$ and $\\underline{p}_{f} \\in \\arg \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p$. Define also the constant acts $\\bar{f}=\\int f d \\bar{p}_{f}$ and $\\underline{f}=\\int f d \\underline{p}_{f}$.

Consider $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that for all $x \\in X, f \\bowtie x$ implies $g \\bowtie x$. If $f \\succ g$, then $u(\\bar{f})>u(\\bar{g})$. However, by assumption, $g \\bowtie \\bar{f}$, which implies $u(\\bar{g}) \\geq u(\\bar{f}) \\geq u(\\underline{g})$, a contradiction. The same argument applies to prove that $g \\succ f$ cannot hold. Therefore, $f \\bowtie g$.\n\nAxiom 7 easily obtains from the comparisons in (2). Indeed, let $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $x, y \\in X$ such that $f \\bowtie x, g \\bowtie y, x \\succ g$, and $f \\succ y$.

The following proof closely follows the proof of Lemma A. 3 of Frick et al. (2022). We only prove that $(i)$ implies $(i i)$; the other implication is easily checked. By $(i)$, there is an increasing function $W:\\left\\{\\left(I^{\\prime}(\\varphi), I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)\\right): \\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $W\\left(I^{\\prime}(\\varphi), I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)\\right)=I(\\varphi)$.\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$ be such that $I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)=I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)=k$. We will show that $I(\\varphi)=k$. Since $I^{\\prime}$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}$ are monotonic and constant-linear, $k+\\varepsilon=I^{\\prime}(k+\\varepsilon)>I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)>I^{\\prime}(k-\\varepsilon)=k-\\varepsilon$ and $k+\\varepsilon=I^{\\prime \\prime}(k+\\varepsilon)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(k-\\varepsilon)=k-\\varepsilon$. Thus, by $(i), k+\\varepsilon=I(k+\\varepsilon)>I(\\varphi)>$ $I(k-\\varepsilon)=k-\\varepsilon$. Let $\\varepsilon$ converge to 0 , then $I(\\varphi)=k$. Thus, $I(\\varphi)=k$, which implies that $I(\\varphi)=\\alpha I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)+(1-\\alpha) I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{48}$ Axiom 2 implies the \"Archimedean axiom\" in Ghirardato et al. (2004).\n\nNow, consider $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$ such that $I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)<I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$. There exists $\\alpha(\\varphi) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $I(\\varphi)=\\alpha(\\varphi) I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)+(1-\\alpha(\\varphi)) I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$. By a simple computation, one obtains\n\n$$\n\\alpha(\\varphi)=\\frac{I(\\varphi)-I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)}{I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)-I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)}=-I(\\phi)=-W\\left(I^{\\prime}(\\phi), I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\phi)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi=\\frac{\\varphi-I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)}{I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)-I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)}$. Clearly, $I^{\\prime}(\\phi)=-1$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)=0$. Thus, $\\alpha(\\varphi)=-W(-1,0)$, which is independent of $\\varphi$. Let $\\alpha=-W(-1,0)$. Then, $I(\\varphi)=\\alpha I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)+(1-\\alpha) I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$ for all $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nWe now prove that $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$. By contradiction, assume that $\\alpha<0$. For any $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$ such that $I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)<I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$, we have $I(\\varphi)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$. There exists $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $I(\\varphi)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon=I^{\\prime}\\left(I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon\\right)>I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon=I^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon\\right)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$. By (i), $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon=I\\left(I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)+\\varepsilon\\right)>I(\\varphi)$, which is a contradiction. Thus, $\\alpha \\geq 0$. One can similarly show that $\\alpha \\leq 1$.\n\nAssume that $\\succ$ is a hope-and-prepare preference and $\\succ^{*}$ is an invariant biseparable extension of $\\succ$.

Thus, one can assume without loss of generality $u=u^{\\prime}$.\n\nDefine $I^{\\prime}: B_{0}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}: B_{0}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by $I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)=\\min _{p \\in C} \\int \\varphi d p$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)=$ $\\max _{p \\in D} \\int \\varphi d p$ for all $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$. Clearly, $I^{\\prime}$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}$ are monotonic, constant-linear functionals; and since $C \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset, I^{\\prime \\prime} \\geq I^{\\prime}$.\n\nNow, let $\\phi, \\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$ such that $I^{\\prime}(\\phi)>I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)$ and $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\phi)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$. We denote by $B_{0}(\\Sigma, u(X))$ the set of all functions in $B_{0}(\\Sigma)$ that take values in $u(X)$. Since $u(X)$ is an\n\ninterval in $\\mathbb{R}$, it is easy to check that there are $a>0$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\phi=a \\phi^{\\prime}+b$ and $\\varphi=a \\varphi^{\\prime}+b$, where $\\phi^{\\prime}, \\varphi^{\\prime} \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma, u(X))$. And, by definition of $u(X)$ and $\\mathcal{F}$, there are $f, g \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $\\phi^{\\prime}=u(f)$ and $\\varphi^{\\prime}=u(g)$. The following equivalences hold:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I^{\\prime}(\\phi)>I^{\\prime}(\\varphi) \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow & \\min _{p \\in C} \\int a \\phi^{\\prime}+b d p>\\min _{p \\in C} \\int a \\varphi^{\\prime}+b d p \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow & \\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(f) d p>\\min _{p \\in C} \\int u(g) d p\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, $I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\phi)>I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$ is equivalent to $\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(f) d p>\\max _{p \\in D} \\int u(g) d p$. Thus, $f \\succ g$. Since $\\succ^{*}$ is an extension of $\\succ, f \\succ^{*} g$, which is equivalent to $I(u(f))>I(u(g))$. Thus, $I\\left(\\phi^{\\prime}\\right)>I\\left(\\varphi^{\\prime}\\right)$. Because $I$ is constant-linear, one obtains $I(\\phi)>I(\\varphi)$.\n\nIt then follows from Lemma 7 that there exists $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$ such that, for all $\\varphi \\in B_{0}(\\Sigma)$, $I(\\varphi)=\\alpha I^{\\prime}(\\varphi)+(1-\\alpha) I^{\\prime \\prime}(\\varphi)$.

Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as\nbest and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions,\nand is, generically, less conservative than Bewley preferences and twofold\nmulti-prior preferences, the two ambiguity models that are closest to ours.", "updated": "2025-01-16T15:17:05Z", "published": "2024-06-17T03:11:49Z"}
