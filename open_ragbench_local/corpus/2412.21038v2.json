      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nFrom factor analysis to covariance estimation to matrix factorization, principal component analysis (PCA) is a standard tool for dimensionality reduction and low-rank signal recovery. Given data with $n$ observations and $p$ variables, the principal components are the eigenvectors of the $p \\times p$ sample covariance matrix. PCA, however, has two key drawbacks: first, the principal components are generally non-sparse linear combinations of all $p$ variables. This limits interpretability, and fails to capture the fact that signal matrices are often simultaneously low-rank and sparse-such matrices arise in diverse fields, including genetics, computer vision, imaging, and neuroscience $[22,23,29,55,65]$. Second, in high dimensions (when $p$ is comparable to or greater than $n$ ), PCA is inconsistent: the principal components are inconsistent estimators of the eigenvectors of the population covariance [57].\n\nThese issues have spurred the development of numerous alternatives to classical PCA that produce sparse principal components, collectively referred to as sparse PCA methods [38, 17, 67, $22,14,61,42]$. In this literature, the assumption of a low-rank and sparse ground truth is often\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ Department of Statistics and Data Science, Yale University\n    ${ }^{\\ddagger}$ Department of Statistics, Stanford University\n\nimplicit in applied and methodological papers, and explicit in theoretical analyses [45]. Whether or not there is evidence in a particular problem that the ground truth is sparse, Friedman et al. advise \"betting on sparsity\": \"Use a procedure that does well in sparse problems, since no procedure does well in dense problems\" $[29,32]$.\n\nPCA has been extensively studied in high dimensions, revealing several phenomena that are absent in classical fixed- $p$ statistics. A prototypical model in the theoretical literature is Johnstone's spiked covariance model (henceforth referred to as the \"spiked model\") [35]. Under this model, $n$ independent samples are observed from a $p$-dimensional Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$, where the population covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$ is a rank-one perturbation of identity:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}:=(\\lambda-1) \\boldsymbol{v} \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{I}_{p}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda>1$ is the maximum eigenvalue of $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ and our goal is to estimate the corresponding eigenvector or \"spike\" $\\boldsymbol{v} \\in \\mathbb{S}^{p-1}$. Let $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ denote the data matrix with the samples as rows, where $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ contains i.i.d. standard Gaussian elements.\n\nPCA estimates $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by the leading eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ of the sample covariance $\\boldsymbol{Y}:=n^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2} \\boldsymbol{Z}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{Z} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2}$ (which is a sufficient statistic for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ ). In low dimensions, where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $p / n \\rightarrow 0, \\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ are consistent estimators of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ (in terms of cosine similarity) and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ (in operator norm), respectively: $\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{v}\\right\\rangle^{2} \\xrightarrow{a . s} 1$ and $\\|\\boldsymbol{Y}-\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\|_{2} \\xrightarrow{a . s} 0$. In high dimensions, however, these consistency results no longer hold. As $n, p \\rightarrow \\infty$ with $p / n \\rightarrow \\gamma \\in(0, \\infty)$ (and $\\lambda$ fixed), the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ converges weakly almost surely to the Marchenko-Pastur law, supported on $\\left[(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma})^{2},(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})^{2}\\right]$. Moreover, the maximum eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\lambda_{1} \\xrightarrow{a . s} \\begin{cases}\\lambda+\\frac{\\lambda \\gamma}{\\lambda-1} & \\lambda>1+\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\\\\n(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})^{2} & \\lambda \\leq 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{v}\\right\\rangle^{2} \\xrightarrow{a . s} \\begin{cases}\\left(1-\\frac{\\gamma}{(\\lambda-1)^{2}}\\right) /\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda-1}\\right) & \\lambda>1+\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\\\\n0 & \\lambda \\leq 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\end{cases}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nRemarkably, PCA experiences a phase transition: if $\\lambda \\leq 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}, \\lambda_{1}$ converges to the upper edge of the support of the Marchenko-Pastur law, and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ is asymptotically orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{v}$. On the other hand, if $\\lambda>1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}, \\lambda_{1}$ is an outlier eigenvalue, occurring outside the Marchenko-Pastur support, and the cosine similarity between $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is non-trivial; that is, $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ contains (partial) information about $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Key papers in the development of (1.2) and (1.3) include works of Baik, Ben Arous, and P\u00e9ch\u00e9 [6], Baik and Silverstein [7], and Paul [57], and the threshold $1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ is known as the Baik-Ben Arous-P\u00e9ch\u00e9 (BBP) transition. For a full list of references, see the survey [34].\n\nWhen $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is uniformly distributed on $\\mathbb{S}^{p-1}$, consistent detection (testing between $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda>1$ ) and non-trivial estimation are impossible for weak signal strengths below the BBP transition [58]. However, if $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is sufficiently sparse, these key objectives become possible for such weak signals through alternative methods to PCA. In a seminal work, Johnstone and Lu [35] proposed the diagonal thresholding (DT) algorithm, which estimates the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by the indices of the largest-magnitude diagonal elements of $\\boldsymbol{Y} .{ }^{1}$ Assuming knowledge of the sparsity level $m:=\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{0}$ and that the entries of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ satisfy $v_{i} \\in\\{0, \\pm 1 / \\sqrt{m})$, Amini and Wainwright [3] proved that DT recovers the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ with high probability if $m \\leq C(\\lambda) \\sqrt{n / \\log p}$.\n\nBuilding upon DT, Krauthgamer, Nadler, and Vilenchik [42] proposed covariance thresholding (CT). Informally, CT (1) hard-thresholds the entries of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$, (2) computes the principal eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Given the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$, PCA applied to the corresponding submatrix of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ consistently estimates $\\boldsymbol{v}$.\n\nof the thresholded matrix, and (3) estimates the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ from the largest-magnitude elements of $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$. Deshpande and Montanari [19] subsequently suggested using soft thresholding and setting the diagonal of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ to zero in step (1). They proved that this modified algorithm (also referred to as CT) recovers the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ with high probability if $m \\leq C(\\lambda) \\sqrt{n}$, thereby confirming a conjecture of [42]. In particular, below the BBP transition where PCA fails, CT succeeds if $m / \\sqrt{n}$ is sufficiently small. Semidefinite programming approaches were unable to improve on this result $[3,42]$ (see the discussion in [19]).\n\nThis body of research raises the following question: is the condition $m \\lesssim \\sqrt{n}$ necessary for computationally efficient estimation below the BBP transition? Ignoring computational considerations, a weaker condition suffices: by exhaustively searching over $m \\times m$ principal submatrices of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$, exponential-time algorithms can recover the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ if $m \\log p \\lesssim n$ (for any fixed $\\lambda>1$ ), which is information-theoretically optimal [19, 66]. Conversely, work of Berthet and Rigollet [10] and ensuing papers strongly suggest that no polynomial-time algorithm can non-trivially estimate $\\boldsymbol{v}$ below the BBP transition if $m \\gg \\sqrt{n}$. In summary, \"the sparse PCA problem demonstrates a fascinating interplay between computational and statistical barriers\" [19].\n\nThis work focuses on the \"critical\" regime $m \\asymp \\sqrt{n}$; as discussed above, this is the coarsest sparsity level at which $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is believed recoverable below the BBP transition in polynomial time. Accordingly, we assume $m / \\sqrt{n} \\rightarrow \\beta \\in(0, \\infty)$ and, as in $[3,42]$, work under the spiked model (1.1) with $v_{i} \\in\\{0, \\pm 1 / \\sqrt{m}\\}$. We consider generalized covariance thresholding (GCT), which computes the maximum eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ and corresponding eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, defined as follows:\n\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{K}(f))_{i j}:= \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} f\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right) & i \\neq j \\\\ 0 & i=j\\end{cases} \\quad i, j \\in[p]\n$$\n\nwhere $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a kernel function. We estimate the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ by hard thresholding the entries of $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$. CT corresponds to the hard-thresholding kernel $\\eta_{h}(x, t):=x \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{|x| \\geq t}$ in [42] and the soft-thresholding kernel $\\eta_{s}(x, t):=\\operatorname{sign}(x) \\cdot(|x|-t)_{+}$in [19].",

      "text": "# 1.1 Summary of Contributions \n\nThe objective of this paper is to develop a comprehensive theory of GCT. Specifically, we answer in the affirmative the following question: does the high-dimensional PCA theory outlined above (namely, (1.2) and (1.3)) extend to GCT? Moreover, we resolve an open question of Desphande and Montanari [19]: under what range of sparsity levels $\\beta$ does CT (or GCT) (1) outperform PCA by producing a non-trivial estimate of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ below the BBP transition, and (2) consistently recover the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ ? We now summarize our contributions:\n(1) For a general class of kernel functions, we establish a phase transition, analogous to the BBP transition. ${ }^{2}$ Above a signal strength threshold $\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)$-depending on $f$, the limiting aspect ratio $\\gamma$, and the limiting sparsity level $\\beta$-GCT is informative: the spectrum of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ contains an outlier eigenvalue and the cosine similarity between $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is non-trivial. Below $\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta), \\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ is asymptotically orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{v}$. We provide limiting formulas for eigenvalue\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ For brevity, we describe here a slightly simplified version of our results.\n\nand eigenvector inconsistency, analogous to (1.2) and (1.3):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda_{1} & \\xrightarrow{a.s.} \\begin{cases}\\psi(f, \\gamma, \\beta) & \\lambda>\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta) \\\\\n\\lambda_{+} & \\lambda \\leq \\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\left\\langle\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{v}\\right\\rangle^{2} & \\xrightarrow{a.s.} \\begin{cases}\\theta^{2}(f, \\gamma, \\beta) & \\lambda>\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta) \\\\\n0 & \\lambda \\leq \\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nExpressions for $\\psi(f, \\gamma, \\beta)$ and $\\theta^{2}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)$ are provided in Section 2.\nFurthermore, above $\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)$, the coordinates of $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ concentrate tightly around those of $\\theta(f, \\gamma, \\beta) \\boldsymbol{v}$. Consequently, appropriate hard-thresholding of $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ recovers the support of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ exactly, with high probability.\n(2) We prove the existence of and characterize an optimal kernel function (depending on $\\beta$ ) with phase transition\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta):=\\inf _{f \\in L^{2}(\\phi)} \\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)\n$$\n\nwhere $L^{2}(\\phi)$ is the set of odd $L^{2}$ functions with respect to the Gaussian measure. With this kernel choice, GCT strictly outperforms PCA for all values of $\\beta \\in(0, \\infty)$, and as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$, GCT and PCA coincide (see Figure 1). Numerical calculations suggest that CT is nearly optimal, and we propose to adaptively select the thresholding level to maximize the (normalized) spectral gap. That is, we select the thresholding level that empirically produces the most \"clear\" outlier eigenvalue.\n(3) To prove (1), we develop sharp bounds on the coordinate fluctuations of kernel principal components. These bounds are based on novel approximation guarantees for deterministic equivalents of kernel matrices-Theorems 4.1 and 4.2-which achieve optimal rates of convergence and may be of independent interest. General-purpose entrywise eigenvector perturbation bounds (such as those in [1]) are insufficient for our purposes.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our main results, Section 3 contains numerical calculations and simulations, Section 4 states deterministic equivalents for kernel matrices, and Section 5 and Appendices A-C contain proofs.",

Their analysis is non-asymptotic and applies to a more general spiked model than we consider here. El Amine Seddik, Tamaazousti, and Couillet [24] study a variant of GCT in the sub-critical sparsity regime $m \\ll \\sqrt{n}$. They do not establish a phase transition or consider support recovery.\n\nRecently, Novikov [54] proposed a novel sparse PCA algorithm building on ideas from the planted clique problem [2].

Area (I) is the recovery region of PCA, the union of areas (I) and (II) is the recovery region of GCT, and (III) is the GCT impossibility region. The boundary between regions (II) and (III), the curve $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$, is the phase transition location of the optimal kernel function, characterized in Section 2.3. As $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty, \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta) \\rightarrow 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ (the BBP transition).\nnot establish a phase transition or derive exact limits as in (1.5) and (1.6). We remark that the algorithm is highly tailored to the spiked model (1.1), making it primarily of theoretical interest.\n\nA related body of work, including [59, 18, 47, 46, 58, 31, 51], considers estimation in the spiked model (1.1) where $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{p}$ are i.i.d. samples from a (fixed) prior distribution. By assuming a prior with a positive point mass on zero, this framework covers sparse PCA in the linear sparsity regime where $m \\asymp n$. Deshpande and Montanari [18] and Perry et al. [58] considered a Bernoulli prior: $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{p} \\sim \\operatorname{Ber}(\\rho)$. While non-trivial estimation of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is impossible below the BBP transition, PCA becomes sub-optimal above the transition when $\\rho$ is sufficiently small. Specifically, there exists a critical value $\\rho_{c} \\leq .05$, such that if $\\rho<\\rho_{c}$, an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is Bayes optimal [18]. For $\\rho>\\rho_{c}$, PCA is conjectured to be optimal among polynomial-time algorithms [58].\n\nDT and CT are connected to the works of Bickel and Levina [11], Ma [49], and Cai, Ma, and Wu [15], all of which use thresholding to induce sparsity. In contrast to the spiked model, the first paper studies estimation of covariance matrices with $L^{q}$ quasi-norm sparse rows, where $q \\in[0,1)$. The third paper considers minimax estimation of the principal subspace of spiked models of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=\\boldsymbol{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{I}_{p}$, where $\\boldsymbol{V}$ has $L^{q}$-sparse rows. They develop a data-driven algorithm based on DT which runs in polynomial time and achieves the minimax rate of convergence over a subset of the parameter space. Specializing their results to our model and $L^{0}$-sparsity, their estimator is suboptimal by a logarithmic factor: it requires $m \\leq C(\\lambda) \\sqrt{n / \\log p}$ to provably outperform PCA (see Theorem 7 and Proposition 1 of [15]).\n\nRather than thresholding, many sparse PCA methods induce sparsity through $L_{1}$-penalized regression. We intend to study the theoretical properties of the elastic-net-based method developed by Zou, Hastie, and Tibshirani [67] in future work.\n\nKey studies of high-dimensional kernel matrices include the works of El Karoui [25], Cheng and Singer, [16], and Fan and Montanari [26]. El Karoui considered kernel matrices with off-diagonal\n\nelements $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right)$ (instead of $n^{-1 / 2} f\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right)$ as in (1.4)), in which case the kernel matrix acts as a spiked covariance matrix, plus (1) a non-informative low-rank term and (2) a multiple of the identity. Consequently, the leading kernel principal components are asymptotically orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{v}$ below the BBP transition. The second and third papers pertain to kernel matrices of isotropic data (that is, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=\\mathbf{I}_{p}$ ). Cheng and Singer characterized the limiting spectral distribution (LSD) of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ as defined in (1.4), which is the additive free convolution of the (scaled) Marchenko-Pastur and semicircle laws; see Section 1.4 for details. Subsequently, Fan and Montanari proved that the maximum eigenvalue of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ converges to the supremum or \"upper edge\" of this LSD's support.\n\nNonlinear transformations of spiked matrices is an active area of research not limited to sparse PCA, with recent contributions from Liao, Couillet, and Mahoney [48], Guionnet et al. [30], Feldman [27], Wang, Wu, and Fan [63], and Mergny et al. [50]. The first paper assumes delocalized (dense) spikes and investigates thresholding and quantization kernels (which reduce PCA's computational cost), finding that their application minimally impacts estimation. The second and third papers study a related model in which a transform $f$ is applied elementwise to the data $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2}$, rather than to the sample covariance $\\boldsymbol{Y}$. Similarly to [48], spikes are delocalized. For a more detailed discussion of the technical distinctions between our work and [24, 48, 30, 27], see (2.3) and the following comments.",

As in $[3,42]$, let $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}:=(\\lambda-1) \\boldsymbol{v} \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}+\\mathbf{I}_{p}$, where $\\lambda \\geq 1$ is constant, $m:=\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{0}$, and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is deterministic (or independent of $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ ) and of the form\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{m} v_{1}, \\sqrt{m} v_{2}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{m} v_{m} \\in\\{-1,1\\}, \\quad v_{m+1}=v_{m+2}=\\cdots=v_{p}=0\n$$\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ have rows $\\boldsymbol{z}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{z}_{n} \\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)$ and\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S}:=n^{-1} \\boldsymbol{Z}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{Z}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{Y}:=\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2} \\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{X}:=\\boldsymbol{Y}-\\boldsymbol{S}\n$$\n\nThis model naturally extends from the first to the second moment the sparse Gaussian sequence model with a Rademacher prior [37]. The assumptions that the non-zero entries of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ are the first $m$ and that $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is sparse in the canonical basis are without loss of generality.\n\nDefine kernel matrices $\\boldsymbol{K}(f), \\boldsymbol{K}_{0}(f) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$ as follows: for $i, j \\in[p]$,\n\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{K}(f))_{i j}:= \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} f\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right) & i \\neq j \\\\ 0 & i=j\\end{cases} \\quad\\left(\\boldsymbol{K}_{0}(f)\\right)_{i j}:= \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} f\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{S}_{i j}\\right) & i \\neq j \\\\ 0 & i=j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe kernel matrix of noise, $\\boldsymbol{K}_{0}(f)$, is unobserved. We work within a standard asymptotic framework of random matrix theory, where $n, p, m \\rightarrow \\infty$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{p}{n} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\in(0, \\infty), \\quad \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow \\beta \\in(0, \\infty)\n$$\n\nLet $\\lambda_{1} \\geq \\lambda_{2} \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\lambda_{p}$ denote the eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{u}_{p}$ the corresponding eigenvectors. Non-bold symbols will be used to denote the elements of certain matrices and vectors. For example, $\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}=\\left(u_{11}, u_{12}, \\ldots, u_{1 p}\\right)$ and $\\boldsymbol{Z}=\\left(z_{i j}: 1 \\leq i \\leq n, 1 \\leq j \\leq p\\right)$.

In particular, (1) the ESDs of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ and $\\boldsymbol{A}(f)$ converge weakly almost surely to a common limit by Cauchy's interlacing inequality and (2) the leading eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{K}(f)$ and $\\boldsymbol{A}(f)$ are asymptotically equal.

Thus, $\\lambda_{1}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$, and support recovery undergo an identical phase transition. This support recovery phase transition was empirically observed by Krauthgamer et al. (Figure 3 of [42]), though it has not been rigorously established.\n\nSecond, we prove the existence of and characterize an optimal kernel $f^{*}(\\cdot ; \\gamma, \\beta)$ with the broadest recovery region. Third, we demonstrate that as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$, GCT fails below the BBP transition. This supports the conjecture that if $m \\gg \\sqrt{n}$, the detection threshold of PCA is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms-see the discussion in Section 1. Proofs are deferred to Section 5.3.\n\nLet $L_{o}^{2}(\\phi):=\\left\\{f:\\|f\\|_{\\phi}^{2}<\\infty, f(x)=-f(-x)\\right\\}$. In light of Theorems 2.2 and 2.4, we define a region $\\mathcal{R}$ in which GCT is informative,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}:=\\left\\{(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\lambda): \\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)>0, f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi), \\gamma \\in(0, \\infty), \\beta \\in(0, \\infty), \\lambda \\geq 1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand $\\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot):=\\{\\lambda:(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\lambda) \\in \\mathcal{R}\\}$. Within $\\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)$, the following test consistently detects the presence of a spike:\n\nCorollary 2.5. Let $f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi)$ satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 2.4 and $\\lambda_{0} \\in \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)$.

The thresholding level is independent of $\\lambda$ and $\\beta$, which are generally unknown:\n\nCorollary 2.6. Let $f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi)$ be a polynomial, $\\lambda \\in \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot), \\varepsilon \\in(1 / 4,1 / 2)$, and define the estimator\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{v}}:=\\frac{\\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\left(\\eta_{h}\\left(\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, n^{-\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)\\right.}{\\left\\|\\operatorname{sign}\\left(\\left(\\eta_{h}\\left(\\boldsymbol{u}_{1}, n^{-\\varepsilon}\\right)\\right)\\right]\\right\\|_{2}}\n$$\n\nFor any $D>0$, there exists $n_{\\varepsilon, D} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{v}}=\\boldsymbol{v}) \\geq 1-n^{-D}, \\quad \\forall n \\geq n_{\\varepsilon, D}\n$$\n\nCorollaries 2.5 and 2.6 follow directly from Theorems 2.2 and 2.4. In Corollary 2.6, we assume that $f$ is polynomial, since we only establish entrywise eigenvector bounds for polynomial kernels. While we believe this assumption is not strictly necessary, we leave this technicality for future work. Notwithstanding, recovery throughout $\\mathcal{R}$ is formally possible by polynomial-kernel GCT:\n\nLemma 2.7. For $f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi)$, let $f_{\\ell}:=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} a_{k} h_{k}$ denote its degree- $\\ell$ Hermite approximation.

For brevity, we omit the explicit dependence of $f^{*}$ on $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$.\n\nCorollary 2.9. There exists a kernel function $f^{*}$ satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.3 and a critical value $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{0}^{p}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)=\\mathcal{R}\\left(f^{*}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)=\\left(\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta), \\infty\\right)\n$$\n\nFor $k \\geq 2$, the Hermite coefficients of $f^{*}$ are of the form\n\n$$\na_{k}^{*}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\left(\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)-1\\right)^{k}}{\\sqrt{k!} \\beta^{k-1}} & k \\text { odd } \\\\ 0 & k \\text { even }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBy design, $f^{*}$ maximizes $\\tau\\left(f, \\beta, \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)\\right)$ over\n\n$$\n\\left\\{f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi):\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}=a_{1}^{*},\\|f\\|_{\\phi}=\\left\\|f^{*}\\right\\|_{\\phi}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn Section 3, we will numerically calculate $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$.\nOur final result demonstrates that as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$, GCT fails below the BBP transition.

As $\\beta$ decreases, the performance gap between GCT and PCA increases. Figure 3 plots the corresponding chance of recovery using the estimator of Corollary 2.6; empirically, GCT recovers $\\boldsymbol{v}$ with high probability above the detection threshold. For example, in the left plot, we recovered $\\boldsymbol{v}$ in $100 \\%$ of simulations with $\\lambda \\geq 1.7$.\n\nFigure 4 depicts the optimal phase transitions of GCT (right) and soft thresholding (left), for $\\gamma \\in\\{.5,1,1.5\\}$ and $\\beta \\in[.1,2.5]$. From Corollary 2.9 , recall the optimal transition of GCT is\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)=\\inf \\bigcup_{f \\in L_{0}^{p}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)\n$$\n\nWe define the optimal transition of soft thresholding analogously:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{s, *}(\\gamma, \\beta):=\\inf \\bigcup_{t \\geq 0} \\mathcal{R}\\left(\\eta_{s}(\\cdot, t), \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly to Corollary 2.9, the infimum is achieved for a specific thresholding level $t_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$.\nSurprisingly, soft thresholding is close to optimal: the left and right plots of Figure 4 are visually nearly indistinguishable, and the discrepancy between the plotted curves is less than $.05 .{ }^{6}$ Based on these calculations, we advocate soft thresholding; it is likely more robust to model misspecification than $f^{*}$, which is tailored to (1.7). Figure 4 also illustrates Corollary 2.10: as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty, \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ converges to the BBP transition.\n\nAs the optimal soft thresholding level depends on $\\lambda$ and $\\beta$, which are generally unknown, we propose to adaptively select the threshold to maximize the normalized spectral gap $\\left(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2}\\right) / \\lambda_{2}$. This procedure is motivated by Corollaries 2.5 and 2.6: since the presence of an outlier eigenvalue indicates that $\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)>0$, it is natural to choose the threshold that produces the most distinct outlier. This procedure compares well to optimal fixed-level thresholding, GCT with the kernel $\\eta_{s}(\\cdot, t_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta))$-see Figure 5 .\n\nEmpirically, the phenomena we uncover are not restricted to $\\sqrt{m} v_{1}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{m} v_{m} \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ as in (1.7). In Figure 6, we generate $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ according to\n\n$$\n\\xi_{1}, \\ldots, \\xi_{m} \\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\\sim} \\operatorname{unif}([-2,-1] \\cup[1,2])\n$$\n\nand set $\\boldsymbol{v}_{[1: m]}=\\boldsymbol{\\xi} /\\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\|_{2}$. The left plot depicts the cosine similarity of GCT with the kernel $\\eta_{s}(\\cdot, 2)$, which experiences a phase transition. The right plot depicts support recovery, measured as follows:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m}\\left(\\left|\\operatorname{supp}(\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{v}}) \\cap \\operatorname{supp}(\\boldsymbol{v})\\right|-\\left|\\operatorname{supp}(\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{v}}) \\cap([p] \\backslash \\operatorname{supp}(\\boldsymbol{v}))\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{v}}$ is defined in Corollary 2.6. That is, (3.2) counts the number of correctly identified entries minus the number of false positives, normalized by $m$. The signal detection and recovery thresholds seem aligned, as we expect from Section 2.3.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ To calculate $\\lambda_{s, *}(\\gamma, \\beta)$, we performed a grid search over the thresholding level $t$, computing for each the minimum value of $\\lambda$ such that $\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)=0$. To calculate $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$, we used the characterization of $f^{*}$ provided by Corollary 2.9 , and performed a grid search over possible values of $a_{1}^{*}$ and $\\left\\|f^{*}\\right\\|_{\\phi}$. For $f \\in L_{0}^{2}(\\phi)$, we approximated $s_{+}$using $\\tau\\left(f_{L}, \\beta, \\lambda\\right)$ in place of $\\tau(f, \\beta, \\lambda)$, where $f_{L}$ is the Hermite approximation of $f$ with degree $L=21$.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Cosine similarities for GCT with the kernel $\\eta_{s}(\\cdot, 2)$ (blue) and standard PCA (orange). There is close agreement between Theorem 2.4 (solid lines) and simulations (points, each representing the average over 50 simulations). On the left, $n=10,000, p=5,000$, and $m=25$, so $\\beta=1 / 4$. On the right, $n=10,000, p=5,000$, and $m=50$, so $\\beta=1 / 2$. Observe that the phase transition of GCT decreases with $\\beta$.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Simulations of GCT with the kernel $\\eta_{s}(\\cdot, 2)$ (blue) and standard PCA (orange). Points represent the fraction of 50 simulations in which $\\boldsymbol{v}$ was recovered. On the left, $n=10,000, p=$ 5,000 , and $m=25$, so $\\beta=1 / 4$. On the right, $n=10,000, p=5,000$, and $m=50$, so $\\beta=1 / 2$.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: Cosine similarities for soft thresholding with adaptive threshold selection (blue) and the optimal threshold $t_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ (orange). Here, $n=10,000$ and $p=5,000$, so $\\gamma=.5$. At each value of $\\beta \\in[.1,2]$, we set the signal strength to be $\\lambda=\\lambda_{s, *}(\\gamma, \\beta)+.1$. Each point represents the average of 50 simulations. Interestingly, for intermediate values of $\\beta$, adaptive thresholding empirically outperforms the optimal fixed level $t_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: The optimal phase transition of GCT (left) and soft thresholding (right), for $\\gamma \\in$ $\\{.5,1,1.5\\}$ and $\\beta \\in[.1,2.5]$. Notice that (1) $\\lambda_{s, *}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ and $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ are visually nearly indistinguishable, suggesting that soft thresholding is close to optimal, and (2) $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta) \\rightarrow 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$, supporting Lemma 2.10.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6: Simulations of GCT with the kernel $\\eta(\\cdot, 2)$ (blue) and standard PCA (orange). The non-zero elements of $\\boldsymbol{v}$ are generated from a uniform prior (3.1). The left plot displays cosine similarities; on the right, we plot support recovery, measured according to (3.2). Empirically, the signal detection and recovery thresholds seem aligned. Here, $n=10,000, p=5,000$, and $m=25$, so $\\beta=1 / 4$. Each point represents the average of 50 simulations.",

In contrast, in the setting where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is distributed uniformly on $\\mathbb{S}^{p-1}$, only those terms with $(\\ell, k)$ equal to $(0,1)$ or $(\\ell, \\ell)$ are non negligible.\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1.

Writing the coordinates of $\\boldsymbol{w}:=\\boldsymbol{S} \\boldsymbol{v}-\\boldsymbol{v}$ as\n\n$$\nw_{j}=\\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\boldsymbol{S}_{i j} v_{i}-v_{j}=\\frac{v_{j}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(z_{i j}^{2}-1\\right)+\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_{i j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}-z_{i j} v_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nthe independence of $\\left\\{z_{i j}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]}$ and $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{z}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}-z_{i j} v_{j}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]}$ implies $w_{j}$ is an average of i.i.d. sub-exponential variables. Therefore, using a Hoeffding inequality and a union bound,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{j \\in[\\rho]}\\left|w_{j}\\right|=O_{\\prec}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly bounding $\\|$ diag $(\\boldsymbol{S})-\\mathbf{I}_{p} \\|_{2}$, we obtain claim (1):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{Y})-\\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right\\|_{2} & \\leq\\left\\|\\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{S})-\\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right\\|_{2}+\\|\\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{X})\\|_{2} \\\\\n& \\leq \\sup _{j \\in[p]}\\left(\\left|n^{-1} \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}-1\\right|+c v_{j}^{2}+2(\\sqrt{\\lambda}-1)\\left|v_{j} w_{j}\\right|\\right) \\\\\n& \\prec n^{-1 / 2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, consider the expansion\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\odot \\ell}=\\sum_{\\substack{k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3} \\in[\\ell] \\\\ k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}=\\ell}}\\binom{\\ell}{k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3}} c^{k_{1}}(\\sqrt{\\lambda}-1)^{k_{2}+k_{3}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\odot\\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\\right)} \\odot \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\odot k_{3}}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\odot\\left(k_{1}+k_{3}\\right)} \\odot \\boldsymbol{w}^{\\odot k_{2}}\\right)^{\\top}\n$$\n\nthe first term of which is $c^{\\ell} m^{-(\\ell-1)} \\boldsymbol{v} \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}$ (corresponding to $k_{1}=\\ell, k_{2}=k_{3}=0$ ).

We shall prove $\\psi\\left(s_{+}\\right)>\\lambda_{+}$and $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ encircles exactly one eigenvalue of $\\boldsymbol{K}$ with probability $1-n^{-D}$ (for any $D>0$ ). Furthermore, considering an arbitrary, bounded contour $\\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\inf _{z \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\operatorname{Re}(z)>\\lambda_{+}$and $\\mathcal{C} \\cap \\mathcal{C}_{n}=\\emptyset$, an identical argument yields $\\mathcal{C}$ encircles no eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{K}$ with probability $1-n^{-D}$.

Let $f_{\\lambda}$ have Hermite coefficients $\\left\\langle f_{\\lambda}, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}=0$ and\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle f_{\\lambda}, h_{k}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{(\\lambda-1)^{k}}{\\sqrt{k!} \\beta^{k-1}} & k \\text { odd } \\\\ 0 & k \\text { even }\\end{cases} \\quad k \\neq 1\n$$\n\nGiven any $f \\in L_{o}^{2}(\\phi)$, consider the kernel\n\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_{\\lambda}:=\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi} h_{1}+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\|f\\|_{\\phi}^{2}-\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}^{2}}}{\\left\\|f_{\\lambda}\\right\\|_{\\phi}} f_{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nThe orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials implies $\\left\\|\\bar{f}_{\\lambda}\\right\\|_{\\phi}=\\|f\\|_{\\phi}$ and $\\left\\langle\\bar{f}_{\\lambda}, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}=\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}$. Moreover, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau(f, \\beta, \\lambda) & =\\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left\\langle f, h_{k}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}(\\lambda-1)^{k}}{\\sqrt{k!} \\beta^{k-1}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\sqrt{\\|f\\|_{\\phi}^{2}-\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}^{2}}\\left(\\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\lambda-1)^{2 k}}{k!\\beta^{2(k-1)}}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{\\|f\\|_{\\phi}^{2}-\\left\\langle f, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}^{2}}\\left\\|f_{\\lambda}\\right\\|_{\\phi} \\\\\n& =\\tau\\left(\\bar{f}_{\\lambda}, \\beta, \\lambda\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly to the proof of Lemma 2.8, these properties imply\n\n$$\n\\left[\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)\\right](f, \\lambda) \\leq\\left[\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)\\right]\\left(\\bar{f}_{\\lambda}, \\lambda\\right), \\quad \\forall \\lambda \\in \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)\n$$\n\nThus, since $\\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)$ is invariant under rescalings of $f$,\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{0}^{2}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)=\\bigcup_{a \\geq 0} \\bigcup_{\\lambda>1} \\mathcal{R}\\left(a h_{1}+f_{\\lambda}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nConsider $\\left\\{\\left(a_{k}, \\lambda_{k}\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\inf \\mathcal{R}\\left(a_{k} h_{1}+f_{\\lambda_{k}}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)=\\inf _{a \\geq 0, \\lambda \\geq 1} \\mathcal{R}\\left(a h_{1}+f_{\\lambda}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nAssuming $\\left\\{\\left\\|a_{k} h_{1}+f_{\\lambda_{k}}\\right\\|_{\\phi}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded without loss of generality, there exists a convergent subsequence $\\left\\{\\left(a_{k_{\\ell}}, \\lambda_{k_{\\ell}}\\right)\\right\\}_{\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}} ;$ let $a_{k_{\\ell}} \\rightarrow a_{*} \\geq 0$ and $\\lambda_{k_{\\ell}} \\rightarrow \\lambda_{*}>1$ as $\\ell \\rightarrow \\infty$, and define $f^{*}:=$ $a_{*} h_{1}+f_{\\lambda_{*}}$. As $\\left[\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)\\right](f, \\lambda)$ is continuous in the Hermite coefficients of $f$, we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}\\left(a_{k_{\\ell}} h_{1}+f_{\\lambda_{k_{\\ell}}}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{R}\\left(f^{*}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nTogether with Lemma 2.8, this yields\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{0}^{2}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)=\\mathcal{R}\\left(f^{*}, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nTo complete the proof, we note that (5.40) implies\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{*}=\\inf \\left\\{\\lambda \\geq 1:\\left[\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{+}\\right)\\right]\\left(f^{*}, \\lambda\\right)>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProof of Corollary 2.10. We first establish monotonicity of $\\beta \\mapsto \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$. Let $L_{o,+}^{2}(\\phi) \\subset L_{o}^{2}(\\phi)$ denote the subset of kernel functions with non-negative Hermite coefficients. By Lemma 2.8 and Corollary 2.9,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta), \\infty\\right)=\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{0}^{2}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)=\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{o,+}^{2}(\\phi)} \\mathcal{R}(f, \\gamma, \\beta, \\cdot)=\\bigcup_{f \\in L_{o,+}^{2}(\\phi)}\\left(\\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta), \\infty\\right)\n$$\n\nFor all $\\lambda>1$ and $f \\in L_{o,+}^{2}(\\phi), \\tau(f, \\beta, \\lambda)$ is non-increasing in $\\beta$, implying (similarly to the proof of Corollary 2.9) that $\\beta \\mapsto \\lambda_{*}(f, \\gamma, \\beta)$ is non-decreasing. Consequently, $\\beta \\mapsto \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ is nondecreasing. Since $\\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ is upper-bounded by the BBP transition (corresponding to the identity kernel), $\\lim _{\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$ exists and is at most $1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$.\n\nFix $\\lambda>\\lim _{\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda_{*}(\\gamma, \\beta)$; it suffices to prove that $\\lambda \\geq 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$. By (5.43), there exists a sequence of sparsity levels and kernels $\\left\\{\\left(\\beta_{k}, f_{k}\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ satisfying $\\beta_{k} \\rightarrow \\infty$ and, for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\lambda \\in \\mathcal{R}\\left(f_{k}, \\gamma, \\beta_{k}, \\cdot\\right)$, $f_{k} \\in L_{o,+}^{2}(\\phi)$, and $\\left\\|f_{k}\\right\\|_{\\phi}=1$. For brevity, denote\n\n$$\na_{1, k}:=\\left\\langle f_{k}, h_{1}\\right\\rangle_{\\phi}, \\quad \\tau_{k}:=\\tau\\left(f_{k}, \\beta_{k}, \\lambda\\right), \\quad s_{k}:=s_{+}\\left(f_{k}, \\beta_{k}, \\lambda\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that (1) if there exists $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\tau_{k}=0$, the claim follows from $\\mathcal{R}\\left(f_{k}, \\gamma, \\beta_{k}, \\cdot\\right)=$ $(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}, \\infty),(2) \\tau_{k} \\rightarrow 0$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ since $\\left\\|f_{k}\\right\\|_{\\phi}=1$, and (3) $a_{1, k}>0$ for all sufficiently large $k$. The third fact follows from Remark 2.2, which implies that if $a_{1, k}=0, \\lambda \\in \\mathcal{R}\\left(f_{k}, \\gamma, \\beta_{k}, \\cdot\\right)$ if and only if $\\tau_{k}>\\sqrt{\\gamma}$ (which contradicts $\\tau_{k} \\rightarrow 0$ ). Henceforth, we assume without loss of generality that $a_{1, k}, \\tau_{k}>0$. From Corollary 1.2 and Theorem 2.2, recall that $\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{k}\\right)>0, s_{k} \\in\\left(-1 /\\left(a_{1, k} \\gamma\\right), 0\\right)$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_{k} & =\\frac{1}{2 a_{1, k} \\gamma \\tau_{k}}\\left(-a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)-\\tau_{k}+\\sqrt{\\left(a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)+\\tau_{k}\\right)^{2}-4 a_{1, k} \\gamma \\tau_{k}}\\right) \\\\\n\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{k}\\right) & =\\frac{1}{s_{k}^{2}}-\\frac{a_{1, k}^{2} \\gamma}{\\left(1+a_{1, k} \\gamma s_{k}\\right)^{2}}-\\gamma\\left(1-a_{1, k}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $a_{1, k}$ is bounded away from zero. Taking a subsequence if necessary, let $a_{1, k} \\rightarrow$ $a_{1} \\in(0,1]$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} s_{k} & =-\\frac{1}{a_{1}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)} \\\\\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} s_{k}^{2} \\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{k}\\right) & =1-\\frac{\\gamma}{(\\lambda-1)^{2}}-\\frac{\\gamma\\left(1-a_{1}^{2}\\right)}{a_{1}^{2}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)^{2}} \\leq 1-\\frac{\\gamma}{(\\lambda-1)^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $s_{k}^{2} \\psi\\left(s_{k}\\right) \\geq 0$, this implies $\\lambda \\geq 1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}$. In fact, as the inequality is strict unless $a_{1}=1$ (corresponding to the identity kernel), we conclude that PCA is the unique optimal kernel in the limit $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nIt remains to prove $a_{1, k} \\asymp 1$. Assume towards a contradiction that $a_{1, k} \\rightarrow 0$. There are three cases to consider: (1) $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\rightarrow 0$, (2) $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\rightarrow \\infty$, and (3) $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\asymp 1$. In each case, we will argue that $s_{k} \\rightarrow-\\infty$, implying\n\n$$\n\\liminf _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{k}\\right) \\leq \\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{s_{k}^{2}}-\\gamma\\left(1-a_{1, k}^{2}\\right)=-\\gamma\n$$\n\nand contradicting $\\psi^{\\prime}\\left(s_{k}\\right)>0$.\n(1) If $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\rightarrow 0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_{k} & =\\frac{1}{2 a_{1, k} \\gamma}\\left(-(\\lambda+\\gamma-1) \\frac{a_{1, k}}{\\tau_{k}}-1+\\sqrt{1+2(\\lambda+\\gamma-1) \\frac{a_{1, k}}{\\tau_{k}}+(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)^{2} \\frac{a_{1, k}^{2}}{\\tau_{k}^{2}}-\\frac{4 \\gamma a_{1, k}}{\\tau_{k}}}\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\frac{1}{\\tau_{k}}+O\\left(\\frac{a_{1, k}}{\\tau_{k}^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis yields $s_{k} \\rightarrow-\\infty$ since $\\tau_{k}>0$ tends to zero.\n(2) If $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\rightarrow \\infty$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{1, k} s_{k} & =\\frac{a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)+\\tau_{k}}{2 \\gamma \\tau_{k}}\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4 a_{1, k} \\gamma \\tau_{k}}{\\left(a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)+\\tau_{k}\\right)^{2}}}-1\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\frac{a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)+\\tau_{k}}{2 \\gamma \\tau_{k}}\\left(\\frac{2 \\gamma \\tau_{k}}{a_{1, k}(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)^{2}}+O\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{k}^{2}}{a_{1, k}^{2}}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis yields $a_{1, k} s_{k} \\rightarrow-1 /(\\lambda+\\gamma-1)$ and $s_{k} \\rightarrow-\\infty$.\n\n(3) If $a_{1, k} / \\tau_{k} \\asymp 1$, similarly to the previous case, we have $a_{1, k} s_{k} \\asymp 1$ and $s_{k} \\rightarrow-\\infty$.",

Given a compact set $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ such that $\\inf _{z \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\operatorname{Re}(z)>\\lambda_{+}$, the extension from pointwise to uniform convergence is made by restricting calculations to the event $\\left\\{\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{K}_{0}(f)\\right\\|_{2} \\leq(1+\\varepsilon) \\lambda_{+}\\right\\}$, which occurs with probability at least $1-n^{-D}$ by Lemma 5.1.

We follow the $k$-graph approach in [26].

We first develop a polynomial approximation of $f^{\\prime}$; this approximation is uniform on closed intervals in which $f$ is twice differentiable.\n\nLemma C.1. Suppose $f(x)$ is odd and there exist finitely many points $x_{1}<\\ldots<x_{k}$ such that $f(x)$ is twice-differentiable on $\\left(-\\infty, x_{1}\\right),\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(x_{k-1}, x_{k}\\right),\\left(x_{k}, \\infty\\right)$. Additionally, assume there exists a constant $c>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\max \\left(|f(x)|,\\left\\|f^{\\prime}(x)\\right|,\\left|f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)\\right|\\right) \\leq c e^{c|x|}, \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nGiven $\\varepsilon>0$, let $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}:=\\bigcup_{1 \\leq i \\leq k}\\left(x_{i}-\\varepsilon / k, x_{i}+\\varepsilon / k\\right)$, so that the Lebesgue measure or length of $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$ is at most $\\varepsilon$. There exists an odd polynomial $q_{\\varepsilon}$ such that the residual $\\kappa(x):=f(x)-q_{\\varepsilon}(x)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\left|\\kappa^{\\prime}(x)\\right| \\leq C \\varepsilon e^{C|x|} & x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\\\\n\\left|\\kappa^{\\prime}(x)\\right| \\leq C e^{C|x|} & x \\in \\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\backslash\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $C>0$ is a constant depending only on $c$.\nThe proof of Lemma C. 1 is deferred to Section C.1. We stress that the specific conditions that Theorem 2.3 and Lemma C. 1 place on $f$ are not the focus of this paper and are likely improvablewe have developed a minimal extension of [26] that accommodates soft thresholding.\n\nLemma 5.4 is an immediate consequence of Lemma C. 1 and the following result:\nTheorem C.2. Suppose that $\\kappa(x)$ is odd, continuous everywhere, and differentiable at all but finitely many points, with the derivative satisfying (C.1) wherever it exists. Denote by $\\boldsymbol{K}(\\kappa)$ the corresponding transformed matrix (1.4). Almost surely,\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\|\\boldsymbol{K}(\\kappa)\\| \\lesssim \\varepsilon^{1 / 4} \\quad \\text { as } \\quad n, p, m \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to proving Theorem C. 2 by adapting the proof of Theorem 1.6 in [26].\n\nFor brevity, we will use the shorthand $\\boldsymbol{K}:=\\boldsymbol{K}(\\kappa)$. We write $\\boldsymbol{Z} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{1 / 2} / \\sqrt{n}=\\sqrt{\\lambda-1} \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{N}$, where $\\boldsymbol{N}$ has i.i.d. $\\mathcal{N}(0,1 / n)$ entries; and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, which collects the factor loadings, has i.i.d. $\\mathcal{N}(0,1 / n)$ entries. Accordingly,\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Y}=(\\lambda-1)\\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\|^{2} \\boldsymbol{v} \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}+\\sqrt{\\lambda-1} \\boldsymbol{v}\\left(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right)^{\\top}+\\sqrt{\\lambda-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\right) \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top}+\\boldsymbol{N}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N}\n$$\n\nIn what follows, we think of $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ as fixed, so that $\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{0} \\leq m,\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{\\infty} \\lesssim m^{-1 / 2},\\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\|_{2} \\lesssim 1$. We first bound the expectation of $\\boldsymbol{K}$; note that it is not zero, owing to the presence of the spike.\n\nLemma C.3. Under the conditions of Theorem C.2,\n\n$$\n\\|\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{K}]\\|_{2} \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nThe proof appears below in Section C.2. The core of the proof of Theorem 1.6 in [26] is a delicate net argument. The idea, originally due to Lata\u0142a [44], is to construct an explicit net of the sphere where the number of points that have large $\\ell^{\\infty}$ norm is small.\n\nDenote $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}}:=\\boldsymbol{K}-\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{K}]$. For $\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p},\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|,\\|\\boldsymbol{y}\\| \\leq 1$, let $F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N}):=\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}} \\boldsymbol{y}$, where we think of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}}$ as a function of $\\boldsymbol{N}$. A key step in [26] is a bound on the gradient of $F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}$.\n\nLemma C.4. The following holds with probability one:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{N}} F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right\\|^{2} \\leq & 8\\|\\boldsymbol{N}\\|^{2}\\|\\boldsymbol{y}\\|_{\\infty} \\max _{1 \\leq \\ell \\leq p}\\left(\\sum_{i \\neq \\ell}\\left(\\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i \\ell}\\right)\\right)^{4}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\\\\n& +8(\\lambda-1)\\|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}\\|^{2}\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{\\infty}^{2} \\max _{i \\leq \\ell \\leq p} \\sum_{i \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\backslash\\{\\ell\\}}\\left|\\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i \\ell}\\right)\\right|^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe proof is given below in Section C.3. As in [26], we restrict attention to a high-probability subset of matrices $\\boldsymbol{N}$ on which $F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})$ is Lipschitz. Fix $D>0$. For sufficiently large $C=C(D)$, let $\\mathcal{G} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ be the subset of matrices $\\boldsymbol{N}$ satisfying\n\n(1) $\\|\\boldsymbol{N}\\| \\leq C(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma})^{2}$,\n(2) $\\max _{1 \\leq \\ell \\leq p} \\sum_{i=1, i \\neq \\ell}^{p}\\left(\\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i \\ell}\\right)\\right)^{4} \\leq p C \\varepsilon$,\n(3) $\\max _{1 \\leq \\ell \\leq p} \\sum_{i \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\boldsymbol{v}) \\backslash\\{\\ell\\}}\\left|\\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i \\ell}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\leq m C \\varepsilon$.\n\nLemma C.5. Under the conditions of Theorem C.2, $\\mathbb{P}(\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}) \\lesssim n^{-D}$.\nThe proof is essentially identical to that of Lemma 3.1 in [26] and is omitted. Note that Lemma C. 4 implies that $F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}$ is Lipschitz on $\\mathcal{G}$, with\n\n$$\nL:=\\left\\|F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{G}} \\|^{2} \\sup _{L \\mathrm{lip}} \\lesssim\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\sqrt{p \\varepsilon}+\\|\\xi\\|^{2}\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{\\infty}^{2} m \\varepsilon \\lesssim\\|y\\|_{\\infty} \\sqrt{p \\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nHere, we used that $\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|_{\\infty} \\lesssim m^{-1 / 2}$ and $\\varepsilon<1$ (by assumption), and $\\|\\xi\\| \\lesssim 1$ (note that $p\\|y\\|_{\\infty}^{2} \\geq 1$, hence the first term is always the dominant one).\n\nWe now show that $F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}$ concentrates, using the Gaussian Lipschitz concentration inequality. To this end, recall a well-known result on Lipschitz extension.\n\nTheorem C. 6 (Kirszbraun). Let $F: \\mathcal{G} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}, \\mathcal{G} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}}$, be L-Lipschitz. Then $F$ has an $L$ Lipschitz extension to $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\tilde{F}: \\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}, \\quad \\tilde{F} \\mid{ }_{\\mathcal{G}}=F\n$$\n\nWhen $d_{2}=1$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ is compact, there is a simple construction:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{F}(x)=\\min _{y \\in \\mathcal{G}}(F(y)+L\\|x-y\\|)\n$$\n\nLet $\\tilde{F}_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}$ be a Lipschitz extension of $\\left.F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}\\right|_{\\mathcal{G}}$.\nLemma C.7. Under the conditions of Theorem C.2, for $\\tilde{D}=\\tilde{D}(D)$ that can be made arbitrarily small,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\tilde{F}_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right]\\right| \\lesssim n^{-\\tilde{D}}\n$$\n\nProof. For $\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}$\n\n$$\n\\left|F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right| \\leq\\|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{K}}\\|_{2} \\leq\\|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{K}}\\|_{F}, \\quad\\left|\\tilde{F}_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right| \\leq F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(0)+L\\|\\boldsymbol{N}\\|_{F}\n$$\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}}\\right]\\right| & \\leq\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left|F_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N})\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}(\\mathbb{P}(\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}))^{1 / 2} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\|\\boldsymbol{K}\\|_{F}^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}(\\mathbb{P}(\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}))^{1 / 2} \\lesssim p n^{-D / 2} \\lesssim n^{-\\tilde{D}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly one can bound $\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\tilde{F}_{\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}}(\\boldsymbol{N}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\boldsymbol{N} \\notin \\mathcal{G}}\\right]\\right|$.\nLemma C.8.

Gaussian Lipschitz concentration.\nFinally, we apply the net argument of [26]. As in Section 2 of [26], let\n\n$$\nD_{2}^{p}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}:\\|\\boldsymbol{y}\\| \\leq 1, y_{i}^{2} \\in\\left\\{0,1,2^{-1}, \\ldots, 2^{-(K+3)}\\right\\}\\right\\}, \\quad K:=\\left\\lceil\\log _{2} p\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nLemma C. 9 (Lemma 3.3 of [26]). For $\\boldsymbol{A}$ symmetric, $\\|\\boldsymbol{A}\\|_{2} \\leq 10 \\max _{\\boldsymbol{y} \\in D_{2}^{p}} \\boldsymbol{y}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{y}$.\nFor $l=0,1, \\ldots, K+3$, define the projection $\\pi_{l \\backslash(l-1)}$ (resp. $\\pi_{l}$ ) on dyadic scale $l$ (resp. $\\leq l$ ):\n\n$$\n\\pi_{l \\backslash(l-1)}(\\boldsymbol{y})_{i}=y_{i} \\mathbf{1}_{y_{i}^{2}=2^{-l}}, \\quad \\pi_{l}(\\boldsymbol{y})_{i}=y_{i} \\mathbf{1}_{y_{i}^{2} \\geq 2^{-l}}\n$$\n\nAs shown in [26, Eq.

By Lemma C.9, (C.5), and (C.8), it suffices to show that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{y \\in D_{2}^{p}} \\pi_{l}(\\boldsymbol{y})^{\\top} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}} \\pi_{l \\backslash(l-1)}(\\boldsymbol{y}), \\sup _{y \\in D_{2}^{p}} \\pi_{l \\backslash(l-1)}(\\boldsymbol{y})^{\\top} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}} \\pi_{l-1}(\\boldsymbol{y}) \\lesssim n^{-\\tilde{D}}+\\varepsilon t_{l}, \\quad \\ell \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, K+3\\}\n$$\n\nwith high probability.

Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\kappa\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right)-\\kappa\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right) & =\\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right]} \\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right) d t \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\cap\\left(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}-\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)} \\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right) d t+\\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\backslash\\left(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}-\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)} \\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right) d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$ is the set from Lemma C.1. We can bound each term using (C.1). Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\cap\\left(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}-\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)} \\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right) d t\\right| & \\leq\\left|\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\cap \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\right| \\cdot \\max _{t \\in\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\cap\\left(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}-\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)}\\left|\\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right)\\right| \\\\\n& \\lesssim \\varepsilon \\cdot e^{c_{1}\\left|\\eta_{i, j}\\right|} e^{c_{1}\\left|\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right|} \\cdot \\lesssim e^{c_{1}\\left|\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right|} \\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used that $\\eta_{i, j} \\lesssim 1$ (thinking of $\\lambda$ as constant), since $\\left|v_{i} v_{j}\\right| \\in\\{0,1 / \\sqrt{n}\\}$. As for the other term,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right] \\backslash\\left(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}-\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)} \\kappa^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right) d t\\right| \\lesssim \\int_{\\left[0, \\eta_{i, j}\\right]}\\left(e^{c_{1}\\left|\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}+t\\right|} \\varepsilon\\right) d t \\lesssim e^{c_{1}\\left|\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right|} \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1}\\left|A_{i, j}\\right|}\\right] \\lesssim 1$ (again, thinking of $\\lambda$ as constant). For completeness' sake, let us verify this for the heavier-tailed term $\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{N}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N}_{j}}\\right]$. Conditioned on $\\boldsymbol{N}_{i}$, $\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{N}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N}_{j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{N}_{i}\\right\\|^{2}\\right)$. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1} \\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{N}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N}_{j}}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1}^{2}\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{N}_{i}\\right\\|^{2} / 2}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1}^{2} \\chi^{2}(n) /(2 n)}\\right]=\\left(1-c_{1}^{2} / n\\right)^{-n / 2} \\approx e^{-c_{1}^{2} / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi^{2}(n)$ denotes a chi-squared random variable with $n$ degrees of freedom (note that $\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{N}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{N}_{j}$ tends to a $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ random variable.)\n\nNow, note that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right]=0$, since $\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}$ has a symmetric distribution. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{K}_{i, j}\\right]\\right|=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\left|\\mathbb{E} \\kappa\\left(\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}\\right)-\\mathbb{E} \\kappa\\left(\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right)\\right| \\lesssim \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{c_{1}\\left|\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\\right|}\\right] \\lesssim \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n\nAlso note that $\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i j}$ differs from $\\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}$ only when $i, j \\in \\operatorname{supp}(v)$; accordingly, $\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{K}]$ has at most $m^{2} \\asymp n$ nonzero entries. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\|\\mathbb{E} \\boldsymbol{K}\\|_{2} \\leq\\|\\mathbb{E} \\boldsymbol{K}\\|_{F} \\lesssim m \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\varepsilon \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n$$",

  "abstract": "This work studies estimation of sparse principal components in high\ndimensions. Specifically, we consider a class of estimators based on kernel\nPCA, generalizing the covariance thresholding algorithm proposed by Krauthgamer\net al. (2015). Focusing on Johnstone's spiked covariance model, we investigate\nthe \"critical\" sparsity regime, where the sparsity level $m$, sample size $n$,\nand dimension $p$ each diverge and $m/\\sqrt{n} \\rightarrow \\beta$, $p/n\n\\rightarrow \\gamma$.\n  Within this framework, we develop a fine-grained understanding of signal\ndetection and recovery. Our results establish a detectability phase transition,\nanalogous to the Baik--Ben Arous--P\\'ech\\'e (BBP) transition: above a certain\nthreshold -- depending on the kernel function, $\\gamma$, and $\\beta$ -- kernel\nPCA is informative. Conversely, below the threshold, kernel principal\ncomponents are asymptotically orthogonal to the signal. Notably, above this\ndetection threshold, we find that consistent support recovery is possible with\nhigh probability. Sparsity plays a key role in our analysis, and results in\nmore nuanced phenomena than in related studies of kernel PCA with delocalized\n(dense) components. Finally, we identify optimal kernel functions for detection\n-- and consequently, support recovery -- and numerical calculations suggest\nthat soft thresholding is nearly optimal.",
