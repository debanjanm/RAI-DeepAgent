However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindbladian parity-time ( $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ ) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations in a wide class of systems. This includes one-collective spin models, which have been studied thoroughly in the context of dissipative continuous time crystals, and spatially extended bipartite bosonic systems with conserved particle number. By making an analogy to non-reciprocal phase transitions, we demonstrate that a transition point from the dynamical phase is associated with spontaneous PT symmetry breaking that typically corresponds to a critical exceptional point. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial state dependence. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry at the microscopic level implies a nonlinear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.\n\n\nIntroduction. - Exploration of phases of matter unique to systems out of equilibrium is an important problem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. A paradigmatic example of such nonequilibrium exotic states of matter is a continuous time crystal [1-3], which spontaneously breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry into a discrete one. This has been proven impossible in equilibrium [4], but it is possible to exist out of equilibrium.\n\nThose in open systems, called dissipative continuous time crystals (DCTCs), have been shown to arise in various quantum systems. This includes driven-dissipative collective spin (that consists of all-to-all coupled two-level systems) [5-8], bosonic [9-12], fermionic [13], and spin$1 / 2$ systems [14-16], and have recently been observed experimentally [17-21]. Many of these, in the classical limit, correspond to the limit cycles or closed orbits in nonlinear dynamical systems, which have traditionally been studied in various classical contexts, including chemistry and biology [22]. Curiously, for collective spin systems, it has been suggested that the emergence of these macroscopic oscillations is related to some set of microscopic symmetry such as $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}[6,7]$ or parity-time ( $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ ) symmetry [23]. However, they are based on explicit calculations for several concrete models, and the reasoning for such symmetry requirements and their exact role is yet to be elucidated.\n\nOne of the reasons for such difficulties is that, in the GKSL equation, extracting the physical consequences of symmetries is not always trivial. For unitary symmetries,\nsuch as $U(1)$-symmetry, they indicate the existence of a conserved charge [24] or the occurrence of phase transition with their symmetry breaking in the steady-state [25, 26]. However, for anti-unitary symmetry, such as $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, it is difficult to extract such conclusions. Technically, this is due to the property that the operator corresponding to this symmetry does not commute with the generator of the dynamics (i.e., the non-shifted Lindbladian), in contrast to conventional symmetries.\n\nIn this Letter, despite the challenges mentioned above, we show that a $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry at a microscopic level generically implies the emergence of DCTCs in a wide class of systems. Specifically, we establish that bipartite bosonic systems with $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry and conserved particle numbers, which includes spatially extended systems and those that can be mapped to collective spin systems, generically exhibit time-dependent phases that, interestingly, have initial-state dependence. This is shown by connecting the two different notions of $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetries for microscopic and macroscopic quantities developed in different contexts. We prove that, if the GKSL equation has a Lindbladian $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ (L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ ) symmetry at the microscopic level [23, 27], its mean-field equation has nonlinear PT (n-PT) symmetry [28, 29] and its PT-symmetric solution generically exhibits persistent oscillations. We demonstrate that transition points from the dynamical phase are associated with spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking. The transition points are typically marked by so-called critical exceptional points (CEPs), where the criticality occurs by the coalescence of collective excitation mode to a zero\n\nmode [29-37]. Finally, we demonstrate our argument for a one-collective spin model which can be mapped to two-boson systems with conserved particle number.\n\nOur work provides an intriguing connection to a class of nonequilibrium phase transitions called non-reciprocal phase transitions [29-31], which are also characterized by CEPs. In an active (classical) system where the detailed balance is broken, constituents do not necessarily satisfy the action-reaction symmetry (e.g., particle A attracts particle B but B repulses A). In such systems, it was found that a phase transition from a static to a timedependent phase occurs, where the latter corresponds to a phase where collective degrees of freedom exhibits a persistent many-body chase-and-runaway motion [29-31].\n\nInterestingly, the symmetry (and its breaking) of bipartite bosonic systems with conserved particle number considered in this work is conceptionally similar to those of non-reciprocal phase transitions, but with an important difference originating from their physical context [38]. In particular, while the former breaks the PT symmetry, the latter breaks the anti-PT symmetry. This subtle difference leads to significant physical consequences. For our systems, linear stability analysis reveals that all the physical PT-symmetric fixed points are center types (also called neutrally stable fixed points), implying the presence of persistent periodic closed orbits. Our analysis also shows that the nature of the transition in DCTCs has an unusual property compared to the conventional symmetry breaking that a pair of stable and unstable solutions appear instead of steady-state degeneracy in a symmetry-broken phase. These are in contrast to non-reciprocal systems, where the anti-PT-symmetric (broken) phase has a unique (two) stable fixed point (limit cycles) as their stationary states [29-31].\n\nLindbladian $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. - In open quantum systems where the evolution of states is completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) Markovian, the time evolution of the density matrix $\\rho(t)$ is described by the GKSL equation [39, 40], $\\partial_{t} \\rho=\\check{\\mathcal{L}} \\rho=-i[H, \\rho]+\\sum_{\\mu} \\check{\\mathcal{D}}\\left[L_{\\mu}\\right] \\rho$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian, $L_{\\mu}$ is the Lindblad operator, and $\\check{\\mathcal{L}}$ is the Lindbladian. Here, the dissipation superoperator $\\check{\\mathcal{D}}[L]$ is defined as $\\check{\\mathcal{D}}[L] \\rho=2 L \\rho L^{\\dagger}-L^{\\dagger} L \\rho-\\rho L^{\\dagger} L$.\n\nWe say that $\\check{\\mathcal{L}}$ is $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetric when the following relation is satisfied $[23,27,41,42]$ :\n\n$$\n\\check{\\mathcal{L}}\\left[\\mathbb{P T}(H) ; \\mathbb{P T}\\left(L_{\\mu}\\right), \\mu=1,2, \\cdots\\right]=\\check{\\mathcal{L}}\\left[H ; L_{\\mu}, \\mu=1,2, \\cdots\\right]\n$$\n\nwith $\\mathbb{P T}(O):=P T O^{\\dagger}(P T)^{-1}$, where the parity operator $P$ and time reversal operator $T$ are defined as operators that satisfies $P^{2}=1, P=P^{\\dagger}$, and $[P, T]=0$. When this holds, the GKSL equation can generally be written as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho=-i[H, \\rho]+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\check{\\mathcal{D}}\\left[L_{\\mu}\\right]+\\check{\\mathcal{D}}\\left[\\mathbb{P T}\\left(L_{\\mu}\\right)\\right]\\right) \\rho\n$$\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian $H$ has the conventional PT symmetry $[H, P T]=0[43-45]$.\n\nWe remark that our L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) is different from the $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry for a shifted Lindbladian analyzed in Refs. [46-49] defined as anti-pseudo Hermicity [46, 50]. The consequence of $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) considered here turns out to be very different: as shown below, the $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry and its spontaneous breaking implies the emergence of phase transitions to steady state properties (including stationary oscillation) in the thermodynamic limit, not only their spectral properties (as shown in Table A. 1 in Supplemental Material (SM) Sec. A [51]).\n\nNonlinear PT symmetry for mean-field equation.- In the following, we will show that the L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) in dissipative bosonic systems puts a strong constraint on its mean-field dynamics. We define the parity operator $P$ as a permutation acting on the Fock state of $l$-bosons $\\left.\\left.\\left.\\left|n_{1}, n_{2}, \\ldots, n_{l}\\right\\rangle\\right.\\right.$ as $P\\left.\\left.\\left|n_{1}, n_{2}, \\ldots, n_{l}\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle\\left.\\right| n_{i+1}\\right\\rangle, n_{i+2}\\left.\\left.2_{2}, \\ldots, n_{i+l}\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle$ that satisfies $P^{2}=1$. Here, $\\sigma:\\{1,2, \\ldots, l\\} \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, l\\}$ is a permutation and $n_{j}:=a_{j j}^{\\dagger} a_{j}$ denotes the particle number in the $j$-th particle with the bosonic annihilation (creation) operator $a\\left(a^{\\dagger}\\right)$. The parity operator acts on the bosonic annihilation operators as $P a_{j} P^{-1}=a_{i+1 j}$. The time-reversal operator $T$ acts as complex conjugation $i \\rightarrow-i$.\n\nBelow, we restrict ourselves to the case where the total particle number $N:=\\sum_{j} n_{j}$ is conserved and the filling is large $v:=N / l \\gg 1$. In this case, a mean-field approximation is justified, where the density operator can be approximated as $\\rho=\\prod_{j}\\left|\\alpha_{j}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\alpha_{j}\\right|$, where $\\left|\\alpha_{j}\\right\\rangle$ is a coherent state satisfying $a_{j}\\left|\\alpha_{j}\\right\\rangle=\\alpha_{j}\\left|\\alpha_{j}\\right\\rangle$ with $\\alpha_{j} \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe set of the mean-field equation is written in the form $i \\partial_{t} \\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{q})$ with a function $\\mathbf{f}=\\left(f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{l}\\right): \\mathbb{C}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{1}$ and $\\mathbf{q}:=\\left\\langle\\alpha_{1}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle\\alpha_{2}\\right\\rangle, \\ldots,\\left\\langle\\alpha_{l}\\right\\rangle^{T} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{1}$. Here, $\\langle\\cdot\\rangle$ denotes $\\operatorname{Tr}[\\cdot \\rho]$. To put constraints on their form, we find it useful to define the notion of symmetry of nonlinear dynamical systems. The nonlinear dynamical system is said to be nonlinear X symmetric (n-X symmetric) if $\\tilde{X} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{q})=\\mathbf{f}(\\tilde{X} \\mathbf{q})$, where $\\tilde{X}$ is a unitary or anti-unitary operator. (Symmetry operations in nonlinear dynamical systems will be denoted with tildes to distinguish them from those of operators.) From the mean-field equation, one finds that if $\\mathbf{q}(t)$ is a solution, then $\\tilde{X} \\mathbf{q}(t)$ is also a solution.\n\nIn this Letter, we will be concerned with the case of $\\tilde{X}=\\tilde{P} \\tilde{T}$, where we define a parity operator as $\\tilde{P} \\mathbf{f}=$ $\\left(f_{\\sigma(1)}, f_{\\sigma(2)}, \\ldots, f_{\\sigma(l)}\\right)^{T}$ and the time-reversal operation as $\\tilde{T} \\mathbf{f}(t)=\\mathbf{f}^{*}(-t)$, so that the n-PT symmetry $\\tilde{P} \\tilde{T} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{q}(t))=$ $\\mathbf{f}(\\tilde{P} \\tilde{T} \\mathbf{q}(t))$ reads\n\n$$\n\\tilde{P} \\mathbf{f}^{*}(\\mathbf{q}(t))=\\mathbf{f}\\left(\\tilde{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}(t)\\right)\n$$\n\nWith the above preparations, we are now ready to state the main theorem of this paper:\n\nTheorem For a dissipative bosonic system with conserved particle number and L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1), where\n\nthe parity operator is a permutation with $P^{2}=1$, its mean-field nonlinear dynamical system has n-PT symmetry (3).\n\nWe provide a proof in SM Section B [51].\nLinear stability analysis.-So far, we have established that when the GKSL equation has the L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (Eq. (1)), the corresponding order parameter dynamics for a large filling $v$ have n-PT symmetry (Eq. (3)). For conventional symmetries, the steady state (or thermal state in equilibrium) may spontaneously break. For example, a paramagnetic phase in the Ising model with a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry may destabilize into a ferromagnetic phase that spontaneously breaks the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry.\n\nWe show below that a similar destabilization of PTsymmetric state in Eq. (3) may occur, implying a spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking in the steady state. Let us first define what we mean by spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking. The PT symmetry of a fixed point $\\mathbf{q}$ is said to be unbroken if $\\mathbf{q}=\\bar{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}$, while, if not, it is spontaneously broken.\n\nTo further get the insight of the PT-symmetric solution, we focus on a bipartite system with a uniform solution, the minimal case with spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking among the dissipative bosonic systems. For bipartite systems with sublattices $A$ and $B$, this solution is characterized by two order parameters $b_{A}:=2 \\sum_{i \\in A}\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle / l$ and $b_{B}:=2 \\sum_{i \\in B}\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle / l$. Since the bosonic particle number is conserved, that is, the system has (strong) $U(1)$ symmetry, the mean-field equation is independent of each phase $\\theta_{A}, \\theta_{B}$ in the polar coordinates $b_{A}=r_{A} e^{i \\theta_{A}}, b_{B}=r_{B} e^{i \\theta_{B}}$. Together with the property that the total number is conserved $r_{A}^{2}+r_{B}^{2}=$ const., the mean-field equation can be specified to the form\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}=\\binom{G\\left(r_{A}, r_{B}, \\Delta \\theta\\right) / r_{A}}{-G\\left(r_{A}, r_{B}, \\Delta \\theta\\right) / r_{B}}, \\text { with } \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}:=\\left(r_{A}, r_{B}, \\Delta \\theta\\right)^{T} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3} \\text { and the phase difference }\n$$\n\n$\\Delta \\theta:=\\theta_{A}-\\theta_{B}$. Here, the function $G(H)$ is symmetric (anti-symmetric) for the exchange of amplitudes $r_{A}$, $r_{B}$. As expected by Theorem, Eq. (4) also has n-PT symmetry where the parity operator satisfies the relation $\\bar{P} \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}=\\left(r_{B}, r_{A}, \\Delta \\theta\\right)^{T}$.\n\nNow, let us perform the linear stability analysis around a $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric fixed point by calculating the Jacobian matrix $J$ with $\\partial_{t} \\delta \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}=J \\delta \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}$, where $\\delta \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}:=\\left(\\delta r_{B}, \\delta \\Delta \\theta\\right)^{T}$ represents the fluctuation vector around the fixed point. Here, we have eliminated the $r_{A}$ component using the property that the total particle number is conserved. From Eq.(4), the Jacobian around the PT-symmetric fixed point with $r_{A}=r_{B}$ can be simplified to the form\n\n$$\nJ=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & \\alpha \\\\\n\\beta & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha:=-\\left.\\partial_{A \\theta} G / r_{B}\\right|_{x x}, \\beta:=\\left.\\left(\\partial_{r_{B}} H-\\partial_{r_{A}} H\\right)\\right|_{x x} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Here, quantities with \" $\\left.\\right|_{x x}$ \" describe the value at the fixed point.\n\nThe excitation spectra and modes of Eq. (5) are given by $\\lambda= \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha \\beta}$ and $\\delta \\mathbf{q}^{\\prime}=\\left( \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha / \\beta}, 1\\right)^{T}$. Physically, the real part of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ characterizes the growth rate of the fluctuations, while the imaginary part represents the oscillation frequency. For the PT-symmetric solution to be physical, $\\alpha \\beta$ must be non-positive, since otherwise $(\\alpha \\beta>0)$ the eigenvalue would have a positive real part, implying the diverging growth of fluctuation and, therefore, the solution is unstable.\n\nIn the physical case of $\\alpha \\beta<0$, purely imaginary eigenvalues emerge. This fixed point type is called center [52]. The finite imaginary part implies the occurrence of periodic closed orbits around the fixed point, while the vanishing real part shows that the oscillation is persistent. As the decay is absent, this implies that the resulting orbits are initial state dependent. It is interesting that despite the presence of dissipation, the PT symmetry of the system ensures the presence of such marginal orbits.\n\nStarting from this PT-symmetric state $\\alpha \\beta<0$, one may move microscopic parameters in the Hamiltonian or Lindblad operator such that $|\\alpha \\beta|$ decreases, until it reaches a critical point $\\alpha \\beta=0$. In this situation, the frequency $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\mid \\alpha \\beta|}$ vanishes, signaling the divergence of a timescale [53]. Interestingly, this critical point is generically characterized by the coalescence of the eigenmodes to a zero mode [29-37], which is called a critical exceptional point (CEP) in the literature [33, 35]. A notable exception is when $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ simultaneously vanish: in this case, all the elements in the Jacobian (5) are zero, leading to having a complete basis and hence no CEP. (We will see an example of this special case just before the conclusion.)\n\nOne may also perform a similar linear stability analysis to the PT-broken fixed points as well. It can be shown generically that the fixed points come in pairs, where one is stable and the other is unstable in the physical case (see SM Sec. C [51]). We remark that this is different from conventional phase transitions, where a pair of stable fixed points appears in a symmetry-broken phase [26].\n\nIn summary, by combining Theorem with linear stability analysis we have shown that the $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations for bipartite bosonic models with conserved particle number. Moreover, we have revealed that a pair of stable and unstable fixed points emerge if a PT symmetry of solutions is broken and the transition point is typically a CEP.\n\nAt a glance, this is similar to the PT transitions of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which are also associated with exceptional points. However, there is a fundamental difference: the non-Hermitian PT symmetry breaking is\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. (a) The phase diagram of the generalized DDM. The yellow, blue and red regions can be classified based on the PT symmetry of the fixed points and are referred to as PTsymmetric, fully PT-broken (FPTB), and partially PT-broken (PPTB) phases, respectively. In these regions, there are two PT-symmetric, two PT-broken, and both PT-symmetric and PTbroken fixed points, respectively.

Bottom: Mean-field trajectory of dynamics (green arrow), stable (orange) and unstable (black) fixed points, and the representative collective excitation modes (blue and red or pink arrows). Here, the components of collective excitation modes are generally complex numbers, so we take absolute values. The transition points are CEPs.\na spectral transition while our n-PT symmetry breaking is a transition of a steady state (which is closer to the conventional notion of phase transition). As a result, the exceptional points that mark our transition are critical (i.e. the damping rate vanishes), while the former is generically not [43-45] (as shown in Table A. 1 in SM Sec. A) $[51,56]$.\n\nOne-collective spin models.- A representative example to which our framework can be applied is the onecollective spin [57-60]. (For a concrete example of a spatially extended bosonic system, see SM Sec. D.5.) This class of systems has been discovered to exhibit DCTCs [5-8] and has been extensively studied since then. Since it is known that one-collective spin can be mapped to a two-boson particle-number conserving system via the Schwinger boson transformation [61], our conclusions for bipartite bosonic systems with L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry above can be directly applied when the collective spin has L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry.\n\nLet us first consider the generalized Driven Dicke model (DDM) described by the Hamiltonian $H=$ $S\\left(2 g m_{x}+\\omega m_{z}^{2}\\right)$, where the transverse magnetic field with strength $h$ and two-body interaction along the z-axis with strength $\\omega$, and the Lindblad operator representing the collective decay with rate $\\kappa, L=\\sqrt{\\kappa S} m_{-}$, where\n$m_{\\alpha}:=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_{\\alpha}^{i} / S(\\alpha=x, y, z)$ is the normalized magnetization with Pauli matrices $\\sigma_{\\alpha}$ and $m_{-}:=m_{x}-i m_{y}$ denotes the lowering operator. Here, the total spin $S:=N / 2$ is conserved, where $N$ represents the number of two-level systems. Note that the implementation of all-to-all (or long-range) interactions has already been demonstrated [62-64] and recently collective decay has also been realized in hybrid quantum systems [65] and cold atom systems in free space [66], indicating that these experimental setups serve as promising platforms for implementing dissipative collective spin models [67].\n\nThis model has a L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) [23], where the parity operator is a $\\pi$-rotation of collective spin around the $x$-basis $P=(i)^{2 S} \\exp \\left(i \\pi S m_{x}\\right)$. As stated above, it can be mapped to a two bosonic system by the Schwinger boson transformation, $m_{-}=a b^{\\dagger} /(2 S), \\quad m_{z}=\\left(a^{\\dagger} a-b^{\\dagger} b\\right) /(2 S)$, $S=\\left(a^{\\dagger} a+b^{\\dagger} b\\right) / 2$, where $a, b$ are bosonic annihilation operators.\n\nThe time evolution in the large $S$ limit is given by $[68,69]$\n\n$$\ni \\partial_{t} \\mathbf{m}=2 i\\binom{-\\omega\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle+\\kappa\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle}{\\omega\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle-g\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle+\\kappa\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle}{g\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle-\\kappa\\left(1-\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle^{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwith $\\mathbf{m}:=\\left(\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{T}$. As expected, the dynamical system (6) also exhibits n-PT symmetry (3) with $\\bar{P}=\\operatorname{diag}(1,1,-1)$.\n\nFigure 1(a) shows the phase diagram of this model, which consists of three regimes. The yellow region is a PT-symmetric regime with two stable fixed points $\\left(\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle=0\\right.$, i.e. $\\left.\\quad r_{A}=r_{B}\\right)$ that respect PT symmetry, while the blue region exhibits two PT-broken fixed points $\\left(\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle \\neq 0\\right)$. In the red region, we find that a pair of stable and unstable fixed points of both PT-symmetric and PTbroken fixed points coexist. The PT-symmetric phase has eigenvalues $\\lambda_{ \\pm}$of the Jacobian that are pure imaginary, $\\lambda_{ \\pm}= \\pm i \\sqrt{\\left|\\alpha_{ \\pm} \\beta\\right|}$ with $\\alpha_{ \\pm}=-2\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle_{ \\pm}\\left|{ }_{x x}\\left(g\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle_{ \\pm}\\right]_{x x}-\\omega\\right)$, $\\left.\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle_{ \\pm}\\right|_{x x}= \\pm \\sqrt{1-(\\kappa / g)^{2}}$, and $\\beta=2 g$, implying that the orbits are marginal. At both the phase boundaries (yellow to red and red to blue), we find that a PT-symmetric phase destabilizes at the critical exceptional point [70]. All these behaviors are consistent with our general theory developed above.\n\nReference [6] argued, based mainly on numerical results, that $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian part may be a necessary condition. Our symmetry-based theory clearly shows that the condition for the emergence of DCTC and its transitions should be understood instead in terms of $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Indeed, in the model studied in Ref. [8], the Lindbladian (Hamiltonian does not) have a L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\right)$ symmetry but exhibits a DCTC, consistent with our theory [See SM Sec. D.4].\n\nAs demonstrated above, there are (infinitely in theory) many one-collective spin models to which our the-\n\nory can be applied, where a CEP appears at the transition point. Next, as an example that shows a phase transition to DCTCs without CEP, we examine the Lipkin-MeshkovGlick (LMG) model, studied in nuclear and solid state physics [71]. This model is described by the Hamiltonian $H=g S\\left(m_{x}^{2}+m_{-}^{2}\\right) / 2 S$ with the collective decay $L=\\sqrt{\\kappa S} m_{-}$. This model also has the L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetry and therefore, our theory applies here as well. The PTsymmetric and broken phase is separated by the discontinuous transition [72], unlike in the previous example. In the PT-symmetric phase, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian $\\lambda=\\sqrt{\\alpha \\beta}$ are pure imaginary as expected, where $\\alpha=$ $\\left.-2 g\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\right|_{x x}+2 \\kappa\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle|_{x x}, \\beta=\\frac{4}{\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle_{x y}}\\left[\\left(\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\right|_{x x}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\right|_{x x}\\right)^{2}$ ] can be shown to be negative. As detailed in SM D.3, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ vanish simultaneously at the transition point. As we discussed in the paragraphs below Eq. (5), in such a case, it is not associated with a CEP. (Note that, in the generalized DDM case, $\\beta=2 g$ is always non-zero.)\n\nConclusion and discussion.- We have shown that the $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry can generically induce spontaneous continuous time-translation symmetry breaking in spatially extended bipartite bosonic systems with conserved number, including one-collective spin systems. Moreover, we have revealed that transition points are associated with spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking and typically correspond to CEPs by making an analogy to non-reciprocal phase transitions.\n\nSince our theory is based on the symmetry principle, it can predict the emergence of DCTCs without actually solving the problem, irrespective of the details of the system. Especially in collective spin systems, since dissipators that respect $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry include representative dissipation processes such as pump $L=m_{+}$, decay $L=m_{-}$ and dephasing $L=m_{z}$, our theory suggests that the DCTC is extremely robust against a wide range of unwanted dissipation processes. Our theory would thus serve as a useful guide for the experimental implementation of DCTCs.\n\nIn this Letter, we focused on the PT symmetry of timeindependent solutions (i.e. fixed points). It is unclear what the role of $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is for time-periodic solutions. Interestingly, we numerically find that oscillating solutions are PT-symmetric in the parameter region where a PT-symmetric fixed point is found (see SM Sec. D), but the general features of such solutions remain elusive, which is left to future work.\n\nAcknowledgment- We thank Kazuya Fujimoto, Kazuho Suzuki, Yoshihiro Michishita, Masaya Nakagawa, and Hosho Katsura for fruitful discussions.

Non-reciprocal phase transitions [29-31], on the other hand, corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking of anti- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, $P \\mathbf{f}^{*}(\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{t}))=-\\mathbf{f}\\left(P \\mathbf{q}^{*}(t)\\right)$. [Note that in Ref. [29], they called their transition $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking due to the use of different conventions from our definition of $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetry.] This difference arises due to the property that the order-parameter dynamics of our open quantum systems are described by the form similar to nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, $i \\partial_{t} \\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{q})$, while those considered in active matter systems are overdamped, $\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{q})$, where the factor \" $i$ \" in front of the timederivative on the left-hand side is missing compared to the open quantum system analog.\n[39] G.

COMPARISON BETWEEN NON-HERMITIAN PT TRANSITIONS AND LINDBLADIAN $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ PHASE TRANSITIONS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the similarities and differences between non-Hermitian PT transitions and L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ phase transitions (Table A.1). First, we focus on the non-Hermitian case. A Hamiltonian $H$, in the Shr\u00f6dinger-type equation $i \\partial_{t} \\phi=H \\phi$, is said to be PT-symmetric if $H$ commutes with the combined parity and time-reversal operator,\n\n$$\n[H, P T]=0\n$$\n\nIn this case, if $\\phi \\propto P T \\phi$ for all the eigenvectors, the PT symmetry is said to be unbroken. Otherwise, the $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is said to be broken.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, let us consider a pragmatic PT-symmetric model with a balanced gain and loss (Fig.A. 1 (a)) described by\n\n$$\nH=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mathrm{i} \\Gamma & g \\\\\ng & \\mathrm{i} \\Gamma\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the weak dissipative regime $(\\Gamma<g)$, the gain and loss are effectively canceled by the sufficiently strong interaction, causing the system to behave as though dissipation is absent. Consequently, all the eigenvalues are real, and then oscillating solutions, resembling those of closed systems, emerge. In this regime, the PT symmetry is said to be unbroken. In contrast, in the strong dissipative regime $(\\Gamma>g)$, the gain and loss cannot be fully canceled, resulting in a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. This indicates the presence of one divergent solution and one decaying solution over time - a pair of stable and unstable modes. In this regime, the PT symmetry is said to be broken. The transition between these regimes occurs at an exceptional point, where two eigenvectors coalesce.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure A. 1 . (a) Illustration of a typical PT symmetric system with a balanced gain and loss. Here, $\\Gamma$ and $g$ denote the strength of gain (loss) and interaction. (b) Illustration of the DDM in the Schiwnger boson representation.\n\nSimilarly, for the Lindbladian case with $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1), the phase transition occurs with spontaneous n-PT symmetry breaking, and the transition point is typically a CEP. Moreover, in the PT phase, persistent periodic oscillations appear, while in the PT-broken phase, a pair of stable and unstable fixed points emerge. For the one-collective spin,\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable A. 1 : Comparison between non-Hermitian PT transitions and Lindbladian $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ phase transitions.\none can intuitively understand it as a balanced gain-loss system in the Schwinger boson transformation [61],\n\n$$\nm_{x}=\\frac{a^{\\dagger} b+a b^{\\dagger}}{2 S}, m_{y}=\\frac{a^{\\dagger} b-a b^{\\dagger}}{2 i S}, m_{z}=\\frac{a^{\\dagger} a-b^{\\dagger} b}{2 S}, S=\\frac{a^{\\dagger} a+b^{\\dagger} b}{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $a, b$ are bosonic annihilation operators. Here, the parity operation with $P=(i)^{2 S} \\exp \\left(i \\pi S m_{x}\\right)$ on the internal degrees of freedom turns into an exchange of two subspaces, that is, an operation on the external degrees of freedom $P a P^{-1}=b$. In this case, collective decay becomes the product of gain (creation operator) and loss (annihilation operator) $S_{-}=a b^{\\dagger}$. As an example, we describe the illustration of the $\\operatorname{DDM}\\left(H=2 g S m_{x}, L=\\sqrt{\\kappa S} m_{-}\\right)$in the Schwinger boson representation (Fig.A. 1 (b)).\n\nDespite these similarities, we emphasize a fundamental difference: non-Hermitian PT transitions are generically spectral transitions occurring even in a finite system, while in the Lindbladian case, these are phase transitions in the steady state (including stationary oscillations) occurring only in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nFinally, we remark that DCTCs originating from L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry cannot appear in the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained from the GKSL equation neglecting quantum jump terms (See $L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} \\rho L_{\\mu}$ in Eq.(1)). This is because this effective Hamiltonian is written in the form $H-i \\sum_{\\mu} L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} L_{\\mu}$, which can only represent loss effects. Therefore, it cannot have (active) PT symmetry, and the system decays to a steady state with no oscillations in the long time limit.", "tables": {"table_0": "|  | Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian |

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# B. THEOREM AND PROOF OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ SYMMETRY AND THE N- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ SYMMETRY \n\nLet us consider a $l$-bosonic system that preserves particle number and L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1), where the parity operator is a permutation with $P^{2}=1$, and time-reversal operator is a complex conjugate operator. In this case, the GKSL equation can be written as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho=-i N[H, \\rho]+\\frac{N}{2} \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}\\left[L_{\\mu}\\right]+\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}(P T)^{-1}\\right]\\right) \\rho\n$$\n\nwith $H=P T H(P T)^{-1}$ and conserved bosonic number $N$, where the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators are consist of normalized bosonic operators. Here, a permutation acts on the Fock basis $\\left|n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{l}\\right\\rangle$ as $P\\left|n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{l}\\right\\rangle=\\left|n_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, n_{\\sigma(l)}\\right\\rangle$, with $\\sigma:\\{1,2, \\ldots, l\\} \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, l\\}$, where $n_{i}$ denotes the bosonic particle number at the site $i$. The parity operator $P$ satisfies $P=P^{\\dagger}$ and $P a_{i} P^{-1}=a_{\\sigma(i)}$. Here, $a_{i}$ denotes the bosonic normalized annihilation operator in the $i$-th boson. These operators satisfy the following commutation relations: $\\left[a_{i}, a_{j}^{\\dagger}\\right]=\\delta_{i, j} / N$. The set of the mean-field equation is written in the form $i \\partial_{t} \\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{q})$, where a function $\\mathbf{f}:=\\left(f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{l}\\right)^{T} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{l}$ and a vector consisting of order parameters $\\mathbf{q}:=\\left(\\left\\langle a_{1}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle a_{2}\\right\\rangle, \\ldots,\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{l}$.\n\nTheorem For a dissipative bosonic system with conserved particle number and L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1), where the parity operator is a permutation with $P^{2}=1$, its mean-field nonlinear dynamical system has $n$-PT symmetry (3).\n\nProof. When the Lindbladian has $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P T}$ symmetry, the time evolution of order parameter (the mean value of normalized bosonic annihilation operator) $\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\ni \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle=N\\left\\langle\\left[a_{i}, H\\right]+i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, a_{i}\\right] L_{\\mu}-L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\left[L_{\\mu}, a_{i}\\right]+\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, a_{i}\\right] P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T-P T L_{\\mu} P T\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, a_{i}\\right]\\right)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side can be rewritten as a sum of products of bosonic operators:\n\n$$\ni \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\substack{k_{j}, m_{j}=0 \\\\ j=1,2, \\ldots, J}}\\left\\langle c_{k_{1}, m_{1}, \\ldots, k_{j}, m_{1}}\\left(a_{1}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{k_{1}}\\left(a_{1}\\right)^{m_{1}} \\cdots\\left(a_{j}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{k_{j}}\\left(a_{j}\\right)^{m_{1}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwith $c_{k_{1}, m_{1}, \\ldots, k_{j}, m_{l}} \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Here, we use the fact that the factor $N$ on the right-hand side of Eq.(B.2) cancels with $1 / N$, which arises from the commutation relation $\\left[a_{i}, a_{j}^{\\dagger}\\right]=\\delta_{i, j} / N$. Applying the mean-field approximation, where the annihilation operators $a_{i}$ are replaced by their mean-field values $\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle$, we can obtain mean-field equation:\n\n$$\ni \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{i}\\right\\rangle \\approx \\sum_{\\substack{k_{j}, m_{j}=0 \\\\ j=1,2, \\ldots, J}} c_{k_{1}, m_{1}, \\ldots, k_{j}, m_{1}}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{1}\\right\\rangle^{*}\\right)^{k_{1}}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{1}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{m_{1}} \\cdots\\left(\\left\\langle a_{j}\\right\\rangle^{*}\\right)^{k_{j}}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{j}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{m_{1}}=f_{i}(\\mathbf{q})\n$$\n\nFurthermore, the time evolution of order parameter $\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(i)}\\right\\rangle$ follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& i \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(i)}\\right\\rangle=i \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle P a_{i} P\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =N\\left\\langle\\left[P a_{i} P, H\\right]+i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, P a_{i} P\\right] L_{\\mu}-L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\left[L_{\\mu}, P a_{i} P\\right]+\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, P a_{i} P\\right] P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T-P T L_{\\mu} P T\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, P a_{i} P\\right]\\right)\\right\\rangle\\right. \\\\\n& =N\\left\\langle P\\left(\\left[a_{i}, P H P\\right]+i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[P L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P, a_{i}\\right] P L_{\\mu} P-P L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P\\left[P L_{\\mu} P, a_{i}\\right]+\\left[T L_{\\mu} T, a_{i}\\right] T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} T-T L_{\\mu} T\\left[T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} T, a_{i}\\right]\\right)\\right) P\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =N\\left\\langle P T\\left(\\left[a_{i}, H\\right]-i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, a_{i}\\right] P T L_{\\mu} P T-P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, a_{i}\\right]+\\left[L_{\\mu}, a_{i}\\right] L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}-L_{\\mu}\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, a_{i}\\right]\\right)\\right) P T\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =N\\left\\langle P T\\left(\\left[a_{i}, H\\right]+i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, a_{i}\\right] L_{\\mu}-L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\left[L_{\\mu}, a_{i}\\right]+\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, a_{i}\\right] P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T-P T L_{\\mu} P T\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, a_{i}\\right]\\right)\\right) P T\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& +N\\left\\langle P T\\left(i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, a_{i}\\right], P T L_{\\mu} P T\\right]-\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T,\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, a_{i}\\right]\\right]+\\left[\\left[L_{\\mu}, a_{i}\\right], L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\right]-\\left[L_{\\mu},\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, a_{i}\\right]\\right]\\right)\\right) P T\\right\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, in the fourth transformation, we use the relations $T a T^{-1}=a$ and $[H, P T]=0$. Using Eqs.(B.2) and (B.3), the first term in the last equation of Eq.(B.5) can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ni \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(i)}\\right\\rangle & =\\sum_{\\substack{k_{j}, m_{j}=0 \\\\\nj=1,2, \\ldots, J}}\\left\\langle P T\\left(c_{k_{1}, m_{1}, \\ldots, k_{j}, m_{1}}\\left(a_{1}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{k_{1}}\\left(a_{1}\\right)^{m_{1}} \\cdots\\left(a_{j}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{k_{j}}\\left(a_{j}\\right)^{m_{1}}\\right) P T\\right\\rangle\\right. \\\\\n& +N\\left\\langle P T\\left(i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(\\left[\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T, a_{i}\\right], P T L_{\\mu} P T\\right]-\\left[P T L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger} P T,\\left[P T L_{\\mu} P T, a_{i}\\right]\\right]+\\left[\\left[L_{\\mu}, a_{i}\\right], L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\right]-\\left[L_{\\mu},\\left[L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}, a_{i}\\right]\\right]\\right)\\right) P T\\right\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe second term in Eq.(B.6) involves double commutators and is therefore proportional to $N \\times 1 / N^{2}=1 / N$. Consequently, in the large $N$ limit, these terms can be neglected. As a result, Eq.(B.5) can be approximated as\n\n$$\ni \\frac{d}{d t}\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(i)}\\right\\rangle \\approx \\sum_{\\substack{k_{j}, m_{j} \\\\ i=1,2, \\ldots, J}}\\left(c_{k_{1}, m_{1}, \\ldots, k_{j}, m_{j}}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(1)}\\right\\rangle^{*}\\right)^{k_{1}}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(1)}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{m_{1}} \\cdots\\left(\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(j)}\\right\\rangle^{*}\\right)^{k_{j}}\\left(\\left\\langle a_{\\sigma(j)}\\right\\rangle\\right)^{m_{j}}=f_{\\sigma(i)}(\\mathbf{q})\n$$\n\nFrom Eqs.(B.4), (B.7), it follows that the mean-field equation satisfies n-PT symmetry (3):\n\n$$\n\\left[\\hat{P} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}^{*}(\\mathbf{q})\\right]_{i}=f_{\\sigma(i)}^{*}(\\mathbf{q})=f_{i}\\left(\\hat{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}\\right)=\\left[\\mathbf{f}\\left(\\hat{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}\\right)\\right]_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere the parity matrix $\\hat{P}$ is defined as $\\hat{P}\\left(f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{l}\\right)^{T}:=\\left(f_{\\sigma}(1), f_{\\sigma}(2), \\ldots, f_{\\sigma}(l)\\right)^{T}$.\nNote that Theorem holds for the Linbladian satisfying the condition where (a) $\\mathbb{P} \\mathbb{T}(H)=H$ and $\\mathbb{P} \\mathbb{T}\\left(L_{\\mu}\\right)=L_{\\mu}$ or (b) $\\mathbb{P} \\mathbb{T}(H)=H+i \\sum_{\\mu}\\left(a_{\\mu}^{*} L_{\\mu}-a_{\\mu} L_{\\mu}^{\\dagger}\\right), \\mathbb{P} \\mathbb{T}\\left(L_{\\mu}\\right)=L_{\\mu}+a_{\\mu} I$ with $a_{\\mu}$ a complex number, as well as the L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry (1) because the GKSL equation can be also written in the form Eq.(B.1).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# C. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR BIPARTITE BOSONIC SYSTEMS WITH L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ SYMMETRY AND CONSERVED PARTICLE NUMBER \n\nWe now focus on a bipartite bosonic system with a uniform solution.

By converting variables to amplitude and phase, $\\left\\langle a_{A(B)}\\right\\rangle=r_{A(B)} e^{i \\theta_{A(B)}}$, we obtain the set of mean-field equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& i \\partial_{t} r_{A}-r_{A} \\partial_{t} \\theta_{A}=g\\left(r_{A}, r_{B}, i \\Delta \\theta\\right) \\\\\n& i \\partial_{t} r_{B}-r_{B} \\partial_{t} \\theta_{B}=g^{*}\\left(r_{B}, r_{A}, i \\Delta \\theta\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $g: \\mathbb{C}^{3} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$.

Under the assumption that $\\gamma_{1}+\\gamma_{2} \\neq 0$, a pair of PT-broken solutions can exist as physically meaningful states only if the inequality $\\gamma_{1} \\gamma_{2}>\\alpha \\beta$ is satisfied. When this condition is satisfied, one of the solutions remains stable while the other becomes unstable. However, if this condition is not met, at least one of the eigenvalues will always have a positive real part, indicating that both solutions are inherently unstable.

Therefore, the solution $\\mathbf{m}_{+, \\text { PTb }}$ is unstable for any $\\kappa$, and the solution $\\mathbf{m}_{-, \\text { PTb }}$ is stable for $\\kappa>\\sqrt{g^{2}-\\omega^{2}}$. Moreover, a CEP also appears in $\\kappa=\\sqrt{g^{2}-\\omega^{2}}$ from the PPTB phase.\n\nSo far, we have classified the PT symmetry for fixed points. Now, we will explore the PT symmetry of time-dependent solutions (e.g. oscillating solution) as well. To proceed, we first define the PT symmetry for time-dependent solutions. We say that the PT symmetry of a time-dependent solution $\\mathbf{q}(t)$ is unbroken if $\\mathbf{q}(t)$ is equivalent to $\\hat{P} \\hat{T} \\mathbf{q}(t)=\\hat{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}(-t)$ at late times (i.e. the attractor), while, if not, it is spontaneously broken. Here, we say that the two solutions are equivalent when they can be transformed from one to the other using symmetry operations present in the system (other than the n-PT symmetry). For example, a mean-field equation of a system governed by a time-independent Lindbladian always has continuous time-translation symmetry. In this case, we say that $\\mathbf{q}(t)$ is PT-symmetric if $\\mathbf{q}(t)=\\hat{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}\\left(-t+t_{0}\\right)$, where $t_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAs expected for the presence of a center, persistent oscillations exist for $\\kappa<g$ as shown in Fig.D. 1 (a). Moreover, one can confirm that these oscillations are $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetric since the trajectory is the same as the PT transformed one, that is, $\\mathbf{q}(t)=\\hat{P} \\mathbf{q}^{*}\\left(-t+t_{0}\\right)$ holds.\n\nNext, we compare the value of the gap of the matrix $J(5)$ in the linear stability analysis to the Lindbladian gap, which is the absolute value of the real part of the second maximal eigenvalue $\\Delta_{\\text {gap }}:=\\left\\{\\max _{(\\alpha 0} \\operatorname{Re}[\\lambda_{i}]\\right\\}$ (Fig. D. 1 (b)). (Here, we assume that the steady state is unique.) One can expect that the Lindbladian gap vanishes in the PT and PPTB phase because of the presence of persistent oscillations without decay, while in the FPTB phase, it corresponds to the real part of mean-field excitation spectra $\\operatorname{Re}[\\lambda]=2 \\kappa\\left\\langle\\left.m_{z}\\right\\rangle\\right|_{x x}$ with $\\left.\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle\\right|_{x x}=-\\sqrt{\\left(\\kappa^{2}-\\kappa_{1 c}^{2}\\right) /\\left(\\kappa^{2}+\\omega^{2}\\right)}$. Fig. 1 (d) indicates that the mean-field prediction coincides well with the Lindbladian gap for a large $S$, as expected.\n\nLastly, we highlight the special nature of the case where $\\omega=0$, corresponding to the DDM. In this scenario, the effects of CEPs cannot be observed. To understand why this is the case, we analyze the conditions required for observing CEPs.\n\nIn general, to observe the effects of CEPs, one must choose an initial state that deviates from the eigenmode $\\delta \\mathbf{m}=(0,1)$. This means selecting an initial perturbation direction such that $\\delta \\mathbf{m}=(a, b)$ with $a \\neq 0, b \\in \\mathbb{C}$. However, in\n\nthe DDM case, this choice is prohibited due to the structure of the magnetization vector. Specifically, the magnetization vector is restricted to $\\left(\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle\\right)=(1,0)$, which is orthogonal to the eigenmode $\\delta \\mathbf{m}=(0,1)$ (as illustrated in the left diagram of Fig.D. 2 . As a result, the system cannot move in the $\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle$-direction, preventing the observation of CEP effects.\n\nAnother potential way to detect CEP effects would be to initialize the system in the $\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle$-direction. However, one can show that the Jacobian at PT-symmetric solutions in the $\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle-\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle$ plane takes the same form as Eq.(5).\n\nThus, in the context of the DDM, the effects of CEPs cannot be observed due to the restrictions imposed by the system's magnetization structure and the behavior of the Jacobian at the transition point.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure D. 2 .

{"section_id": 8, "text": "# D. 3 Discontinuous $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P T}$ phase transition \u2014 Dissipative LMG model. \n\nLet us next analyze the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian $H=g S\\left(m_{x}^{2}+m_{-}^{2}\\right) / 2 S$ with collective decay $L=\\sqrt{\\kappa S} m \\ldots$ In this model, a discontinuous phase transition occurs at $\\kappa=g$ as shown in Fig.D. 3 (a).This model has $\\mathrm{L}-\\mathcal{P T}$ symmetry (1).\n\nThe time evolution in the large $S$ limit is written down as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{m}=2\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n-g\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle+\\kappa\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n-g\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle+\\kappa\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n2 g\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle-\\kappa\\left(\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle^{2}+\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle^{2}\\right)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe nonlinear dynamical system (D.10) has n-PT symmetry (3) with $\\bar{P}=\\operatorname{diag}(1,1,-1)$.\nThere are six distinct fixed points: four PT-symmetric and two PT-broken ones. The PT-symmetric solutions are given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{m}_{\\pm, \\mathrm{PT}}^{\\mathrm{I}}=\\left(M_{\\pm}, M_{\\mp}, 0\\right), \\quad \\mathbf{m}_{\\pm, \\mathrm{PT}}^{\\mathrm{II}}=\\left(-M_{\\pm},-M_{\\mp}, 0\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $M_{\\pm}:=\\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-(\\kappa / g)^{2}}}{2}}$. On the other hand, the PT-broken solutions are given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{m}_{\\pm, \\mathrm{PTb}}=(0,0, \\pm 1)\n$$\n\nThe elements in the Jacobian (5) at PT-symmetric fixed points are given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha=-2 g m_{x}+2 \\kappa m_{y}, \\beta=\\frac{4}{m_{x}}\\left(m_{x}^{2}-m_{y}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nindicating that they are centers for $\\kappa<g$, indicating the presence of persistent oscillations. This is consistent with Ref.[72] that reported that a periodic solution emerges, as shown in Fig.D. 3 (b). Moreover, by performing a PT\n\ntransformation $\\left(\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle \\rightarrow-\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle, t \\rightarrow-t\\right)$, one finds that the system describes the same attractor, confirming that the solution is PT-symmetric. Additionally, this analysis shows that at the transition point $\\kappa=g$, both coefficients vanish $\\alpha=\\beta=0$. As a result, the oscillation period diverges at this transition, but this divergence does not correspond to a CEP.\n\nThe excitation spectra and modes around the $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-broken fixed points $\\mathbf{m}_{\\pm \\text {, PTb }}$ are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lambda & =\\left\\{2(\\kappa+g) m_{\\pm, \\mathrm{PTb}, \\mathrm{z}}, 2(\\kappa-g) m_{\\pm, \\mathrm{PTb}, \\mathrm{z}}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\delta \\mathbf{m} & =\\left\\{(1,-1)^{T},(1,1)^{T}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese expressions indicate that the solution $\\mathbf{m}_{+, \\mathrm{PTb}}$ is unstable for any $\\kappa$, whereas the solution $\\mathbf{m}_{-, \\mathrm{PTb}}$ is stable for $\\kappa<g$. At the transition point $\\kappa=g$, the solution $\\mathbf{m}_{-, \\mathrm{PTb}}$ becomes destabilized, but notably, a CEP does not emerge from the PT-broken phase as well. Fig.D. 3 (c) shows the Lindbladian gap and the mean-field excitation spectrum. These results demonstrate that the mean-field prediction accurately captures the discontinuous L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ phase transition in the limit of large $S$.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure D.3.

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# D. 4 One-collective spin model without $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Hamiltonian \n\nWe consider a light-matter system composed of emitters coupled to light modes which propagate in a waveguide, where the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators are given by\n\n$$\nH=S\\left(2 g m_{x}-\\omega \\gamma\\left\\{m_{x}, m_{y}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nL_{1}=\\sqrt{\\gamma S / 2}\\left((2 \\omega+1) m_{x}-i m_{y}\\right), \\quad L_{2}=\\sqrt{\\gamma S / 2} m_{-}\n$$\n\nrespectively. The parameters $\\omega, g, \\gamma$ denote the Rabi frequency, feedback strength, and decay rate. This model exhibits a DCTC as shown in [8].\n\nContrary to the expectation in Ref.[6], the Hamiltonian does not have $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry since there are no spin unitary operators that invert only one component ( $m_{\\alpha} \\rightarrow-m_{\\alpha}, \\alpha=x, y, z$ ). On the other hand, the Lindbladian has L- $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry with $P=(i)^{2 S} \\exp \\left(i \\pi S m_{x}\\right)$ and $T=K$. The time evolution in the large $S$ limit is written down as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mathbf{m}=2\\binom{\\gamma\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle}{-g\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle+\\gamma \\kappa\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle m_{z}\\right\\rangle}\n$$\n\n$$\ng\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle-\\gamma\\left\\langle m_{x}\\right\\rangle^{2}-\\gamma \\kappa\\left\\langle m_{y}\\right\\rangle^{2}\n$$\n\nwith $\\kappa=2 \\omega+1$. As expected, the nonlinear dynamical system (D.18) has n-PT symmetry (3) with $\\bar{P}=\\operatorname{diag}(1,1,-1)$.
