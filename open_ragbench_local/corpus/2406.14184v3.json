The methodology of integral priors was developed to get prior distributions for Bayesian model selection when comparing two models, modifying initial improper reference priors. We propose a generalization of this methodology to more than two models. Our approach adds an artificial copy of each model under comparison by compactifying the parametric space and creating an ergodic Markov chain across all models that returns the integral priors as marginals of the stationary distribution. Besides the guarantee of their existence and the lack of paradoxes attached to estimation reference priors, an additional advantage of this methodology is that the simulation of this Markov chain is straightforward as it only requires simulations of imaginary training samples for all models and from the corresponding posterior distributions. This renders its implementation automatic and generic, both in the nested and in the non-nested cases.

The most famous of these prior distributions are the Jeffreys prior (Jeffreys (1961)), and the reference priors (Bernardo (1979), Berger and Bernardo (1992)). These default or reference methods usually yield an improper prior distribution, which is determined up to a positive multiplicative constant. Very often this is not a serious issue for estimation because the constant cancels in the posterior distribution. However, in model selection problems where we have two models under consideration, $M_{i}:\\left\\{f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right), \\theta_{i} \\in \\Theta_{i}\\right\\}, i=1,2$, and improper priors $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=c_{i} h_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right), i=1,2$, the Bayes factor\n\n$$\nB_{21}^{N}(x)=\\frac{c_{2} \\int f_{2}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{2}\\right) h_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{2}}{c_{1} \\int f_{1}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right) h_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{1}}\n$$\n\ndepends on the arbitrary ratio $c_{2} / c_{1}$. An attempt towards solving this issue consists of using intrinsic priors (Berger and Pericchi (1996)) that use part of the data to turn the prior into a proper posterior. Intrinsic priors are the solution $\\left\\{\\pi_{1}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right), \\pi_{2}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)\\right\\}$ of a system of two functional equations. Under certain conditions, and assuming that $M_{1}$ is nested in $M_{2}$, the system of functional equations reduces to a single equation with two functional unknowns, in such a way that once an arbitrary choice is made for $\\pi_{1}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$, the dual prior $\\pi_{2}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$ is automatically determined. The solution $\\left\\{\\pi_{1}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right), \\pi_{2}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)\\right\\}$ proposed by Moreno et al. (1998) consists of choosing $\\pi_{1}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and hence\n\n$$\n\\pi_{2}^{I}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)=\\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right) \\mathbb{E}_{f_{2}\\left(z \\mid \\theta_{2}\\right)}\\left(B_{12}^{N}(Z)\\right)=\\int \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid z\\right) m_{1}^{N}(z) \\mathrm{d} z\n$$\n\nwhere $z$ denotes an imaginary training sample, $B_{12}^{N}(z)=m_{1}^{N}(z) / m_{2}^{N}(z)$, and $m_{i}^{N}(z)=\\int f_{i}\\left(z \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i}, i=1,2$. See P\u00e9rez and Berger (2002) for more details. However, intrinsic Bayes factors are often not suitable in the non-nested case, see Berger and Mortera (1999) and Moreno (2005). Another proposal consists of using fractional priors, which are again defined as the solution to a system of functional equations (see Moreno (1997)). However, this methodology has received less attention and also faces difficulties (Robert, 2001).\n\nP\u00e9rez and Berger (2002) have proposed a novel approach under the name of expected posterior priors distributions. This method can be applied in the general scenario where we have $q \\geq 2$ models under consideration. The expected posterior priors are defined as\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}^{*}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z\\right) m^{*}(z) \\mathrm{d} z, \\quad i=1, \\ldots, q\n$$\n\nwhere $m^{*}(z)$ is an arbitrary predictive density, which can be improper, for the imaginary training sample $z$. When $M_{1}$, say, is nested in the other models, P\u00e9rez and Berger (2002) propose $m^{*}(z)=m_{1}^{N}(z)$, and therefore this method applied to two nested-encompassing models produces the intrinsic priors introduced by Moreno et al. (1998).\n\nOther approaches have been proposed for prior construction towards Bayesian model selection, among which Bayarri and Garc\u00eda-Donato (2008), Bayarri et al. (2012), and Fouskakis et al. (2015). A review of reference priors for model selection can be found in Consonni et al. (2018). An extensive literature on Bayesian model selection can be found in Berger et al. (2024).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 1.1 Integral priors \n\nIntegral priors have been introduced in Cano et al. (2008) for model selection when two models, $M_{i}:\\left\\{f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right), \\theta_{i} \\in \\Theta_{i}\\right\\}, i=1,2$, are under consideration. These prior distributions, $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$, are defined as the solution of a system of integral equations, and can be considered as a generalization of the expected posterior priors introduced in P\u00e9rez and Berger (2002). Concretely, integral priors $\\left\\{\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right), \\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)\\right\\}$ satisfy the integral equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid z_{1}\\right) m_{2}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z_{1} \\\\\n& \\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid z_{2}\\right) m_{1}\\left(z_{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$ is a prior distribution for estimation (typically a noninformative prior), $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z\\right) \\propto f_{i}\\left(z \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right), m_{i}(z)=\\int f_{i}\\left(z \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i}, i=$ 1,2 , and $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are (minimal) imaginary training samples for $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$, respectively. When $\\theta_{i}$ or $z_{i}$ are discrete, the corresponding integrals are replaced by sums with no loss of generality. These integral equations balance each model with respect to the other one since the prior $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$ is derived from the marginal $m_{j}\\left(z_{i}\\right)$, and therefore from $\\pi_{j}\\left(\\theta_{j}\\right), j \\neq i$, as an unknown generalized expected posterior prior.\n\nIntegral priors can be used to compare both nested and non-nested models without the need to make this distinction, and the application of this methodology does not need to specify a predictive distribution as with the expected posterior priors approach.\n\nSome examples where the exact form of integral priors is known are studied in Cano et al. (2008). The simplest one is the point null hypothesis testing $H_{0}: \\theta=\\theta^{*}$ versus $H_{1}: \\theta \\neq \\theta^{*}$, for which the integral priors are $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=\\delta_{\\theta^{*}}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid z\\right) f_{1}\\left(z \\mid \\theta^{*}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z$, respectively. A further example is the comparison of two location models, where the priors $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=1, i=1,2$, are integral priors. This extends to the comparison of two scale and two location-scale models, the initial default priors, $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\sigma_{i}\\right)=\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\sigma_{i}\\right)=1 / \\sigma_{i}, i=1,2$ for the former, and $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right)=\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right)$ $=1 / \\sigma_{i}, i=1,2$, for the latter, being integral priors. Further examples have been provided in Cano et al. (2008), while significant differences between intrinsic and integral priors have been discussed in Cano et al. (2018).\n\nIn general closed-form solutions to the integral equations are unavailable. To deal with this drawback we established an equivalence between the solution of the integral equations and the convergence of two Markov chains. Cano et al. (2008) showed that $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$ are integral priors if and only if $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$ are the invariant $\\sigma$-finite measures of two Markov chains, $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The transition $\\theta_{1}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\theta_{1}$ of the Markov chain $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is the marginal of the following conditional steps:\n\n1. Generate a training sample $z_{2} \\sim f_{1}\\left(z_{2} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$\n2. Generate $\\theta_{2} \\sim \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid z_{2}\\right)$\n3. Generate a training sample $z_{1} \\sim f_{2}\\left(z_{1} \\mid \\theta_{2}\\right)$\n4. Generate $\\theta_{1} \\sim \\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid z_{1}\\right)$,\nand the transition $\\theta_{2}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\theta_{2}$ of the Markov chain $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is obtained in a symmetric manner, with both chains being simultaneously recurrent or transient. Therefore, the study of integral priors can be performed considering the stochastic stability of these Markov chains, as in Cano et al. (2007a), Cano et al. (2007b), Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013), Salmer\u00f3n et al. (2015), Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2016), and Cano et al. (2018).\n\nIn some situations the Markov chains attached to integral priors are positive recurrent, and even sometimes positive Harris recurrent, in which case the integral priors are proper prior distributions. This implies that the Bayes factor $B_{21}(x)$ is defined without ambiguity (Robert, 2001) and can be esti-\n\nmated by the Monte Carlo estimator\n\n$$\n\\hat{B}_{21}(x)=\\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{2}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)}{\\sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{1}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)}\n$$\n\nassociated with the above Markov chains.\nIn the general case Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013) have proposed to consider constrained imaginary training samples $z$ when the simulation of the chains is performed, which guarantees the existence and the uniqueness of invariant probability measures. This approach has been implemented successfully in several situations, see Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013), and Cano et al. (2018). However, the simulation of constrained imaginary training samples can involve high computing time, specially when the accept-reject method is implemented. In this article we therefore propose a new approach.\n\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we generalize the definition of integral priors for more than two models. In Section 3 we propose to add copies of the models under consideration but with compact parametric spaces, and we show that integral priors are proper priors. Section 4 is dedicated to show how the methodology applies to the problem of testing if the mean of a normal population is negative, zero, or positive. This multiple non-nested hypothesis testing problem has previously been studied in Berger and Mortera (1999) assuming known variance when using both intrinsic and fractional Bayes factor. However, as pointed out by Berger and Mortera (1999), these approaches do not correspond to genuine Bayes factors attached to specific prior distributions, and there is no a general methodology that, when applied to this model selection problem, produces priors with a satisfactory answer. In Section 5 we apply our methodology to the one way ANOVA model. Section 6 is dedicated to the problem of testing the Poisson versus the negative binomial using integral priors; a model selection problem where the definition of intrinsic priors presents a certain degree of arbitrariness when the initial default prior for estimation is the natural choice, that is, the Jeffrey's priors. In Section 7 we show how the simulation from the integral posterior can be performed. Finally, in Section 8 we present some relevant conclusions and outline incoming research.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 The Markov chains associated with integral priors \n\nWhen considering only two models, the integral priors are the invariant $\\sigma$ finite measures of two Markov chains, $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)$, respectively. In this\n\nsection we extend the definition of the integral priors when comparing more than two models, through a generalization of the above Markov chains.\n\nAs a starter, it proves convenient to represent the simulation of the dual chains $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)$ as shown in Figure 1, where each single step $\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow \\theta_{j}$, $i \\neq j$, is carried out by first simulating $z_{j} \\sim f_{i}\\left(z_{j} \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right)$, which we call an imaginary training sample of sufficient size to make $\\pi_{j}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid z_{j}\\right)$ proper, and second simulating $\\theta_{j} \\sim \\pi_{j}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid z_{j}\\right)$, that is, simulating from the marginal transition\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i j}\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{j}\\right)=\\int f_{i}\\left(z_{j} \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{j}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{j} \\mid z_{j}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z_{j}\n$$\n\nMore specifically, given an initial point $\\theta_{1}^{1} \\in \\Theta_{1}$, we carry out the transitions $\\theta_{1}^{1} \\rightarrow \\theta_{2}^{1} \\rightarrow \\theta_{1}^{2} \\rightarrow \\theta_{2}^{2} \\cdots$ obtaining two marginal (interleaved) Markov chains, $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)$. When starting with an initial point $\\theta_{2}^{1} \\in \\Theta_{2}$, the process maintains the same stochastic behaviour.\n\nHowever, with more than two models under comparison, there exist several possibilities to combine simulations from $\\pi_{i j}\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{j}\\right)$ in a sequence of simulation steps, towards obtaining Markov chains on each parametric space. Consider the case with three models. Figure 2 shows two scenarios to combine single steps. It is worth noting the similarity with Gibbs sampling. However, contrary to what happens with Gibbs sampling where the chosen order in which we carry out the simulation does not impact the stationary distribution (albeit it does impact the convergence rate), in the context we are dealing with, order matters and each scenario can produce a Markov chain on $\\Theta_{i}$ with a different stationary distribution, $i=1,2,3$. Suppose that $M_{1}$ corresponds to the point null hypothesis $\\theta_{1}=\\theta_{1}^{*}$. Therein the stationary distribution $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$ is $\\pi_{12}\\left(\\theta_{1}^{*}, \\theta_{2}\\right)$ under scenario 1 , and $\\int \\pi_{32}\\left(\\theta_{3}, \\theta_{2}\\right) \\pi_{13}\\left(\\theta_{1}^{*}, \\theta_{3}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{3}$ under scenario 2 , which obviously differ. Hence the specific way in which the single steps are combined can produce different answers, with the consequent problem of defining integral priors for more than two models. A straightforward proposal that makes this issue vanish is to randomly choose the ordering in which the steps are performed: if we have carried out the steps $\\theta_{i_{1}}^{t} \\rightarrow \\theta_{i_{2}}^{t} \\rightarrow \\theta_{i_{3}}^{t}$ for a given sequence $\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}\\right)$, then we select at random a\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Transition of the Markov chains for two models under comparison.\n\nScenario 1\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nScenario 2\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Two competing scenarios to combine conditional updating steps when comparing three models.\nsequence $\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right)$ with the condition that $j_{1} \\neq i_{3}$, and then we perform the steps $\\theta_{i_{3}}^{t} \\rightarrow \\theta_{j_{1}}^{t+1} \\rightarrow \\theta_{j_{2}}^{t+1} \\rightarrow \\theta_{j_{3}}^{t+1}$, as shown in Figure 3. This produces three Markov chains, $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{t}\\right),\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{3}^{t}\\right)$, and leads to the following definition.\n\nDefinition.

{"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3 Proper integral priors\n### 3.1 Auxiliary compactified models\n\nAs indicated above, for some model comparisons involving two models, the Markov chains associated with integral priors are recurrent Markov chains. In the general case Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013) have proposed to consider constrained imaginary training samples $z$ when the simulation of the chains is performed, which guarantees both the existence and the uniqueness of invariant probability measures. In brief, their practical recommendation consists in keeping the imaginary training samples constrained within an interval of $\\pm 5 s$ about the sample mean, where $s$ is the sample standard deviation. This approach has been implemented successfully in several situations comparing two models, see Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013) and Cano et al. (2018). However, since the simulation of constrained imaginary training samples is carried out using some accept-reject method (for instance, a truncated normal distribution, see Robert, 1995), this induces a consequent computational overhead. The computational alternative developed in this article consists in including in the comparison an artificial copy of each model of interest but with a corresponding compact parametric space.\n\nConsider for instance the case of two models under comparison, $M_{i}$ : $f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right), \\theta_{i} \\in \\Theta_{i}, i=1,2$, and their attached improper priors $\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)$, respectively. We then introduce an auxiliary model $M_{3}$ that is a copy of model $M_{1}$ with a parameter space restricted to a compact that is,\n\n$$\nM_{3}: f_{1}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{3}\\right), \\quad \\theta_{3} \\in \\Theta_{3}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta_{3}$ is a compact subset of $\\Theta_{1}$, hence $\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) \\mathbb{I}_{\\Theta_{3}}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)$ is a proper prior. Our goal is to obtain integral priors for both $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$, but we can resort to our generalized methodology of constructing integral priors for the three models $\\left\\{M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}\\right\\}$, which produces Markov chains $\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ with transition densities $Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, and resulting integral priors $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$, that is,\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=\\int Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}, \\quad i=1,2,3\n$$\n\nNote that we are using the conditional notation for the marginal transition density $Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, while the alternative notation $\\pi_{i j}\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{j}\\right)$ corresponds for the between-model transition $\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow \\theta_{j}, i \\neq j$.\n\nSince $\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)$ is a proper prior, we need no imaginary training sample for $\\theta_{3}$. In this case\n\n$$\n\\pi_{13}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{3}\\right)=\\pi_{23}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{3}\\right)=\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)\n$$\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of a 2-step transition when comparing three models: $\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}\\right),\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right)$, and $\\left(k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3}\\right)$ are random permutations of $(1,2,3)$, $i_{3} \\neq j_{1}, j_{3} \\neq k_{1}$.\n\nThus, the Markov chain $\\left(\\theta_{3}^{t}\\right)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, $\\theta_{3}^{t} \\sim$ $\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)$, and therefore $\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)$ is the integral prior for $\\theta_{3}$. The study of the stochastic stability of the corresponding Markov chains $\\left(\\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right)$ entails a slightly greater level of complexity. The most natural approach is based on the 2 -step transition densities\n\n$$\nQ_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)=\\int Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\tilde{\\theta}_{i}\\right) Q_{i}\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tilde{\\theta}_{i}, \\quad i=1,2\n$$\n\nFor $i=1,2$, both the transition density $Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)$ and the 2 -step transition density $Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)$, are mixtures of different conditional densities due to the randomness in the order of the between-model sequences, as illustrated by Figure 4. Each component of the mixture $Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)$ corresponds to a specific realisation of the sequences $\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}\\right),\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right)$, and $\\left(k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3}\\right)$. However, all components of this mixture share the crucial property that a simulation from $\\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right)$ occurs within the sequence, since $j=3$ is necessarily part of the sequence $\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right)$. For instance, with regard to the mixture $Q_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$, configuration 1 in Figure 5 corresponds to the component\n\n$$\n\\int \\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) \\pi_{31}\\left(\\theta_{3}, \\theta_{1}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{3}\n$$\n\nand configuration 2 corresponds to the component\n\n$$\n\\int \\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) \\pi_{32}\\left(\\theta_{3}, \\theta_{2}\\right) \\pi_{21}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\tilde{\\theta}_{1}\\right) \\pi_{12}\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}_{1}, \\theta_{2}^{t}\\right) \\pi_{21}\\left(\\theta_{2}^{t}, \\theta_{1}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{2}^{t} \\mathrm{~d} \\tilde{\\theta}_{1} \\mathrm{~d} \\theta_{2} \\mathrm{~d} \\theta_{3}\n$$\n\nMore precisely, it is straightforward to derive that all components of these mixtures are necessarily equal to one of four cases that can be schematically\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: Two realizations of the 2-step transition process given in Figure 4.\nrepresented as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\\\\n1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1, \\text { and } 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThen $Q_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\theta_{1}^{\\prime}$, and hence $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=Q_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is the integral prior for $\\theta_{1}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int \\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*} \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i}=\\int Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*} \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i} \\\\\n=\\int Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\tilde{\\theta}_{i}\\right) Q_{i}\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*} \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i} \\mathrm{~d} \\tilde{\\theta}_{i} \\\\\n=\\int Q_{i}\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*} \\mid \\tilde{\\theta}_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tilde{\\theta}_{i}=Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{*}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the 2-step transition for $\\left(\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is the integral prior for $\\theta_{2}$, that is, $\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)=Q_{2}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid \\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)$. From a practical perspective, we point out that all simulation steps that precede the latest simulation of $\\theta_{3}$ in $Q_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ are superfluous since $\\theta_{3}$ is generated independently.\n\nHowever, these resulting integral priors do depend which model is copied into a compactified version. Towards the elimination of the resulting arbitrariness, we propose to duplicate each model into a compactified version. For instance, when facing two models, we add to model $M_{2}$ the model\n\n$$\nM_{4}: f_{2}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{4}\\right), \\quad \\theta_{4} \\in \\Theta_{4}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta_{4}$ is a compact subset of $\\Theta_{2}$ with $\\pi_{4}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right) \\mathbb{I}_{\\Theta_{4}}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right)$ thus a proper prior. While one could consider comparing $\\left\\{M_{3}, M_{4}\\right\\}$ instead of\n\n$\\left\\{M_{1}, M_{2}\\right\\}$, since the corresponding Bayes factor $B_{34}(x)$ is then well-defined, the models of interest remain $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. Therefore moving to the set of models $\\left\\{M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4}\\right\\}$ is purely procedural and solely intended to derive a well-defined integral prior on both $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$.\n\nFor the same reason as above, the training sample size for $\\theta_{4}$ is zero and the integral prior is again $\\pi_{4}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right)$. The 2 -step transition $Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\theta_{i}^{\\prime}$ and hence $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is the integral prior for $\\theta_{i}$, $i=1,2$. Besides, $Q_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is a mixture of densities and the components of this mixture are reduced to eight cases that can be schematically represented as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\\\\n1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\\\\n1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 1, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\\\\n1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1, \\text { and } 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhich means that there exist functions $H_{1}^{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{3}\\right)$ and $H_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{4}\\right)$, defined for $\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{3} \\in \\Theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{4} \\in \\Theta_{2}$, such that the integral prior $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)$ is\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=Q_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid \\theta_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) H_{1}^{1}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{3}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{3}+\\int \\pi_{4}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right) H_{1}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\theta_{4}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{4}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, there exist functions $H_{2}^{1}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{3}\\right)$ and $H_{2}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{4}\\right)$, defined for $\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{4} \\in$ $\\Theta_{2}$ and $\\theta_{3} \\in \\Theta_{1}$, such that\n\n$$\n\\pi_{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}\\right)=Q_{2}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid \\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{3}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{3}\\right) H_{2}^{1}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{3}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{3}+\\int \\pi_{4}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{4}\\right) H_{2}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{2}, \\theta_{4}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{4}\n$$\n\nis the integral prior for $\\theta_{2}$.\nObviously, this device of adding copycat models with a compact parametric space applies to more than two models. We start from $q \\geq 2$ models\n\n$$\nM_{i}: f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right), \\quad \\theta_{i} \\in \\Theta_{i}, \\quad i=1, \\ldots, q\n$$\n\nunder comparison and associated improper prior distributions $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) i=$ $1, \\ldots, q$. Given a compact subset $\\Theta_{q+i} \\subseteq \\Theta_{i}$ such that $\\int_{\\Theta_{q+i}} \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{i}<+\\infty$, we consider a copy of $M_{i}$ but with parameter space $\\Theta_{q+i}$, that is,\n\n$$\nM_{q+i}: f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{q+i}\\right), \\quad \\theta_{q+i} \\in \\Theta_{q+i}\n$$\n\nand $\\pi_{q+i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{q+i}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{q+i}\\right) \\mathbb{I}_{\\Theta_{q+i}}\\left(\\theta_{q+i}\\right), i=1, \\ldots, q$. Then integral priors for $\\left\\{M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{q}, \\ldots, M_{2 q}\\right\\}$ do exist, they all are unique and proper priors, and the integral prior for $\\theta_{i}$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\int \\pi_{q+j}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{q+j}\\right) H_{i}^{j}\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{q+j}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{q+j}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $H_{i}^{j}\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{q+j}\\right)$ is defined for $\\theta_{i} \\in \\Theta_{i}$ and $\\theta_{q+j} \\in \\Theta_{j}, i, j=$ $1, \\ldots, q$.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-4.jpeg":

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 3.2 Selecting the compact sets \n\nWithout loss of generality consider two models under comparison, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, with their copies over compact parametric spaces, $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$, respectively. It is quite sensible to seek compact sets such that the posterior probabilities\n\n$$\nP_{x}^{3}=\\int_{\\Theta_{3}} \\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid x\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{1} \\text { and } P_{x}^{4}=\\int_{\\Theta_{4}} \\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{2} \\mid x\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta_{2}\n$$\n\nare close to one. While there are a variety of ways to choose these compact sets, we opt for the simple solution where both $\\Theta_{3}$ and $\\Theta_{4}$ are the Cartesian products of compact intervals based on marginal posterior quantiles in such a way that the compact sets include the highest posterior values. ${ }^{1}$ More specifically, our proposal is made of credible intervals with posterior probability $1-\\alpha$, based on the quantiles $\\alpha / 2$ and $1-\\alpha / 2$, with $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ small, typically $\\alpha \\leq 0.05$. Note that the computation of such HPD regions usually requires MCMC samples. This differs from the costlier requirement of simulating constrained imaginary training samples in the Markov chains that define integral priors under the approach proposed in Cano and Salmer\u00f3n (2013). The following example illustrates the behaviour of this method.\n\nExample 1. For the data $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$, consider the models\n\n$$\nM_{1}: f_{1}\\left(x_{j} \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\theta_{1}} \\exp \\left(-x_{j} / \\theta_{1}\\right), \\quad j=1, \\ldots, n, \\quad \\theta_{1} \\in(0,1)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nM_{2}: f_{2}\\left(x_{j} \\mid \\theta_{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\theta_{2}} \\exp \\left(-x_{j} / \\theta_{2}\\right), \\quad j=1, \\ldots, n, \\quad \\theta_{2} \\in(1,+\\infty)\n$$\n\nwith $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=1 / \\theta_{i}, i=1,2$. For a sample of size $n=15$ and mean 0.7 , we implement the above methodology of integral priors, thus defining the collection of models $\\left\\{M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4}\\right\\}$, where $\\Theta_{i+2}=\\left[a_{i+2}, b_{i+2}\\right]$ is a $100(1-\\alpha) \\%$ credible interval based on the quantiles $\\alpha / 2$ and $1-\\alpha / 2$ of $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid x\\right), i=1,2$. We also opt for using training samples $z$ of size one for both $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$. Simulation from the posterior distributions is straightforward:\n\n$$\n\\theta_{1}=1 /\\left(1-z^{-1} \\log u_{1}\\right), \\quad u_{1} \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The posterior distributions are associated with the original prior distributions, independently for each model.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Estimation of the Bayes factor $B_{12}(x)$ and posterior probability $P\\left(M_{1} \\mid x\\right)$, based on $10^{6}$ simulations from the integral priors.\nand\n\n$$\n\\theta_{2}=-z / \\log \\left(u_{2}\\left(1-e^{-z}\\right)+e^{-z}\\right), \\quad u_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)\n$$\n\nFor $\\alpha \\in\\{0.05,0.01,0.005,0.001\\}$, Table 1 provides $\\hat{B}_{12}(x)$, the approximate values of $B_{12}(x)$, as well as the estimated posterior probability of model $M_{1}$ if the prior probabilities of $M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ are $1 / 2,1 / 2,0$, and 0 , respectively. Hence, $\\hat{P}\\left(M_{1} \\mid x\\right)=\\hat{B}_{12}(x) /\\left(1+\\hat{B}_{12}(x)\\right)$.\n\nIt is worth noting that under the unconstrained Exponential model\n\n$$\nf\\left(x_{j} \\mid \\theta\\right)=\\theta^{-1} \\exp \\left(-x_{j} / \\theta\\right), \\quad j=1 \\ldots, n, \\quad \\theta \\in(0,+\\infty)\n$$\n\nand $\\pi^{N}(\\theta) \\propto 1 / \\theta$, the posterior probability of $\\Theta_{1}=(0,1)$ is 0.89 .\nThe histograms corresponding to the chains $\\left(\\log \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right), i=1,2,3,4$, using the associated Markov chains with the compact sets for $\\alpha=0.001$ (last row in Table 1), are shown in Figure 6.\n\nTo evaluate the Monte Carlo variability in Table 1, we repeated 100 times the estimations, that is, we simulated the Markov chains 100 times and computed the corresponding estimator $\\hat{B}_{12}(x)$. The standard deviation of the 100 values of $\\hat{B}_{12}(x)$ was 0.02 for each value of $\\alpha$.\n\nMoreno (2005) has stated that the encompassing approach for intrinsic priors does not work for this example, and has proposed an ad hoc solution inspired in intrinsic priors for two different models: the point null hypothesis $\\theta=1$ and the unconstrained model $\\theta>0$. Then the proposal is to consider the restriction of the prior for the unconstrained model to $\\theta<1$ and $\\theta>1$ to obtain two priors for the computation of the Bayes factor.", "tables": {"table_0": "| $\\alpha$ | $a_{3}$ | $b_{3}$ | $a_{4}$ | $b_{4}$ | $\\hat{B}_{12}(x)$ | $\\hat{P}\\left(M_{1} \\mid x\\right)$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 0.05 | 0.44 | 0.97 | 1.00 | 1.62 | 8.98 | 0.90 |\n| 0.01 | 0.39 | 0.99 | 1.00 | 1.90 | 9.10 | 0.90 |\n| 0.005 | 0.37 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 2.02 | 9.09 | 0.90 |\n| 0.001 | 0.34 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 2.28 | 9.16 | 0.90 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 4 Test on a Normal mean under dependent samples \n\nIn the specific context of paired samples in which each subject is measured twice, resulting in pairs of observations, there are three natural hypotheses\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6: Histograms of $10^{6}$ simulations from the integral priors for $\\log \\theta_{i}$, $i=1,2$ (first row: $\\log \\theta_{1}$ left, $\\log \\theta_{2}$ right), and $i=3,4$ (second row: $\\log \\theta_{3}$ left, $\\log \\theta_{4}$ right).\nregarding the mean difference, $\\mu$, namely, $\\mu<0, \\mu=0$, and $\\mu>0$. This multiple non-nested hypothesis testing problem has been previously studied in Berger and Mortera (1999), assuming known variance and comparing the encompassing arithmetic intrinsic Bayes factor (EIBF), the encompassing expected intrinsic Bayes factor (EEIBF), the median intrinsic Bayes factor, and the fractional Bayes factor. Unfortunately, these approaches do not correspond to Bayes factors with respect to genuine prior distributions (see Berger and Mortera, 1999, p552). In this section, we therefore apply the theory of integral priors for this testing problem.\n\nUnder model $M_{i}$ the difference data $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ are independently drawn from the Normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma_{i}^{2}\\right), i=1,2,3$, with $\\mu_{1}<0$, $\\mu_{2}=0$, and $\\mu_{3}>0$, respectively,that is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nf_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\mu_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right)=(2 \\pi)^{-n / 2} \\sigma_{i}^{-n} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma_{i}^{2}} \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(x_{j}-\\mu_{i}\\right)^{2}\\right), \\quad i=1,3 \\\\\nf_{2}\\left(x \\mid \\sigma_{2}\\right)=(2 \\pi)^{-n / 2} \\sigma_{2}^{-n} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma_{2}^{2}} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{j}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nand we consider the default estimation priors $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=1 / \\sigma_{i}, i=1,2,3$, where $\\theta_{1}=\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right), \\theta_{2}=\\sigma_{2}$, and $\\theta_{3}=\\left(\\mu_{3}, \\sigma_{3}\\right)$.\n\nTo investigate this setting, we produced a simulated sample $x$ of size $n=$ 15 from the Normal distribution with mean -1 and variance 4 . The observed sample mean and standard deviation were -0.927 and 2.530 , respectively.

The default (estimation) prior distributions in this setting are $\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma_{1}\\right)=1 / \\sigma_{1}$ and $\\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\ldots, \\mu_{k}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)=1 / \\sigma_{2}$. Unfortunately, these priors are improper and therefore their use is not validated for model selection. In order to construct integral priors for ANOVA, we again consider copies $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ with compact parametric spaces.\n\nThe imaginary training samples are generated as follows:\nFor $\\theta_{1} \\rightarrow \\theta_{2}$. Given $\\theta_{1}=\\left(\\mu, \\sigma_{1}\\right)$\n\n1. $j \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$\n2. $z_{i} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\sigma_{1}^{2}\\right), i \\neq j$, and $z_{j}=\\left(z_{j}^{1}, z_{j}^{2}\\right)$, where $z_{j}^{1}, z_{j}^{2} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\sigma_{1}^{2}\\right)$\n3. $z=\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{k}\\right)$ is the imaginary training sample\n\nFor $\\theta_{2} \\rightarrow \\theta_{1}$. Given $\\theta_{2}=\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\ldots, \\mu_{k}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)$\n\n1. $j_{1}, j_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$\n2. $z_{j_{1}} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{j_{1}}, \\sigma_{2}^{2}\\right), z_{j_{2}} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{j_{2}}, \\sigma_{2}^{2}\\right)$\n3. $z=\\left(z_{j_{1}}, z_{j_{2}}\\right)$ is the imaginary training sample\n\nFor model $M_{1}$, the sample size is 2 , that is $x=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$. The simulation from $\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma_{1} \\mid x\\right)$ can be carried out as follows:\n\n1. $\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{G} a(1 / 2,1), \\sigma_{1}=\\frac{\\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\\right|}{2 \\sqrt{\\xi}}$\n2. $\\mu \\sim N\\left(\\bar{x}, \\sigma_{1}^{2} / 2\\right)$.\n\nFor model $M_{2}$, the sample size is $n_{j}=2$ for some $j \\in\\{i, \\ldots, k\\}$ and $n_{i}=1$ for $i \\neq j$. Then\n\n$$\n\\pi_{2}^{N}\\left(\\sigma_{2} \\mid x\\right) \\propto \\sigma_{2}^{-2} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{s_{j}^{2}}{2 \\sigma_{2}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore the simulation from

(2021) is dedicated to the test of a Poisson model versus the negative binomial family, using intrinsic priors. In this section we develop integral priors and compare the methodologies.\n\nLet us consider the Poisson model\n\n$$\nM_{1}: f_{1}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{1}\\right)=\\frac{\\theta_{1}^{x} e^{-\\theta_{1}}}{x!}, \\theta_{1}>0\n$$\n\nand the negative binomial models\n\n$$\nM_{r}: f_{r}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{r}\\right)=\\binom{x+r-2}{x} \\theta_{r}^{r-1}\\left(1-\\theta_{r}\\right)^{x}, \\quad \\theta_{r} \\in(0,1)\n$$\n\n$r=2, \\ldots, q$. Jeffreys' priors are $\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1}\\right)=\\theta_{1}^{-1 / 2}$ and $\\pi_{r}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{r}\\right)=\\theta_{r}^{-1}\\left(1-\\theta_{r}\\right)^{-1 / 2}$, $r=2, \\ldots, q$, and the minimal training sample size is one in all cases. With these priors, the posteriors are Gamma and Beta distributions, respectively:\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid z\\right)=\\mathcal{G} a\\left(\\theta_{1} \\mid z+1 / 2,1\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\pi_{r}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{r} \\mid z\\right)=\\mathcal{B} e\\left(\\theta_{r} \\mid r-1, z+1 / 2\\right), \\quad r \\geq 2\n$$\n\nfor $z \\geq 0$ a minimal training sample.\nAs is pointed out in (Moreno et al., 1998, pp.1457-1458), the intrinsic priors methodology is not well defined when comparing Poisson versus geometric $\\left(M_{2}\\right)$ because of the arbitrariness in the limiting procedure for defining\n\nthe intrinsic priors and the corresponding Bayes factor. This issue can be adjusted if instead of using Jeffreys' priors as the initial default estimation priors - which would be the natural choice-one uses Jaynes' priors, for which a minimal training sample is any value of $x$ other than $x=0$\n\nHere we illustrate the integral priors methodology with the data referring the number of times that the word \"may\" appears per block in papers by James Madison, see Conigliani et al. (2000).\n\nWe have considered $q=15$ and, as in previous examples, the compact parametric spaces are based on the quantiles $\\alpha / 2$ and $1-\\alpha / 2$ of the posterior distributions $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid y\\right), i=1, \\ldots, q$.\n\nBased on such compact sets, we apply the methodology of integral priors with 50,000 simulations in order to approximate the posterior probabilities of models $M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{15}$. The prior probabilities were $1 / 15$ for models $M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{15}$, and 0 for the artificial models. Using $\\alpha=0.05$, the approximated posterior probabilities where 0.68 for the geometric model $M_{2}, 0.26$ for $M_{3}, 0.04$ for $M_{4}$, and less than 0.01 for other models. The results were virtually identical with $\\alpha=0.001$.\n\nFor the purpose of comparing the methodologies, we have applied the approach proposed in Moreno et al.

For example, we can estimate the Bayes factor $B_{21}(x)$ by $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{2}(x \\mid$ $\\left.\\theta_{2}^{t}\\right) / \\sum_{t=1}^{T} f_{1}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{1}^{t}\\right)$. However, it is well known that this is not the optimal strategy when the integral posterior $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid x\\right) \\propto \\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right) f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right)$ is concentrated relative to the integral prior $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$. In such situations general methods based on the integral posterior could produce estimates of the evidence, and therefore of the Bayes factor, in a more efficient way. Besides, the simulation from the integral posterior entails some additional difficulties because the integral prior is not known analytically. To overcome this issue we resort to a completion of the integral posterior as follows.\n\nThe simulation of $\\theta_{i}^{t+1}$ given $\\theta_{i}^{t}$ is carried out in several steps. The last two steps correspond to the simulation of a training sample $z_{i}^{t+1}$, and the\n\nsimulation $\\theta_{i}^{t+1}$ from $\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}^{t+1}\\right)$. Besides, since the 2 -step transition density $Q_{i}^{2}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\theta_{i}^{t}$, it follows that given any initial point $\\theta_{i}^{0}$, the subsequences $\\left\\{\\theta_{i}^{2}, \\theta_{i}^{4}, \\theta_{i}^{6}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\theta_{i}^{3}, \\theta_{i}^{5}, \\theta_{i}^{7}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ are iid from $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$. Note that $\\theta_{i}^{t}$ and $\\theta_{i}^{t+1}$ are independent if any compact space is involved along the transition $\\theta_{i}^{t} \\rightarrow \\theta_{i}^{t+1}$. In general, we consider the subsequence $\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{i}^{t}\\right)$ of the Markov chain $\\left(\\theta_{i}^{t}\\right)$ such that $\\hat{\\theta}_{i}^{t}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{i}^{t+1}$ are independent, and the corresponding subsequence $\\left(\\hat{z}_{i}^{t}\\right)$ of $\\left(z_{i}^{t}\\right)$. This sequence is the key ingredient of the completion method. If $p_{i}\\left(z_{i}\\right)$ is the stationary distribution of $\\left(z_{i}^{t}\\right)$, then $\\left(\\hat{z}_{i}^{t}\\right)$ are iid from $p_{i}(z)$, and\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)=\\int \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}\\right) p_{i}\\left(z_{i}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z_{i}\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}, z_{i} \\mid x\\right)=\\frac{f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}\\right) p_{i}\\left(z_{i}\\right)}{m_{i}(x)}\n$$\n\nis a completion of $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid x\\right)$, and $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}, x\\right)=\\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}, x\\right)$. Then the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with target $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}, z_{i} \\mid x\\right)$ and proposal of the form\n\n$$\nq_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime}, z_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid \\theta_{i}, z_{i}, x\\right)=p_{i}\\left(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rho_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid \\theta_{i}, z_{i}^{\\prime}, x\\right)\n$$\n\ncan be implemented provided\n\n$$\n\\frac{f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rho_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid \\theta_{i}^{\\prime}, z_{i}, x\\right)}{f_{i}\\left(x \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right) \\pi_{i}^{N}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid z_{i}\\right) \\rho_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid \\theta_{i}, z_{i}^{\\prime}, x\\right)}\n$$\n\ncan be computed. Note that if $\\rho_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid \\theta_{i}, z_{i}^{\\prime}, x\\right)$ does not depend on $z_{i}^{\\prime}$, then this Metropolis-Hasting algorithm becomes the pseudo-marginal MetropolisHastings algorithm of Andrieu and Roberts (2009), for the target $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i} \\mid x\\right)$ where the unbiased estimator of the target is $\\pi_{i}\\left(\\theta_{i}, z_{i} \\mid x\\right) / p_{i}\\left(z_{i}\\right)$.

Our approach proves to be quite automated and generic, both in the nested and in the non-nested cases, with the only requirement being the existence of training samples of finite size for all models under comparison. Since we did not compare here the outcome of more approximate solutions like intrinsic and fractional pseudo Bayes factors (Robert, 2001), further experiments could be conducted in that spirit.\n\nThe examples we considered so far allow to approximate the Bayes factor with the Monte Carlo estimator, but extensions to more general settings are directly available when using evidence approximations (Friel and Wyse, 2011), like bridge sampling, inverse logistic regression or even harmonic means since some models (Marin and Robert, 2011) are associated with compact parameter spaces.\n\nOccasionally researchers can express their knowledge about the parameters by establishing a range of possible values. In such cases, it would\n\nbe possible to work with proper priors. If any of the models considered is equipped with such a proper prior, then it is not necessary to use artificial models with compact parametric spaces because the original model does not require imaginary training samples, and the prior would be the integral prior. Furthermore, we could use these ranges of values to construct the artificial models, in which case the integral priors could differ.\n\nAcknowledgements The research of D Salmer\u00f3n was supported by the Fundaci\u00f3n S\u00e9NeCa-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia Program for Excellence in Scientific Research (project 20862/PI/18).
