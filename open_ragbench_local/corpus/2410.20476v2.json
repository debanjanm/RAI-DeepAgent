In each round of VRP, a randomly selected proposer suggests an alternative that is voted on against the previous round's winner. In a framework with single-peaked preferences, we show that the VRP procedure guarantees that the Condorcet winner is implemented in a few rounds with truthful voting, and in just two rounds under sufficiently symmetric preference distributions or if status quo positions are not extreme. The results have applications for committee decisions, legislative decision-making, and the organization of citizens' assemblies and decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\n\nKeywords: strategy-proofness, multi-round voting, majority voting.\nJEL Classification: C72, D70, D72.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *We thank Vincent Anesi, Pio Blieske, Jon X.

      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nIn various collective decision-making scenarios such as committee deliberations, legislative processes, and the governance of proof-of-stake blockchains, members of the corresponding bodies face the challenge of selecting a single alternative from a large set of options. A widely used approach in such contexts is to conduct successive rounds of pairwise majority voting (Rasch, 2000). For instance, legislative bodies often refine bills by sequentially voting on amendments, and negotiating parties in multi-agent resource allocation problems typically converge on a solution through incremental steps. However, with a large number of alternatives, it becomes infeasible to consider all options comprehensively. Moreover, the final outcome is highly sensitive to the subset of alternatives chosen for voting and the sequence in which they are presented. This creates a well-known vulnerability, whereby strategic monopoly agenda setters can manipulate the decision-making process to achieve outcomes aligned with their preferences, as extensively documented in the literature. ${ }^{1}$\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce an iterative majority voting procedure where, in each round, a randomly selected proposer from the society suggests an alternative to be voted against the winner of the previous round. We refer to this method as \"Voting with Random Proposers\" (VRP). The random selection of proposers is designed to decentralize and democratize the agenda-setting process, thus preventing any single agent from dominating the proposal sequence. Our analysis focuses on a simplified framework with a fixed number of voting rounds, one-dimensional alternatives, and a society of agents with symmetric single-peaked preferences with publicly known distribution. Additionally, only the final winning alternative is payoff relevant to the members of the society.\n\nOur main goal is to analyze the strategic incentives created by the VRP procedure for both voters and proposers, while assessing its efficiency in selecting the socially optimal\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See the classic contributions by McKelvey (1979), Rubinstein (1979), Bell (1981), Schofield (1983) and the more recent contributions that have extended and applied the potential and limit of agenda power to various settings, Barber\u00e0 and Gerber (2017), Nakamura (2020) and Ali, Bernheim, Bloedel, and Console Battilana (2023). We refer to Horan (2021) and Rosenthal and Zame (2022) for a recent account of the literature and to Banks (2002) for a review of the earlier literature.\n\nCondorcet winner. We show that the weakly dominant strategy for the proposers in all rounds except the final one is to propose the Condorcet winner, unless their peak lies at the tail of the preference distribution, in which case they propose their own peak. For voters, truthful voting is the weakly dominant strategy, whether they are sophisticated (maximizing continuation utility) or myopic (favoring their current top choice).\n\nAs a result, the probability of implementing the socially optimal alternative converges to one after only a few voting rounds. For balanced distributions of the preferences, where the median and mean are sufficiently close, the Condorcet winner is obtained in only two voting rounds, independently of the status quo and the proposers' preferences. Even for arbitrary distributions of preferences in the society, the Condorcet winner is selected in two rounds if the status quo is not too extreme.\n\nOur results demonstrate that current iterative voting procedures can be optimized by engaging randomly selected proposal-makers, thereby increasing both efficiency and the likelihood of welfare improvement. The VRP procedure has a wide range of potential applications, not only within standard collective decision-making bodies, such as committees and legislative bodies, but also in citizens' assemblies that prepare proposals for city councils or parliaments. In this context, it may be optimal to select two randomly chosen citizen groups to develop proposals, which the assembly would then vote on, advancing the winning alternative to the next decision-making body. Moreover, this procedure could be effectively employed to decide on initiatives in direct democracies and can be easily adapted for decentralized autonomous organizations operating with distributed ledger technologies.",

      "text": "# 2 Relation to Literature \n\nSince the seminal result of Moulin (1980), it is well-known that in the case of single-peaked preferences the Condorcet winner can be selected by asking agents to announce their peak, adding a number of fixed peaks, and using a generalized median rule. This result has\n\nbeen considerably extended by Border and Jordan (1983), Barber\u00e0 and Jackson (1994) and Klaus and Protopapas (2020). Unlike their mechanism design approach, our paper focuses on an alternative implementation problem: There is no mechanism designer and procedures can involve proposal-making by agents and voting. This approach mirrors common practices in parliamentary decision-making in representative democracies and referenda in direct democracies. In particular, we focus on procedures that present agents with two alternatives at a time.\n\nOur paper also relates to the work of Miller (1977), who demonstrates that a Condorcet winner is selected through sophisticated and potentially strategic voting, regardless of the agenda, as long as it includes the Condorcet winner. Similarly, Austen-Smith (1987) shows that strategic voting and sincere voting may be observationally equivalent since agendasetters will propose options that can defeat the last winning proposal under sincere voting. We extend these insights by showing that the random selection of agenda-setters in an iterative majority voting process creates strong incentives for them to propose the Condorcet winner, even when they are self-interested and strategic. Additionally, we demonstrate that this procedure is strategy-proof.\n\nLegislative bargaining models commonly feature random proposer selection and iterative majority voting on proposals, a framework originating from the seminal work of Baron and Ferejohn (1989). While much of the subsequent literature has focused on bargaining with an exogenous status quo ${ }^{2}$, another line of research, notably Anesi and Seidmann (2014), explores dynamic bargaining models with an endogenous status quo, where the status-quo is determined by the outcome of the bargaining in the previous round. ${ }^{3}$ Our model features several important deviations from these frameworks, including a finite number of voting rounds, a one-dimensional policy space ${ }^{4}$, and a single payoff-relevant outcome.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ See Eraslan and Evdokimov (2019) for a review.\n    ${ }^{3}$ This literature has been recently surveyed in Eraslan, Evdokimov, and Z\u00e1pal (2022).\n    ${ }^{4}$ In this respect, our paper relates to the literature on spatial bargaining, including Baron (1991), Banks and Duggan (2000), Kalandrakis (2016), and Zapal (2016).\n\nWithin this context, our model can be classified as a spatial legislative bargaining model featuring an endogenous status quo and a finite horizon.\n\nOur research on voting with random proposers over a large set of alternatives also relates to the literature on algorithmically determined and iterative voting procedures with a random component in various policy spaces, as developed by Airiau and Endriss (2009), Goel and Lee (2012) and Garg, Kamble, Goel, Marn, and Munagala (2019), among others. We add to this literature by studying a simple procedure to implement the Condorcet winner.\n\nFinally, when designing iterative voting procedures with endogenous proposal-making, it is crucial to identify alternatives in each round that are welfare-improving, i.e. closer to the Condorcet winner. In this sense, our work contributes to the literature by Callander (2011), Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010) and Barber\u00e0 and Gerber (2022), which examines how to identify desirable policies to put to a vote. We demonstrate that the sequential random selection of proposers plays a pivotal role in guiding proposers toward making socially superior proposals.",

      "text": "# 3 The Model \n\nConsider a society that consists of a continuum of agents with mass one, each of them privately informed about their type $\\theta \\in[0,1]$. The agents' types follow an absolutely continuous distribution $\\theta \\sim F$ with nowhere-zero density function $f>0$ and median $\\theta_{\\mu}$ such that $1-F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}-x\\right)-F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}+x\\right)$ is of the same sign for all $x \\in[0,1]^{5}$ The distribution of the types is public knowledge. The utility of an agent of type $\\theta$ from an alternative $x \\in[0,1]$ is given by $u_{\\theta}(x)=-(x-\\theta)^{2}$, therefore it has a unique maximum at $\\theta$ and is symmetric around $\\theta$.\n\nWe define a function $c:[0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1], x \\mapsto \\min \\left\\{\\max \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-x, 0\\right\\}, 1\\right\\}$. Thus, the function gives for each $x$ the alternative with the following property: the farthest positioned alternative in $[0,1]$ that is just as much or more preferred than $x$ by the society. Note in particular\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ This assumption implies that if $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5, \\theta_{\\mu}>\\mathrm{E}(\\theta)$ and vice-versa (van Zwet, 1979) where $F(\\cdot)=0$, (1) when the argument in the function is below zero (above 1 ).\n\nthat whenever $x \\in\\left(\\max \\left\\{0,2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}, 1\\right\\}\\right)$, we have $F\\left(\\frac{x+c(x)}{2}\\right)=F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFurthermore, we define a lower and upper threshold types as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\underline{\\theta}=\\max \\left\\{0,\\left\\{\\theta<2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1: \\int_{\\theta}^{1} u_{\\theta}(v) f(v) d v=u_{\\theta}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right\\}\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\bar{\\theta}=\\min \\left\\{1,\\left\\{\\theta>2 \\theta_{\\mu}: \\int_{0}^{\\theta} u_{\\theta}(v) f(v) d v=u_{\\theta}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right\\}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, the lower threshold type $\\underline{\\theta}$ has the same expected utility from final winners larger than the own peak as the utility from the median peak. Similarly, the upper threshold type $\\bar{\\theta}$ has the same expected utility from final winners smaller than the own peak as the utility from the median peak. In right-skewed distributions, $\\bar{\\theta}=1$ and in left-skewed distributions $\\underline{\\theta}=0$ by definition. Observe that for distributions of the types for which the expected utility of the two most extreme types over all possible final winners in $[0,1]$ is smaller than the utility from the median peak, the upper and lower threshold types are 1 and 0 , respectively.",

      "text": "# Voting with Random Proposers \n\nThe society uses a multi-round voting procedure called Voting with Random Proposers to implement an alternative from the interval $[0,1]$ in a publicly known fixed number of voting rounds $T$.

In round $t=1$, an agenda-setter of type $\\theta_{s^{1}}$ is randomly drawn from the distribution $F$ and makes a proposal $p^{1} \\in[0,1]$. Then, a majority-vote between $p^{1}$ and $q^{1}$ takes place, where ties are resolved in favor of the proposal. All voters in the society take part in each round of voting. The winner of the first voting round $w^{1}$ becomes the status quo in the next round, i.e. $w^{1}=q^{2}$. In round $t=2$ a new agenda-setter is randomly drawn and the process is repeated. The procedure ends at round $T$ and the winner of the last round $w^{T}$ is implemented. Agenda-setters and voters are assumed to be strategic, i.e. they would choose a proposal or vote in favour of alternatives in order to maximize the proximity of the final winner to their type.",

      "text": "## 4 Optimal Proposal-Making and Truthful Voting\n\nIn this section, we study the optimal proposal of the proposers, depending on their type, the distribution of preferences, and the status quo, as well as the outcome of the VRP procedure. As we show in the theorem below, the equilibrium strategy for all proposers in rounds $t=\\{1,2, \\ldots, T-1\\}$ is identical and they either propose their own type or the Condorcet winner. In the last round of voting, the agenda-setter proposes either their own type or the farthest positioned alternative that wins in a pairwise vote against the status quo.\n\nTheorem 1. The optimal proposal under Voting with Random Proposers is given as follows: in rounds $t=\\{1,2, \\ldots, T-1\\}$\n$p^{t}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\theta_{s^{t}} & \\text { if } \\max \\left\\{q^{t}, \\theta_{s^{t}}\\right\\}<\\underline{\\theta} \\text { or } \\min \\left\\{q^{t}, \\theta_{s^{t}}\\right\\}>\\bar{\\theta} & \\text { and } p^{T}= \\begin{cases}\\min \\left\\{\\theta_{s^{T}}, c\\left(q^{T}\\right)\\right\\} & \\text { if } q^{T} \\leqslant \\theta_{\\mu} \\\\ \\max \\left\\{\\theta_{s^{T}}, c\\left(q^{T}\\right)\\right\\} & \\text { if } q^{T}>\\theta_{\\mu}\\end{cases}$\nTruthful voting is a weakly dominant strategy. The probability of implementing the Condorcet\n\nwinner for $T=\\{2,3, \\ldots\\}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(w^{T}=\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)= \\begin{cases}1-F(\\underline{\\theta})^{T-1} & \\text { if } \\theta_{\\mu} \\geqslant 0.5 \\\\ 1-(1-F(\\bar{\\theta}))^{T-1} & \\text { if } \\theta_{\\mu}<0.5\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProof. See Appendix A.\n\nProposers face a trade-off between proposing their own type to maximize their utility and proposing the Condorcet winner to insure themselves against unfavorable final winners. The closer a proposer's type is to the Condorcet winner, the stronger the incentive to propose it. The share of such voters increases with the symmetry of the distributions of the types. However, in sufficiently skewed distributions, the Condorcet winner is positioned closer to one extreme, leading proposers with preference peaks at the tail of the distribution to favor their own type. This is the case, because the potential benefit from having all subsequent proposers positioned at the tail outweighs the insurance gained by proposing the Condorcet winner, which is nearly as disliked as the extreme opposite alternatives. The optimal strategy of the proposers is illustrated in Figure 1 depending on the distribution of the types. It follows from the proposers' equilibrium strategy that for highly skewed distributions of the types and a status quo positioned at the tail of the distribution, the final winner might also be at the tail, though this scenario becomes less likely with more voting rounds. Thus, the probability of implementing the Condorcet winner rapidly approaches one within a few rounds, as illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, when $\\theta_{\\mu} \\geqslant 0.5$, we have $\\operatorname{Prob}\\left(w^{T}=\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=$ $1-F(\\underline{\\theta})^{T-1} \\geqslant 1-F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)^{T-1}$. Using $1-F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)^{T-1}$ as a lower bound, it follows that the probability of implementing the Condorcet winner within six voting rounds exceeds $96.8 \\%$, regardless of the specific distribution of types.\n\nThis proposal strategy is supported by a truthful voting behavior of sophisticated voters maximizing their continuation utility. However, as we show in Lemma 3 in the Appendix, it\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: The first row depicts the optimal proposals in rounds $t=\\{1,2, \\ldots, T-1\\}$ for different Beta distributions of the types. All types positioned in the green regions of the distribution propose the Condorcet winner, and those in the red regions propose their own type. The dashed line marks the position of the Condorcet winner. The second row shows the probability of the Condorcet winner being implemented for $T \\in\\{2, \\ldots, 5\\}$ for each of the three distributions of the types. Note that if the distribution is sufficiently symmetric, as in the left plot, all types propose the Condorcet winner.\nis also sustained if voters are truthful and myopic, i.e. vote for the more preferred alternative in the current round. Intuitively, this is the case, because there is always a majority of voters for which the two strategies coincide given the optimal strategy of the proposers.\n\nAs we demonstrate in the following proposition, if the distribution is sufficiently symmetric or the initial status quo is sufficiently balanced, the VRP procedure effectively implements the socially optimal alternative in only two rounds of voting.\n\nProposition 1. Voting with Random Proposers implements the Condorcet winner in $T=2$ rounds when for any status quo $q^{1} \\in[\\underline{\\theta}, \\bar{\\theta}]$ and any proposer's type $\\theta_{s^{1}} \\in[\\underline{\\theta}, \\bar{\\theta}]$, the distribution\n\nof the voters' types $F$ is such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) \\geqslant \\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)^{2}-\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)^{2} & \\text { if } \\theta_{\\mu} \\geqslant 0.5 \\\\\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) \\geqslant(1-\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta))^{2}-(1-\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta))^{2} & \\text { if } \\theta_{\\mu}<0.5\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nMoreover, the voting procedure is strategy-proof.\n\nProof. See Appendix B.\n\nProposition 1 establishes the conditions under which the Condorcet winner can be implemented in two rounds. In particular, implementation is guaranteed when the distribution is not highly asymmetric, a condition that holds when the median and the mean are sufficiently close, regardless of the status quo and the proposer's type. Intuitively, in such cases all types prefer to propose the Condorcet winner as this acts as an insurance against undesirable final winners. Note that proposing the Condorcet winner is a weakly dominant strategy even in a polarized society, as long as the distribution is sufficiently symmetric. Additionally, we show that the Condorcet winner can be implemented in two rounds for arbitrary distributions of voter preferences, provided that the status quo or the proposer's type in the first round is not extreme.",

      "text": "# 5 Discussion and Outlook \n\nWe demonstrate that incorporating random proposers into an iterative majority voting process efficiently implements the socially optimal alternative within a few rounds. Furthermore, if individual utility-maximizing alternatives are sufficiently symmetrically distributed or the status quo is balanced, the VRP procedure selects the Condorcet winner in only two rounds.\n\nWe use a simple framework in which the distribution of peaks of the individual preferences is public knowledge. Even if the distribution is unknown, our results would imply that each proposer would like to guess the position of the Condorcet winner and propose it, unless the\n\nproposer believes to have a peak in the tail of the distribution. Therefore, the intermediate winners would also converge to the Condorcet winner, but possibly in more rounds.\n\nIt is well known that a Condorcet winner might not exist when preferences violate singlepeakedness and pairwise voting procedures might exhibit cycles. Voting with Random Proposers offers a probabilistic solution to resolving such cycles. Future research should build on the work of Airiau and Endriss (2009), who show that the proposal dynamic resembles a Markov chain, and explore the convergence and strategic incentives of the players.",

This is due to the fact that the procedure is a simple majority voting between two alternatives and the voters have single-peaked preferences.

      "text": "# Optimal proposal in round $T-1$ \n\nWe now consider the optimal proposal and voting at round $T-1$. We organise the proof in the following way. First, we derive the winner of round $T-1$ that would maximize the expected utility of the proposer, which, as we show, is either the proposer's own peak or the Condorcet winner. Then, we determine the optimal proposals in round $T-1$. Finally, we show that the majority of the strategic voters would vote in favour of the proposal in Lemma 1.\n\nWe now state the expected utility of the proposer $\\theta_{s} \\in-1$ when proposing $w$ in round $T-1$. To ease the notation we denote the proposers type $\\theta_{s} \\in-1=\\theta_{s}$ in this subsection:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)= \\begin{cases}\\int_{0}^{w} u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(v) d v+\\int_{w}^{c(w)} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v+\\int_{c(w)}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(v) d v & \\text { if } w \\leqslant \\theta_{\\mu} \\\\ \\int_{0}^{c(w)} u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(v) d v+\\int_{c(w)}^{w} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v+\\int_{w}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(v) d v & \\text { if } w>\\theta_{\\mu}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich can be simplified as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)= \\begin{cases}u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) F(w)+\\int_{w}^{c(w)} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v+u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w))(1-F(c(w))) & \\text { if } w \\leqslant \\theta_{\\mu} \\\\ u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) F(c(w))+\\int_{c(w)}^{w} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)(1-F(w)) & \\text { if } w>\\theta_{\\mu}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nEach of the three terms in the expected utility function corresponds to the possible winners in round $T$, depending on the proposer's type in round $T$. In the case when $w \\leqslant \\theta_{\\mu}$ and for\n\n$\\theta_{s^{T}} \\in\\left[0, w^{T-1}\\right)$, the final winner is $w^{T}=q^{T}=w^{T-1}$. For $\\theta_{s^{T}} \\in\\left[w^{T-1}, c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)\\right]$, the final winner will be $\\theta_{s^{T}}$. Finally, for $\\theta_{s^{T}} \\in\\left(c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right), 1\\right]$, the final winner is $c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)$. The analogous argument holds for the case when $w \\geqslant \\theta_{\\mu}$.\n\nWe proceed by finding the utility-maximizing winner considering the following cases.\nCase 1: $w^{T-1} \\in\\left[0,2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1\\right]$. Thus, $c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)=1$. The first order condition is given by\n\n$$\nu_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime} F(w)+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)-u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)=u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime} F(w)=0\n$$\n\nObserve that $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)$ is monotonically increasing for $\\theta_{s} \\geqslant \\max \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1,0\\right\\}$. If $\\theta_{s}<\\max \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-\\right.$ $1,0\\}$, we have $u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}=0$ when $w^{T-1}=\\theta_{s}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)$ has a maximum at $w^{T-1}=\\theta_{s}$ as $u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}=2\\left(\\theta_{s}-w\\right)$ and\n\n$$\nw^{T-1}=\\min \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1, \\theta_{s}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $w^{T-1} \\in\\left(2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1, \\theta_{\\mu}\\right]$. By definition, $c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)=2 \\theta_{\\mu}-w^{T-1}$. The FOC is given by ${ }^{6}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nu_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime} F(w)+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(c(w))-u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)- \\\\\n-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w))^{\\prime}(1-F(c(w)))+u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(c(w))=0 \\\\\nu_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime} F(w)-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w))^{\\prime}(1-F(c(w)))=0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nObserve that if $w=\\theta_{\\mu}$ then $c(w)=\\theta_{\\mu}$ and the equation is satisfied. Hence, $w^{T-1}=\\theta_{\\mu}$.\nCase 3: $w^{T-1} \\in\\left[\\theta_{\\mu}, 2 \\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$. We have $c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)=2 \\theta_{\\mu}-w^{T-1}$. The FOC is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w))^{\\prime} F(c(w))-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(c(w))+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)+u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w)) f(c(w))+ \\\\\n+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}(1-F(w))-u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)=0 \\\\\n-u_{\\theta_{s}}(c(w))^{\\prime} F(c(w))+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}(1-F(w))=0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ One can also verify the second-order conditions.\n\nThus, the utility maximizing $w$ is equal to the Condorcet winner.\nCase 4: $w^{T-1} \\in\\left[2 \\theta_{\\mu}, 1\\right]$. Thus, by definition $c\\left(w^{T-1}\\right)=0$. The FOC is given by\n\n$$\nu_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}(1-F(w))+u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)-u_{\\theta_{s}}(w) f(w)=u_{\\theta_{s}}(w)^{\\prime}(1-F(w))=0\n$$\n\nObserve that $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)$ is monotonically decreasing for $\\theta_{s} \\leqslant \\min \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}, 1\\right\\}$. If $\\theta_{s}>\\min \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}, 1\\right\\}$, the expected utility is maximized at $w^{T-1}=\\theta_{s}$. Thus,\n\n$$\nw^{T-1}=\\max \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}, \\theta_{s}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThus, the utility-maximizing winner of round $T-1$ is\n\n$$\nw^{T-1} \\in\\left\\{\\min \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}, \\theta_{\\mu}, \\max \\left\\{2 \\theta_{\\mu}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe organise the rest of the proof in a series of lemmas:\n\n1. we identify the interval of types of proposers who have a higher expected utility from $\\theta_{s}$ winning round $T-1$ instead of $\\theta_{\\mu}$ when $\\theta_{s}<2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1$ or $\\theta_{s}>2 \\theta_{\\mu}$,\n2. we show that all such types of proposers prefer a winner within the interval over $\\theta_{\\mu}$,\n3. truthful voting behavior is the optimal strategy.\n\nIn Lemma 3 we show that these voting strategies are equivalent in terms of outcomes to the voting behavior of myopic voters, who simply vote for the preferred alternative in a given round.\n\nLemma 1. If $\\theta_{s} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}] \\cup[\\bar{\\theta}, 1], E U_{s}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right) \\geqslant u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ and if $\\theta_{s} \\in[\\underline{\\theta}, \\bar{\\theta}], E U_{s}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right) \\leqslant u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Assume that the distribution $F$ is such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$. We begin the proof by comparing the expected utility for type $\\theta_{s}$ when the winner of round $T-1$ is $\\theta_{s}$ vs. the median\n\npeak for all types $\\theta_{s}<2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{EU}_{s}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) & =u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right) F\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)+\\int_{\\theta_{s}}^{c\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v+u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(c\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-F\\left(c\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)\\right)\\right)-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\theta_{s}}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsince $u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)=0$ and $c\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)=1$. In order to find the type for which the above expression is positive, we will first show that the function $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ is monotonically decreasing in $\\theta_{s}$. Differentiating the right-hand side of the above inequality w.r.t. $\\theta_{s}$ gives\n\n$$\n2\\left(\\theta_{s} F\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)+\\int_{\\theta_{s}}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor $\\theta_{s}=0$, the above expression (2) is negative since the expected value is smaller than the median whenever $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ by definition of $F$. It is also monotonically increasing in $\\theta_{s}$, which is bounded from above by $2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1$. Thus, we need to show that\n\n$$\n\\left(2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1\\right) F\\left(2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1\\right)+\\int_{2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0\n$$\n\nObserve that the above expression is monotonically decreasing in $\\theta_{\\mu}$. Letting $\\theta_{\\mu} \\rightarrow 0.5$, we have $\\int_{0}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0$, as we have shown above.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}\\left(\\theta_{s}\\right)-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ is monotone decreasing in $\\theta_{s}$. Recall the definition of the lower threshold type $\\underline{\\theta}=\\max \\left\\{0,\\left\\{\\theta<2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1: \\int_{\\theta}^{1} u_{\\theta}(v) f(v) d v=u_{\\theta}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right\\}\\right\\}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{EU}_{\\underline{\\theta}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\underline{\\theta}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=0$ and $\\forall \\theta_{s} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$, proposing the own type is associated with higher expected utility than proposing $\\theta_{\\mu}$. Note that for $\\theta_{s} \\in\\left[2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1,2 \\theta_{\\mu}\\right]$, our previous analysis shows that the expected utility is maximized at $p^{T-1}=\\theta_{\\mu}$. We can redo analysis for distributions with $\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0.5$ to obtain the final result.\n\nNext, we show that for sufficiently extreme types in $[0, \\underline{\\theta}] \\cup[\\bar{\\theta}, 1]$, a winner which is within the same bound is more preferred than $\\theta_{\\mu}$.\n\nLemma 2. For all $\\theta_{s} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}] \\cup[\\bar{\\theta}, 1], E U_{s}(w) \\geqslant u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ for all $w \\in\\left[\\theta_{s}, \\underline{\\theta}\\right] \\cup\\left[\\bar{\\theta}, \\theta_{s}\\right]$.\n\nProof. Assume that the distribution $F$ is such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ and $\\underline{\\theta}>0$. First note that $\\mathrm{EU}_{s}(w)-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ is monotone decreasing for all $w \\in\\left[\\theta_{s}, \\underline{\\theta}\\right]$. Thus, it suffices to show:\n\n$$\nE U_{\\theta_{s}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=u_{\\theta_{s}}(\\underline{\\theta}) F(\\underline{\\theta})+\\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s}}(v) f(v) d v-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nfor all $\\theta_{s} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$. First, observe that the type $\\theta_{s}=\\underline{\\theta}$ is indifferent between proposing $\\underline{\\theta}$ and $\\theta_{\\mu}$ (following from the definition of $\\underline{\\theta}$ ). Thus, if we can show that the function is monotonically decreasing w.r.t. $\\theta_{s}$, we would prove the claim. Differentiating the left-hand side w.r.t. $\\theta_{s}$ gives\n\n$$\n2\\left(\\underline{\\theta} F(\\underline{\\theta})+\\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor $\\underline{\\theta}=0$, the expression is negative since the expected value is smaller than the median whenever $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ by definition of $F$. It is also monotonically increasing in $\\underline{\\theta}$, which is bounded from above by $2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1$. We have that $\\underline{\\theta}$ approaches $2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1$ with the increasing skewness of the distribution in which case $\\theta_{\\mu} \\rightarrow 1$ and\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\underline{\\theta} \\rightarrow 2 \\theta_{\\mu}-1, \\theta_{\\mu} \\rightarrow 1} \\underline{\\theta} F(\\underline{\\theta})+\\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu}=0\n$$\n\nThus, we have shown that $\\underline{\\theta} F(\\underline{\\theta})+\\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0$ and therefore, $\\forall \\theta_{s} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$, proposing $\\theta_{s}$ is associated with higher expected utility than proposing $\\theta_{\\mu}$. We can repeat the analogous analysis for distributions with $\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0.5$ to obtain the final result.\n\nThe weakly dominant strategy for the agenda-setter in round $T-1$ is therefore:\n\n$$\np^{T-1}= \\begin{cases}\\theta_{s^{T-1}} & \\text { if } \\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}<\\underline{\\theta} \\text { or } \\min \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}>\\bar{\\theta} \\\\ \\theta_{\\mu} & \\text { else }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFinally, we show that this optimal proposal can be sustained by truthful voting behavior. We also show that the outcome is equivalent to myopic voting, i.e. when voters simply vote for their preferred alternative in a given round.\n\nLemma 3. Sophisticated and myopic voting are equilibrium strategies under the proposer's strategy shown in Equation (4).\n\nProof. Suppose first that $p^{T-1}=\\theta_{\\mu}$. Let the distribution of the types be such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$. We know from Lemma 1 that all types $\\theta_{s} \\notin[0, \\underline{\\theta}] \\cup[\\bar{\\theta}, 1]$ would prefer $\\theta_{\\mu}$ to be the winner of round $T-1$ than their own type. Thus, the majority of voters would vote for $\\theta_{\\mu}$ in equilibrium. Since by definition $F\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=0.5$, the mass of voters who prefer $\\theta_{\\mu}$ over $q^{T-1}$ is sufficient to win the election even if voters are myopic. We can make the analogous argument if the distribution of the types be such that $\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0.5$.\n\nNext, consider the strategic voting behavior when $p^{T-1}=\\theta_{s^{T-1}}$. Suppose that $F$ is such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$, hence $\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}<\\underline{\\theta}$. Note that $c\\left(\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}\\right)=1$. In that case, all voters with a type in $\\left[\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}, 1\\right]$ strictly prefer $\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}$, since they anticipate that the final winner will be in the same interval as opposed to $\\left[\\min \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}, 1\\right]$ if they support $\\min \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}$. Therefore, $\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}$ would win the vote in round $T-1$. Recall that proposers of type $\\theta_{s^{T-1}}$ have a higher expected utility from $\\max \\left\\{q^{T-1}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}$ than $\\theta_{\\mu}$ as shown in Lemma 2, so they would still propose their type even if it loses against the status quo. ${ }^{7}$ We obtain the analogous result for distributions with $\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0.5$.\n\nOptimal proposal in rounds $t=\\{1,2, \\ldots, T-2\\}$\nNote that if the distribution of the types is such that $\\underline{\\theta}=0$ and $\\bar{\\theta}=1$, it is optimal for all types to propose the Condorcet winner, based on our previous analysis. Suppose now that the distribution is such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ and $\\underline{\\theta}>0$. If $q^{T-2}>\\underline{\\theta}$, majority of utility-maximizing (but also myopic) voters would not support a proposal $p^{T-2}<\\underline{\\theta}$, hence $\\theta_{\\mu}$ will be proposed\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Note that this equilibrium strategy leads to the same outcome if voters follow a myopic truthful voting strategy.\n\nin the next round and will win the final round. Let $q^{T-2} \\leqslant \\underline{\\theta}$ and assume that voters vote in a way that maximizes their continuation utility. Note that $c\\left(q^{T-2}\\right)=1$ by definition. Therefore, the optimal proposal in round $T-1$ is as follows:\n\n$$\np^{T-1}= \\begin{cases}\\theta_{s^{T-1}} & \\text { if } \\max \\left\\{p^{T-2}, q^{T-2}, \\theta_{s^{T-1}}\\right\\}<\\underline{\\theta} \\\\ \\theta_{\\mu} & \\text { else. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nHence, in finding the optimal proposal in round $T-2$ we compare the expected utility of making a proposal below the threshold value with the utility from proposing the median type. This is the case because, if $p^{T-2}>\\underline{\\theta}$, then the expected utility of the agenda-setter is equal to the utility from the Condorcet winner, because it is going to be proposed in the next round and implemented in the final round. First note that for all $\\theta_{s^{T-2}} \\in[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}\\left(\\theta_{s^{T-2}}\\right)-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\geqslant \\mathrm{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis is the case because, if all subsequent agenda-setters' types are smaller than $\\underline{\\theta}$, the final outcome is in the interval $\\left[\\max \\left\\{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}, q^{T-2}\\right\\}, \\underline{\\theta}\\right]$, and is thus more preferred than $\\underline{\\theta}$. If $\\theta_{s^{T-1}} \\leqslant \\underline{\\theta}$ and $\\theta_{s^{T}} \\geqslant \\theta_{s^{T-1}}$, the final outcome will be in the interval $\\left[\\theta_{s^{T-1}}, 1\\right]$, which will give the agenda-setter at $T-2$ a higher expected utility than by proposing $\\underline{\\theta}$, in which case the final winner is in the interval $[\\underline{\\theta}, 1]$. Finally if $\\theta_{s^{T-1}}>\\underline{\\theta}$, the agenda-setter is indifferent between the two strategies, because $\\theta_{\\mu}$ will be proposed and will win. Let us now derive the difference in expected utilities by proposing $\\underline{\\theta}$ vs. the Condorcet winner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) & =u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}(\\underline{\\theta}) F(\\underline{\\theta})^{2}+F(\\underline{\\theta}) \\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}(v) f(v) d v-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-2}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) F(\\underline{\\theta}) \\\\\n& =F(\\underline{\\theta})\\left(\\mathrm{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{T-1}}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-1}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term in the above expression refers to the case when all subsequent agenda-setters' types are in the interval $[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$ and hence, $\\underline{\\theta}$ is implemented. The second term refers to the\n\ncase when $\\theta_{s^{T-1}} \\leqslant \\underline{\\theta}$ and $\\theta_{s^{T}} \\geqslant \\underline{\\theta}$ and the final winner is $\\theta_{s^{T}}$. Finally, if $\\theta_{s^{T-1}}>\\underline{\\theta}$, the Condorcet winner is proposed in round $T-1$ and wins irrespective of the proposal in the last round. As we have shown in the proof of Lemma 2, $\\operatorname{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{T-1}}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s^{T-1}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\geqslant 0$, and hence, the optimal $p^{T-2}=\\theta_{s^{T-2}}$ whenever $\\theta_{s^{T-2}} \\leqslant \\underline{\\theta}$.\n\nNext, suppose that $\\theta_{s} \\in\\left[\\underline{\\theta}, \\theta_{\\mu}\\right]$. We compare $\\operatorname{EU}_{\\theta_{s}}(\\underline{\\theta})$ against $u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$.\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{EU}_{\\theta_{s}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=u(\\underline{\\theta}) F(\\underline{\\theta})^{2}+F(\\underline{\\theta}) \\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} u(v) f(v) d v-u\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) F(\\underline{\\theta}) \\leqslant 0\n$$\n\nNote that $u(\\underline{\\theta})<0$ and $\\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} u(v) f(v) d v-u\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)<0$ for $\\theta_{s} \\in\\left(\\underline{\\theta}, \\theta_{\\mu}\\right]$. Therefore, such agents are better off by proposing the Condorcet winner. Thus, the optimal proposal for all agendasetters in round $T-2$ coincides with the one in round $T-1$. We can repeat the same argument for distributions with $\\theta_{\\mu} \\leqslant 0.5$ and verify that the optimal proposal coincides with the one derived for round $T-1$.\n\nNote that the argument generalizes to all rounds $t=\\{1,2, \\ldots, T-2\\}$ since\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{EU}_{\\theta_{s^{t}}}(\\underline{\\theta})-u_{\\theta_{s^{t}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)=u_{\\theta_{s^{t}}}(\\underline{\\theta}) F(\\underline{\\theta})^{T-t}+F(\\underline{\\theta})^{T-t-1} \\int_{\\underline{\\theta}}^{1} u_{\\theta_{s^{t}}}(v) f(v) d v-u_{\\theta_{s^{t}}}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) F(\\underline{\\theta})^{T-t-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, observe that Lemma 1 holds in that case as well, hence the voting procedure is strategy-proof.\n\nIn order to obtain the probability of implementing the Condorcet winner, observe that the only case in which it will not be proposed in the first $T-1$ rounds is when all types of proposers are in the interval $[0, \\underline{\\theta}]$ or $[\\bar{\\theta}, 1]$, depending on the skewness of the distribution. Moreover, no other alternative is proposed in the first $T-1$ rounds, which leads us to the final answer.",

      "text": "# B Appendix: Proof of Proposition 1 \n\nObserve that if the distribution of preferences is such that $\\underline{\\theta}=0$ when $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ and $\\bar{\\theta}=1$ when $\\theta_{\\mu}<0.5$, the optimal proposal at $T-1$ is always $\\theta_{\\mu}$. Therefore, we need that $\\int_{0}^{1} u_{0}(v) f(v) d v \\leqslant u_{0}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ when $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$ and $\\int_{0}^{1} u_{1}(v) f(v) d v \\leqslant u_{1}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ when $\\theta_{\\mu}<0.5$. Substituting the utility function, we obtain in the former case:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} v^{2} f(v) d v \\geqslant \\theta_{\\mu}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhich is equal to $\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)^{2}-\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)^{2} \\leqslant \\operatorname{Var}(\\theta)$. Note that if the distribution is such that $\\theta_{\\mu}>0.5$, this implies that $\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)>\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)$ and the inequality is not trivially satisfied. In the latter case, we simplify the inequality $\\int_{0}^{1} u_{1}(v) f(v) d v \\leqslant u_{1}\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$ to obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int_{0}^{1} v^{2} f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu}^{2} \\geqslant 2\\left(\\int_{0}^{1} v f(v) d v-\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta)+\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)^{2}-\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)^{2} \\geqslant 2(\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)-\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) \\geqslant(\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)-\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta))(2-\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)-\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIf $\\theta_{\\mu}<0.5$, then by definition of $F$, we have $\\operatorname{Med}(\\theta)<\\operatorname{Mean}(\\theta)$. This implies that the above inequality is not trivially satisfied. Anticipating that $\\theta_{\\mu}$ will be proposed at $T-1$ the latest, all previous agenda-setters cannot do better by making other proposals. Knowing that the Condorcet winner is going to be proposed at least at round $T-1$, voting truthfully is therefore a weakly dominant strategy for all voters.",

In a framework with single-peaked preferences, we show\nthat the VRP procedure guarantees that the Condorcet winner is implemented in a\nfew rounds with truthful voting, and in just two rounds under sufficiently\nsymmetric preference distributions or if status quo positions are not extreme.\nThe results have applications for committee decisions, legislative\ndecision-making, and the organization of citizens' assemblies and decentralized\nautonomous organizations.",
