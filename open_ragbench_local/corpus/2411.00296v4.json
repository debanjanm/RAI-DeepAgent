      "text": "## 1. Mapping numerosities to surreal numbers.\n\nSeveral authors[1][2][3][4] have introduced the concept of a measure of set's size, striving to satisfy the Euclid's principle \"the whole is greater than a part\" (often calling it \"numerosity\"), which can be formally represented by the following equation: $N(A \\cup B)=N(A)+N(B)-N(A \\cap B)$, where $N$ is the proposed measure. The approach described in this paper makes an attempt to do so in the most simple way, yet allowing to explicitly derive values of numerosities in closed form.\n\nOur aim is to define a measure on subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ that would be\n\n- Surreal-valued.\n- Equal to cardinality at finite sets.\n- It is finitely-additive.\n- For a bounded set is invariant under translations.\n\nComb-form of the numerosity. We formally represent the numerosity of a discrete set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ with elements $s_{n}$ as a (generally, divergent) integral $N(S)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(x-s_{n}\\right) d x$, where $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac Delta distribution. These divergent integrals should be considered as formal symbols until we establish a mapping from them to surreal numbers. Indeed, naturally partial sums of this integral increase by one each time they encounter an element of $S$. We will call integrals of this form the \"comb-form\" of the numerosity. We assume that numerosity is invariant regarding changing of the sign of the elements of a set, so $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(x-s_{n}\\right) d x=\\int_{-1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(x-\\left|s_{n}\\right|\\right) d x$\n\nSmooth-form of the numerosity. Let $\\phi_{n}(x)$ to be a bounded real function with finite support $\\left[a_{n}, b_{n}\\right]$, area under the curve $\\int_{a_{n}}^{b_{n}} \\phi_{n}(x) d x=1$ and center of mass at $s_{n}: \\int_{a_{n}}^{b_{n}} x \\phi_{n}(x) d x=s_{n}$. We postulate that these two integrals are equal: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\delta\\left(x-s_{n}\\right) d x=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\phi_{n}(x)+\\phi_{n}(-x)\\right) d x$. The later one is one of the smooth-forms of $N(S)$. As weth the comb form, smooth form, if diverges, should be considered a formal symbol for now, but we are going to establish mapping between them and surreal numbers.\n\nThe surreal numbers can be considered an H-field with natural embedding of the germs of the fuctions (satisfying the Hard field requirements) at infinity into surreals, such that the germ of identity function $[x]$ is mapped to $\\omega$ [5]. In such setting, if $u \\in \\mathbb{J}$, a purely-infinite surreal number, corresponding to the germ at infinity of the function $f(x)$, we postulate equivalence of the following divergent integral to $u$ :\n$f(a)+\\int_{a}^{\\infty} f^{\\prime}(t) d t=u$\nwhere $a$ is an arbitrary real number.\nIn this way, smooth forms of numerosities can be mapped to surreal numbers.\nEXAMPLE. Find a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, whose numerosity is $\\ln \\omega$. The number $\\ln \\omega$ is purely-infinite, because its Conway normal form $\\omega^{1 / \\omega}$ has no finite and infinitesimal terms. Under canonical embedding and the above-mentioned equivalence,\n$\\ln \\omega=[\\ln x]=\\ln 1+\\int_{1}^{\\infty}(\\ln t)^{\\prime} d t=\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t} d t$.\nNow, we take the last integral and separate it into pieces of area equal to 1 , in our case:\n$\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t} d t=\\int_{1}^{e} \\frac{1}{t} d t+\\int_{e}^{e^{2}} \\frac{1}{t} d t+\\cdots=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{e^{k}}^{e^{k+1}} \\frac{1}{t} d t$.\nThe centers of mass of each integral are located at $s_{k}=e^{k+1}-e^{k}$, so the set $\\left\\{e^{k+1}-e^{k}\\right\\}: k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ has the numerosity $\\ln \\omega$.\n\nEXPLICIT FORMULA. The above-mentioned definitions can be expressed in compact form as follows:\n$N\\left(\\left\\{a_{k}\\right\\}\\right)=\\left(D \\Delta^{-1} a_{k}\\right)^{[-1]}(\\omega)$\nwhere $f^{[-1]}$ is the inverse function operator. The formula works not only for purely-infinite numbers but for those containing finite and infinitesimal parts, so we suggest calling the result of applying this formula the full numerosity and after trimming the infinitesimal part, the refined numerosity $\\bar{N}\\left(\\left\\{a_{k}\\right\\}\\right)$. Differences in refined numerosities between different sequences, calculated according to the method suggested in this article coincide with those obtained with the method suggested by James Propp in[6].\n\nMATHEMATICA CODE. Below is the Mathematica code for finding the surreal expression of the numerosity of a non-negative, growing sequence $a_{k}$ with no accumulation points:\n\n```\na[k]:= k^2;\nSolveValues[D[Sum[a[k], k], k] == \\[Omega], k] /. C[1] -> 0 //\n    FullSimplify // Expand\n```\n\nThe opposite process, finding a sequence with given numerosity as a surreal expression $S$ can be done with the following code:\n\n```\nS = Log[\\[Omega]];\nDifferenceDelta[Integrate[Normal[SolveValues[S == k, \\[Omega]]], k], k] /. C[1]\n-> 0 // FullSimplify // Expand\n```\n\nIn the obtained result only the real positive elementsshould be considered. The obtained list of numerosities of subsets of reals can be seen in Appendix 1.",

      "text": "# 2. Surreal Delta function \n\nSuppose we want to obtain a functional to count the number of roots of a function on an interval. For a differentiable function $f(x)$, the following expression does the thing, where applicable: $\\int_{a}^{b} \\delta(f(x))\\left|f^{\\prime}(x)\\right| d x$. From now on we will call the operator $\\tilde{\\delta}$, defined as $\\tilde{\\delta}(f(x))=\\delta(f(x))\\left|f^{\\prime}(x)\\right|$, where $x$ is the integration variable, \"surreal delta function\". We will further generalize it.\n\nFirst of all, we should notice that $\\tilde{\\delta}(x)$ behaves just like $\\delta(x)$ in all contexts where its argument is the integration variable itself, and not some non-trivial function of it. Particularly, its Laplace and Fourier transforms are the same as of conventional Delta distribution.\n\nSecond thing to notice is that it satisfies the following property: $\\tilde{\\delta}(a x)=\\tilde{\\delta}(x)$, which coincides with the similar property of the unit impulse function, unlike the property of the conventional Delta distribution $\\delta(a x)=\\frac{1}{|a|} \\delta(x)$.\n\nLet us consider the Fourier transform of the constant function $f(x) \\equiv 1$ :\n$F(s)=\\mathcal{F}[1](s)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s t} d t$\n\nFormally, the right-hand expression is equal to 0 at any $s \\neq 0$ (by Cesaro regularization). But at $s=0$ we get the divergent integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 d t$. This divergent integral corresponds to the surreal number $2 \\omega$.\n\nConsequently, we can formally write:\n$F(x)=\\mathcal{F}[1](x)= \\begin{cases}2 \\omega, & \\text { if } x=0 \\\\ 0, & \\text { if } x \\neq 0\\end{cases}$\nApplying inverse Fourier transform, $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[F](t)=1=2 \\pi \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\delta](t)=2 \\pi \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\tilde{\\delta}](t)$. This allows us to generalize the Surreal Delta function this way:\n$\\tilde{\\delta}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\omega}{\\pi}, & \\text { if } x=0 \\\\ 0, & \\text { if } x \\neq 0\\end{cases}$\nWe can see that the property $\\tilde{\\delta}(a x)=\\tilde{\\delta}(x)$ holds with this piece-wise definition. This function $\\tilde{\\delta}(x)$ is a full-fledged surreal-valued function, and can be evaluated at any point. Particularly, since $\\int_{-1}^{1} \\tilde{\\delta}(x) d x=1$, we can consider it (in a sense) a derivative of $\\operatorname{sign}(x)$ function. This shows us that an infinite value of the derivative at a point indicates a jump the function makes there.\n\nExpanding $\\omega^{p}$ as a divergent integral, Surreal Delta function can be raised to any power:\n$\\tilde{\\delta}(x)^{p}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{p}{\\pi^{p}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{p-1} d x, & \\text { if } x=0 \\\\ 0, & \\text { if } x \\neq 0 .\\end{cases}$\n\nIt should be noted that the Surreal Delta function is not differentiable in terms of surreal-valued functions.",

Our aim among other things was to make a definition, in which the finite part of the numerosity of any subset of integers, particularly, the natural numbers would coincide with the regularized value (using Dirichlet or Zeta regularization) of the sum of the indicator function over the set, for instance:\nfin $N(\\mathbb{N})=\\operatorname{reg} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 1=-1 / 2$.\n\nThe numerosity of natural numbers, using our definition, corresponds to the germ of the function $f(x)=x-1 / 2$ at infinity, which in turn corresponds to the surreal number $\\omega-1 / 2$. Similarly, definite values can be assigned to the numerosities of even or odd positive numbers: $N\\left(\\text { odd }_{+}\\right)=\\omega / 2$ and $N\\left(\\text { even }_{+}\\right)=\\omega / 2-1 / 2$, so their difference is $1 / 2$. This result coincides with that of James Propp[6]. In comparison, Benci at al in their work[1] (p.63) concede that their definition has an arbitrariness depending on the choice of ultrafilter, and can be defined as num $\\left(\\text { odd }_{+}\\right)=\\operatorname{num}\\left(\\text { even }_{+}\\right)$or num $\\left(\\text {odd }_{+}\\right)=\\operatorname{num}\\left(\\text { even }_{+}\\right)+1$.\n\nIn general, other works often do not define or neglect the finite parts of the numerosities, effectively treating numerosities as growth rates.\n\nAn exception to this observation is the article by James Propp[6] on Wordpress. There he suggests a formula for finding the finite part of the numerosity of a sequence of reals using Abel's regularization:\nfin $N\\left(\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}\\right)=\\lim _{q \\rightarrow 1^{-}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} q^{a_{n}}$. Our results coincide with those of James Propp in the finite part.

It is defined as the sequence of partial sums over the set's indicator function, and as such, can be a sequence itself. Operations on the \"sizes\" are defined as element-wise operations on sequences. In the table below for uniformity, we still will use the notation $N(S)$ for all definitions.\n\nThe following table summarizes the differences in the definitions (N/D stands for \"not defined\"):\n\n![table_0](table_0)",

Discussion \n\nIn this work we proposed a way to map numerosities of certain subsets of reals to surreal numbers and used postulated equivalence between surreals and divergent improper integrals to interpret them in Laplace transform sense, which allowed us to derive certain integration properties of surreals. Still there remains a huge room for generalization of our principles.\n\nFor numerosities of many sequences our formula does not provide a closed-form expression, so that certain approximation techniques are to be developed. A formula for sequences with accumulation points is still to be found.\n\nNumerosities of the sets in higher-dimensional space is another still unsolved problem. Already in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, a bounded set can be made into its own proper subset by a simple rotation. This hints that a numerosity-like measure following Euclid's principle cannot be always rotation-invariant. In any case, the finite part of a numerosity of a set, corresponds to its Euler's characteristic.\n\nThe numerosities of the dense countable sets is another point of uncertainty. In her work[4] Trlifajov\u00e1 estimates the \"size\" of the unit interval of rational numbers:\n$\\frac{3}{10} \\cdot \\alpha^{2}<\\sigma\\left((0,1]_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\right)<\\frac{\\alpha^{2}-\\alpha}{2}$\nWe disagree with this result, as seemingly she had lost the natural ordering in her representation of rational numbers.

So, in absence of any reason to choose one of the two possibilities, we go for the simplest option $n_{\\alpha}\\left((0,1]_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\right)=\\alpha$ \"[9] (Benci \\& Di Nasso 2019, p. 291), which is even more doubtful.\n\nInstead, based on the formula for the Dirichlet function $\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(x)=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(\\lim _{j \\rightarrow \\infty}(\\cos (k!\\pi x))^{2 j}\\right)$, we could represent it as a sum of lattices and naively conjecture $N(\\mathbb{Q})=2 \\omega$ ! and $N\\left([0,1)_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\right)=\\Gamma(\\omega)$. Using similar ideas, we can naively derive that the numerosity of the dyadic rationals could be $\\omega 2^{\\omega}$.\n\nAll these ideas though, seemingly conflict with the Euclid's principle as one can construct (in all of the proposed theories) a discrete sequence of rationals with numerosity greater than $2 \\omega$ ! and $\\omega 2^{\\omega}$ which would still be a subset of the rational numbers.\n\nAPPENDIX 1.

  "abstract": "We introduce the concept of numerosity, a measure of a set's size, more\nprecise than cardinality and satisfying the Euclid's principle \"the whole is\ngreater than a part\" as a surreal number and provide an explicit formula for\nexpressing numerosities of some sequences that have no more than one\naccumulation point as surreal expressions, with examples. Then (mapping surreal\nnumbers to divergent integrals and interpreting them as Laplace transforms) we\nintroduce a surreal-valued function that shares many properties with the Dirac\nDelta distribution and employ it to derive some integration properties of\nsurreal values. Finally, we provide a formula for integrating a surreal-valued\nfunction over surreal domain, employing numerosity in a way, similar to\nLebesgue measure and derive some novel formulas, connecting surreal numbers via\nintegration. The suggested here method of surreal integration is different from\nmethods suggested by other authors in not satisfying the property of linearity\nregarding infinite factors. In our opinion, the struggle to keep this rule\nintact is the reason for many failed attempts to define the surreal\nintegration. For the suggested formulas, code in Wolfram Mathematica language\nis provided.",
