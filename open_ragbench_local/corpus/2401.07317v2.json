      "text": "## Introduction\n\nIt is well known that algebras associated with idempotent semirings are related to particular geometric representations. This article investigates some of these properties through the non-associative symmetrization of Max-Times algebras. The concept of $\\mathbb{B}$-convexity was introduced in [12] as a Painlev\u00e9-Kuratowski limit of generalized convexities. ${ }^{1}$ This fundamental idea is related to earlier work by Ben-Tal [5] and Avriel [2]. When restricted to the nonnegative orthant, $\\mathbb{B}$-convexity coincides with Max-Times convexity. In this context, an algebraic formulation has been established in the idempotent Max-Times semiring $\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right.$, max, $\\left.\\times\\right)$ by applying the transformation $+\\rightarrow$ max in the nonnegative Euclidean orthant. The idempotent Max-Times semiring is homeomorphic to the Max-Plus semiring $(\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty\\}$, max, +$)$ via a logarithmic transformation, and $\\mathbb{B}$-convex sets emerge from a broad class of idempotent algebraic structures introduced in [26] and derived from the notion of dequantization (see also [24]).\n\nHahn-Banach-type separation properties [14] and fixed-point results have been established in [13]. Other idempotent convex structures have been proposed in [1] and [30]. The algebraic formulation of $\\mathbb{B}$-convexity was previously limited to the Max-Times semi-module $\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}, \\vee, \\times\\right)$. To address this limitation, an idempotent and non-associative binary operation was introduced in [8] by considering a special class of idempotent and non-associative magmas. In this paper, we introduce an $n$-ary operation associated with a suitable class of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *University of Perpignan, LAMPS, 52 avenue Villeneuve, 66000 Perpignan, France. emailbriec@univ-perp.fr\n    ${ }^{1}$ The letter $\\mathbb{B}$, used to define a corresponding notion of convexity may be confusing in light of the concept of convexity introduced by Anatole Beck in Banach spaces in 1962. It was chosen due to the origins of the names of several members of the mathematics department at the University of Perpignan at the time of the publication of the first paper [12]. Additionally, it can be linked to the work of Aaron Ben-Tal [5], whose paper plays a crucial role in the context of these articles. Another reason for this choice is that the operation $\\mathbb{G}$, pronounced \" $\\mathbb{B}$ oxplus,\" bears a graphical resemblance to the Chebyshev unit ball $\\left(\\ell_{\\infty}\\right)$ when represented in two dimensions with Cartesian coordinates. This ball plays a central role in the proposed approach and is itself the Hausdorff limit of the sequence of $\\ell_{p}$ balls as $p \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nregularized semicontinuous operators. It is worth noting that, when involving only two points, the idempotent and non-associative algebraic structures considered are also mentioned by Gaubert [16] and discussed Viro [31], who explored the complex case.\n\nNote that there exist other approaches to extending idempotent algebraic structures. For example, Izhakian and Rowen [19] introduced supertropical algebra, which involves a similar type of construction based on the notion of a valued monoid. Additionally, the concept of hyperfields, introduced in [21] and [25], provides an alternative approach.\n\nRelaxing associativity preserves both symmetry and idempotency. It has been shown that this notion of convexity can be equivalently characterized by the Kuratowski-Painlev\u00e9 limit of the generalized convex hull of two points as defined in [12]. Some separation results in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ have been established in [9], and the limiting structure of polytopes has been analyzed in [10].\n\nMore recently, these structures have been examined from an algebraic perspective to compute the limit solutions of systems of Max-Times equations, particularly by introducing a special determinant formulation. These results also have geometric implications for determining the equation of a limit hyperplane passing through $n$ points, with possible extensions to Max-Plus algebra.\n\nThis paper continues prior research on this topic from a geometric perspective, introducing appropriate notions of distance. Throughout the paper, an idempotent analogue of subtraction plays a key role.\n\nFirst, we define a space notion suited to the algebraic structure under consideration and generalize the definition of $\\mathbb{B}$-space introduced in [13]. Second, we construct a sequence of generalized metrics via an appropriate homeomorphic transformation of the vector space structure. We demonstrate that their limit properties yield an ultrametric distance intimately linked to the algebraic structure considered. To this end, we derive a notion of orthogonality from the limit inner product defined in [8]. As a result, we establish geometric properties of a special class of right-angle triples, specifically proving a Pythagorean-type relation within this framework. Using the limiting properties of the generalized inner product, we construct a pseudocosine limit function, where the pseudo-cosine is derived from the limiting inner product, and the pseudo-sine stems from the two-dimensional determinant formula established in [11]. Following this approach, we explore potential implications of these properties in the complex plane.\n\nFinally, the paper investigates a notion of line corresponding to the non-associative algebraic structure under study. We show that the Painlev\u00e9-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of generalized lines admits an algebraic description extending a previous result in [8] for a line segment. We establish a condition ensuring that two boundary lines are parallel, analogous (in a certain sense) to the criterion for parallel lines in a vector space. The paper concludes with an analysis of the two-dimensional case, in which a special idempotent geometry is examined. Building on [11], we demonstrate how to compute the equation of a two-dimensional line. The final result describes a plane geometry where a unique line passes through two distinct points, and where a line segment can be extended to a half-line. However, two distinct parallel lines may share an infinite number of points.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 1 introduces the framework of the non-associative idempotent algebraic structure defined in [8], along with some associated convexity notions. Section 2 defines field and space concepts related to this algebraic structure, providing illustrative examples. Section 3 derives an ultrametric distance as the limit of a sequence of generalized metrics. In this context, a triangular equality is established for a special class of right-angle triples. Section 4 explores inner product properties established in [9] and introduces a related notion of pseudo-cosine. Section 5 presents an algebraic description of a line. The paper concludes with an analysis of the geometric implications of the considered algebraic structure.",

      "text": "# 1 Idempotent and Non-Associative Algebraic and Convex Structure\n### 1.1 Isomorphism of vector-Space Structures in Limit\n\nFor all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$, let us consider a bijection $\\varphi_{p}: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined by:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{p}: \\lambda \\longrightarrow \\lambda^{2 p+1}\n$$\n\nand $\\phi_{p}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=\\left(\\varphi_{p}\\left(x_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\varphi_{p}\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\right)$. This is closely related to the approach proposed by Ben-Tal [5] and Avriel [2]. One can induce a field structure on $\\mathbb{R}$ for which $\\varphi_{p}$ becomes a field isomorphism. For $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the indexed sum and the indexed product are simply given by\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\stackrel{p}{+} \\mu=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}(\\lambda)+\\varphi_{p}(\\mu)\\right)=\\left(\\lambda^{2 p+1}+\\mu^{2 p+1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 p+1}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{p} \\mu=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\varphi_{p}(\\mu)\\right)=\\lambda \\cdot \\mu\n$$\n\nThese two operations define a scalar field $(\\mathbb{R}, \\stackrel{p}{+}, \\cdot)$. Given this change of notation via $\\varphi_{p}$ and $\\phi_{p}$, we can define a $\\mathbb{R}$-vector space structure on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by: $\\lambda \\stackrel{\\varphi_{p}}{+} x=\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}(\\lambda) \\cdot \\phi_{p}(x)\\right)=\\lambda \\cdot x$ and $x \\stackrel{\\varphi_{p}}{+} y=\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\phi_{p}(x)+\\phi_{p}(y)\\right)$. We call these two operations the multiplication by scalar and the indexed sum (indexed by $\\varphi_{p}$ ).\n\nThe $\\varphi_{p}$-sum denoted $\\sum^{\\varphi_{p}}$ of $\\left(x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$ is defined by ${ }^{2}$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in[m]}^{\\varphi_{p}} x^{(j)}=\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{j \\in[m]} \\phi_{p}\\left(x^{(j)}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFor the sake simplicity, throughout the paper we denote for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ :\n\n$$\nx \\stackrel{p}{+} y=x \\stackrel{\\varphi_{p}}{+} y\n$$\n\nRecall that Kuratowski-Painlev\u00e9 lower limit of the sequence of sets $\\left\\{A_{n}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, denoted $\\operatorname{Li}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{n}$, is the set of points $x$ for which there exists a sequence $\\left\\{x^{(n)}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of points such that $x^{(n)} \\in A_{n}$ for all $n$ and $x=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x^{(n)}$. The Kuratowski-Painlev\u00e9 upper limit of the sequence of sets $\\left\\{A_{n}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, denoted $\\mathrm{Ls}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{n}$, is the set of points $x$ for which there exists a subsequence $\\left\\{x^{\\left(n_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of points such that $x^{\\left(n_{k}\\right)} \\in A_{n_{k}}$ for all $k$ and $x=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} x^{\\left(n_{k}\\right)}$. A sequence $\\left\\{A_{n}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is said to converge, in the Kuratowski-Painlev\u00e9 sense, to a set $A$ if $\\mathrm{Ls}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{n}=A=\\operatorname{Li}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{n}$, in which case we write $A=\\operatorname{Lim}_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} A_{n}$.\n\nIn [8] it was shown that for all $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\lambda \\stackrel{p}{+} \\mu= \\begin{cases}\\lambda & \\text { if } \\quad|\\lambda|>|\\mu| \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda+\\mu) & \\text { if } \\quad|\\lambda|=|\\mu| \\\\ \\mu & \\text { if } \\quad|\\lambda|<|\\mu|\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAlong this line one can introduce the binary operation $\\boxplus$ defined for all $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\boxplus \\mu=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\lambda \\stackrel{p}{+} \\mu\n$$\n\nThough the operation $\\boxplus$ does not satisfy associativity, it can be extended by constructing a non-associative algebraic structure which returns to a given $n$-tuple a real value. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and all subsets $I$ of $[n]$, let us consider the map $\\xi_{I}[x]: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ defined for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by\n\n$$\n\\xi_{I}[x](\\alpha)=\\operatorname{Card}\\left\\{i \\in I: x_{i}=\\alpha\\right\\}-\\operatorname{Card}\\left\\{i \\in I: x_{i}=-\\alpha\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThis map measures the symmetry of the occurrences of a given value $\\alpha$ in the coordinates of a vector $x$.\nFor all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ let $\\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)$ be a subset of $I$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)=\\left\\{j \\in I: \\xi_{I}\\left[x \\mid\\left(x_{j}\\right) \\neq 0\\right\\}=I \\backslash\\left\\{i \\in I: \\xi_{I}\\left[x \\mid\\left(x_{i}\\right)=0\\right\\}\\right.\\right.\n$$\n\n$\\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)$ is called the residual index set of $x$. It is obtained by dropping from $I$ all the $i$ 's such that $\\operatorname{Card}\\left\\{j \\in I: x_{j}=x_{i}\\right\\}=\\operatorname{Card}\\left\\{j \\in I: x_{j}=-x_{i}\\right\\}$.\n\nFor all positive natural numbers $n$ and for all subsets $I$ of $[n]$, let $\\digamma_{I}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be the map defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ For all positive natural numbers $n,[n]=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\n$$\n\\digamma_{I}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)} x_{i} & \\text { if } \\quad \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x) \\neq \\emptyset \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\xi_{I}[x]\\left(\\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)}\\left|x_{i}\\right|\\right)>0 \\\\ \\min _{i \\in \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)} x_{i} & \\text { if } \\quad \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x) \\neq \\emptyset \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\xi_{I}[x]\\left(\\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)}\\left|x_{i}\\right|\\right)<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\xi_{I}[x]$ is the map defined in (8) and $\\mathcal{J}_{I}(x)$ is the residual index set of $x$. The operation that takes an $n$-tuple $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and returns a single real value $\\digamma_{I}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ is called an $n$-ary extension of the binary operation $\\boxplus$, for all natural numbers $n \\geq 1$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $I$ is a nonempty subset of $[n]$.\n\nAccording to [8], for any $n$-tuple $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$, the operation can be defined as:\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_{i}=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i \\in I}^{\\varphi_{p}} x_{i}=F_{I}(x)\n$$\n\nClearly, this operation encompasses as a special case the binary operation mentioned in [16] and defined in equation (6). For all $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ :\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{i \\in\\{1,2\\}} x_{i}=x_{1} \\boxplus x_{2}\n$$\n\nFor example, if $x=(-3,-2,3,3,1,-3)$, we have $F_{[6]}(-3,-2,3,3,1,-3)=F_{[2]}(-2,1)=-2=\\bigoplus_{i \\in[6]} x_{i}$. There are some basic properties that can be inherited from the above algebraic structure: (i) for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, one has: $\\alpha\\left(\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_{i}\\right)=\\bigoplus_{i \\in I}\\left(\\alpha x_{i}\\right) ;(i i)$ suppose that $x \\in \\epsilon \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ where $\\epsilon$ is +1 or -1 . Then $\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_{i}=$ $\\epsilon \\max _{i \\in I}\\left\\{\\epsilon x_{i}\\right\\} ;(i i i)$ we have $\\left|\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_{i}\\right| \\leq \\bigoplus_{i \\in I}\\left|x_{i}\\right| ;(i v)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left[x_{i} \\boxplus\\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in I \\backslash\\{i\\}} x_{j}\\right)\\right] \\in\\left\\{0, \\bigoplus_{j \\in I} x_{j}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} x_{i}=\\bigoplus_{i \\in I}\\left[x_{i} \\boxplus\\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in I \\backslash\\{i\\}} x_{j}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe algebraic structure $(\\mathbb{R}, \\boxplus, \\cdot)$ can be extended to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Suppose that $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and let us denote $x \\boxplus y=\\left(x_{1} \\boxplus y_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} \\boxplus y_{n}\\right)$. Moreover, let us consider $m$ vectors $x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and define\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{j \\in[m]} x^{(j)}=\\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in[m]} x_{1}^{(j)}, \\ldots, \\bigoplus_{j \\in[m]} x_{n}^{(j)}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe $n$-ary operation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow \\bigoplus_{i \\in[n]} x_{i}$ is not associative. To simplify the notations of the paper, for all $z \\in\\left\\{z_{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{m}}: i_{k} \\in I_{k}, k \\in[m]\\right\\}$, where $I_{1}, \\ldots, I_{m}$ are $m$ index subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$, we use the notation:\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{\\substack{i_{k} \\in I_{k} \\\\ k \\in[m]}} z_{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{m}}=\\prod_{\\left(i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{m}\\right) \\in \\prod_{k \\in[m]} I_{k}} z_{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{m}}\n$$\n\nNotice that since the operation $\\boxplus$ is not associative, it can be ambiguous to apply without using the symbol $\\bigoplus$ indexed on a given finite subset $I$. In the remainder, for the sake of simplicity, and when it is more convenient, we will adopt the following notational convention. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ :\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{i \\in[n]} x_{i}=x_{1} \\boxplus \\cdots \\boxplus x_{n}\n$$\n\nIn the sequel, for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ we will often use the following notation to define an idempotent analogue of the subtraction operation:\n\n$$\nx \\boxminus y=x \\boxplus(-y)\n$$",

If $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle$ is the canonical inner product over $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then there exists a symmetric bilinear form $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle_{\\varphi_{p}}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined by:\n\n$$\n\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\varphi_{p}}=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\langle\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right\\rangle\\right)=\\left(\\sum_{i \\in[n]} x_{i}^{2 p+1} y_{i}^{2 p+1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 p+1}}\n$$\n\nNow, let us denote $\\left[\\langle y, \\cdot\\rangle_{\\varphi_{p}} \\leq \\lambda\\right]=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}:\\langle y, x\\rangle_{\\varphi_{p}} \\leq \\lambda\\right\\}$. For the sake of simplicity, let us denote $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle_{p}$ this scalar product.\n\nIn what follows, we state some results obtained in $[8,9]$ by taking the limit. We first introduce the operation $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle_{\\infty}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by $\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[n]} x_{i} y_{i}$. Let $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$ be the Tchebychev norm defined by $\\|x\\|_{\\infty}=\\max _{i \\in[n]}\\left|x_{i}\\right|$. It is established in [8] that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we have: $(i) \\sqrt{\\langle x, x\\rangle_{\\infty}}=\\|x\\|_{\\infty} ;(i i)\\left|\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}\\right| \\leq\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\\|y\\|_{\\infty} ;(i i i)$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\alpha\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\langle\\alpha x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\langle x, \\alpha y\\rangle_{\\infty}$. By definition, we have for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ :\n\n$$\n\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow \\infty}\\langle x, y\\rangle_{p}\n$$\n\nA map $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x)=\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is called an idempotent symmetric form. In the following, for all maps $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and all real numbers $c$, the notation [ $f \\leq c$ ] stands for the set $f^{-1}(]-\\infty, c[)$. Similarly, $[f<c]$ stands for $f^{-1}(]-\\infty, c[)$ and $[f \\geq c]=[-f \\leq-c]$.\n\nFor all $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let us define the binary operation\n\n$$\nu \\doteq v=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\nu & \\text { if } & |u|>|v| \\\\\n\\min \\{u, v\\} & \\text { if } & |u|=|v| \\\\\nv & \\text { if } & |u|<|v|\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nNote that in [19], a polynomial theory for supertropical algebra was proposed. To achieve this, a similar operation was constructed by extending the tropical semiring with a suitable valuation function. Both proposed constructions follow a similar principle. However, in our approach, this binary operation is derived from the idempotent semiring $\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}, \\max , \\cdot\\right)$ and the absolute value function.\n\nAn elementary calculus shows that $u \\boxplus v=\\frac{1}{2}[u \\doteq v-[(-u) \\doteq(-v)]]$. It was shown in [14], that this operation is associative.\n\nGiven $m$ elements $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}$ of $\\mathbb{R}$, not all of which are 0 , let $I_{+}$, respectively $I_{-}$, be the set of indices for which $0<u_{i}$, respectively $u_{i}<0$. We can then write $u_{1} \\doteq \\cdots \\doteq u_{m}=\\left(\\tilde{\\sim}_{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i}\\right) \\tilde{\\sim}\\left(\\tilde{\\sim}_{i \\in I_{-}} u_{i}\\right)=$ $\\left(\\max _{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i}\\right) \\tilde{\\sim}\\left(\\min _{i \\in I_{-}} u_{i}\\right)$ from which we have\n\n$$\nu_{1} \\doteq \\cdots \\doteq u_{m}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\max _{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i} & \\text { if } & I_{-}=\\emptyset \\text { or } \\max _{i \\in I_{-}}\\left|u_{i}\\right|<\\max _{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i} \\\\\n\\min _{i \\in I_{-}} u_{i} & \\text { if } & I_{+}=\\emptyset \\text { or } \\max _{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i}<\\max _{i \\in I_{-}}\\left|u_{i}\\right| \\\\\n\\min _{i \\in I_{-}} u_{i} & \\text { if } & \\max _{i \\in I_{-}}\\left|u_{i}\\right|=\\max _{i \\in I_{+}} u_{i}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe define an idempotent lower symmetric form on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as a map $g: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$\n\n$$\ng\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{-}=a_{1} x_{1} \\doteq \\cdots \\doteq a_{n} x_{n}\n$$\n\nIt was established in [8] that for all $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $g^{-1}(]-\\infty, c])=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid g(x) \\leq c\\right\\}$ is closed. It follows that an idempotent lower symmetric form is lower semi-continuous. It was also shown in [8] that for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the idempotent lower symmetrical form $g$ defined by $g\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=a_{1} x_{1} \\doteq \\cdots \\doteq a_{n} x_{n}$, is the lower semi-continuous regularization of the map $x \\mapsto\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[n]} a_{i} x_{i}$.\n\nSimilarly, one can introduce a binary operation defined for all $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ as\n\n$$\nu \\stackrel{+}{+}=-[(-u) \\doteq(-v)]\n$$\n\nwhich is associative. Along these lines, one can define an idempotent upper symmetric form as a map $h: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\n\n$$\nh\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{+}=a_{1} x_{1} \\stackrel{+}{+} \\cdots \\stackrel{+}{+} a_{n} x_{n}\n$$\n\nFor all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we clearly, have the following identities\n\n$$\n\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{+}=-\\langle a,-x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{-} \\text {and }\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{-}=-\\langle a,-x\\rangle_{\\infty}^{+}\n$$\n\nFor any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the idempotent upper symmetric form $h$ defined by $h\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=a_{1} x_{1} \\stackrel{+}{+} \\cdots \\stackrel{+}{+} a_{n} x_{n}$, is the upper semi-continuous regularization of the map $x \\mapsto\\langle a, x\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[n]} a_{i} x_{i}$.\n\nThese forms can be related to the construction of a ring involving a balance relation symmetrizing the semi-ring $\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}, \\vee, \\cdot\\right)$ (see [11], see also [18] and [28] in a Max-Plus context).\n\nMore, recently, the following notion of determinant was introduced in [11]. The set $\\mathbb{R}$, equipped with the operation $\\boxplus$, allows for the definition of a suitable notion of determinant (see $[10,11]$ ).\nWe denote by $\\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ the set of square matrices of order $n$ with real entries. We introduce over $\\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ the map $\\Phi_{p}: \\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ defined for all matrices $A=\\left(a_{i, j}\\right)_{\\substack{i=1 \\ldots n \\\\ j=1 \\ldots n}} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ by:\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{p}(A)=\\left(\\varphi_{p}\\left(a_{i, j}\\right)\\right)_{\\substack{i=1 \\ldots n \\\\ j=1 \\ldots n}}=\\left(a_{i, j}^{2 p+1}\\right)_{\\substack{i=1 \\ldots n \\\\ j=1 \\ldots n}}\n$$\n\nIts reciprocal is the map $\\Phi_{p}^{-1}: \\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R})$ defined by:\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{p}^{-1}(A)=\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(a_{i, j}\\right)\\right)_{\\substack{i=1 \\ldots n \\\\ j=1 \\ldots n}}=\\left(a_{i, j} \\frac{1}{2 p+1}\\right)_{\\substack{i=1 \\ldots n \\\\ j=1 \\ldots n}}\n$$\n\n$\\Phi_{p}$ is a natural extension of the map $\\phi_{p}$ from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\\mathcal{M}_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) . \\Phi_{p}(A)$ is the $2 p+1$ Hadamard power of matrix $A$. In the following we introduce the matrix product:\n\n$$\nA^{p} x=\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\Phi_{p}(A) \\cdot \\phi_{p}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is easy to see that the map $x \\mapsto A^{p} x$ is $\\varphi_{p}$-linear, that is linear with respect to the algebraic operation $\\stackrel{p}{+}$ and the usual scalar multiplication. Conversely, if $g$ is a $\\varphi_{p}$-linear map then it can be represented by a matrix $A$ such that $g(x)=A^{p} x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nFor any $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, let $|A|$ denote its determinant. We now introduce the following definition of the $\\varphi_{p}$-determinant:\n\n$$\n|A|_{p}=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left|\\Phi_{p}(A)\\right|\n$$\n\nUsing the Leibnitz formula yields\n\n$$\n|A|_{p}=\\left(\\sum_{\\sigma \\in \\mathfrak{S}_{n}} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i \\in[n]} a_{i, \\sigma(i)}^{2 p+1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2 p+1}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$ is the set of all the permutations defined on $[n]$.\nAlong this line, one can define a determinant in limit as follows:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}|A|_{p}:=|A|_{\\infty}=\\bigoplus_{\\sigma \\in \\mathfrak{S}_{n}}\\left(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i \\in[n]} a_{i, \\sigma(i)}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis notion is compared in [11] to that of permanent originally defined in the framework of Max-Plus algebras (se $[7]$ and $[6]$ ).",

The definition of $\\mathbb{B}$ convex sets is based on the definition of the Kuratowski-Painlev\u00e9 limit of a sequence of $\\phi_{p}$-convex sets. For a non-empty finite subset $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ we let $C o^{\\infty}(A)=\\mathrm{L} s_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p}(A)$. A subset $C$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is $\\mathbb{B}$-convex if for all finite subsets $A$ of $C, C o^{\\infty}(A) \\subset C$. The structure of $\\mathbb{B}$-convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ will involve the order structure, with respect to the positive cone of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$; we denote by $\\bigvee_{i \\in[m]} x^{(i)}$ the least upper bound of $x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that is:\n\n$$\n\\bigvee_{i \\in[m]} x^{(i)}=\\left(\\max \\left\\{x_{1}^{(1)}, \\ldots, x_{1}^{(m)}\\right\\}, \\ldots, \\max \\left\\{x_{n}^{(1)}, \\ldots, x_{n}^{(m)}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhen $A=\\left\\{x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$, it was shown in [12] that:\n\n$$\nC o^{\\infty}(A)=\\left\\{\\bigvee_{i \\in[m]} t_{i} x^{(i)}: t_{i} \\in[0,1], \\max _{i \\in[m]} t_{i}=1\\right\\}=\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p}(A)\n$$\n\nMoreover it is also proved that the sequence is Hausdorff convergent. In addition, if the set $A$ is contained in any $n$-dimensional orthant, it was established in [8] that $C o^{\\infty}(A)=\\left\\{\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[m]} t_{i} x^{(i)}: t_{i} \\in[0,1], \\max _{i \\in[m]} t_{i}=\\right.$ $1\\}$.\n\nIf $L \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ is $\\mathbb{B}$-convex, then $L=\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p}(L)=\\bigcap_{p=0}^{\\infty} C o^{p}(L)$. For all $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$, we denote $C o^{\\infty}(S)=\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p}(S)$. Properties of this operation are developed in [12]. In particular, for all $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}, C o^{\\infty}(S)$ is $\\mathbb{B}$-convex or equivalently Max-Times convex.\n\nAn important limitation of this definition of $\\mathbb{B}$-convexity is that its algebraic form is restricted to the non-negative orthant $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$, over which the idempotent Max-Times semiring is considered. To circumvent this difficulty an extended definition of $\\mathbb{B}$-convexity other $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ was suggested in [8]. A subset $C$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is said to be idempotent symmetric convex ${ }^{3}$ if, for all $x, y \\in C$ and for all $t \\in[0,1]$,\n\n$$\nx \\boxplus t y \\in C\n$$\n\nIt was shown in [8] that the sequence of subsets $\\left\\{C o^{(p)}(x, y)\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has a Painlev\u00e9-Kuratowski limit denoted $C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$. These points can be expressed trough an explicit algebraic formula in term of the idempotent and non-associative algebraic structure defined on $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1: Examples of sets $C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$.\nMoreover, it was established in [8] that this limit entirely characterizes an idempotent symmetric convex set. A subset $C$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is idempotent symmetric convex if and only if for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} C o^{\\infty}(x, y) \\subset C$. More recently, it has been established in [10] that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$ is idempotent symmetric convex and thereby $C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$ is the smallest idempotent symmetric convex set that contains $\\{x, y\\}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ Referred to as $\\mathbb{B}^{1}$-convexity in [8], this concept is given a more intuitive terminology here.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFig. 2: Examples of idempotent symmetric convex sets",

      "text": "### 2.1 Idempotent Symmetric Fields and Spaces\n\nA finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{B}$-space (Max-Times space) is, by definition, a subset $X$ of $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ such that $0 \\in X$, for all $t \\geq 0$ and all $x \\in X, t x \\in X$ and for all $x, y \\in X, x \\vee t y \\in X$.\n\nWe first define a suitable notion of idempotent pseudo-field. By comparing this definition with that of a field, note that we consider a weakened form of associativity and idempotence is added.\n\nDefinition 2.1.1 A triple $\\left(K, \\boxplus_{K}, \\cdot_{K}\\right)$ is an idempotent pseudo-field if:\n(a) There exits a binary operation $\\boxplus_{K}: K \\times K \\longrightarrow K$ that satisfies the following properties: (i) for all $\\lambda \\in K$ we have $\\lambda \\boxplus_{K} \\lambda=\\lambda$ (idempotence); (ii) for all $(\\lambda, \\mu) \\in K \\times K$ we have $\\lambda \\boxplus_{K} \\mu=\\mu \\boxplus_{K} \\lambda$ (commutativity); (iii) there exists a neutral element $0_{K} \\in K$ such that $\\lambda \\boxplus_{K} 0_{K}=0_{K} \\boxplus_{K} \\lambda=\\lambda$ for all $\\lambda \\in K$; (iv) every $\\lambda \\in K$ has a symmetric element $-\\lambda$ such that $(-\\lambda) \\boxplus_{K} \\lambda=\\lambda \\boxplus_{K}(-\\lambda)=0_{X}$ (symmetry); (v) for any mutually non-symmetric triple of elements $(\\lambda, \\mu, \\eta) \\in K^{3},\\left(\\lambda \\boxplus_{K} \\mu\\right) \\boxplus_{K} \\eta=\\lambda \\boxplus_{K}\\left(\\mu \\boxplus_{K} \\eta\\right)$ (weakened form of associativity).\n(b) There exists a scalar multiplication $\\cdot_{K}: K \\times K \\longrightarrow K$ that satisfies the following properties: (i) for all $\\lambda \\in K$ and all $(\\lambda, \\mu) \\in K \\times K$, we have $\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\mu=\\mu \\cdot{ }_{K} \\lambda$ (commutativity); (ii) for all $\\lambda, \\mu, \\eta \\in K \\times K \\times K$ we have $\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\mu\\right) \\cdot{ }_{K} \\eta=\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}\\left(\\mu \\cdot{ }_{K} \\eta\\right)$ (associativity); (iii) there is an element $1_{K} \\in K$ such that for all $\\lambda \\in K$ we have $1_{K} \\cdot{ }_{K} \\lambda=\\lambda$; (iv) for all $\\lambda \\in K \\backslash\\left\\{0_{K}\\right\\}$ there exists an element $\\lambda^{-1}$ such that $\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\lambda^{-1}=1_{K}$.\n(c) The multiplication $\\cdot{ }_{K}$ is distributive over the operation $\\boxplus_{K}$ : for all $\\lambda \\in K$ and all $(\\mu, \\nu) \\in K \\times K$, we have\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot_{K}\\left(\\mu \\boxplus_{K} \\nu\\right)=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\mu\\right) \\boxplus_{K}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\nu\\right)\n$$\n\nExample 2.1.2 From [8], the triple $(\\mathbb{R}, \\boxplus, \\cdot)$, where $\\boxplus$ is the binary operation defined in (6) is an idempotent pseudo-field.\n\nIn the following, when we use the $\\boxplus$ symbol without further specification on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ this will mean that we are considering the binary operation defined in equation (6) and its related $n$-ary extension.\n\nExample 2.1.3 We consider the case of the non-associative symmetrisation of the Max-Plus semi-module analysed in [11]. Let $\\mathbb{M}=\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty\\}$ and let us denote $(\\mathbb{M}, \\oplus, \\otimes)$ the Maslov's semi-module where we replace the operations $\\vee$ with $\\oplus$ and + with $\\otimes$. More precisely one can define on $\\mathbb{M}$ the operations $\\oplus$ and $\\otimes$ respectively as $x \\oplus y=\\max \\{x, y\\}$ and $x \\otimes y=x+y$, where $-\\infty$ is the neutral element of the operation $\\oplus$.\n\nSuppose now that $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{-}$and let us extend the logarithm function to the whole set of real numbers. This we do by introducing the set\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}=\\mathbb{M} \\cup(\\mathbb{R}+\\mathrm{i} \\pi)\n$$\n\nwhere i is the complex number such that $\\mathrm{i}^{2}=-1$ and $\\mathbb{R}+\\mathrm{i} \\pi=\\{x+\\mathrm{i} \\pi: x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Note that this approach is not an extension to the complex numbers. In fact, it designates a copy of the real numbers. Note also that in [19], the authors propose a closely related construction, though not a symmetric one, by creating a copy of the real numbers. The formalism proposed in this paper is however convenient for introducing the following extended logarithmic function to $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}$ and transferring the algebraic structure of the real set. Let $\\psi_{\\ln }: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}$ be the map defined by:\n\n$$\n\\psi_{\\ln }(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\ln (x) & \\text { if } x>0 \\\\\n-\\infty & \\text { if } x=0 \\\\\n\\ln (-x)+\\mathrm{i} \\pi & \\text { if } x<0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe map $x \\mapsto \\psi_{\\ln }(x)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}$. Let $\\psi_{\\exp }(x): \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be its inverse. Notice that $\\psi_{\\ln }(-1)=\\mathrm{i} \\pi$. By definition we have $z \\widetilde{\\boxplus} u=\\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\psi_{\\exp }(z) \\boxplus \\psi_{\\exp }(u)\\right)$. Moreover, we have $z \\widetilde{\\otimes} u=$ $\\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\psi_{\\exp }(z) \\otimes \\psi_{\\exp }(u)\\right)$. It follows that $(\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}, \\widetilde{\\oplus}, \\widetilde{\\otimes})$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{R}, \\boxplus, \\cdot)$ and is also an idempotent pseudofield with the neutral elements $0_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}}=-\\infty$ and $1_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}}=0$.\n\nIn Chapter 3 of [22] it was shown that Max-Plus algebra can also be viewed as a limit algebraic structure via the dequantization principle. For all $z \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}$, let us denote:\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\bigoplus}_{i \\in[n]} z_{i}=\\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\bigoplus_{i \\in[n]} \\psi_{\\exp }\\left(z_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom [11], it follows that for all $z \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\bigoplus}_{i \\in[n]} z_{i}=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2 p+1} \\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\sum_{i \\in[n]} \\psi_{\\exp }\\left((2 p+1) z_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the following, we give another example arising in a Min -Times context (see [1] for more details.)\nExample 2.1.4 Let us define $\\mathbb{R}^{-1}:=\\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$. Let us consider the binary operation $\\boxplus^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^{-1} \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}^{-1} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{-1}$ defined as:\n\n$$\nx \\boxplus^{-1} y=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\nx & \\text { if } & |x|<|y| \\\\\ny & \\text { if } & |x|>|y| \\\\\n+\\infty & \\text { if } & x+y=0 \\\\\nx & \\text { if } & x=y\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThis operation is idempotent, has $+\\infty$ as neutral element and is symmetric. Moreover, the standard product of non-zero numbers in $\\mathbb{R}^{-1}$ satisfies the desired condition.\n\nRemark 2.1.5 In [31], an idempotent algebraic structure was derived from a suitable dequantization principle defined over the complex scalar field. Let us consider the binary operation $\\boxplus_{\\mathbb{C}}: \\mathbb{C} \\times \\mathbb{C} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ defined as:\n\n$$\nz \\boxplus_{\\mathbb{C}} w=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\nz & \\text { if } & |z|>|w| \\\\\nw & \\text { if } & |z|<|w| \\\\\n0 & \\text { if } & z+w=0 \\\\\n\\rho \\frac{z+w}{|z+w|} & \\text { if } & |z|=|w|=\\rho>0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nIt is easy to check that this operation is idempotent, has 0 as neutral element and is symmetric. Moreover, the standard product of complex numbers fulfils all the desired conditions. In addition note that this product is distributive over the operation $\\boxplus_{\\mathbb{C}}$. In particular, if $|z|=|w|=\\rho>0$ then we have for all $u \\in \\mathbb{C}$ :\n\n$$\nu \\cdot\\left(z \\boxplus_{\\mathbb{C}} w\\right)=u \\rho \\frac{z+w}{|z+w|}=\\rho \\frac{u z+u w}{|z+w|}=\\rho|u| \\frac{u z+u w}{|u z+u w|}=(u z) \\boxplus_{\\mathbb{C}}(u w)\n$$\n\nHowever, it does not satisfy the weakened form of associativity of an idempotent pseudo-field.\n\nDefinition 2.1.6 A triple $\\left(X, \\boxplus_{X}, \\cdot{ }_{K}\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space defined over a idempotent pseudofield $K$ if:\n(a) There exits a binary operation $\\boxplus_{X}: X \\times X \\longrightarrow X$ that satisfies the following properties: (i) for all $x \\in X$ we have $x \\boxplus_{X} x=x$; (ii) for all $(x, y) \\in X \\times X$ we have $x \\boxplus_{X} y=y \\boxplus_{X} x$; (iii) there exists a neutral element $0_{X} \\in X$ such that $x \\boxplus_{X} 0_{X}=0_{X} \\boxplus_{X} x$ for all $x \\in X$; (iv) every $x \\in X$ has a symmetric element $-x$ such that $(-x) \\boxplus_{X} x=x \\boxplus_{X}(-x)=0_{X}$.\n(b) There exists a scalar multiplication $\\cdot{ }_{K}: \\mathbb{R} \\times X \\longrightarrow X$ that satisfies the following properties: (i) for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all $(x, y) \\in X \\times X$, we have $\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} y\\right)$; (ii) for all $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ we have $\\left(\\lambda \\boxplus_{K} \\mu\\right) \\cdot{ }_{K} x=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(\\mu \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right)$, (iii) for all $\\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ we have $\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} \\mu\\right) \\cdot{ }_{K} x=\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}\\left(\\mu \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right)$; (iv) for all $x \\in X$ we have $1 \\cdot{ }_{K} x=x$ and $-x=(-1) \\cdot{ }_{K} x$.\n\nSuppose that $X$ is an idempotent symmetric space. A subset $Y$ of $X$ is an idempotent symmetric subspace if for all $x, y \\in Y$ and all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}, x \\boxplus_{X} t y \\in Y$. Notice that, in this definition, associativity has been replaced with idempotence. Clearly, $(\\mathbb{R}, \\boxplus, \\cdot)$ is an idempotent symmetric space.\n\nLemma 2.1.7 Suppose that $\\left(X, \\boxplus_{X}, \\cdot{ }_{K}\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space defined over an idempotent pseudo-field $K$. Then, for all $x \\in X$, one has:\n(a) $\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} 0_{X}=0_{X}$\n(b) $0_{K} \\cdot{ }_{K} x=0_{X}$\n(c) $\\left((-y) \\boxplus_{X}(-x)\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=0_{X}$.\n\nProof: (a) By definition, for all $x \\in X$ and all $\\lambda \\in K, \\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} 0_{X}=\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X}(-x)\\right)$ for all $x \\in X$. Using axioms $\\left(b_{1}\\right),\\left(b_{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{4}\\right)$ yields $\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} 0_{X}=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}(-x)\\right)=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}(-1) \\cdot{ }_{K}\\right.$ $x)$ ) $=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left((-1) \\cdot{ }_{K} \\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right)\\right)=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(-\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right)\\right)=0_{X}$. (b) We have for all $x \\in X$, $0_{K} \\cdot{ }_{K} x=\\left(1_{K} \\boxplus\\left(-1_{K}\\right)\\right) x=\\left(1_{K} \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(\\left(-1_{K}\\right) \\cdot{ }_{K} x\\right)=x \\boxplus_{X}(-x)=0_{X}$. (c) For all $x, y \\in X$, $\\left((-y) \\boxplus_{X}(-x)\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=\\left(\\left(-1_{K}\\right) \\cdot{ }_{K} y \\boxplus_{X}\\left(-1_{K}\\right) \\cdot x\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=\\left(\\left(-1_{K}\\right) \\cdot\\left(y \\boxplus_{X} x\\right)\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=$ $-\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right) \\boxplus_{X}\\left(x \\boxplus_{X} y\\right)=0_{X}$.\n\nProposition 2.1.8 Let $X$ be an idempotent symmetric space. The intersection of two idempotent symmetric subspaces of $X$ is an idempotent symmetric subspace.\n\nExample 2.1.9 $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space. $Y=\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}: x_{1}=x_{2}, x_{3}=x_{4}\\right\\}$ is an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$.\n\nIn the following, if $K$ is an idempotent pseudo-field, we define the operations for all $x, y \\in K^{n}$ and all $\\lambda \\in K$ as follows:\n\n$$\nx \\boxplus_{K} y=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\boxplus_{K}\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)=\\left(x_{1} \\boxplus_{K} y_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} \\boxplus_{K} y_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x=\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=\\left(\\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda \\cdot{ }_{K} x_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe two following examples are based on this construction.\nExample 2.1.10 $\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}, \\widehat{\\boxplus}, \\widehat{\\otimes}\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space.\nExample 2.1.11 $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{-n}, \\boxplus^{-1}, \\cdot\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space, with $\\mathbb{R}^{-n}=\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{-1}\\right)^{n}$.\nIn the next example, it is shown that a similar construction can be applied to certain infinite-dimensional spaces.\n\nExample 2.1.12 Suppose that $I$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ and let $\\lambda$ be the Lebesgue measure. Let $L_{p}(\\lambda)$ be the set of the real valued maps $f: I \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{I}|f|^{p} d \\lambda<+\\infty\n$$\n\nfor $p \\in] 1,+\\infty[$. Let us consider the binary operation defined over $L_{p}(\\lambda)$ by:\n\n$$\nf \\boxplus g: x \\mapsto f(x) \\boxplus g(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rll}\nf(x) & \\text { if } & |f(x)| & > & |f(y)| \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}(f(x)+f(y)) & \\text { if } & |f(x)| & = & |f(y)| \\\\\nf(y) & \\text { if } & |f(x)| & < & |f(y)|\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nClearly, one has $|f(x) \\boxplus g(x)| \\leq|f(x)|+|g(x)|$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\int_{I}|f \\boxplus g|^{p} d \\lambda<\\int_{I}|f|^{p} d \\lambda+\\int_{I}|g|^{p} d \\lambda<\\infty\n$$\n\nLet $\\cdot$ be the standard product of a real valued function by a real scalar, it follows that $\\left(L_{p}(\\lambda), \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$ is an idempotent symmetric space.\n\nRemark 2.1.13 Notice that that Examples 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 are constructed from an homeomorphic transformation of $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$. It is therefore easy to define two convex structures on $\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}, \\widetilde{\\boxplus}, \\widetilde{\\otimes}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{-n}, \\boxplus^{-1}, \\cdot\\right)$ respectively. Namely a subset $M$ of $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}$ is $\\mathbb{M}$-convex if for all $x, y \\in M$ and all $t \\in \\mathbb{M}, x \\boxplus t y \\in C$. Paralleling [1], a subset $C$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{-n}$ is inverse- $\\mathbb{B}$-convex if for all $x, y \\in C$ and all $t \\in[1,+\\infty], x \\boxplus^{-1} t y \\in C$.\n\nThe next result specifically concerns the algebraic structure considered in [8]. However it has some immediate implications for the idempotent symmetric spaces defined in examples 2.1.10 and 2.1.11.\n\nProposition 2.1.14 For all subsets $Y$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the following claims are equivalent:\n(a) $Y$ is an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$.\n(b) For all $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{m}\\right) \\in Y^{m}$ and all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, we have $\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m]} t_{i} x_{i} \\in Y$.\n\nProof: Let us prove that (a) implies (b). If $Y$ is an idempotent symmetric subspace, this property is true for $m=2$. Suppose it is true at rank $m$ and let us prove that it is true at rank $m+1$. In other words, assume that for all $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{m}\\right) \\in Y^{m}$ we have: $\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m]} t_{i} x_{i} \\in Y$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, we need to prove that if $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{m}, x_{m+1}\\right) \\in Y^{m+1}$ then for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ we have $\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m+1]} t_{i} x_{i} \\in Y$. To establish this property, we use equation (12) which implies that if $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{m}, x_{m+1}\\right) \\in Y^{m+1}$ then, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m+1]} t_{i} x_{i}=\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m+1]}\\left[t_{i} x_{i} \\boxplus\\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in[m+1] \\backslash\\{i\\}} t_{j} x_{j}\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\quad(\\star)\n$$\n\nFor all $i$, the vectors $z_{i}=t_{i} x_{i} \\boxplus\\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in[m+1] \\backslash\\{i\\}} t_{j} x_{j}\\right)$ are copositive. Thus the associativity holds true for the $m$-tuple $\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{m}\\right)$. However, since we assume that the property holds true at rank $m, z_{i} \\in Y$ for all $i$. Thus we deduce that $\\bigoplus_{i \\in[m+1]} t_{i} x_{i} \\in Y$. Therefore, the first part of the proof is established. Since $Y$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that is an idempotent symmetric space, the converse inclusion is immediate.\n\nThe following property is an immediate consequence.\nProposition 2.1.15 Let $Y$ be an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$. Then $Y$ is idempotent symmetric convex.",

In particular for all $x, y, z \\in E$, at least one of the three equalities $d(x, y)=d(y, z)$ or $d(x, z)=d(y, z)$ or $d(x, y)=d(z, x)$ holds. From the above definition, one can conclude several typical properties of ultrametrics.\n\nProposition 2.2.4 Let $Y$ be an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n} .\\left(Y, d_{\\boxplus}\\right)$ is an ultrametric space.\nProof: Since $Y$ is an idempotent symmetric space, the metric $d_{\\boxplus}$ is well-defined on $Y$. From Proposition 2.2.3, the result is immediate.\n\nIn the following we say that a sequence $\\left\\{x^{(k)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is $\\digamma$-convergent to $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ if $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(k)}, x\\right)=0$.\nLemma 2.2.5 Suppose that $\\left\\{x^{(k)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is $\\digamma$-convergent to $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $I(x)=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: x_{i} \\neq 0\\right\\}$. Then, there exists some natural number $k_{0}$ such that for all $k \\geq k_{0}$ and for all $i \\in I(x)$ we have $x_{i}^{(k)}=x_{i}$. Moreover, for all $i \\notin I(x), \\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} x_{i}^{(k)}=0$.\n\nProof: Suppose that $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x_{i}^{(k)}, x\\right)=0$. Assume that there exits an increasing subsequence $\\left\\{k_{q}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and some $i_{0} \\in I(x)$ such that, for all $q, x_{i}^{\\left(k_{q}\\right)} \\neq x_{i}$ and let us show a contradiction. In such a case, for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $\\left|x_{i_{0}}^{\\left(k_{q}\\right)} \\boxminus x_{i_{0}}\\right|=\\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i_{0}}^{\\left(k_{q}\\right)}\\right|,\\left|x_{i_{0}}\\right|\\right\\} \\neq 0$.

Hence, there is some $k_{0}$ such that for all $k \\geq k_{0}$ and for all $i \\in I(x)$ we have $x_{i}^{(k)}=x_{i}$. If $i \\notin I(x)$ then $\\left|x_{i}^{(k)} \\boxminus x_{i}\\right|=\\left|x_{i}^{(k)} \\boxminus 0\\right|=\\left|x_{i}^{(k)}\\right|$ and $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(k)}, x\\right)=0$. Therefore, $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} x_{i}^{(k)}=0$.\n\nIt is now interesting to see that the idempotent symmetrized space $\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}, \\widetilde{\\boxplus}, \\widehat{\\otimes}\\right)$ can also be endowed with a suitable form of ultrametric. Let $d_{\\boxplus}: \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n} \\times \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty\\}$ defined as:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(z, w)=\\left.\\widehat{\\bigoplus_{i \\in[n]}}\\left|z_{i} \\widetilde{\\boxminus} w_{i}\\right|_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}}\\right\\rvert\\,\n$$\n\nwhere for all $\\gamma \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}},|\\gamma|_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}}=\\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\left|\\psi_{\\exp }(\\gamma)\\right|\\right)$ and, for all $i, z_{i} \\widetilde{\\boxminus} w_{i}=\\psi_{\\ln }\\left(\\psi_{\\exp }\\left(z_{i}\\right) \\boxminus \\psi_{\\exp }\\left(w_{i}\\right)\\right)$. It is therefore easy to check that: $(i)$ for all $(z, w) \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n} \\times \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}, d_{\\boxplus}(z, w)=-\\infty \\Longleftrightarrow z=w$; (ii) for all $z, t, w \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}$, $d_{\\boxplus}(z, w) \\leq \\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}(z, t), d_{\\boxplus}(t, w)\\right\\}$. Therefore, paralleling Proposition 2.2.4, $(\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}, \\widetilde{\\boxplus}, \\widehat{\\otimes})$ can also be endowed with a topological structure. In particular, we can construct a standard ultrametric by defining for all $z, w \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}$ the distance $\\bar{d}_{\\boxplus}(z, w)=\\psi_{\\exp }\\left(\\bar{d}_{\\boxplus}(z, w)\\right)$.\n\nProposition 2.2.6 Let $Z$ be an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}$. Then $\\left(Z, \\bar{d}_{\\boxplus}\\right)$ is an ultrametric space.",

This map associates to each index $i$ the absolute value of the $i$-th coordinate of $x$. For all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}, \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}(\\alpha)=\\left\\{i \\in I:\\left|x_{i}\\right|=\\alpha\\right\\}$.\n\nFor all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, let $\\mathcal{L}(x, y)$ be a subset of $I$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y)=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: x_{i} \\neq y_{i}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n$\\mathcal{L}(x, y)$ is obtained by dropping from $[n]$ all the $i$ 's such that $x_{i}=y_{i}$. It follows that $d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=0$ if $x=y$ and\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|x_{i}\\right| & \\text { if } & \\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\geq \\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|y_{i}\\right| \\\\\n\\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|y_{i}\\right| & \\text { if } & \\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\leq \\max _{i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)}\\left|y_{i}\\right|\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nif $x \\neq y$. In the next statement we describe the geometry of any ball centered at $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nProposition 2.3.1 Let $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{A}_{x}([n])=\\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} \\mathcal{A}_{x}(i)=\\left\\{\\alpha_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in[m]}$ with $\\alpha_{j}<\\alpha_{j+1}$ for all $j \\in[m-1]$ and $\\alpha_{j} \\geq 0$ for all $j$.\n(i) If $x=0$ and $\\mathcal{A}_{x}([n])=\\{0\\}$, then for all $\\alpha \\geq 0, B_{\\boxplus}(0, \\alpha]=B_{\\infty}(0, \\alpha]$.\n(ii) If either $\\alpha=0$ or $\\alpha \\in\\left[0, \\alpha_{1}\\left[\\right.\\right.$ then $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]=\\{x\\}$.\n(iii) If $\\alpha \\in\\left[\\alpha_{j}, \\alpha_{j+1}\\left[\\right.\\right.$ then $z \\in B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ if and only if:\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{k}\\right| \\leq \\alpha \\text {, for all } k \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[0, \\alpha_{j}\\right]\\right) \\text { and } z_{k}=x_{k} \\text { for all } k \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{j+1}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\n(iv) If $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_{m}=\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$ then $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]=B_{\\infty}(0, \\alpha]$.\n\nProof: (i) is immediate. (ii) If $\\alpha=0$, then $B_{\\boxplus}(x, 0]=\\{x\\}$. If $\\alpha_{1}=0$, the case $\\alpha<\\alpha_{1}$ is then excluded. Suppose that $\\alpha_{1}>0$. For all $z \\neq x, \\max _{i \\in[n]}\\left|x_{i} \\boxplus\\left(-z_{i}\\right)\\right| \\geq \\max _{i \\in[n]}\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\geq \\alpha_{1}$. Therefore $\\alpha<\\alpha_{1}$ implies that $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]=\\{x\\}$. (iii) Suppose that $\\alpha \\in\\left[\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}\\right]$. If there is some $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)$ such that $z_{i} \\neq x_{i}$, then $d_{\\boxplus}(x, z) \\geq \\alpha_{2}>\\alpha_{1}$. Therefore, if $z \\in B_{\\boxplus}(x, 0]$ we should have $z_{i}=x_{i}$ for all $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)$. Moreover, for all $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\{\\alpha_{1}\\right\\}\\right)$ we should have $\\left|z_{i}\\right| \\leq \\alpha$. Let us extend this result to some arbitrary $j \\leq m-1$. Suppose that $\\alpha \\in\\left[\\alpha_{j}, \\alpha_{j+1}\\right]$. If there is some $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{j+1}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)$ such that $z_{i} \\neq x_{i}$, then $d_{\\boxplus}(x, z) \\geq \\alpha_{j+1}>\\alpha_{j}$. Therefore, if $z \\in B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$, we should have $z_{i}=x_{i}$ for all $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{j+1}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)$. Moreover, for all $i \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{j}\\right]\\right)$ we should have $\\left|z_{i}\\right| \\leq \\alpha$. (iv) Suppose now that $\\alpha \\geq\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$. By construction $\\alpha_{m}=\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$ and $z \\in B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ if and only if $\\left|z_{i}\\right| \\leq\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$, which ends the proof.\n\nCorollary 2.3.2 For all $\\alpha \\geq 0$, and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ is closed with respect to the norm topology.\nProof: Let $\\mathcal{A}_{x}([n])=\\left\\{\\alpha_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in[m]}$ with $\\alpha_{j}<\\alpha_{j+1}$ for all $j \\in[m-1]$ and $\\alpha_{j} \\geq 0$ for all $j$. The result is immediate if either $\\alpha=0$ or $\\alpha \\in\\left[0, \\alpha_{1}\\left[\\right.\\right.$ since $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]=\\{x\\}$. From Proposition 2.3.1, if $\\alpha \\in\\left[\\alpha_{j}, \\alpha_{j+1}\\right]$, then\n\n$$\nB_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid z_{k} \\mid \\leq \\alpha, k \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[0, \\alpha_{j}\\right]\\right)\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} z_{k}=x_{k}, k \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\alpha_{j+1}, \\alpha_{m}\\right]\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince the intersection of two closed sets is a closed set, we deduce that $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ is closed. If $\\alpha \\geq\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$, the result is immediate.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nCorollary 2.3.3 For all $\\alpha \\geq 0$, and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ is idempotent symmetric convex.\nProof: From Proposition 2.3.1, $B_{\\boxplus}(x, \\alpha]$ is the cartesian product between a box and a singleton. Since any box is idempotent symmetric convex, the result immediately follows.\n\nIn [8] the following formulation of a $\\mathbb{B}$-polytope was established in the case of two points. ${ }^{4}$ For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\n\n$$\nC o^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: \\max \\{t, r, s, w\\}=1, t, r, s, w \\geq 0\\}\n$$\n\nIn classical convexity, counting the same point twice in a finite set does not alter its convex hull. However, this is not the case here due to the specific properties of the non-associative operation we consider. This formulation is useful to prove the next decomposition result over $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$.\n\nProposition 2.3.4 For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and all $z \\in C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$ we have:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}(x, z), d_{\\boxplus}(z, y)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProof: If $x=y$, then the result is immediate. Let us assume that $x \\neq y$. Suppose that $z \\in C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$, in such a case there are some $r, s, t, w \\in[0,1]$ with $\\max \\{r, s, t, w\\}=1$ such that\n\n$$\nz=r x \\boxplus s x \\boxplus t y \\boxplus w y\n$$\n\nSuppose that $\\alpha=d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)$. Let $\\mathcal{L}(x, y)=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: x_{i} \\neq y_{i}\\right\\}$. By construction\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=\\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|: i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nTherefore, for all $i \\notin \\mathcal{L}(x, y)$, if $\\left|x_{i}\\right|>d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)$ then $x_{i}=y_{i}$. Thus, we deduce that $z_{i}=r x_{i} \\boxplus s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i} \\boxplus w y_{i}=$ $x_{i}=y_{i}$. It follows that $x_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}=y_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}=0$. Hence, we have:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, z)=\\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}\\right|: i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(y, z)=\\max \\left\\{\\left|y_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}\\right|: i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNow, notice that for all $i$\n\n$$\n\\left|z_{i}\\right|=\\left|r x_{i} \\boxplus s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i} \\boxplus w y_{i}\\right| \\leq \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|\\right\\}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ We use the convention that for all $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}, \\alpha \\boxplus \\beta \\boxplus \\gamma \\boxplus \\delta=\\digamma_{[4]}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta)$.\n\nSince, for all $i,\\left|x_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}\\right| \\leq \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|\\right\\}$ and $\\left|y_{i} \\boxminus z_{i}\\right| \\leq \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|\\right\\}$, we deduce that\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, z) \\leq \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|: i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)\\right\\}=d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(y, z) \\leq \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right|,\\left|y_{i}\\right|: i \\in \\mathcal{L}(x, y)\\right\\}=d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}(x, z), d_{\\boxplus}(z, y)\\right\\} \\leq d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)\n$$\n\nHowever, from the triangular inequality, we have\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, y) \\leq \\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}(x, z), d_{\\boxplus}(z, y)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince the converse inequality holds, this completes the proof.\nThe next result is an immediate consequence.\nProposition 2.3.5 Let $A=\\left\\{x^{(1)}, \\ldots, x^{(m)}\\right\\}$ be a finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Suppose moreover that $(i) C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)=$ $\\bigcup_{i \\in[m-1]} C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(i)}, x^{(i+1)}\\right) ;$ (ii) for all $i C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(i-1)}, x^{(i)}\\right) \\cap C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(i)}, x^{(i+1)}\\right)=\\left\\{x^{(i)}\\right\\}$. Then we have:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)=\\max _{i \\in[m-1]} d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(i)}, x^{(i+1)}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof: Since $x^{(2)} \\in C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)$, we have:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)=\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}\\right), d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(2)}, x^{(m)}\\right)\\right)\\}\n$$\n\nFrom the decomposition property established in [10], we have $C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(k)}, x^{(m)}\\right)=C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(k)}, x^{(k+1)}\\right) \\cup$ $C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(k+1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)$. It follows that for any $k \\in[m-1], x^{(k+1)} \\in C o^{\\infty}\\left(x^{(k)}, x^{(m)}\\right)$. Hence:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(k)}, x^{(m)}\\right)=\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(k)}, x^{(k+1)}\\right), d_{\\boxplus}\\left(x^{(k+1)}, x^{(m)}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nBy recurrence the proof is then immediate.\n\nProposition 2.3.6 Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. If $x=-y$, then for all $z \\in C o^{\\infty}(x, y) \\backslash\\{x, y\\}, d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=d_{\\boxplus}(x, z)=$ $d_{\\boxplus}(z, y)$.\n\nProof: Suppose that $z \\in C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$, in such a case there are some $r, s, t, w \\in[0,1]$ with $\\max \\{r, s, t, w\\}=1$ such that $z=r x \\boxplus s x \\boxplus t y \\boxplus w y$. Since $z \\notin\\{x, y\\}$ we have $\\max \\{r, s\\}=\\max \\{t, w\\}=1$, and $\\min \\{r, s\\}=$ $\\max \\{t, w\\}=1$, otherwise either $z=x$ or $z=y$. If $r=s=t=w=1$, then $z=0$ and the result is immediate. Consequently $\\max \\{r, s\\}=\\max \\{t, w\\}=1, \\min \\{r, s\\}<1$ and $\\min \\{t, w\\}<1$. Dropping the symmetric terms, it follows that\n\n$$\nz=r x \\boxplus s x \\boxplus t y \\boxplus w y=\\min \\{r, s\\} x \\boxplus \\min \\{t, w\\} y\n$$\n\nSince $\\min \\{r, s\\}<1$ and $\\min \\{t, w\\}<1$, this implies that $d_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=d_{\\boxplus}(x, z)=d_{\\boxplus}(z, y)$.",

Notice that we have for all natural numbers $p$\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=\\sum_{i \\in[n]}^{\\varphi_{p}} x_{i} y_{i} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sum_{i \\in[n]}^{\\varphi_{p}}\\left(-x_{i} z_{i}\\right) \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sum_{i \\in[n]}^{\\varphi_{p}}\\left(-y_{i} z_{i}\\right) \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sum_{i \\in[n]}^{\\varphi_{p}} z_{i}{ }^{2}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=\\digamma_{[4 n]}\\left(x_{1} y_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} y_{n},-x_{1} z_{1}, \\ldots,-x_{n} z_{n},-y_{1} z_{1}, \\ldots,-y_{n} z_{n}, z_{1}{ }^{2}, \\ldots, z_{n}{ }^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the following, we introduce the operation $\\langle\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle_{\\boxplus}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined as:\n\n$$\n\\langle\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\rangle_{\\infty}=\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}\n$$\n\nIn the following, for all $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we say that $[x, y, z]$ is $\\digamma$-right-angled in $z$ if\n\n$$\n\\langle\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\rangle_{\\infty}=0\n$$\n\nIn general, a right-angled triangle is not a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple. This is shown in the next example.\nExample 3.1.1 Let $x=(1,-2,-1), y=(2,3,-2)$ and $z=(3,2,-3)$. We have $x-z=(-2,-4,2)$ and $y-z=(-1,1,1)$. We have $\\langle x-z, y-z\\rangle=0$. Therefore $[x, y, z]$ is a right-angled triangle. However $\\digamma_{[12]}(2,-6,2,3,2,-3,-6,-6,-6,9,4,9)=9 \\neq 0$. Hence $[x, y, z]$ is not a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple.\nThe next result was established in [10]. It plays an important role in the remainder. It means that if the limit sum is zero then the $\\phi_{p}$-generalized sum is zero for any $p$.\nLemma 3.1.2 Suppose that there is some $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[n]} x_{i}=0$. Then for all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\sum_{i \\in[n]}^{\\varphi_{p}} x_{i}=0$.\n\nProposition 3.1.3 Let $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and let $[x, y, z]$ be a triple. The triple $[x, y, z]$ is $\\digamma$-right-angled in $z$ all if and only if for all $p \\in \\mathbb{N},[x, y, z]$ is $\\varphi_{p}$-right-angled in $z$, i.e. $\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=0$.\n\nProof: If $[x, y, z]$ is a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple in $z$ then:\n\n$$\n\\langle\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\rangle_{\\infty}=0\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=0\n$$\n\nfor all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and the first implication follows.\nConversely if for all $p,[x, y, z]$ is a $\\varphi_{p}$-right-angled triple in $z$, then for all $p$\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=0\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=\\langle\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\rangle_{\\infty}=0\n$$\n\nwhich proves the reciprocal.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFig. 4: $\\digamma$-right-angled triples with convex lines.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFig. 5: $\\digamma$-right-angled triples with idempotent symmetric convex lines.\n\nRemark 3.1.4 A $\\digamma$-right-angled triple is a right-angled triangle. However, the converse is not true. In Figure $4,[a, b, c]$ is right-angled but not $\\digamma$-right-angled. The triples $[d, f, e]$ and $[g, 0, h]$ are $\\digamma$-right-angled.\n\nIn Figure 5, the same triples are represented using idempotent symmetric convex lines. Clearly, the right angle is preserved only for the triples $[d, f, e]$ and $[g, 0, h]$.\n\nIn the following, for all subsets $I$ of $[n]$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, let us denote $x_{[I]}=\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{i} e_{i}$, where $\\left\\{e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{n}\\right\\}$ is the canonic basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nProposition 3.1.5 Let $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and let $[x, y, 0]$ is a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple in 0 . Then there exists a partition $\\left\\{I_{1}, \\ldots, I_{m}, J\\right\\}$ of $[n]$ with $m=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, Card $(J) \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and such that for all $k$ :\n\n$$\n\\left[x_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}, y_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}, 0_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}\\right]\n$$\n\nis a right-angled triangle in $0_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{I_{k}}$ with $\\operatorname{Card}\\left(I_{k}\\right)=2$. Moreover, if $J=\\{j\\}$ is nonempty then $x_{j} y_{j}=0$.\nProof: If $[x, y, 0]$ is a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple in 0 then:\n\n$$\n\\bigoplus_{i \\in[n]} x_{i} y_{i}=0\n$$\n\n$\\bigsqcup_{i \\in[n]} x_{i} y_{i}=0$ implies that there exists a partition $\\left\\{I_{1}, \\ldots, I_{m}, J\\right\\}$ of $[n]$ with $m=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, Card $\\left(I_{k}\\right)=2$ for all $k$ and $\\operatorname{Card}(J) \\in\\{0,1\\}$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in\\left[I_{k}\\right]} x_{i} y_{i}=\\bigoplus_{i \\in\\left[I_{k}\\right]} x_{i} y_{i}=0\n$$\n\nand $x_{j} y_{j}=0$ if $J=\\{j\\}$ is a nonempty set. Consequently\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in\\left[I_{k}\\right]} x_{i} y_{i}=0\n$$\n\nSuppose that $I_{k}=\\left\\{i^{\\prime}, i^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\}$. Then\n\n$$\nx_{i^{\\prime}} y_{i^{\\prime}} \\boxminus x_{i^{\\prime \\prime}} y_{i^{\\prime \\prime}}=0 \\Longleftrightarrow x_{i^{\\prime}} y_{i^{\\prime}}-x_{i^{\\prime \\prime}} y_{i^{\\prime \\prime}}=0\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\left\\langle x_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}, y_{\\left[I_{k}\\right]}\\right\\rangle_{p}=0$ for all $p$.\nCorollary 3.1.6 Suppose that $n=2$. If $[x, y, 0]$ is a right-angled triangle in $z$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, then $[x, y, 0]$ is $\\digamma$ -right-angled in 0 and it is $\\varphi_{p}$-right-angled in 0 for all natural numbers $p$.\n\nThe following result is an idempotent and non-associative analogue of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nProposition 3.1.7 Let $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and let $[x, y, z]$ is a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple in $z$. Then for all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ :\n\n$$\nd_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, y)=d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, z) \\stackrel{p}{+} d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(y, z)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}(x, y)=\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}(x, z), d_{\\boxplus}(y, z)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProof: If $[x, y, z]$ is a $\\digamma$-right-angled triple in $z$ then\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\langle x, y, z\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{\\infty}=0\n$$\n\nThus, for all $p,\\left\\langle x \\stackrel{p}{-} z, y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\rangle_{p}=0$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{p}(z), \\phi_{p}(y)-\\phi_{p}(z)\\right\\rangle=0\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{p}(y)\\right\\|^{2}=\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{p}(z)\\right\\|^{2}+\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(y)-\\phi_{p}(z)\\right\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nWe deduce that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\phi_{p}\\left(\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)\\right\\|^{2}=\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\|\\phi_{p}\\left(\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\phi_{p}(x)-\\phi_{p}(z)\\right)\\right)\\right\\|^{2}\\right)\\right)+\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\|\\phi_{p}\\left(\\phi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\phi_{p}(y)-\\phi_{p}(z)\\right)\\right)\\right\\|^{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThus:\n\n$$\nd_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, y)=\\left\\|x \\stackrel{p}{-} y\\right\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}=\\left\\|x \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\|_{\\varphi_{p}} \\stackrel{p}{+}\\left\\|y \\stackrel{p}{-} z\\right\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}=d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, z) \\stackrel{p}{+} d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(y, z)\n$$\n\nTaking the limit, yields:\n\n$$\nd_{\\boxplus}^{2}(x, y)=\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, y)=\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(x, z) \\stackrel{p}{+} d_{\\varphi_{p}}^{2}(y, z)=\\max \\left\\{d_{\\boxplus}^{2}(x, z), d_{\\boxplus}^{2}(y, z)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe final statement immediately follows.",

Paralleling the usual definition of a cosine, let us define the $\\varphi_{p}$-pseudo-cosine of the angle between two vectors as:\n\n$$\n\\cos _{p}(x, y)=\\frac{\\langle x, y\\rangle_{p}}{\\|x\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}\\|y\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}}\n$$\n\nTaking the limit, we define the pseudo $\\digamma$-cosine as:\n\n$$\n\\cos _{\\infty}(x, y)=\\frac{\\langle x, y\\rangle_{\\infty}}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\\|y\\|_{\\infty}}\n$$\n\nIt is now natural to define a sine function in limit. In [11] a $\\varphi_{p}$ exterior product is defined for all $v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as:\n\n$$\n\\left(v_{1} \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} v_{2} \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} \\cdots \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} v_{n}\\right)=\\left|v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right|_{p}\\left(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(v_{1} \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} v_{2} \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} \\cdots \\stackrel{p}{\\wedge} v_{n}\\right) & =\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\phi_{p}\\left(v_{1}\\right) \\wedge \\phi_{p}\\left(v_{2}\\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\phi_{p}\\left(v_{n}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left|\\phi_{p}\\left(v_{1}\\right), \\phi_{p}\\left(v_{2}\\right), \\ldots, \\phi_{p}\\left(v_{n}\\right)\\right|\\right)\\left(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_{n}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTaking the limit yields:\n\n$$\n\\left(v_{1} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} v_{2} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} \\cdots \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} v_{n}\\right)=\\left|v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right|_{\\infty}\\left(e_{1} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} e_{2} \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} \\cdots \\stackrel{\\infty}{\\wedge} e_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the case of two vectors the exterior product can be identified to the exterior product and the oriented area of the cross product can be interpreted as the positive area of the parallelogram having $x$ and $y$ as sides:\n\n$$\nx \\wedge y=|x, y|=\\|x\\|\\|y\\| \\sin (x, y)\n$$\n\nThe $\\varphi_{p}$-sine function for two vectors $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\sin _{p}(x, y)=\\frac{|x, y|_{p}}{\\|x\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}\\|y\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}}=\\frac{\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\varphi_{p}\\left(y_{2}\\right)-\\varphi_{p}\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\varphi_{p}\\left(y_{1}\\right)\\right)}{\\|x\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}\\|y\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}}\n$$\n\nAlong this line, let us define\n\n$$\n\\sin _{\\infty}(x, y)=\\frac{|x, y|_{\\infty}}{\\|x\\|_{\\infty}\\|y\\|_{\\infty}}=\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\sin _{p}(x, y)=\\frac{x_{1} y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2} y_{1}}{\\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{1}, x_{2}\\right|\\right\\} \\max \\left\\{\\left|y_{1}, y_{2}\\right|\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nLemma 3.2.1 For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we have the following properties.\n(a) $\\cos _{p}(x, y)=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)$ and $\\sin _{p}(x, y)=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)$.\n(b) $\\cos _{p}(x, y)^{2} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sin _{p}(x, y)^{2}=1$.\n(c) $\\max \\left\\{\\left|\\cos _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|,\\left|\\sin _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|\\right\\}=1$.\n\nProof: (a) The first statement is immediate. To prove the second part note that:\n\n$$\n\\sin _{p}(x, y)=\\frac{|x, y|_{p}}{\\|x\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}\\|y\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}}=\\frac{\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left|\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right|\\right)}{\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(x)\\right\\|\\right) \\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(y)\\right\\|\\right)}\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\n\\sin _{p}(x, y)=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\left|\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right|}{\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(x)\\right\\|\\left\\|\\phi_{p}(y)\\right\\|}\\right)=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n(b) We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\cos _{p}(x, y)^{2} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sin _{p}(x, y)^{2} & =\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\left[\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right)+\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\left[\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left[\\left(\\cos \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right)\\right)+\\varphi_{p}\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\left[\\sin \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\cos \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\sin \\left(\\phi_{p}(x), \\phi_{p}(y)\\right)\\right)^{2}=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(c) From (a) and (b), we have\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{\\left|\\cos _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|^{2},\\left|\\sin _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|^{2}\\right\\}=\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\cos _{p}(x, y)^{2} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\sin _{p}(x, y)^{2}=1\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{\\left|\\cos _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|,\\left|\\sin _{\\infty}(x, y)\\right|\\right\\}=1\n$$\n\nLet $C_{\\infty}(0,1]=\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: \\max \\left\\{\\left|x_{1}\\right|,\\left|x_{2}\\right|\\right\\}=1\\right\\}$ be the circle defined with respect to the $\\left\\|\\|_{\\infty}\\right.$ metric in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let us consider the points $a=(1,0), b=(1,1), c=(0,1), d=(-1,1), e=(-1,0), f=(-1,-1)$, $g=(0,-1), h=(1,-1)$. By construction:\n\n$$\nC_{\\infty}(0,1]=C_{\\mathbb{E}}(0,1]=[a, b] \\cup[b, d] \\cup[d, f] \\cup[f, h] \\cup[h, a]\n$$\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFig. 6: Pseudo Cosine.\n\nIn the following we will identify the angles of the square with the length of the segments of its circumference. Let us consider the map $\\alpha: C_{\\infty}(0,1] \\longrightarrow[0,8]$ defined by:\n\n$$\n\\alpha\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\nx_{2} & \\text { if } & x \\in[a, b] \\\\\n2-x_{1} & \\text { if } & x \\in[b, d] \\\\\n4-x_{2} & \\text { if } & x \\in[d, f] \\\\\n6+x_{1} & \\text { if } & x \\in[f, h] \\\\\n8+x_{2} & \\text { if } & x \\in[h, a]\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nClearly, we have $\\alpha(a)=0, \\alpha(b)=1, \\alpha(c)=2, \\alpha(d)=3, \\alpha(e)=4, \\alpha(f)=5, \\alpha(g)=6, \\alpha(h)=7$.\nIt is easy to prove that this map is a bijection from $C_{\\infty}(0,1]$ to $[0,8]$. Notice that 8 is the perimeter of $C_{\\infty}(0,1]$. For all $\\theta \\in[0,8]$ we define the pseudo-cosine pcos : $\\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow[-1,1]$ as a periodic function with period 8 :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{pcos}(\\theta)=\\cos _{\\infty}\\left(\\alpha^{-1}(\\theta), e_{1}\\right) \\quad \\bmod 8\n$$\n\nIt follows that for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{pcos}(\\theta+8 k)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 & \\text { if } & \\theta \\in[0,1] \\\\\n2-\\theta & \\text { if } & \\theta \\in[1,3] \\\\\n-1 & \\text { if } & \\theta \\in[3,5] \\\\\n-6+\\theta & \\text { if } & \\theta \\in[5,7] \\\\\n1 & \\text { if } & \\theta \\in[7,8]\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFig. 7: Pseudo Cosine Function\nParallel to the previous definition, for all $\\theta \\in[0,8]$, we define the pseudo-sine function $\\operatorname{psin}: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow[-1,1]$ as a periodic function with period 8 :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{psin}(\\theta)=\\sin _{\\infty}\\left(\\alpha^{-1}(\\theta), e_{1}\\right) \\quad \\bmod 8\n$$\n\nIt follows that for any integer $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{psin}(\\theta+8 k)= \\begin{cases}\\theta & \\text { if } \\quad \\theta \\in[0,1] \\\\ 1 & \\text { if } \\quad \\theta \\in[1,3] \\\\ 4-\\theta & \\text { if } \\quad \\theta \\in[3,5] \\\\ -1 & \\text { if } \\quad \\theta \\in[5,7] \\\\ 8-\\theta & \\text { if } \\quad \\theta \\in[7,8]\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nHence, for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have from Lemma 3.2.1\n\n$$\n\\max \\{|\\operatorname{pcos}(\\theta)|,|\\operatorname{psin}(\\theta)|\\}=\\max \\left\\{\\left|\\cos _{\\infty}\\left(\\alpha^{-1}(\\theta), e_{1}\\right)\\right|,\\left|\\sin _{\\infty}\\left(\\alpha^{-1}(\\theta), e_{1}\\right)\\right|\\right\\}=1\n$$",

      "text": "# 3.3 Some Formalism on the Complex Scalar Field \n\nWe can continue the previous analogies, this time using complex numbers and studying the relative properties of the unit square. Let us denote $C_{\\varphi_{p}}(0,1]=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}:\\|x\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}=1\\right\\}$. We have the relations $\\phi_{p}\\left(C_{\\varphi_{p}}(0,1]\\right)=$ $C(0,1]$. Now, let us consider the subsets of $\\mathbb{C}$ defined as $C_{\\varphi_{p}}^{\\natural}(0,1]=\\{z=a+\\mathrm{i} b \\in \\mathbb{C}:\\|(a, b)\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}=1\\}$ and $C_{\\infty}^{\\natural}(0,1]=\\{z=a+\\mathrm{i} b \\in \\mathbb{C}:\\|(a, b)\\|_{\\infty}=1\\}$. Let us consider the bijective map $\\varphi^{\\natural}: \\mathbb{C} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ defined as:\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}(a+\\mathrm{i} b)=\\varphi_{p}(a)+\\mathrm{i} \\varphi_{p}(b)\n$$\n\nIts reciprocal is the map $\\varphi^{\\natural}{ }^{1}: \\mathbb{C} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ defined as $\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}{ }^{1}(a+\\mathrm{i} b)=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}(a)+\\mathrm{i} \\varphi_{p}^{-1}(b)$. The map $\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}$ is homogeneous with respect to the real scalar field, i.e. for all $\\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}(\\rho(a+\\mathrm{i} b))=\\rho\\left(\\varphi_{p}(a)+\\mathrm{i} \\varphi_{p}(b)\\right)=$ $\\rho \\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}(a+\\mathrm{i} b)$. Therefore, for all $z=\\rho e^{\\mathrm{i} \\theta} \\in \\mathbb{C}$, with $\\rho=|z|$, we have\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}{ }^{1}(z)=\\rho\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{-1}(\\cos \\theta)+\\mathrm{i} \\varphi_{p}^{-1}(\\sin \\theta)\\right)\n$$\n\nFor all $z, w \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2}$, let us define:\n\n$$\nz^{p} w=\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}{ }^{1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}(z) \\varphi_{p}^{\\natural}(w)\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows that if $z=a+\\mathrm{i} b$ and $w=c+\\mathrm{i} d$, then:\n\n$$\nz^{p} w=\\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}(a) \\varphi_{p}(b)-\\varphi_{p}(b) \\varphi_{p}(d)\\right)+\\mathrm{i} \\varphi_{p}^{-1}\\left(\\varphi_{p}(a) \\varphi_{p}(c)+\\varphi_{p}(b) \\varphi_{p}(c)\\right)\n$$\n\nEquivalently\n\n$$\nz^{p} w=\\left(a b \\stackrel{p}{-} b d\\right)+\\mathrm{i}\\left(a d \\stackrel{p}{+} b c\\right)\n$$\n\nAlong this line, taking the limit with respect to the product topology of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we define the product:\n\n$$\nz \\boxtimes w=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow \\infty} z^{p} w=(a b \\boxminus b d)+\\mathrm{i}(a d \\boxplus b c)\n$$\n\nNote that this product is equivalent to the matrix product defined in [11] for matrices representing complex numbers. We have for all complex numbers of the form $z=a+\\mathrm{i} b$ and $w=c+\\mathrm{i} d$ :\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\na & -b \\\\\nb & a\n\\end{array}\\right) \\boxtimes\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nc & -d \\\\\nd & c\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\na c \\boxminus b d & -(a d \\boxplus b c) \\\\\na d \\boxplus b c & a c \\boxminus b d\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, for all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and all $z=a+\\mathrm{i} b \\in \\mathbb{C}$ we define the $\\varphi_{p}$-module of $z$ as $|z|_{p}=\\|(a, b)\\|_{\\varphi_{p}}$. Similarly, $|z|_{\\infty}=\\|(a, b)\\|_{\\infty}=\\max \\{|a|,|b|\\}$. In the following, we also extend the operation $\\boxplus$ to the complex numbers.

However, since $|c|=|d|=1$, this implies that $d^{2}=-c^{2}$ that is a contradiction.

      "text": "# 4 Algebraic Formulation of the Kuratowski-Peano Limit of a Line\n### 4.1 Algebraic Formulation of a Line\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate that the non-associative algebraic structure we consider allows for establishing an algebraic formulation of any limiting line passing through two points. In the standard convex case it is easy to give an algebraic formulation of a line passing trough two different points. In such a case one can define the line passing trough $x$ and $y(x \\neq y)$ as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}(x, y)=\\{t x+s y: s+t=1, s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\nNote that there is no restriction imposing the non-negativity of $s$ and $t$ which limits a line to a line-segment. Paralleling this definition one can define a $\\varphi_{p}$-line as:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)=\\left\\{t x \\stackrel{p}{+} s y: s \\stackrel{p}{+} t=1, s, t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIt was pointed out in [8] that the subset $\\{t x \\boxplus s y: \\max \\{s, t\\}=1, s, t \\geq 0\\}$ is not path-connected and does not describe, over $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the convex hull in the limit of $\\{x, y\\}$. To that end it was shown in [8] that $C o^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: \\max \\{t, r, s, w\\}=1, t, r, s, w \\geq 0\\}$. In what follows, we take a parallel approach to give the algebraic description of a line. Let us consider the following subset:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y):=\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\nLemma 4.1.1 For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x \\neq y$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\subset \\underset{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}{\\operatorname{Li}} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)\n$$\n\nProof: Suppose that $z \\in\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. By definition, there exist $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\alpha_{1} \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} \\boxplus \\beta_{1} \\boxplus \\beta_{2}=1$ and such that\n\n$$\nz=\\alpha_{1} x \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} x \\boxplus \\beta_{1} y \\boxplus \\beta_{2} y\n$$\n\nSince $\\alpha_{1} \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} \\boxplus \\beta_{1} \\boxplus \\beta_{2}=1$, there exists some $p_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $p \\geq p_{0}, \\alpha_{1} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\alpha_{2} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{1} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{2} \\neq 0$. For all $p \\geq p_{0}$, define\n\n$$\nz^{(p)}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{1} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\alpha_{2} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{1} \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{2}}\\left(\\alpha_{1} x \\stackrel{p}{+} \\alpha_{2} x \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{1} y \\stackrel{p}{+} \\beta_{2} y\\right)\n$$\n\nBy construction, for all $p \\geq p_{0}, z^{(p)} \\in \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$. Taking the limit on both sides yields:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} z^{(p)} & =\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{1} \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} \\boxplus \\beta_{1} \\boxplus \\beta_{2}}\\left(\\alpha_{1} x \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} x \\boxplus \\beta_{1} y \\boxplus \\beta_{2} y\\right) \\\\\n& =\\alpha_{1} x \\boxplus \\alpha_{2} x \\boxplus \\beta_{1} y \\boxplus \\beta_{2} y=z\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nConsequently, $z \\in \\operatorname{Li}_{p \\longrightarrow+\\infty} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$.\nLemma 4.1.2 Let $\\left\\{\\left(s^{(p)}, t^{(p)}\\right)\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be sequence of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Suppose there is an increasing subsequence $\\left\\{p_{q}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+} t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=1$ and $\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right)=(s, t)$. We have the following properties:\n(a) If $\\max \\{|s|,|t|\\}>1$ then $s=-t$.\n(b) If $s=-t$ then $|s|=|t| \\geq 1$.\n(c) If $\\min \\{|s|,|t|\\} \\leq 1$ then $\\max \\{s, t\\}=1$.\n(d) If $s \\neq-t$ then $\\max \\{s, t\\}=1$.\n\nProof: (a) In such a case if $|s|>1$ then $t=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} t_{p_{q}}=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} 1 \\stackrel{p_{q}}{ } s_{p_{q}}=-s$. The proof is symmetrical if $|t|>1$. (b) Let us prove that in such a case we have $|s| \\geq 1$ and $|t| \\geq 1$. If $|s|<1$ then $t=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} t_{p_{q}}=$ $\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} 1 \\stackrel{p_{q}}{ } s_{p_{q}}=1$, which contradicts $s=-t$. Similarly, if $|t|<1$ we have a contradiction. Therefore $|s| \\geq 1$ and $|t| \\geq 1$. (c) If $s=1$, then the conclusion is obvious. If $|s|<1$, then $t=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} t_{p_{q}}=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} 1 \\stackrel{p_{q}}{ } s_{p_{q}}=1$ and $\\max \\{s, t\\}=1$. To conclude if $s=-1$, then $t=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} t_{p_{q}}=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} 1 \\stackrel{p_{q}}{ } 1=1$, which ends the proof of (c). (d) From $(a), s \\neq-t$ implies that $\\max \\{|s|,|t|\\} \\leq 1$. Hence $\\min \\{|s|,|t|\\} \\leq 1$ and the result is then immediate from $(c)$.\n\nThe next lemma is a preliminary result to show the upper limit of the sequence $\\left\\{\\mathcal{D}^{(p)}\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is identical to $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$.\n\nLemma 4.1.3 Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x \\neq y$ and suppose that $z \\in \\mathrm{~L} s_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$. Then there exists a sequence $\\left\\{\\left(s^{(p)}, t^{(p)}\\right)\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and an increasing subsequence $\\left\\{p_{q}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of natural numbers such that $s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right) \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+}} t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=1, \\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right)=(s, t)$ and\n\n$$\nz_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}\n$$\n\nfor all $i \\in[n]$ such that $s x_{i} \\neq-t y_{i}$.\nProof: Suppose that $z \\in \\mathrm{~L} s_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$. In such a case there exists an increasing sequence of natural numbers $\\left\\{p_{k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and sequence $\\left\\{z^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with $z^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)} \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}(x, y)$ for all $k$ and $\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} z^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=z$. This implies that there exists a sequence $\\left\\{s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\nz^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)} x \\stackrel{p_{k}}{+} s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)} y\n$$\n\nwith $s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)} \\stackrel{p_{k}}{+} t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=1$ for all $k$. Let us prove that $\\left\\{\\left(s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right)\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a bounded sequence. Suppose that this is not the case and let us show a contradiction. Suppose for example that $\\left\\{s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is not bounded. An elementary calculus shows that since $t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=1 \\stackrel{p_{k}}{=} s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}$. Thus:\n\n$$\nz^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=x \\stackrel{p_{k}}{+} s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\left(y \\stackrel{p_{k}}{=} x\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} y^{p_{k}} x=y \\boxminus x$. Since $x \\neq y, y \\boxminus x \\neq 0$ and this implies that $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|z^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right\\|=\\infty$ that is a contradiction. Consequently $\\left\\{s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded. Since $s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}=1 \\stackrel{p_{k}}{-} t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}$ this also implies that $\\left\\{t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded. Therefore, we deduce that the sequence $\\left\\{\\left(s^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{k}\\right)}\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded. Consequently one can extract an increasing subsequence $\\left\\{p_{k_{m}}\\right\\}_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{m \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(s^{\\left(p_{k_{m}}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{k_{m}}\\right)}\\right)=(s, p)\n$$\n\nLet us denote $I=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=0\\right\\}$. For all $i \\notin I$, since $s x_{i} \\neq-t y_{i}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\lim _{m \\longrightarrow \\infty} s^{\\left(p_{k_{m}}\\right)} x_{i} \\stackrel{p_{k_{m}}}{+} t^{\\left(p_{k_{m}}\\right)} y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}\n$$\n\nwhich yields the result.\n\nProposition 4.1.4 For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x \\neq y$,\n\n$$\n\\underset{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}{\\operatorname{Lim}} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)=\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\nProof: To prove this result, we need to establish that $\\mathrm{L} s_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y) \\subset\\left\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=\\right.$ $1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Suppose that $z \\in \\mathrm{~L} s_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$. By hypothesis, there exists an increasing sequence of natural numbers $\\left\\{p_{q}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and sequence $\\left\\{z^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with $z^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} x \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+} s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} y \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}(x, y)$ for all $q$ such that $\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} z^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=z$. Moreover, $\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}, t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right)=(s, p)$ and\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} x_{i} \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+} t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}\n$$\n\nfor all $i$ such that $s x_{i} \\neq-t y_{i}$. Let $I=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=0\\right\\}$. We consider three cases.\n(a) $I=\\emptyset$. If $\\min \\{|s|,|t|\\}>1$ then, from Lemma 4.1.2.(a), $s=-t$. Let us consider the vector\n\n$$\ns x \\boxplus x \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y \\boxplus t y\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small. Clearly, we have $s \\boxplus 1 \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) \\boxplus t=1 \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon)=1$. Moreover, since $|s|=|t|>1$, for all $i \\in[n]$ we have $s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus x_{i} \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}$. From equation (1)\n\n$$\nz=s x \\boxplus t y=s x \\boxplus x \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y \\boxplus t y\n$$\n\nTherefore $z \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$. If $\\min \\{|s|,|t|\\} \\leq 1$ then, from Lemma 4.1.2, $\\max \\{s, t\\}=1$. Suppose that $t=1$. Then, $s x \\boxplus t y=s x \\boxplus 0 x \\boxplus y \\boxplus y$ and $s \\boxplus 0 \\boxplus 1 \\boxplus 1=1$. One can proceeds symmetrically if $s=1$.\n(b) $I \\neq \\emptyset$ and for all $i \\in I, x_{i}=y_{i}$. In such a case for all $i \\in I, z_{i}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=x_{i}=z_{i}$. For all $i \\in I$, $s x_{i}=-t y_{i}=-t x_{i}$ and this implies that $s=-t$. From Lemma Lemma 4.1.2.(b) we have $|s| \\geq 1$ and $|t| \\geq 1$. Let us consider the vector\n\n$$\ns x \\boxplus x \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y \\boxplus t y\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small. Clearly, since $s=-t$, we have $s \\boxplus 1 \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) \\boxplus t=1 \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon)=1$.\nIf $i \\in I$ then, since $s=-t$ and $x_{i}=y_{i}$, one has $s x_{i} \\boxplus x_{i} \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=x_{i} \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y_{i}=x_{i}=y_{i}=z_{i}$.\nIf $i \\notin I$ then, since $s x_{i} \\neq-t x_{i},|s| \\geq 1$ and $|t| \\geq 1$, we have $s x_{i} \\boxplus x_{i} \\boxplus(1-\\epsilon) y_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus t y_{i}=z_{i}$. We conclude that $z \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$.\n(c) $I \\neq \\emptyset$ and there is some $i_{0} \\in I$, such that $x_{i_{0}} \\neq y_{i_{0}}$. We first prove that in such a case we have $s \\neq-t$. Suppose that this is not the case. We have $s x_{i_{0}} \\boxplus t y_{i_{0}}=s x_{i_{0}} \\boxplus(-s) y_{i_{0}}=0$. However this implies $x_{i_{0}}=y_{i_{0}}$ that is a contradiction. Moreover, from Lemma 4.1.2.(c) we have $\\max \\{|s|,|t|\\}=1$ and $\\max \\{s, t\\}=1$. Assume for example that $t=1$.\n\nSuppose that $i \\in I$. We have $t y_{i}=y_{i}=-s x_{i}$ and therefore\n\n$$\ns^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} x_{i} \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+} t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} y_{i}=s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} x_{i} \\stackrel{p_{q}}{-} s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} x_{i}=\\left(s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right) \\stackrel{p_{q}}{-}} s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right) x_{i}\n$$\n\nBy hypothesis $\\lim _{k \\longrightarrow \\infty} z_{i}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=z_{i}$. Hence the sequence $\\left\\{s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right) \\stackrel{p_{q}}{-}} s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right\\}_{q \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ has a limit. Let us denote\n\n$$\ns^{\\prime}=\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right) \\stackrel{p_{q}}{-}} s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\n$$\n\nBy hypothesis we have $z_{i}=s^{\\prime} x_{i}$. Note that, since\n\n$$\n\\left|s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right) \\stackrel{p_{q}}{-}} s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right| \\leq\\left|s^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right| \\stackrel{p_{q}}{+}\\left|s t^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right|\n$$\n\nwe have taking the limit $\\left|s^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq \\max \\{|s|, t|s|\\} \\leq|s|$. We consider two cases.\n(i) Suppose that $s^{\\prime} \\neq-s$. Let us consider the vector\n\n$$\ns x \\boxplus s^{\\prime} x \\boxplus 0 y \\boxplus y\n$$\n\nIf $i \\in I$ then, since $s x_{i}=-y_{i}$, we have $w_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus s^{\\prime} x_{i} \\boxplus 0 y_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=s^{\\prime} x_{i}=z_{i}$.\nIf $i \\notin I$, then since $s \\neq-s^{\\prime}$, we have either $s=s^{\\prime}$ or $\\left|s^{\\prime}\\right|<|s|$. Hence, $s x_{i} \\boxplus s^{\\prime} x_{i} \\boxplus 0 y_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=z_{i}$. It follows that $z=s x \\boxplus s^{\\prime} x \\boxplus 0 y \\boxplus y$. Moreover, since $-s \\neq t=1$ and $\\left|s^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq|s|$, we have $s \\boxplus s^{\\prime} \\boxplus 0 \\boxplus 1=1$. Hence $z \\in \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$.\n(ii) Suppose now that $s^{\\prime}=-s$. Let us consider the vector\n\n$$\ns x \\boxplus 0 x \\boxplus y \\boxplus y\n$$\n\nIf $i \\in I$ then, since $s x_{i}=-y_{i}$, we have $s x_{i} \\boxplus 0 x_{i} \\boxplus y_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=y_{i}$. However since $y_{i}=-s x_{i}$, we deduce that $y_{i}=s^{\\prime} x_{i}=z_{i}$.\n\nIf $i \\notin I$ then, $s x_{i} \\neq-y_{i}$. Thus, we have $s x_{i} \\boxplus 0 x_{i} \\boxplus y_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=s x_{i} \\boxplus y_{i}=z_{i}$. Hence, we conclude that $z=s x \\boxplus 0 x \\boxplus y \\boxplus y$. Moreover, since $\\max \\{|s|,|t|\\}=1, s \\boxplus 0 \\boxplus 1 \\boxplus 1=1$.\n\nConsequently, we have shown that $z \\in\\left\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$. If $s=1$ the proof is symmetrical.

Then, there exists a sequence $\\left\\{\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right)\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that for all $p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y) \\times \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$ and $\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right)=(u, v)$. Let $\\mathcal{I}(u, v)=$ $\\left\\{i \\in[n]: u_{i} v_{i}<0\\right\\}$. Since $\\lim _{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right)=(u, v)$, there is some $p_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $p \\geq p_{0}$, $\\mathcal{I}(u, v)=\\mathcal{I}\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right)$. For all $i \\in \\mathcal{I}(u, v)$ and all $p \\geq p_{0}$, there is a unique point $\\gamma_{i}^{(p)} \\in C o^{p}(x, y)$ such that $\\left\\{\\gamma_{i}^{(p)}\\right\\}=H_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)$ where, for all $i \\in[n], H_{i}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: x_{i}=0\\right\\}$. For all $i \\in \\mathcal{I}(u, v)$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ls}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(H_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)\\right) \\subset H_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\nthat is a nonempty subset of $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$. Let $\\gamma_{i} \\in \\operatorname{Ls}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty}\\left(H_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{D}^{(p)}(x, y)\\right)$. This implies that there is an increasing sequence $\\left\\{p_{q}\\right\\}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} \\gamma_{i}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}=\\gamma_{i} \\in H_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\nLet us denote $n(u, v)=\\operatorname{Card} \\mathcal{I}(u, v)$. For all $p \\geq p_{0}$ one can find a sequence $\\left\\{i_{k}\\right\\}_{k \\in[n(u, v)-1]}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i_{k}}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} \\cdot \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p_{q}}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}^{\\left(p_{q}\\right)}\\right)=C o^{\\infty}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{La}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p}\\left(u^{(p)}, v^{(p)}\\right) & =\\bigcup_{k \\in[u(u, v)-1]} \\operatorname{La}_{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p_{q}}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}^{(p_{q})}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}^{(p_{q})}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\bigcup_{k \\in[u(u, v)-1]} \\operatorname{Lim}_{q \\longrightarrow \\infty} C o^{p_{q}}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}^{(p_{q})}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}^{(p_{q})}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\bigcup_{k \\in[u(u, v)-1]} C o^{\\infty}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, since any set $C o^{\\infty}\\left(\\gamma_{i_{k}}, \\gamma_{i_{k+1}}\\right)$ is path-connected, it follows that there exists a continuous map $\\psi$ : $[0,1] \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ such that $\\psi(0)=u$ and $\\psi(1)=v$.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFig. 9: $\\digamma$-line spanned from $x$ and $y$.\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nFig. 10: 3-dimensional $\\digamma$-line.\nFigure 10 depicts the case of a 3 -dimensional $\\digamma$-line passing trough $x$ and $y$. For $i=1,2,3, \\gamma_{i}$ is the intersection between the $\\digamma$-line and the 2-dimensions plane with equation $x_{i}=0$.\n\nCorollary 4.1.7 For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x \\neq y$,\n\n$$\nC o^{\\infty}(x, y) \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\nProof: From $[8]$\n\n$$\nC o^{\\infty}(x, y):=\\left\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe result is then immediate, since $C o^{\\infty}(x, y)$ is the set of all the $\\mathbb{B}$-convex combinations such that $t, r, s, w \\geq$ 0 .\n\nCorollary 4.1.7 does not imply that $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$ is idempotent symmetric convex. In general, this is not true. This can be seen in Figure 10, where $x \\boxminus y$ and $y \\boxminus x$ belong to $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$. However, $(x \\boxminus y) \\boxplus(y \\boxminus x)=0 \\notin \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$.\n\nProposition 4.1.8 Let $Y$ be an idempotent symmetric subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then, for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $x \\neq y$ we have $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\subset Y$.\n\nProof: We have shown that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\nFrom Proposition 2.1.14 the result is then immediate.\nNotice that since $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boxplus, \\cdot\\right)$ and $\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}^{n}, \\widetilde{\\boxplus}, \\otimes\\right)$ are isomorphic one can deduce the algebraic form of a line passing trough $z$ and $u$. The multiplicative neutral element of $\\cdot$ is replaced with $0=1_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}}$ and we have\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\infty}(z, u)=\\left\\{t z \\boxplus r z \\boxplus s u \\boxplus w u: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=0, t, r, s, w \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{M}}\\right\\}\n$$",

We have the following inclusions:\n(a) If $J=\\emptyset$ then\n\n$$\n\\{t(y \\boxminus x): t \\in[1, \\infty[\\} \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\{t(x \\boxminus y): t \\in[1, \\infty[\\} \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\n(b) If $J \\neq \\emptyset$ then\n\n$$\nx_{[J]}+\\{t(y \\boxminus x): t \\in[1, \\infty[\\} \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x_{[J]}+\\{t(x \\boxminus y): t \\in[1, \\infty[\\} \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{[J]}=\\sum_{k \\in J} x_{k} e_{k}=\\sum_{k \\in J} y_{k} e_{k}=y_{[J]}$.\nProof: (a) We first note that since $J=\\emptyset$ and $I=[n]$\n\n$$\nx \\boxminus y=x \\boxplus x \\boxplus 0 y \\boxplus(-y) \\in\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\nFor all $t \\geq 1$, let us consider the vector\n\n$$\nz=t x \\boxplus(-t) y\n$$\n\nSince $t \\geq 1$, we have\n\n$$\nz=t x \\boxplus x \\boxplus 0 y \\boxplus(-t) y\n$$\n\nMoreover $t \\boxplus 1 \\boxplus 0 \\boxplus(-t)=1$. Clearly $z \\in\\{t x \\boxplus r x \\boxplus s y \\boxplus w y: t \\boxplus r \\boxplus s \\boxplus w=1, t, r, s, w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, which proves the first part of (a). The proof of the second part is symmetrical swapping $x$ and $y$. (b) Let us denote $\\mathbb{R}_{[I]}=\\left\\{\\sum_{k \\in I} x_{k} e_{k}: x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}$. By hypothesis $x, y \\in x_{[J]}+\\mathbb{R}_{[I]}$. Hence $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\subset x_{[J]}+\\mathbb{R}_{[I]}$. Let $n_{I}=\\operatorname{Card}(I)$ and let $\\mathcal{D}_{[I]}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ be the canonical decomposition of $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ over $\\mathbb{R}_{[I]}$. By definition for all $i \\in I$ we have $x_{i} \\neq y_{i}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}_{[I]}$ is isomorphic to its restriction projection onto $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{I}}$ we deduce from (a) that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{t\\left(x_{[I]} \\boxminus y_{[I]}\\right): t \\in[1, \\infty[\\} \\subset \\mathcal{D}_{[I]}^{\\infty}(x, y)\\right.\n$$\n\nHowever $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=x_{[J]}+\\mathcal{D}_{[I]}^{\\infty}(x, y)$. Moreover $x_{[J]} \\boxminus y_{[J]}=0$. Hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{[J]}+\\{t(x \\boxminus y): t \\in[1, \\infty[ \\} & =x_{[J]}+\\left\\{t\\left(x_{[I]} \\boxminus y_{[I]}\\right): t \\in[1, \\infty[ \\}\\right. \\\\\n& \\subset x_{[J]}+\\mathcal{D}_{[I]}^{\\infty}(x, y) \\\\\n& \\subset \\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe proof of the second part of the statement is symmetrical.\nNotice that Proposition 4.2.1.(b) can be deduced from Proposition 4.2.1.(a) by considering the canonical isomorphism $\\psi_{I}$ defined from the set $\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: z_{j}=0, j \\notin I\\right\\}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ where $m=\\operatorname{Card}(I)$.\n![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)\n\nFig. 11: Inclusion of half-lines.\nLet $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The half lines $\\mathcal{D}_{+}(x, y)=\\{t(x \\boxminus y): t \\in[1, \\infty[ \\}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{-}(x, y)=\\{t(y \\boxminus x): t \\in[1, \\infty[ \\}$ are respectively called the upper and lower half-lines components of the $I$-line $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$.\n\nExample 4.2.2 Let us consider the case proposed in 4.1.5 with $x=(3,-2,1)$ and $y=(1,-1,1)$. In such a case $I=\\{1,2\\}$ and $J=\\{3\\}$. We have:\n\n$$\nx \\boxminus y=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n3 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\boxminus\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\\n-1 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n3 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx_{\\{3\\}}=y_{\\{3\\}}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\nD^{\\infty}(x, y) \\supset\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left\\{t\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n3 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n3 t \\\\\n-2 t \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right): t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}=\\mathcal{D}_{+}(x, y)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nD^{\\infty}(x, y) \\supset\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left\\{t\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n-3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n-3 t \\\\\n2 t \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right): t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}=\\mathcal{D}_{-}(x, y)\n$$",

Let $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ and $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}(u, v)$ be two $\\digamma$-lines respectively spanned from $x$ and $y$ and $u$ and $v$. We say that $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}(u, v)$ and $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ are $\\digamma$ parallel if $x \\boxminus y \\propto u \\boxminus v$. Equivalently, this means that $x \\boxminus y$ and $u \\boxminus v$ are collinear, that is there is some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ such that $(x \\boxminus y)=\\alpha(u \\boxminus v)$. From Proposition 4.2.1, there exist two half lines components $\\mathcal{E}_{-}(u, v)$ and $\\mathcal{E}_{+}(u, v)$ of $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}(u, v)$ and two half lines components $\\mathcal{D}_{-}(x, y)$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{+}(x, y)$ of $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)$ such that $\\mathcal{E}_{+}(u, v) \\supset(\\subset) \\mathcal{D}_{+}(x, y)$ and $\\mathcal{E}_{-}(u, v) \\supset(\\subset) \\mathcal{D}_{-}(x, y)$.\n![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)\n\nFig. 12: Parallel $\\digamma$-lines.\nFigure 12 depicts the case of two parallel lines. In Figure 13, we consider the case of two secant lines.\n![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)\n\nFig. 13: Secant $\\digamma$-lines.\nTraditional axioms of planar Euclidean geometry postulate that: $\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ a straight line may be drawn between any two points; $\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely; $\\left(a_{3}\\right)$ a circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any given radius, $\\left(a_{4}\\right)$ all right angles are equal; $(v)$ for any given point not on a given line, there is exactly one line through the point that does not meet the given line.\n\nIt is well known that the fifth axiom does not follow from the first four. Clearly, the geometric implications of the algebraic structure proposed in this paper do not conflict with the first 4 axioms. Not surprisingly, this is not the case for the fifth. In particular:\n(i) two distinct parallel lines may have an infinity of common points (Figure 12);\n(ii) there may exist an infinity of $\\digamma$-lines passing by two distinct points $x$ and $y$ (Figure 12);\n(iii) two secant lines may have an infinity of common points (Figure 13);\n(iv) a $\\digamma$-line may not be spanned by two distinct points it contains (Figure 13).\n\nIn the following a system of inequations characterizing a $\\digamma$-line that passes from two distinct points is provided. This we do by considering the suitable notion of determinant introduced in [10]. The next intermediary result establishes an algebraic description of the limit of a sequence of $\\varphi_{p}$-hyperplanes. The next result was established in [11].\n\nProposition 4.3.1 Let $V$ be the $n \\times n$ matrix with $v_{i}$ as $i$-th column for each $i$. Let $V_{(i)}$ be the matrix obtained from $V$ by replacing line $i$ with the transpose of the unit vector $\\mathbb{1}_{n}$. Suppose that $|V|_{\\infty} \\neq 0$. Let $\\left\\{H_{p}(V)\\right\\}_{p \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be the sequence of $\\varphi_{p}$-hyperplanes passing trough each point $v_{i}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Lim}_{p \\longrightarrow \\infty} H_{p}(V)=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: \\underset{i \\in[n]}{\\sim}\\left|V_{(i)}\\right|_{\\infty} x_{i} \\leq|V|_{\\infty} \\leq \\underset{i \\in[n]}{\\sim}\\left|V_{(i)}\\right|_{\\infty} x_{i}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nGiven two distinct points $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, any point $z \\in \\mathcal{D}(x, y)$ satisfies the relation:\n\n$$\n|z-x, z-y|=\\left|\\begin{array}{ll}\nz_{1}-x_{1} & z_{1}-y_{1} \\\\\nz_{2}-x_{2} & z_{2}-y_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right|=0\n$$\n\nEquivalently, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{2}-y_{2}\\right) z_{1}+\\left(y_{1}-x_{1}\\right) z_{2}=|x, y|\n$$\n\nThe following proposition establishes an analogous result in the case of the $\\digamma$-line $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$. This algebraic characterization is an immediate consequence of Proposition 4.3.1 (see [11]). Let $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $x \\neq y$. Then:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq|x, y|_{\\infty} \\leq\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn the following, we show that the equations of two parallel lines in the plane obey algebraic rules analogous to those of the linear case.\n\nLemma 4.3.2 Let $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$ and $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}$ be two parallel $\\digamma$-lines of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Then there exists $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\langle a, z\\rangle_{\\infty}^{-} \\leq c \\leq\\langle a, z\\rangle_{\\infty}^{+} \\leq c\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\langle a, z\\rangle_{\\infty}^{-} \\leq d \\leq\\langle a, z\\rangle_{\\infty}^{+} \\leq c\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProof: Suppose now that $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$ and $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}$ are two $\\digamma$-line respectively spanned from $x, y$ and $u, v$, where $x, y, u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. By definition we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(u_{2} \\boxminus v_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(v_{1} \\boxminus u_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq|u, v|_{\\infty} \\leq\\left(u_{2} \\boxminus v_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(v_{1} \\boxminus u_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}$ and $\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}$ are parallel then $(u \\boxminus v) \\propto(x \\boxminus y)$. Therefore, there is a real number $\\alpha \\neq 0$ such that $(u \\boxminus v)=\\alpha(x \\boxminus y)$. Hence:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: \\alpha\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown \\alpha\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq|u, v|_{\\infty} \\leq \\alpha\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow \\alpha\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSuppose that $\\alpha>0$, then:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq \\alpha^{-1}|u, v|_{\\infty} \\leq\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe deduce the result taking $a=x \\boxminus y, c=|x, y|_{\\infty}$, and $d=\\alpha^{-1}|u, v|_{\\infty}$. If $\\alpha<0$, then:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\geq \\alpha^{-1}|u, v|_{\\infty} \\geq\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince $\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right)=-\\left(\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right)\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{2} \\boxminus y_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(y_{1} \\boxminus x_{1}\\right)=-\\left(\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\right.$ $\\left.\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right)\\right)$ we deduce that:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\frown\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq|\\alpha|^{-1}|u, v|_{\\infty} \\leq\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\uparrow\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNow note that, since $\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(y, x)$, we also have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup}\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right) z_{2} \\leq|y, x|_{\\infty} \\leq\\left(y_{2} \\boxminus x_{2}\\right) z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup}\\left(x_{1} \\boxminus y_{1}\\right) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHence, taking $a=y \\boxminus x, c=|y, x|_{\\infty}$ and $d=|\\alpha|^{-1}|u, v|_{\\infty}$ yields the result.\n\nExample 4.3.3 Suppose that $x=(3,1), y=(1,-2), u=(-2,4)$ and $v=(-6,1)$. We have:\n\n$$\nx \\boxminus y=\\binom{3 \\boxminus 1}{1 \\boxplus(-2)}=\\binom{3}{2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad u \\boxminus v=\\binom{-2 \\boxplus(-6)}{4 \\boxminus 1}=\\binom{6}{4}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $u \\boxminus v=2(x \\boxplus y)$. Moreover,\n\n$$\n|x, y|_{\\infty}=3 \\cdot(-2) \\boxminus 1 \\cdot 1=-6 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad|u, v|_{\\infty}=(-2) \\cdot 1 \\boxplus(-6) \\cdot 4=24\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:\\left(1 \\boxplus(-2)\\right) z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup}(1 \\boxminus 3) z_{2} \\leq-6 \\leq\\left(1 \\boxplus(-2)\\right) z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup}(1 \\boxminus 3) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHence:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(x, y)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: 2 z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup}(-3) z_{2} \\leq-6 \\leq 2 z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup}(-3) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn addition we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(u, v)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:(4 \\boxplus(-1)) z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup}((-6) \\boxplus(-2)) z_{2} \\leq-6 \\leq(4 \\boxplus(-1)) z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup}((-6) \\boxplus(-2)) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHence:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(u, v)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}:(-4) z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup} 6 z_{2} \\leq 24 \\leq(-4) z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup} 6 z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nEquivalently, by changing the sign and simplifying by 2:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\infty}(u, v)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: 2 z_{1} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\rightharpoonup}(-3) z_{2} \\leq-12 \\leq 2 z_{1} \\stackrel{+}{\\rightharpoonup}(-3) z_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe can notice that the coefficients multiplying $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are the same the difference relating only to the constant term.",

  "abstract": "This article analyzes the geometric properties of an idempotent,\nnon-associative algebraic structure that extends the Max-Times semiring. This\nalgebraic structure is useful for studying systems of Max-Times and Max-Plus\nequations, employing an appropriate notion of a non-associative determinant. We\nconsider a connected ultrametric distance and demonstrate that it implies,\namong other properties, an analogue of the Pythagorean relation. To this end,\nwe introduce a suitable notion of a right angle between two vectors and\ninvestigate a trigonometric concept associated with the Chebyshev unit ball.\nFollowing this approach, we explore the potential implications of these\nproperties in the complex plane.\n  We provide an algebraic definition of a line passing through two points,\nwhich corresponds to the Painlev\\'e-Peano-Kuratowski limit of a sequence of\ngeneralized lines. We establish that this definition leads to distinctive\ngeometric properties; in particular, two distinct parallel lines may share an\ninfinite number of points.",
