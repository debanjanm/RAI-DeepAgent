{"title": "Graph Homomorphism, Monotone Classes and Bounded Pathwidth", "sections": [{"section_id": 0, "text": "#### Abstract\n\nIn recent work by Johnson et al. (2022), a framework was described for the study of graph problems over classes specified by omitting each of a finite set of graphs as subgraphs. If a problem falls into the framework then its computational complexity can be described for all such graph classes, giving a dichotomy between those classes for which the problem is hard and those for which it is easy. Usually, hard is NPcomplete and easy is in P , though some examples are given where hard is quadratic and easy is almost linear. In this article, we consider several variants of the homomorphism problem in relation to this framework. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_{5}$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework, with hard cases NP-complete and easy cases in P. We go on to consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem, namely the locally bijective, surjective and injective variants. Like $C_{5}$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, where a bounded-degree restrictions are considered, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework, with hard cases NP-complete and easy cases in P. Next, we give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. This comes from a list colouring game, realised through first-order logic as quantified constraints. We show that with the additional restriction of bounded alternation, the problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\\Pi_{2 k}^{\\mathrm{P}}$-complete and the easy cases are in P . Finally, we go on to consider an aforementioned problem from our framework, complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, under the omission in the input of not just a graph, but rather a graph $H$ annotated with the types for each vertex: existential or universal. This natural formulation gives finer control over the structure that we forbid in the input sentences, which we realise through the annotated graphs. We address especially the case where $|V(H)|$ has size 3.\n\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * An extended abstract of this article appeared at the 20th Conference on Computability in Europe (CiE 2024) [12].\n\nKeywords: Monotone Classes $\\cdot$ Sequential Colouring Construction Game - Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem - Vertex Separation Number - Pathwidth $\\cdot$ Treedepth.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nLet $G$ and $H$ be two graphs. If $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions only, then $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G$; else $G$ is $H$-free. The induced subgraph relation has been well studied in the literature for many classical graph problems, such as Colouring [24], Feedback Vertex Set [28], Independent Set [19], and so on.\n\nHere we focus on the subgraph relation. A graph $G$ is said to contain a graph $H$ as a subgraph if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge deletions; else $G$ is said to be $H$-subgraph-free. For a set of graphs $\\mathcal{H}$, a graph $G$ is $\\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free if $G$ is $H$-subgraph-free for every $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$; we also write that $G$ is $\\left(H_{1}, \\ldots, H_{p}\\right)$-subgraph-free, if $\\mathcal{H}=\\left\\{H_{1}, \\ldots, H_{p}\\right\\}$. Graph classes closed under edge deletion are also called monotone [16]. Monotone classes that are specified by a finite set of omitted subgraphs are called finitely-bounded.\n\nWhen compared to those for $H$-free graphs there are relatively few complexity classifications for $H$-subgraph-free graphs. Despite this; see [2] for complexity classifications of Independent Set, Dominating Set and Longest Path; and $[16,22]$ for classifications of List Colouring and Max Cut, respectively. All of these classifications hold even for $\\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free graphs, where $\\mathcal{H}$ is any finite set of graphs. In general, such classifications might be hard to obtain; see, for example, [17] for a partial classification of Colouring for $H$-subgraph-free graphs.\n\nTherefore, in [21] a more systematic approach was followed, namely by introducing a new framework for $\\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free graph classes (finite $\\mathcal{H}$ ) adapting the approach of [22]. To explain the framework of [21] we need to introduce some additional terminology. Treewidth and pathwdith are two widly studied width parameters broadly capturing likeness to a tree or path respectivly. A class of graphs has bounded treewidth or pathwdith if there exists a constant $c$ such that every graph in it has treewidth or pathwidth, respectively, at most $c$. Now let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph. Then $G$ is subcubic if every vertex of $G$ has degree at most 3 . The subdivision of an edge $e=u v$ of $G$ replaces $e$ by a new vertex $w$ with edges $u w$ and $w v$. For an integer $k \\geq 1$, the $k$-subdivision of $G$ is the graph $G^{k}$ obtained from $G$ by subdividing each edge of $G$ exactly $k$ times. For a class of graphs $\\mathcal{G}$ and an integer $k, \\mathcal{G}^{k}$ consists of the $k$-subdivisions of the graphs in $\\mathcal{G}$.\n\nWe say that a graph problem $\\Pi$ is computationally hard under edge subdivision of subcubic graphs if for every integer $j \\geq 1$ there is an integer $\\ell \\geq j$ such that: if $\\Pi$ is computationally hard for the class $\\mathcal{G}$ of subcubic graphs, then $\\Pi$ is computationally hard for $\\mathcal{G}^{\\ell}$. The framework of [21] makes a distinction between \"efficiently solvable\" and \"computationally hard\", which could for example mean a distinction between P and NP-complete.\n\nCommonly, we can prove the condition holds by showing that computational hardness is maintained under $k$-subdivision for a small integer $k$ (e.g. $k=$\n\n$1,2,3,4)$ and then repeatedly apply the $k$-subdivision operation. We can therefore say a graph problem $\\Pi$ is a C123-problem (belongs to the framework) if it satisfies the three conditions:\n\nC1. $\\Pi$ is efficiently solvable for every graph class of bounded pathwidth ${ }^{3}$;\nC2. $\\Pi$ is computationally hard for the class of subcubic graphs; and\nC3. $\\Pi$ is computationally hard under edge subdivision of subcubic graphs.\nTo describe the impact of these conditions, we need some notation. The claw is the 4 -vertex star. A subdivided claw is a graph obtained from a claw after subdividing each of its edges zero or more times. The disjoint union of two vertex-disjoint graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ has vertex set $V\\left(G_{1}\\right) \\cup V\\left(G_{2}\\right)$ and edge set $E\\left(G_{1}\\right) \\cup E\\left(G_{2}\\right)$. The set $\\mathcal{S}$ consists of the graphs that are disjoint unions of subdivided claws and paths. As shown in [21], C123-problems allow for full complexity classifications for $\\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free graphs (as long as $\\mathcal{H}$ has finite size).\n\nTheorem 1 ([21]). Let $\\Pi$ be a C123-problem. For a finite set $\\mathcal{H}$, the problem $\\Pi$ on $\\mathcal{H}$-subgraph-free graphs is efficiently solvable if $\\mathcal{H}$ contains a graph from $\\mathcal{S}$ and computationally hard otherwise.\n\nExamples of C123-problems include Independent Set, Dominating Set, List Colouring, Odd Cycle Transversal, Max Cut, Steiner Tree and VerTEX Cover; see [21]. However, there are still many graph problems that are not C123-problems, such as Colouring (whose classification is still open even for $H$-subgraph-free graphs). Hence, it is a natural question if those problems can still be classified for graph classes defined by some set of forbidden subgraphs.\n\nThis paper considers the Graph Homomorphism problem alongside two variants: a graph colouring game, and locally constrained homomorphism problems. Here, we will define the first of these, while details of the latter two will be addressed in greater detail in their respective sections.\n\nThe problem $H$-Colouring takes an input graph $G$ and asks whether there is a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ i.e a function $h: V(G) \\rightarrow V(H)$ such that $x y \\in E(G)$ then $h(x) h(y) \\in E(H)$. If there is, we write $G \\rightarrow H$. The more general problem Graph Homomorphism takes both $G$ and $H$ as input, with the same question, whether $G \\rightarrow H$. In general, $H$-Colouring is not a C123problem, for example, $C_{5}$-Colouring does not satisfy C 3 (as it satisfies C 1 and C2, we label it a C12-problem). The topic of such C12-problems is elaborated in [26]. By contrast, we show that Graph Homomorphism is a C123-problem (where C3 is applied uniformly to both $G$ and $H$ ). Grohe has argued in [18] that, assuming $\\mathrm{FPT} \\neq \\mathrm{W}[1]$ (an assumption widely believed in Parameterized Complexity), Graph Homomorphism is in P on a restricted class of graphs if, and only if that class has bounded treewidth. Bearing in mind the interchangeability of treewidth and pathwidth in our framework, we are improving \"not in P\" to \"NP-complete\" for finitely-bounded monotone classes.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ In the original framework paper [21], pathwidth and treewidth are interchangeable in this position.\n\nWe continue by considering locally constrained variants of the Graph HoMOMORPHISM problem. These problems, Locally Birective Homomorphism, Locally Surjective Homomorphism and Locally Injective Homomorphism, denoted LBHom, LSHom and LIHom respectively, have all been intensively studied in the literature [13]. When either $G$ or $H$ has bounded (vertex) degree, we prove that each of these three problems is a C123-problem, just like Graph Homomorphism, with a dichotomy between P and NP-complete on finitely-bounded monotone classes. Whereas without such a degree bound they are C23-problems, i.e satisfy only C2 and C3 and are elaborated further in [5].\n\nThe graph colouring game we consider is a variant of that proposed by Bodlaender in [4], SeQuential Colouring Construction Game. Here two players alternate in colouring vertices of a graph with one of $k$ colours, with the first player winning when a proper colouring is obtained. In particular, fixing $k=3$, this problem closely relates to the quantified constraint satisfaction problem $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$. Both of these problems are PSPACE-complete 47.\n\nBodlaender proves that SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction Game is in P on any class of bounded vertex separation number. It is well-known that classes of bounded vertex separation number and classes of bounded pathwidth coincide [23]. However here the vertex separation number is with respect to the order in which the vertices are played. A na\u00efve reading of [4] risks a fundamental misinterpretation, as we prove that SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction Game is PSPACE-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth. We do this by mediating through the closely related problem $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ using a celebrated result of Atserias and Oliva [3]. In that paper, they prove that Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) is PSPACE-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth, even when the input is restricted to conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n\nWithin the framework, just as List Colouring was considered, we can extend our attention to a list colouring game. Adjoining some unary relations to $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$, is analogous to moving from 3 -Colouring to List 3 -Colouring. Using only two of these lists we arrive at the problem $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$. Owing to the aforementioned hardness for bounded pathwidth, and unlike List Colouring, $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is not a C123-problem, but is a C23-problem.\n\nHowever, considering the bounded alternation restriction of this, we prove that $\\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is a C123-problem, for which the hard cases are $\\Pi_{2 k}^{P}$-complete while the easy cases are in P .\n\nThe significance of our work lies in its uncovering the field of homomorphism problems and their variants as rich ground for finding framework problems, notwithstanding that is was known that $H$-colouring problems are not in the framework in general. Indeed, we go on to consider the problem $\\Pi_{2^{-}}$ $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ under restrictions that concern omitting as a subgraph not just a graph but rather a graph in which all the vertices are labelled either universal or existential. We argue that this allows for finer classifications, and we classify the complexity for all such labelled graphs of size at most 3 , while proving also some general results.\n\nWe conclude by considering our framework in relation to bounded pathwidth, which coincides (on finitely-bounded monotone classes) with essentially omitting some subdivided claw as a subgraph [29]. If we instead omit some path, we essentially get the graphs of bounded treedepth [27]. For LBHom, LSHom and LIHom, there exists some bounded treedepth class on which they are NPcomplete [8]. We will describe a C23-problem, namely Long Edge Disjoint Paths that is easy on graphs of bounded treedepth but hard on certain classes of bounded pathwidth. Within previous work on C23-problems an example with this behaviour has not yet been discussed. The complexity of QBF on bounded treedepth is a famous open problem (see e.g. [14], where it is proved to be in P under some further restrictions). The complexity of $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ on bounded treedepth may be similarly elusive to classify, and it is on this note that we conclude.\n\nThis paper is organised as follows. After the preliminaries, we address graph homomorphism in Section 3 and locally constrained graph homomorphism in Section 4. We then consider sequential colouring games in Section 5 and QCSPs in Section 6. We then go on to consider bounded pathwidth in Section 8 and labelled graphs in Section 7. We conclude with some final remarks and open question in Section 9. We sum up our results in Figure 1\n\nThis paper is a considerable extension of [12]. The proofs have been elaborated and Figure 1 has been added. The whole of Section 7 is new.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nFig. 1.

Each node of $T$ corresponds to a single bag of $X$. For each vertex $v \\in V$ the nodes of $T$ containing $v$ must induce a non-empty connected subgraph of $T$ and for each edge $u v \\in E$, there must be at least one bag containing both $u$ and $v$. Similarly, we can define a path decomposition where $T$ must instead be a path. We can then define the\n\nwidth of $(T, X)$ to be one less than the size of the largest bag. From this, the treewidth of a graph, $t w(G)$, is the minimum width of any tree decomposition and the pathwidth $p w(G)$, is the minimum width of any path decomposition. As every path decomposition is also a tree decomposition $t w(G) \\leq p w(G)$.\n\nIn the following, $G$ and $H$ are graphs, and $f$ is a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, that is, $f(u) f(v)$ is an edge in $H$ whenever $u v$ is an edge in $G$. We denote the (open) neighbours of a vertex $u$ in $G$ by $N_{G}(u)=\\{v \\mid u v \\in E(G)\\}$. We say that $f$ is locally injective, locally bijective or locally surjective for a vertex $u \\in V(G)$ if the restriction $f_{u}: N_{G}(u) \\rightarrow N_{H}(f(u))$ of $f$ is injective, bijective or surjective, respectively. Now, $f$ is said to be locally injective, locally bijective or locally surjective if $f$ is locally injective, locally bijective or locally surjective for every $u \\in V(G)$. If $X$ is some subset of vertices $X \\subseteq V(G)$, then $G[X]$ is the subgraph of $G$ induced by $X$. We define the closed neighbourhood $N[X]$ to be $\\{v \\mid v \\in X \\vee(\\exists u \\in X \\wedge u v \\in E(G))\\}$.\n\n$\\operatorname{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B})$, is defined for some relational structure $\\mathcal{B}$ which for us will always be a graph.

The primal graph of a formula $\\Phi$ contains a vertex for each $x_{i} \\in \\Phi$ and an edge if and only if the two variables occur together in a constraint. Let $\\Pi_{2 k}$ - $\\operatorname{QCSP}(\\mathcal{B})$ be the restriction of this problem to sentences in $\\Pi_{2 k}$-form, i.e. with quantifier prefix leading with universal quantifiers, alternating $2 k-1$ times, concluding with existential quantifiers.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Graph Homomorphism \n\nIn this section we will prove that Graph Homomorphism is a C123-problem.\nGraph Homomorphism\nInstance: A graph $G$ and a graph $H$\nQuestion: Is there a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ ?\n\nLet us recall that we apply C1, C2 and C3 to both graphs. In particular, the subdivision of C3 uniformly applies to both inputs $G$ and $H$. For a graph $G$, recall that $G^{r}$ is $G$ with each edge replaced by a path of length $r+1$ (an $r$-subdivision). For example, $K_{3}{ }^{5}=C_{15}$.\n\nLemma 1 ([11]). Graph Homomorphism satisfies C1.\nLemma 2 ([15]). Graph Homomorphism satisfies C2.\nLet us recall that we apply the subdivision of C3 uniformly to both inputs $G$ and $H$.\n\nLemma 3. Graph Homomorphism satisfies the variant of C3 that does not restrict to subcubic.\n\nProof. Let $r \\geq 1$ be fixed. Let $G$ be connected and have the additional property that every edge is in a triangle. It is clear that this subset remains NP-complete, since one can enforce it by adding a new triangle at each edge. We claim that:\n\n$$\nG \\rightarrow K_{3} \\text { if and only if } G^{5^{r}-1} \\rightarrow C_{3 \\cdot 5^{r}}\n$$\n\nAn example of this reduction appears in Figure 2. The forward direction is trivial. Let us address the backward direction and let $h$ be a homomorphism from $G^{5^{r}-1}$ to $C_{3 \\cdot 5^{r}}$. Let $X$ be the set of vertices of $G^{5^{r}}$ that appear already in $G$. We claim that $h(X) \\subseteq\\left\\{i, i+5^{r}, i+2 \\cdot 5^{r}\\right\\}$ for some $i \\in\\left[3 \\cdot 5^{r}\\right]$ where addition is $\\bmod 3 \\cdot 5^{r}$. Suppose otherwise, then there is an edge $x y$ in $G$, so that the distance between $h(x)$ and $h(y)$ in $C_{3 \\cdot 5^{r}}$ is $0<i<5^{r}$ (this is why we assumed $G$ to be connected). But this is impossible since we may consider there exists $z$ so that $x y z$ is a triangle in $G$ and this triangle must have been mapped to line in $C_{3 \\cdot 5^{r}}$. Now, once we calculate $i$ and subtract it, we can divide by $5^{r}$ to use $h$ restricted to $X$ to give a homomorphism from $G$ to $K_{3}$.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFig. 2. Reduction from the proof of Lemma 3 This is what the 4 -cycle $C_{4}$ would be reduced to. The first step is to assume each edge is in a triangle. Finally, the edges will be substituted by paths of length $5^{r}$.\n\nNote that Lemmas 1 and 3 are enough to guarantee a dichotomy for $H$ -subgraph-free graphs where $H$ is a single graph and not a finite set of graphs [21]. However, as $C_{3}$-Colouring (or equivalently, 3 -Colouring) does not satisfy C2 due to Brooks' Theorem, we need to do more work to accomplish the following.\n\nLemma 4. Graph Homomorphism satisfies C3.\nProof. Let us recall the self-reduction from $C_{5}$-Colouring to (subcubic) $C_{5^{-}}$ Colouring in Theorem 3.1 from [15]. Each vertex with degree $d$ becomes a chain of $d C_{5} \\mathrm{~s}$, the $i+1$ th connected to the $i$ th by identifying edge 1 on the former with edge 4 on the latter (one may take any cyclic ordering of the edges). Then the $i$ th occurrence of the vertex is taken to be the top vertex of the $i$ th\n\n$C_{5}$ in the chain (where edge 2 meets edge 3 ). Now, one can simply join the $i$ th occurrence of vertex $x$ to the $j$ th occurrence of vertex $y$ if the edge $x y$ is the $i$ th edge of $x$ and the $j$ th edge of $y$. This is exactly the reduction of Theorem 3.1 from [15]. We amend if by pretending each edge $x y$ is in fact three edges and must be joined from the chain of $C_{5} \\mathrm{~s}$ representing $x$ to the chain of $C_{5} \\mathrm{~s}$ representing $y$ three times (this can at most result in a tripling of the degree). We assume that these joins are consecutive on each chain. An example of this self-reduction appears in Figure 3\n\nLet $Y$ be the set of instances of $C_{5}$-Colouring that can be obtained by this self-reduction. For $G \\in Y$, all edges are in a $C_{5}$ except perhaps the edges that came from the edges in the original graph, which are now represented in $G$ in triplicate. Let $r \\geq 1$ be fixed. Let $G \\in Y$. We claim that:\n\n$$\nG \\rightarrow C_{5} \\text { if and only if } G^{5^{r}-1} \\rightarrow C_{5^{r+1}}\n$$\n\nThe forward direction is trivial. Let us address the backward direction and let $h$ be a homomorphism from $G^{5^{r}}$ to $C_{5^{r+1}}$. Let $X$ be the set of vertices of $G^{5^{r}}$ that appear already in $G$. We claim that $h(X) \\subseteq\\left\\{i, i+5^{r}, i+2 \\cdot 5^{r}, i+3 \\cdot 5^{r}, i+4 \\cdot 5^{r}\\right\\}$ for some $i \\in\\left[5^{r+1}\\right]$ where addition is $\\bmod 5^{r+1}$. Suppose otherwise, then there is an edge $x y$ in $G$ so that the distance between $h(x)$ and $h(y)$ in $C_{5^{r+1}}$ is $0<i<5^{r}$. But this is impossible for the edges in $G$ that were in a $C_{5}$ since we may consider there exists $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}$ so that $x y z_{1} z_{2} z_{3}$ is a $C_{5}$ in $G$ and this $C_{5}$ must have been mapped to line in $C_{5^{r+1}}$. Suppose now it happens for an edge that is not in a $C_{5}$ and remember these edges come in triplicate. If $x y$ were the edge in the original graph, then consider that they became edges $x^{\\prime} y^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime}, x^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$ in $G$. Now, w.l.o.g., if $h\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $h\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$ are mapped at distance $0<c<5^{r}$ in $C_{5^{r+1}}$, then both $h\\left(x^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ and $h\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, and $h\\left(x^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}\\right)$ and $h\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}\\right)$ must be mapped to distance $5^{r}-c \\bmod 5^{r}$ since there are even cycles involving $x^{\\prime} y^{\\prime}$ and $x^{\\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime}$, and $x^{\\prime} y^{\\prime}$ and $x^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$, where all other edges were in a $C_{5}$. But now we consider that there is an even cycle involving $x^{\\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $x^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} y^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}$, where all other edges were in a $C_{5}$, and derive a contradiction.\n\nNow, once we calculate $i$ and subtract it, we can divide by $5^{r}$ to use $h$ restricted to $X$ to give a homomorphism from $G$ to $C_{5}$.\n\nTheorem 2.

{"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 Locally Constrained Homomorphisms \n\nIn this section we consider three locally constrained homomorphism problems and show that all three of them are C23-problems, which become C123-problems after imposing a degree bound.\n\nLocally Bijective Homomorphism\nInstance: A graph $G$ and a graph $H$\nQuestion: Is there a locally bijective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ ?\n\nLocally InJective Homomorphism\nInstance: A graph $G$ and a graph $H$\nQuestion: Is there a locally injective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ ?\n\nLocally Surjective Homomorphism\nInstance: A graph $G$ and a graph $H$\nQuestion: Is there a locally surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ ?\n\nWe will often use the abbreviations LBHom, LSHom and LIHom for the three problems. We would also like to consider the bounded-degree versions of these problems, which we refer to as Degree- $d$-LBHom, Degree- $d$-LSHom and Degree- $d$-LIHom, here we restrict the maximum degree of either $G$ or $H$ to be $d$; note that we require only one of these two graphs to have bounded degree.\n\nLemma 5 ([9]). For each d, the three problems Degree-d-LBHom, Degree-$d$-LSHom and Degree- $d$-LIHom satisfy C1.\n\nLemma 6 ([9]). The three problems Degree-3-LBHom, Degree-3-LSHom, Degree-3-LIHom satisfy C2.\n\nIn particular LBHom, LSHom and LIHom remain NP-complete where $G$ is subcubic and $H$ is $K_{4}[9]$.\n\nLemma 7. Locally BiJective Homomorphism satisfies C3.\nProof. We claim LBHom is NP-complete for $r$-subdivisions of subcubic graphs for any integer $r$. Let $X$ be the set of vertices of $G^{r}$ that also appear in $G$ and let $Z$ be the vertices of $K_{4}^{r}$ that also appear in $K_{4}$. We claim:\n\n$$\nG \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{~B}} K_{4} \\text { if and only if } G^{r} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{~B}} K_{4}^{r}\n$$\n\nThe forward direction is trivial. Let us consider the backward direction, let $h_{b}$ be a locally bijective homomorphism from $G^{r}$ to $K_{4}^{r}$, we claim $h_{b}(v) \\in Z$ if, and only if $v \\in X$. As $h_{b}$ is locally bijective, degree must be preserved, meaning $h_{b}(v) \\in Z$ if, and only if $v$ has degree 3 therefore by showing all vertices in $X$ must have degree 3 our claim is proven.\n\nWe may assume there exists at least one degree 3 vertex $v \\in G^{r}$, let $P=$ $\\left(v, p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{r-1}, p_{r}\\right)$ be an arbitrary path of length $r$ from $v$. Both $v$ and $p_{r}$ must be in $X$ with all intermediate vertices having degree 2 . Similarly for any path of length $r$ from $h_{b}(v)$ as $h_{b}(v) \\in Z$ all intermediate vertices must have degree 2 with that at distance $r$ in $Z$. As $p_{1}$ must be mapped to some neighbour of $h_{b}(v)$, both $p_{1}$ and $h_{b}\\left(p_{1}\\right)$ have degree 2 . Now as $p_{2}$ cannot map to $h_{b}(v)$ it must map to the next vertex on a path away from $h_{b}(v)$. As both $p_{i-1}$ and $h_{b}\\left(p_{i-1}\\right)$ have degree 2 it follows that $h_{b}\\left(p_{i}\\right)$ must have distance $i$ from $h_{b}(v)$. Inductively it follows that $h_{b}\\left(p_{r}\\right)$ must have distance $r$ from $h_{b}(v)$ implying $h_{b}\\left(p_{r}\\right) \\in Z$ and therefore $p_{r}$ has degree 3 . As this holds for all vertices distance $r$ from a degree 3 vertex it follows that all vertices in $X$ must have degree 3 meaning $h_{b}$ can be used restricted to $X$ to give a homomorphism from $G$ to $K_{4}$.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFig. 3. Self-reduction at the start of the proof of Lemma 4 This is what the 4-cycle $C_{4}$ would be reduced to.\n\nLemma 8. Locally Surjective Homomorphism satisfies C3.\n\nProof. As with the bijective case let $X$ be the set of vertices of $G^{r}$ that also appear in $G$ and let $Z$ be the vertices of $K_{4}^{r}$ that also appear in $K_{4}$. Now we claim:\n$G \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{~S}} K_{4}$ if and only if $G^{r} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{~S}} K_{4}^{r}$.\nAgain the forward direction is trivial and let us consider the backward direction, let $h_{s}$ be a locally surjective homomorphism from $G^{r}$ to $K_{4}^{r}$, we claim $h_{s}(v) \\in Z$ if and only if $v \\in X$. In the surjective case, the degree of a vertex of $v \\in G^{r}$ can be greater than that of $h_{s}(v)$, although the inverse cannot be true thus implying that only vertices in $X$, specifically those with degree 3 , can be mapped to a vertex in $Z$.\n\nNow consider the other direction showing if $v \\in X$ then $h_{b}(v) \\in Z$, assume for contradiction, $v$ were mapped to some vertex not in $Z$. As all vertices in $G^{r}$ with degree 3 must be in $X$, the length of the shortest path from $v$ to the closest degree 3 vertex must be $\\geq r$. Let $x$ be this degree 3 vertex and $P=\\left(v, p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, x\\right)$ be the path from $v$ to $x$. In addition, as $h_{s}(v) \\notin Z$ there must be exactly two vertices, $z, z^{\\prime} \\in Z$, with distance $<r$ from $h_{s}(v)$ with every path of length $r$ from $h_{s}(v)$ containing one of these. We claim the shortest path from $v$ to $x$ must map to a path from $h_{s}(v)$ via $z$ or $z^{\\prime}$, note this leads to a contradiction as a degree 2 vertex cannot be mapped to a vertex with degree 3 .\n\nFirst consider the vertex $p_{2}$, necessarily $h_{s}\\left(p_{2}\\right)$ is some neighbour of $h_{s}(v)$. If $p_{2}$ maps to either $z$ or $z^{\\prime}$ our claim is proven, else, $h_{b}\\left(p_{2}\\right)$ must have degree 2 . Each neighbour of $h_{s}\\left(p_{2}\\right)$ must be mapped to at least one neighbour of $p_{2}$, as $p_{2}$ has degree $2, p_{3}$ must map to a vertex distance 2 from $v$ given it cannot map to $h_{b}(v)$. It then follows inductively that while $i<r$ and $h_{s}\\left(p_{i}\\right) \\notin\\left\\{z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, both $p_{i}$ and $h_{b}\\left(p_{i}\\right)$ have degree 2 , meaning $h_{s}\\left(p_{i+1}\\right)$ must have distance $i$ from $h_{s}(v)$. As every path of length $r$ from $h_{s}(v)$ must go via either $v$ or $v^{\\prime}$ we once again have a contradiction. As $h_{s}(v) \\in Z$ if and only if $v \\in X$ we can again use $h_{s}$ restricted to $X$ to give a homomorphism from $G$ to $K_{4}$.\n\nLemma 9. Locally InJECTIVE HOMOMORPHISM satisfies C3.\n\nProof. Similarly to LBHOM and LSHOM, we claim:\n$G \\xrightarrow{1} K_{4}$ if and only if $G^{r} \\xrightarrow{1} K_{4}^{r}$.\nAgain, the forward direction is trivial. For the backward direction, let $h_{i}$ be a locally injective homomorphism from $G^{r}$ to $K_{4}^{r}$, this means the degree of $v$ can be less than that of $h_{i}(v)$ but the inverse cannot be true. We will again show that $h_{i}(v) \\in Z$ if and only if $v \\in X$. To aid in this we make a second claim, given two vertices distance $r$ from each other, call these $v$ and $v^{r}$, then $v^{r}$ maps to some vertex in $Z$ if and only if $v$ maps to a vertex in $Z$.\n\nLet $P=\\left(v, p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{r-1}, v^{r}\\right)$ be the shortest path between $v$ and $v^{r}$. First consider where $h_{i}(v) \\in Z$, given any path of length $r$ from $h_{i}(v)$, all intermediate vertices must have degree 2 and the vertex at distance $r$ must also be in $Z$. Showing $P$ must map to a path of length $r$ from $h_{i}(v)$ therefore implies $h_{i}\\left(v^{r}\\right) \\in$ $Z$.\n$p_{2}$ must map to some neighbour of $h_{i}(v)$, as all neighbours of $h_{i}(v)$ have degree $2, p_{2}$ must have degree $\\leq 2$ and as it lies on a path it must have degree 2 . Then as no two neighbours of $p_{2}$ can map to the same neighbour of $h_{i}\\left(p_{2}\\right)$, the vertex $p_{3}$ must map to a vertex distance 2 from $v$. Inductively it follows, where $i<r$, if $h_{i}\\left(p_{i}\\right)$ has distance $i-1$ from $h_{i}(v)$, given $h_{i}\\left(p_{i}\\right)$ and therefore also $p_{i}$ must have degree $2, h_{i}\\left(p_{i+1}\\right)$ has distance $i$ from $h_{i}(v)$. Thus $P$ maps to a path of length $r$ from $h_{i}(v)$, implying $h_{i}\\left(v^{r}\\right) \\in Z$.\n\nSimilarly, if $h_{i}(v) \\notin Z$ a path of length $r$ from $h_{i}(v)$, is made up of two paths with length $<r$. One from $h_{i}(v)$ to some vertex $z_{j} \\in Z$ and one away from $z_{j}$, thus any vertex at distance $r$ cannot be in $Z$. Given that both paths contain only degree 2 vertices, the reasoning from the previous case holds. Say $z_{j}$ has distance $l$ from $h_{i}(v)$, the first $l$ vertices of our path must map a path of length $l$ from $h_{i}(v)$ with the remaining path of length $r-l$ mapping to a path of length $r-l$ from $v_{j}$. This therefore proves our claim.\n\nGiven this holds for any two vertices in $G^{r}$ distance $r$ from one another, this must also hold for any multiple of $r$. If two vertices $v, w$ have distance $k \\cdot r$ from each other, for some integer $k$, then $h_{i}(v) \\in Z$ if, and only if $h_{i}(w) \\in Z$. We can now prove our main claim, $h_{i}(v) \\in Z$ if and only if $v \\in Z$.\n\nSay some vertex $v \\in X$ were mapped to some $h_{i}(v) \\notin Z$, we may assume $v$ has degree $\\leq 2$ as it is mapped to a vertex with degree 2 . As we assume there\n\nexists at least one degree 3 vertex in $G^{r}$, let $x$ be that closest to $v$. As both $v$ and $x$ are in $X$ they must have distance some multiple of $r$. This implies $h_{i}(x) \\notin Z$, however, this leads to a contradiction as a degree 3 vertex cannot be mapped to a vertex with degree 2 .\n\nIn the other direction, assume some vertex $v \\notin X$ were mapped to some vertex in $Z$, again let $x$ be the closest degree 3 vertex to $v$. In addition, on the shortest path from $v$ to $x$, let $v^{\\prime}$ be the vertex closest to $x$ such that its distance from $v$ is some multiple of $r$. As $h_{i}\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right) \\in Z$ and the distance from $v^{\\prime}$ to $x$ is less than $r, h_{i}(x)$ must lay on the path between two vertices in $Z$. As previously this path from $v^{\\prime}$ to $x$ must map to a path of the same length from $h_{i}\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)$ to $h_{i}(x)$. This means $x$ cannot map to a vertex in $Z$ which again leads to a contradiction as $x$ has degree 3 and $h_{i}(x)$ has degree 2 .\n\nTheorem 3. Locally BJective Homomorphism, Locally Surjective HoMOMORPHISM and Locally InJECTIVE HOMOMORPHISM are C23-problems.\n\nTheorem 4.

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5 Sequential 3-Colouring Construction Game, QCSP $\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ \n\nWe prove that $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ remains PSPACE-complete for graphs of bounded pathwidth. Afterwards, we do the same for the SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction Game. We first formally define the former problem.\n\n```\n\\(\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)\\)\n    Instance: A sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the form \\(Q_{1} x_{1} Q_{2} x_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} x_{n} \\Phi\\), where \\(Q_{i} \\in\\)\n    \\(\\{\\forall, \\exists\\}\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) is a conjunction of atoms involving the edge rela-\n    tion \\(E\\).\n    Question: Is \\(\\phi\\) true on \\(K_{3}\\) ?\n```\n\n$\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ is sometimes known as Quantified 3-Colouring and as highlighted previously closely relates to the SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction GaME proposed by Bodlaender in [4]. The two key differences between the problems lie in the requirement of strict alternation in players and each player must assign a colour not previously assigned to a neighbour, in particular, we will show the hardness on bounded pathwidth is preserved between problems.\n\nTheorem 5. $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ is PSPACE-complete for graphs of bounded pathwidth.\nProof. We will reduce from the PSPACE-complete problem Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) which was shown by Atserias et al. [3] to remain hard where the input is in CNF and the path-width of the primal constraint graph is constant.\n\nLet $\\phi=Q_{1} x_{1} Q_{2} x_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} x_{n} \\Phi$ be an instance of QBF where $\\Phi$ is a CNF formula. The primal graph of $\\Phi, G(\\Phi)$, contains a vertex for each variable of $\\Phi$ and an edge where two variables appear in a clause together. Let the pathwidth\n\nof $G(\\Phi)$ be a constant $w$. Each clause may then have length at most $w+1$, as every clause must be contained as a clique in some bag.\n\nTo reduce from QBF to $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ we will construct an intermediate instance of Quantified Not-All-Equal 3-Satisfiability (QNAE3SAT), $\\phi^{\\prime}$. Each clause $C_{i}$ of $\\Phi$ is replaced by a set of $N A E$ relations $C^{\\prime}$ in $\\Phi$. Introducing a constant False it is clear that $N A E\\left(C_{i}, F\\right)$ is satisfied if, and only if $C_{i}$ is satisfied. Now it remains to ensure that there are three variables in each clause. Given $C_{i}$ of $\\Phi$ contains literals $l_{1}, \\ldots, l_{k}, k \\leq w$ we create $k-2$ new existentially quantified variables $q_{i, j}, 1 \\leq j \\leq k-2$. We can now define $C^{\\prime}$ as follows, if $k=1$ let $C^{\\prime}=N A E\\left(l_{1}, F, F\\right)$, where $k=2$ let $C^{\\prime}=$ $N A E\\left(l_{1}, l_{2}, F\\right)$, otherwise where $k \\geq 3, C^{\\prime}=N A E\\left(l_{1}, l_{2}, q_{1}\\right), N A E\\left(\\overline{q_{1}}, l_{3}, q_{2}\\right), \\ldots$, $N A E\\left(\\overline{q_{k-3}}, l_{k-1}, q_{k-2}\\right), N A E\\left(\\overline{q_{k-2}}, l_{k}, F\\right)$.\n\nWe now claim $C_{i}^{\\prime}$ is satisfied by an assignment of variables if, and only if $C_{i}$ is satisfied by this same assignment, thus given a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi$ which satisfies $C_{i}$, this also gives a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ satisfying all clauses in $C_{i}^{\\prime}$. Take some winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi$, at least one literal in $C_{i}$ must be evaluated as True. If $l_{j}$ is the first such literal, $l_{q} \\forall 1 \\leq q<j$ are evaluated as False. If $j \\in\\{1,2\\}$, variables $q_{1} \\ldots q_{k-2}$ can be assigned False which satisfies all later clauses as each clause contains a positive and negative appearance of a variable. If $j \\geq 3$ we can assign $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{j-2}$ True and $q_{j-1}, \\ldots, q_{k-2}$ False, $C_{i, 1}^{\\prime}$ is satisfied as neither $l_{1}$ nor $l_{2}$ are assigned True and all other clauses contain either $F$ or a $q$ variable and a negated $q$ variable. If $j<k$ then $C_{i, j-1}^{\\prime}$ is satisfied as $l_{j}$ is assigned True with $\\overline{q_{j-2}}$ and $q_{j-1}$ evaluated to $0 . C_{i, k-1}^{\\prime}$ is satisfied as $\\overline{q_{k-2}}$ is assigned True and $F$ must be evaluated to False.\n\nNow assuming all variables clauses in $C^{\\prime}$ are satisfied we claim at least one literal must be assigned True. Assume otherwise, $q_{1}$ must be assigned True to satisfy $C_{i, 1}^{\\prime}$, now $q_{2}$ must be assigned True to satisfy $C_{i, 2}^{\\prime}$, it follows that all $q$ variables must be assigned True. However, this means $C_{i, k-1}^{\\prime}$ cannot be satisfied, thus leading to a contradiction.\n\nFrom $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we construct an instance of $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right), \\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. We refer to the variable of $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ as vertices and the vertices of $K_{3}$ as $\\{1,2,3\\}$. With the exception of $F$ every variable $x_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ is replaced by a path of vertices $x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. We introduce a new vertex $W$ which is made adjacent to $F$ alongside all $x$ and $y$ variables. For each clause $C_{p}^{\\prime} \\in \\Phi^{\\prime}$ we also introduce a $K_{3}$ with each vertex corresponding to a literal of the clause. Consider where the first literal of $C_{p}^{\\prime}$ is a positive appearance of $v_{i} \\in \\phi^{\\prime}$ then the first vertex of $K_{3}$ will be adjacent to $x_{i} \\in \\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. If this literal were $\\overline{x_{i}}$ then the same vertex in $K_{3}$ would be adjacent to $y_{i}$.\n\nAll variables in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ are existentially quantified except for $z_{i}$ which follows the quantification of $v_{i} \\phi^{\\prime}$ and the linear ordering of the vertices begins with $W$ and $F$, followed by $z$ vertices which follow the ordering of $x_{i} \\in \\phi$, the ordering of the remaining variables does not matter as they share the same quantification. The quantifier prefix is therefore $\\exists \\exists Q_{1} Q_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} \\exists^{*}$.\n\nWe defer until Lemma 10 the proof that $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ has bounded pathwidth.\n\n$\\left(\\phi^{\\prime} \\rightarrow \\phi^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. Suppose $\\phi^{\\prime}$ is a positive instance, that is we can define a winning strategy for Existential that wins over any strategy of Universal, we can map this to a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. Without loss of generality, $W$ can be coloured 3 and $F$ coloured $1, x$ and $y$ variables must therefore be coloured either 1 or 2 . We can now map assignments in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ to a colouring $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. If a universal variable $z_{i}$ of $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ is coloured $3, y_{i}$ can be coloured 1 and $x_{i}$ coloured 2 ; otherwise, $x_{i}$ can be coloured the same as $z_{i}$ with $y_{i}$ assigned the single remaining colour available to it. This allows us to map a colouring of the variables $x_{i}, y_{j}, z_{i}$ associated with a universal vertex $z_{i}$ to a strategy played by Universal in $\\phi^{\\prime}$.\n\nIf Universal assigns $x_{i}$ the colour 1 in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ we map this to a strategy such that $x_{i}$ is assigned False in $\\phi$ by Universal, similarly if $x_{i}$ coloured 2 in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ we map to a strategy where $x_{i}$ is assigned True. Given this assignment of universal variables, we colour the remaining existential variables according to the winning existential strategy in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ mapping the strategy to colours as done with the universal variables. Finally, we need to show we can colour each of the $K_{3}$ s. As the colouring of variables maps to a winning strategy of QNAE3SAT, at most two literals in a clause can have the same assignment meaning at most two vertices in the triangle have a neighbour with the same colour. Thus using all three colours we can colour the triangle.\n$\\left(\\phi^{\\prime \\prime} \\rightarrow \\phi^{\\prime}\\right.$.) Now suppose we have a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$, we will again translate this into a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime}$. We can assume $W$ and $F$ are coloured 3 and 1 , respectively, meaning variables $x$ and $y$ variables must be coloured 1 or 2 . For any assignment of universal variables in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we can map this to a strategy in $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. We can now as before read off the existential variables, in particular our values of $x$. For each clause, all vertices of the $K_{3}$ must be coloured differently, meaning at most two of the vertices adjacent to the $K_{3}$ may have the same colour. This means each clause in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ must be satisfied giving us a winning strategy.\n\nWe remind the reader that the path-width of a formula is equal to the path-width of the primal graph of its quantifier-free part.\n\nLemma 10. The path-width of $\\Phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ is at most $9 w+2$.\nProof. Given the path-width of $\\Phi$ is $w$ we claim the path-width of $\\Phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ is $w^{\\prime}$ where $w^{\\prime} \\leq 9 w+2$. Let $B$ be a path decomposition for $\\Phi$ such that the size of the largest bag is $w+1$. As each clause $C_{i}$ of $\\Phi$ appears as a clique in the primal graph all variables in $C_{i}$ must be contained in at least one bag together. We say a clause is associated with a given bag if it is the first bag such that all variables in the clause appear together. Where a bag is associated with multiple clauses it can be replaced with a path of duplicates, thus a bag is associated with at most one clause. Notice this increases the number of bags by at most the number of clauses.\n\nWe now define a path decomposition $B^{\\prime}$ for $\\Phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ with a bag $b_{i}^{\\prime} \\in B^{\\prime}$ for each $b_{i} \\in B$. Where $b_{i}$ contains a variable $v_{j} \\in \\Phi$, then $b_{j}$ contains $x, y, z \\in \\Phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. In addition, $W$ and $F$ are contained in each bag of $B^{\\prime}$ meaning $\\left|b_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|=3\\left|B_{i}\\right|+2$. For\n\na clause $c_{i} \\in \\phi$ of size $k$ we have $k-2$ new variables in $\\Phi^{\\prime} q_{i, j}$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq k-2$ thus $3(k-2)$ new vertices in $\\Phi^{\\prime \\prime}$. As $c_{i}$ was replaced by $k-1$ clauses in $\\Phi^{\\prime}$, we also have $3(k-1)$ new vertices for the $K_{3}$ dedicated to each clause. This leads to a total of $3(k-2)+3(k-1)=6 k-9$ new vertices for clause $C_{i}$. If we call these new vertices $S_{C_{i}}$, as $N\\left[S_{C_{i}}\\right]=S_{c_{i}} \\cup C_{i}, S_{i}$ can also be contained in the bag associated with $C_{i}$ with this remaining a path decomposition. Thus if bag $B_{j}$ is associated with clause $C_{i},\\left|B_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|=3\\left|B_{i}\\right|+6 k-7$ and as $\\left|B_{p}\\right|, k \\leq w+1$ for all $B_{p} \\in B,\\left|B_{p}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq 9 w+2$ for all $B_{p}^{\\prime} \\in B$.\n\nTheorem 6. Sequential 3-Colouring Construction Game is PSPACEcomplete for graphs of bounded pathwidth.\n\nProof. We now consider the two additional restrictions of the SeQuential 3Colouring Construction Game. Where the Universal player is unable to colour a vertex the same as a previously coloured neighbour the problem is identical to that of $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ and strict alternation can be overcome using dummy variables while preserving yes and no instances.\n\nWe will therefore use this to show the reduction used to prove Theorem 5 also holds for both problems. In $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ all universally quantified variables are in the form $z_{i}$ with a single neighbour $y_{i}$, as $z_{i}$ comes before $y_{i}$ in the linear ordering of vertices. This means the problems of SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction Game and $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ are equivalent on $\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ thus both problems remain hard for graphs of bounded path-width.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# $6 \\quad \\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ \n\nIn this section, we prove that $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is a C23-problem, but the main result in this section is that its restriction $\\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is a C123-problem. We obtain $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ by augmenting $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ with some unary relations that allow us to restrict existential variables to some subset of the domain.\n\n```\n\\(\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)\\)\n    Instance: A sentence \\(\\phi\\) of the form \\(Q_{1} x_{1} Q_{2} x_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} x_{n} \\Phi\\), where \\(Q_{i} \\in\\)\n    \\(\\{\\forall, \\exists\\}\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) is a conjunction of atoms involving the edge rela-\n    tion \\(E\\) and the unary relations \\(\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\).\n    Question: Is \\(\\phi\\) true on \\(K_{3}\\) ?\n```\n\nAnother variant, $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{1\\},\\{2\\},\\{3\\}\\right)$ is also known as Quantified List 3-Colouring. We consider a slight simplification of this problem as we show not all lists are necessary to ensure hardness, however, the hardness extends to the more general case.\n\nIn order to occupy our framework, we will consider bounded alternation versions of our problems. The problem $\\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is the restriction of $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ to inputs in $\\Pi_{2 k}$-form. While it may lead to a less natural variant of SeQuential List 3-Colouring Construction Game\n\nas the original game insists on a strict alternation between the two players. In this case, bounding the number of alternations between the two players would make the game trivial, we instead allow each player to colour multiple vertices in their turn.\n\nLemma 11. $\\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is $\\Pi_{2 k}^{\\mathbf{P}}$-complete for $2 r$-subdivisions of subcubic graphs.\n\nProof. We will reduce from the $\\Pi_{k}^{\\mathbf{P}}$-complete problem $\\Pi_{k}$-Quantified-Not-All-EQual-3-SAT ( $\\Pi_{k}$-QNAE-3-SAT) 20|25]. Let $\\phi=Q_{1} x_{1} Q_{2} x_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} x_{n} \\Phi$ be an instance of $\\Pi_{k}$-QNAE-3-SAT where $x_{i} \\in\\{0,1\\}, \\Phi=N A E_{3}\\left(C_{1}\\right) \\vee N A E_{3}\\left(C_{2}\\right) \\vee$ $\\ldots \\vee N A E_{3}\\left(C_{m}\\right)$ where $C_{i}=\\left(x_{h}, x_{i}, x_{j}\\right)$ and $x_{h}, x_{i}, x_{j} \\in\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\}$.\n\nFor each variable $x_{i}$ in $\\phi$ there are three variables $\\exists x_{i}, Q_{i} z_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ with $L\\left(x_{i}\\right)=$ $\\{1,2\\}$ and $L\\left(z_{i}\\right)=\\{1,2,3\\}$. Paths of length $2 p+1$ are introduced between $z_{i}$ and $x_{i}$ with each inner vertex having the list $\\{1,2\\}$. In addition for each clause $C_{p}$ we use the three literal clause gadget from [16] introducing variables $C_{p}, C_{p}^{\\prime}, C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where $L\\left(C_{p}\\right)=\\{1,2\\}$ and $L\\left(C_{p}^{\\prime}\\right)=L\\left(C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\{1,2,3\\}$. We add the paths of length $2 p+1$ between the vertices $x_{h} C_{p}, x_{i} C_{p}^{\\prime}, x_{j} C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}, C_{p} C_{p}^{\\prime}, C_{p} C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ with all inner vertices assigned the list $\\{1,2\\}$. Notice this forces the path to alternate between colours and enforces that given a single endpoint is coloured 1 or 2 the other endpoint cannot be coloured the same. There is also a path between $C_{p}^{\\prime}$ and $C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ with inner vertices assigned the list $\\{1,3\\}$, which has the same impact where a vertex is coloured 1 or 3 .\n\nThe ordering of $\\phi^{\\prime}$ follows that of $\\phi$ for variables $z_{i}$. It is then followed by all remaining vertices, as these are all existentially quantified their ordering does not matter. This leads to a prefix $Q_{1} z_{1} Q_{2} z_{2} \\ldots Q_{n} z_{n} \\exists^{*}$.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFig. 4. Construction for clause $C_{p}$. Dashed lines denote paths of length $2 p+1$ with the label corresponding to the list of internal vertices.\n\nSuppose $\\phi$ is a positive instance, that is we can define a winning strategy for the existential player, we can then also define a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime}$. Given the colouring of universal variables in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we can map this to a strategy for the universal player in $\\phi$. Where $z_{i}$ is coloured 1 or $2, x_{i}$ must take the other available colour not used by $z_{i}$, whereas if $z_{i}$ is coloured 3 without loss of generality we can assign $x_{i} 1$. Given $x_{i}$ is coloured 1 in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we can map this to a strategy where universal assigns 0 to $x_{i}$ in $\\phi$ similarly given a colouring of 2 in $\\phi$ we can map this to an assignment of 1 in $\\phi$. We can now evaluate the existential vertices $x_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ according to the strategy of existential for variables $x_{i}$ in $\\phi$, again mapping 0,1 to 1,2 respectively.\n\nGiven this strategy for colouring variables $x_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we claim we can colour the remaining existential variables therefore showing there is a winning strategy for existential. First note all existential variables $z_{i}$ can be coloured 3 , next as the colouring of variables $x_{i}$ equates to a winning strategy for existential in $\\phi$ for all clauses $C_{i}=\\left(x_{h}, x_{i}, x_{j}\\right)$ in $\\phi$ at most 2 of the variables can be assigned the same value meaning of $C_{p}, C_{p}^{\\prime}, C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ at most 2 of their respective $x$ 's can be given the same colour. The colour of $x_{h}$ fixes that of $C_{p}$ such that they are different which also forces both $C_{p}^{\\prime}$ and $C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ to be coloured differently to $C_{p}$. At least one variable of $x_{i}, x_{j}$ must be coloured differently to $x_{h}$, say $x_{i}$, this means $C_{p}$ must be coloured the same as $x_{i}$. We can then colour $C_{p}^{\\prime} 1$ or 2 whichever is not used by $x_{i}$ leaving $C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ to be coloured 3 .\n\nNow given Existential has a winning strategy in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we will construct a winning strategy for her in $\\phi$. Now given an assignment of universal variables in $\\phi$ we can map this to a colouring of the universal vertices in $\\phi^{\\prime}$, given a variable $x_{i}$ is assigned 0 in $\\phi$ we can map this to a strategy of Universal such that $z_{i}$ is coloured 2 , similarly if $x_{i}$ is assigned 1 we map to $z_{i}$ coloured 1 . Notice as $x_{i}$ cannot be coloured the same as $z_{i}$, this is the same strategy such that an assignment of $x_{i}$ to 0 in $\\phi$ maps to one where $x_{i}$ is coloured $1 \\phi^{\\prime}$. We can now, as previously, evaluate the existential variables of $\\phi$ according to the strategy of Existential for variables $x_{i}$ in $\\phi^{\\prime}$, again mapping 1,2 to 0,1 respectively.\n\nWe now claim every clause of $\\phi$ must be satisfied by this assignment. Assume otherwise, let $c_{p}$ be the first clause such that $N A E_{2}\\left(C_{p}\\right)$ is not satisfied, note as this is a winning strategy for Existential in $\\phi^{\\prime}$ we must have some valid colouring for $C_{p}, C_{p}^{\\prime}, C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ such that $x_{h}, x_{i}, x_{j}$ are all equal. Say these were all coloured $1, C_{p}$ must be coloured 2 , meaning neither $C_{p}^{\\prime}$ nor $C_{p}^{\\prime \\prime}$ can be coloured 2 . These vertices also cannot be coloured 1 due to $x_{i}, x_{j}$ leaving only colour 3 for both, however, at most one can be coloured 3 as there is an odd path between them. The same reasoning also holds where $x_{h}, x_{i}, x_{j}$ are coloured 2 , thus a contradiction.\n\nIn this construction the only vertices with degree $>3$ are vertices $x_{i}$ where $x_{i} \\in \\phi$ appears in $>2$ clauses in this case for each appearance of $x_{i}$ in $C_{j}$ we create a new vertex $x_{i, j}$ with an even path to the previous appearance of this variable and an even path to the next. Inner vertices can be coloured $\\{1,2\\}$ and as this is an even path $x_{i, j}=x_{i}$ for all $j$.\n\nThe proof of Lemma 11 also furnishes the following, which we note in passing.\n\nLemma 12. $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is $\\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete for $2 r$-subdivisions of subcubic graphs.\n\nLemma 13 ([10]). $\\Pi_{2

bounded alternation case, $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ does not satisfy C1 with the hardness under bounded path-width following directly from

{"section_id": 7, "text": "# 7 Forbidding labelled graphs \n\nIt has been observed by Hubie Chen ${ }^{4}$ that the objects one should be forbidding from inputs to a problem such as $\\operatorname{QCSP}(A)$ are not just graphs, but graphs with vertices of two types (universal and existential), as well as a relative ordering on those that represent the quantifier order. In this section, we explore some simple cases where the vertices must have one of the two types, but the order is left undefined. Essentially, we forbid the structure for any of the orderings. Let $H$ be a graph in which all the vertices are labelled by either $\\exists$ or $\\forall$ (we may think of this as a 2 -coloured graph $)^{5}$. An input $\\phi$ (with quantifier-free part $\\Phi$ ) for $\\operatorname{QCSP}(A)$ is considered $H$-subgraph-free if the graph $G(\\Phi)$, having been 2labelled according to which vertices are universal and which are existential, omits $H$ as a (2-labelled) subgraph. Let us remark on some simple general results. If $H$ is a subgraph of $H^{\\prime}$ then hardness for the $H$-subgraph-free case translates immediately to hardness for the $H^{\\prime}$-subgraph-free case.\n\nCorollary 1. Let $H$ be a 2 -labelled graph. Then $\\Pi_{2 k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is $\\Pi_{2 k}^{\\mathbf{P}}$-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ contains some connected component, $C$, such that any of the following apply:\n\n1. The underlying graph of $C$ is not in $\\mathcal{S}$\n2. $C$ contains some universal vertex with degree $>1$\n3. $C$ contains some degree 3 vertex and some universal vertex\n4. $C$ contains at least two universal vertices\n\nProof. The proofs for all of these lie in previous parts of the paper. The first part is the principal result as well as a clear corollary of Theorem 7.\n\nThe remaining parts follow from the hardness proof of Lemma 11.\nFor the second part, one may note that the hardness proof only uses universal vertices of degree 1 .\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Private communication, 2024.\n    ${ }^{5}$ We resist using a different notation for these 2 -labelled graphs. Whether $H$ represents a simple graph or a 2 -labelled graph will be clear from the context.\n\nFor the third part, one can note that we can make a path from a universal variable to a vertex of degree at least 3 as long as we care, while not sacrificing hardness.\n\nThe fourth part follows similarly to the third part, as we can make the paths from the universal variables arbitrarily long, we can effectively make universal variables arbitrarily far apart.\n\nWe will now make a further simplification, to study only $\\Pi_{2}$ instances. Let us recall that $\\Pi_{2}$-QCSP $\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is $\\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete in general. We will consider this problem on $H$-subgraph-free instances, where $H$ is a 2 -labelled graph of small size. We will use the following notation. If we assume $H$ to be just a graph with vertex set $V(H)=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, then $H(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha \\in\\{\\forall, \\exists\\}^{\\alpha}$ indicates the graph annotated with vertex $i$ labelled by $\\alpha(i)$. For example, $P_{3}(\\exists \\forall \\exists)$ indicates the path on three vertices with the middle vertex being universal while the end vertices are existential. We use, e.g., $\\exists^{3}$ as an abbreviation for $\\exists \\exists \\exists$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 7.1 $\\boldsymbol{H}$ contains some component of size at most 2 \n\nLemma 14.

Note that hardness translates immediately. We will make an argument that the same holds for the positive algorithm (be that in NP or P ).\n\nLet $\\phi$ be an instance of $\\Pi_{k}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ and let $G$ be the 2labelled graph arising from $\\phi$. Let $A$ contain the set of universal vertices $G$ and $C^{E}=\\left\\{C_{1}^{E}, \\ldots, C_{k}^{E}\\right\\}$ be the connected components of $G \\backslash A$. If there is some $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$ such that $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ is a no-instance then $G$ is a no-instance. As there is no path of existential vertices between a pair of vertices $u \\in C_{i}^{E}$ and $v \\in C_{j}^{E}$ where $C_{i}^{E} \\neq C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}, G$ is a yes-instance if, and only if, $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ is a yes-instance for all $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$.\n\nFirst assume $G$ contains some contains some $H^{\\prime}$ but no $H^{\\prime}+P_{2}\\left(\\exists^{2}\\right)$. As $H^{\\prime}$ has a maximum matching of size at most $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\left|H^{\\prime}\\right|+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, every $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$ has a maximum matching of size $k \\leq\\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\left|H^{\\prime}\\right|+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ and there is a set $X=\\left\\{x_{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq k\\right\\}$ such that every edge of $C_{i}^{E}$ has some endpoint in $X$.\n\nWe claim if $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ contains some path of length $8 k+3$ then this is a noinstance. Let $G_{P}$ denote this $P_{8 k+4}$ subgraph and $P=\\left\\{p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}$ denote the vertices of $V(G) \\cap V\\left(G_{P}\\right)$. If $G$ contains some pair of adjacent universal vertices this is a no-instance, that is we assume $A$ is an independent set. This implies that if $G_{P} \\backslash A$ contains $r$ connected components then $P$ contains at most $r+1$ universal vertices.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFig. 5. No instance as described in Lemma 14. The subgraph $G_{P}$ is drawn in bold with existential vertices $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3} \\in P$ each with a pair of universal neighbours in $G_{P}$. The case $a_{1}=a_{3}^{\\prime}$ cannot occur as these vertices are distinct in the path $P$.\n\nIf $G_{P}$ contains some adjacent pair of existential vertices, then at least one of these is in $X$. There are at most $k$ connected components of $G_{P} \\backslash A$ with size at least 2 (one for each vertex in $X$ ). Further, as each vertex of $X \\cap P$, has at most 2 neighbours in $G_{P}$, at most $3 k$ existential vertices in $P$ have some existential neighbour in $G_{P}$. Note all other existential vertices in $P \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}$ have a pair of universal neighbours in $G_{P}$, let $S$ be this set of existential vertices.\n\nFrom above $G_{P} \\backslash\\left(A \\cup\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}\\right)$ contains at most $3 k+|S|$ existential vertices and at most $k+|S|$ connected components and so at most $k+|S|+1$ universal vertices. As $|P|=8 k+4$ it follows that $4 k+2|S|+1 \\geq 8 k+2$ and $|S| \\geq 2 k+1$ (this uses also the fact that $|S|$ is an integer). Every edge of $C_{i}^{E}$ has some endpoint in $X$, so for any $2 k+1$ vertices in $V\\left(C_{i}^{E}\\right) \\backslash X$, at least 3 have a common endpoint in $X$. This implies that there are vertices $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3} \\in S$ such that in $C_{i}^{E}$ these have some common neighbour $x \\in X$.\n\nWe now claim this is a no-instance, in particular we consider the case where $e_{2}$ has distance 2 to both $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ in $G_{P}$. That is there are vertices $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4} \\in$ $A$ such that $\\left(a_{1}, e_{1}, a_{2}, e_{2}, a_{3}, e_{3}, a_{4}\\right)$ is a path in $G_{p}$, see Figure 5. Note our arguments will also hold where $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ are at distance $>2$ in $G_{P}$. If $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ are assigned the colours $1,2,3,1$ then $e_{1}$ must be coloured $3, e_{2}$ coloured 1 and $e_{3}$ coloured 2 . Now $x$ has neighbours coloured $1,2,3$ hence this is a no-instance.\n\nFor every $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}, G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ contains no path of length $8 k+3$ and so can be solved in polynomial time (by bounded treewidth, following from bounded treedepth, from [10]). We may now assume $G$ contains no $H^{\\prime}$ subgraph in which case the complexity follows on that for $H^{\\prime}$-subgraph-free graphs.\n\nLemma 15. Let $H^{\\prime}$ be some 2-labelled graph, if $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is in NP for $H^{\\prime}$-subgraph-free graphs then $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is NPcomplete for $\\left(H^{\\prime}+P_{2}(\\exists \\forall)\\right)$-subgraph-free graphs.\n\nProof. Note that NP-hardness follows immediately from any instance that contains only existential variables.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be an instance of $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ and let $G$ be the 2labelled graph arising from $\\phi$ with universal vertices $A \\subseteq V(G)$. First assume $G$\n\ncontains some $H^{\\prime}$, on the vertices $Z \\subseteq V(G)$, but no $H^{\\prime}+P_{2}(\\exists \\forall)$. Without loss we may remove any isolated vertices and given any adjacent universal vertices results in a no-instance, we assume every universal vertex is adjacent to some existential vertex. Now given $G$ is $H^{\\prime}+P_{2}(\\exists \\forall)$-subgraph-free, $A \\subseteq N[Z]$.\n\nFurther if some existential vertex is adjacent to 3 universal vertices then this is a no-instance, otherwise $|A| \\leq 2\\left|V\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|$. Given $H^{\\prime}$ has constant size we may branch on the possible strategies for $A$ resulting in an arbitrary instance of $\\operatorname{CSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ which is NP-complete. Else where $G$ does not contain some $H^{\\prime}$, the complexity follows that for $H^{\\prime}$-subgraph-free graphs, as $\\Pi_{2^{-}}$ $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is in NP for $H^{\\prime}$-subgraph-free graphs this concludes our proof.\n\nThe results of this section can be subsumed in the following theorem (see also Figure 6).\n\nTheorem 9. Let $H$ be a graph with each vertex labelled as either universal or existential, such that every component has size at most 2. If there is some $k \\geq 0$ such that $H$ is a subgraph of $k P_{2}\\left(\\exists^{2}\\right)$, then $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is in $P$. If $H$ is a supergraph of $P_{2}(\\exists \\forall)$ then $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is $\\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete. Otherwise, $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is NP-complete.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nFig. 6.

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# 7.2 The case $P_{5}\\left(\\exists^{5}\\right)$. \n\nLemma 16. $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is in $P$ for $P_{5}\\left(\\exists^{5}\\right)$-subgraph-free graphs.\nProof. Let $\\phi$ be an instance of $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ and let $G$ be the 2 -labelled graph arising from $\\phi$. Let $A$ contain the set of universal vertices $G$ and $C^{E}=\\left\\{C_{1}^{E}, \\ldots, C_{k}^{E}\\right\\}$ be the connected components of $G \\backslash A$. If there is some $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$ such that $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ is a no-instance then $G$ is a no-instance. Otherwise given there is no path of existential vertices between some $u \\in C_{i}^{E}$ and some $v \\in C_{j}^{E}$ for any $C_{i}^{E} \\neq C_{j}^{E} \\in C^{E}$, this is a yes-instance if, and only if $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ is a yes-instance for every $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$.\n\nWe claim if for some $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}, G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ contains some path of length 19 , then this is a no-instance. Let $G_{P}$ be this $P_{20}$ subgraph of $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ and\n\n$P=\\left\\{p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{20}\\right\\}$ denote the vertices of $V(G) \\cap V\\left(G_{P}\\right)$. Towards this we claim the maximum matching of $C_{i}^{E}$ has size at most 2 . Assume for contradiction, $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right),\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}\\right),\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$ is a matching in $C_{i}^{E}$. Given $C_{i}^{E}$ is connected, there is some path from $x_{1}$ to $y_{1}$. If this path contains some vertex in $V\\left(C_{i}^{E}\\right) \\backslash$ $\\left\\{x_{2}, y_{2}\\right\\}$ there is some $P_{5}\\left(\\exists^{5}\\right)$, that is we assume $x_{1}, y_{1}$ are adjacent. There is also some path between $x_{1}$ and $z_{1}$, likewise this cannot contain some vertex from $V\\left(C_{i}^{E}\\right) \\backslash\\left\\{x_{2}, z_{2}\\right\\}$. If there is an edge from $z_{1}$ (symmetrically $z_{2}$ ) to some vertex in $\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{1}, y_{2}\\right\\}$ then there is some $P_{5}\\left(\\exists^{5}\\right)$, a contradiction.\n\nAs $C_{i}^{E}$ contains a maximum matching of size at most 2 , there are vertices $x, y$ such that every edge of $C_{i}^{E}$ has some endpoint in $\\{x, y\\}$. If $G_{P}$ contains some pair of adjacent existential vertices at least one of these must be $x$ or $y$, it follows that $G_{P} \\backslash A$ contains at most 2 components with size at least 2 . Now, $\\{x, y\\} \\cap P$ has at most 2 neighbours in $G_{P}$. Thus, $P$ contains at most 6 existential vertices with some existential neighbour in $G_{P}$. Note all other existential vertices in $P \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}$ have a pair of universal neighbours in $G_{P}$, let $S$ be this set of existential vertices.\n\nNow $P \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}$ contains at most $|S|+6$ existential vertices and $G_{P} \\backslash$ $\\left(A \\cap\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}\\right)$ contains at most $|S|+2$ connected components. If $G$ contains some pair of adjacent universal vertices this is a no-instance, that is we assume $A$ is an independent set. As $G_{P} \\backslash\\left(A \\cap\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}\\right)$ contains at most $|S|+2$ connected components $P \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}$ contains at most $|S|+3$ universal vertices. Given $\\left|P \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{8 k+4}\\right\\}\\right|=18$, it follows $2|S|+9 \\geq 18$ that is $|S| \\geq 5$. As $C_{i}^{E}$ is connected and every edge has some endpoint in $\\{x, y\\}$, for any 5 vertices in $V\\left(C_{i}^{E}\\right) \\backslash\\{x, y\\}$, at least 3 have a common endpoint in $\\{x, y\\}$. Without loss we may assume that $S$ contains vertices $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ which are all adjacent to $x$ in $C_{i}^{E}$.\n\nFollowing the approach of Lemma 14 we again claim this is a no-instance. Let us again consider the minimal example with respect to number of vertices. That is $e_{2}$ has distance 2 to both $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ in $G_{P}$ and there are vertices $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4} \\in$ $A$ such that $\\left(a_{1}, e_{1}, a_{2}, e_{2}, a_{3}, e_{3}, a_{4}\\right)$ is a path in $G_{p}$, see Figure 5. Again our arguments will also hold where $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$ are at distance $>2$ in $G_{P}$. If $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ are assigned the colours $1,2,3,1$ then $e_{1}$ must be coloured $3, e_{2}$ coloured 1 and $e_{3}$ coloured 2 . Now $x$ has neighbours coloured $1,2,3$ hence this is a no instance.\n\nWe may now assume $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ is $P_{20}$-subgraph-free, implying it has treedepth at most 20. It follows that this can be solved in polynomial time (by bounded treewidth, from [10).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# 7.3 The case $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$. \n\nLemma 17. $\\Pi_{2}$ - $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is NP-complete for $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$-subgraphfree graphs.\n\nProof. Let $\\phi$ be an instance of $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ and let $G$ be the 2 -labelled graph arising from $\\phi$. Let $A$ contain the set of universal vertices $G$ and $C^{E}=\\left\\{C_{1}^{E}, \\ldots, C_{k}^{E}\\right\\}$ be the connected components of $G \\backslash A$. We assume $G$ contains no isolated vertices as without loss these can be removed. Consider some $C_{i}^{E} \\in C^{E}$, if $C_{i}^{E}$ does not contain some path of length 5 then from Lemma 16 we\n\nmay process this component in polynomial time. Say $C_{i}^{E}$ contains some path of length at least 6 , as $G$ is $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$-subgraph-free, $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ contains no universal vertices, and $C_{i}^{E}$ is a connected component of $G$. Else let $P=\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}\\right\\}$ be some $P_{5}$ in $C_{i}^{E}$. If some universal vertex is adjacent to some vertex in $p_{i} \\in P$, then $p_{i}=p_{3}$, else $G$ contains $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$. Say $p_{3}$ has some universal neighbour $a$. If $p_{1}$ has some neighbour $p_{1}^{\\prime} \\neq p_{2} \\in G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ then this results in some $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$, that is $p_{1}$ has degree 1. Symmetrically the same holds for $p_{5}$.\n\nFurther if $p_{2}$ (symmetrically $p_{4}$ ) has some neighbour $x \\in G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ it must be existential and given $\\left(x, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5}\\right)$ is a $P_{5}$, it follows that $x$ has no universal neighbours and every universal vertex in $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ must be adjacent to $x_{3}$. If some vertex has 3 universal neighbours, then this is a no-instance. We therefore assume each vertex has at most 2 universal neighbours and so $G\\left[N\\left[C_{i}^{E}\\right]\\right]$ contains at most 2 universal vertices. Branching on each of these gives an instance of $\\operatorname{CSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ which is polynomial time solvable on $P_{6}$-subgraph-free graphs (by bounded treewidth).\n\nThat is we may assume $G$ contains only existential vertices, as $\\operatorname{CSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\}\\right.$, $\\{1,3\\})$ is NP-complete and contains no $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$-subgraph $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\}\\right.$, $\\{1,3\\})$ is NP-complete for $P_{5}\\left(\\forall \\exists^{4}\\right)$-subgraph-free graphs.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 7.4 $\\boldsymbol{H}$ has size at most 3. \n\nWe sum up the results of this section in the following synoptic theorem where $H$ has size at most 3 (cf. also Figure 7).\n\nTheorem 10. Let $H$ be a graph on at most three vertices with each vertex labelled as either universal or existential. If $H$ is a subgraph of $P_{3}\\left(\\exists^{3}\\right)$, then $\\Pi_{2^{-}}$ $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ is in $P$.

Complexity of $\\Pi_{2}-\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$ when forbidding a labelled graph $H$ of size at most 3 .\n\nThe Edge Disjoint Paths problem takes as input a graph and $k$ terminal pairs $\\left(s_{i}, t_{i}\\right)$. The problem asks if there exists $k$ edge-disjoint (but not necessarily vertex-disjoint) paths connecting each of $\\left(s_{1}, t_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(s_{k}, t_{k}\\right)$. The Edge Disjoint Paths problem is known to be a C23-problem [5]. Consider its variant Long Edge Disjoint Paths whose input is as Edge Disjoint Paths but we require the yes-instances to be paths of length at least $k$.\n\nTheorem 11. Long Edge Disjoint Paths is a C23-problem which is in P on all classes of bounded treedepth.\n\nProof. To prove that it satisfies C2 we reduce from EdGE Disjoint Paths where we first $k$-subdivide each edge (noting $k$ is part of the input of this problem). This ensures that any edge-disjoint paths that connect the terminal pairs are of sufficient length.\n\nThe proof that it satisfies C3 is then exactly the same as that for EdGE Disjoint Paths, except that we should start with instances in the form of the previous paragraph, built from Edge Disjoint Paths by performing a $k$ subdivision at the start. These obtained instances are yes-instances of Long Edge Disjoint Paths if, and only if their subdivisions are yes-instances. Note that if we started from arbitrary instances of Long Edge Disjoint Paths, we might map no-instances to yes-instances after subdivision.\n\nFinally, on classes of bounded treedepth, which do not contain the $m$-vertex path $P_{m}$ as a subgraph for some integer $m$, we may assume that $k \\leq m$. Now a brute force approach to exploring for the paths may be undertaken.\n\nLemma 18. Let $\\mathcal{G}$ be a class of graphs of pathwidth at most $p$. For each $k, \\mathcal{G}^{k}$ has pathwidth at most $p+2$.\n\nProof. Let $G$ be an arbitrary graph in $\\mathcal{G}$ and $B$ be a path decomposition for $G$ such that the largest bag has size at most $p+1$. From this, a path decomposition $B^{\\prime}$ can be constructed for $G^{k}$ such that the largest bag has size at most $p+3$. Every edge $(u, v) \\in G$ is replaced by a path $u, p_{1}, p_{2}, \\cdots, p_{k}, v$ in $G^{k}$. Consider the first bag $b \\in B$ such that $u$ and $v$ appear together, $b$ can be replaced by a path of $k-1$ bags, $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\cdots, b_{k-1}$ in $B^{\\prime}$. Each bag contains all the vertices of $b$, and for each pair of adjacent vertices in the path $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\cdots, p_{k}$ there will be a bag containing both. In particular $b_{i}=b \\cup\\left\\{p_{i}, p_{i+1}\\right\\}$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq k-1$ as $p_{i}$ will\n\nonly be adjacent to $u, v, p_{i-1}, p_{i+1}$ thus making this a valid path decomposition. In addition, where multiple edges first appear in $b$ we can apply this procedure for each path in series.\n\nTheorem 12. Long Edge Disjoint Paths is NP-complete for graphs of bounded pathwidth and so does not satisfy C1.\n\nProof. We use the same trick that we used in the proof of Lemma 11 where we reduce from Edge Disjoint Paths by first $k$-subdividing each edge (recall $k$ is part of the input of this problem). This is now a correct reduction from Edge Disjoint Paths to Long Edge Disjoint Paths.

Moreover, we proved hardness for bounded path-width for $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ and SeQuential 3-Colouring Construction Game. We do not know if the latter two problems satisfy C2 and C3. We leave this for future work.\n\nWe have begun the investigation into QCSP algorithmics under the omission of a labelled graph as a subgraph, which is annotated according to which vertices represent universal and existential variables, respectively. This is a natural framework in which to study QCSPs. We could further have given a relative order for these quantified variables, however we leave this as future work.

One could as well ask this question for $\\Pi_{2}$-QBF. More generally, if we were looking at (unbounded alternation) $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3},\\{1,2\\},\\{1,3\\}\\right)$, our algorithms might need to be more sophisticated.\n\nWe also gave an example of a problem (Long Edge Disjoint Paths) that is a C23-problem that is NP-complete for some class of graphs of bounded pathwidth but becomes polynomial-time solvable on all classes of bounded treedepth. Whether $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ is another such example is an open question. That is, we do not know if $\\operatorname{QCSP}\\left(K_{3}\\right)$ is polynomial-time for graph classes of bounded treedepth. This is another major open problem arising from our work.\n\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to Mark Siggers for discussions around Theorem 2.
