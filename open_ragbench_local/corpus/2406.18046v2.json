Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.\n\n\nKeywords: Time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, quantum mechanics, gauge transformation",

      "text": "## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect considers what shift of phase one would observe if one varies the magnetic flux inside a solenoid time-dependently. So far, no clear experimental evidence of the time-dependent ABphase shift has been found. What's worse, its existence or non-existence has been a subject of unresolved theoretical controversy. The central controversy concerns the validity or failure of the claim by Singleton and his collaborators, who insist that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the phase change generated by the induced electric field due to time-variation of the magnetic field inside the solenoid and that only the AB-phase shift corresponding to the time-independent part of the magnetic field remains [1-3]. On the other hand, there exist not a few literature [4-8], in which they insist that the time-dependent AB-effect does exist and it can in principle be observed. Unfortunately, it is difficult to say that the authors of these papers convincingly succeeded to show exactly where and why the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is not justified, while they insists the existence of the time-dependent AB-effect. The purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap. As faithful as possible to the basic principle of quantum mechanics, i.e. the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a charged particle motion under the presence of magnetic flux of a solenoid combined with more careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, we try to clarify the reason why Singleton et al.'s cancellation argument would not be justified at least in the form as claimed in their papers.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, in sect.II, we briefly review the cancellation argument by Singleton and collaborators [1-3]. In particular, we remind readers of the two covariant expressions of the time-dependent AB-phase shift discussed in their paper. The 1st expression is given in the form of the closed line integral of the 4 -vector potential in the 4 -dimensional Minkowski space, whereas the 2 nd expression is given in the form of the surface integral of the electromagnetic field strength tensor in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The equivalence of the two expressions is taken for granted on the basis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. In view of the fact that Singleton et al's\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * wakamatu@post.kek.jp\n\ncancellation argument is primarily based on the 2 nd covariant expression, we shall proceed in the following way. First, in sect.III, by going back to the basic equation of quantum mechanics, i.e. the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing the motion of a charged particle in the presence of the infinitely-long solenoid with the time-dependent magnetic flux, we try to provide a firm theoretical basis for the 1st covariant expression for the time-dependent AB-phase shift. This confirms that the AB-phase shift is proportional to the closed space-time line integral even in the case where the magnetic flux is changing time-dependently. Next, in sect.IV, we carefully check whether the use of the 2 nd forms of covariant expression really predicts the cancellation between the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift. We show that the careful treatment of the surface integral in this expression partially confirms the cancellation argument by Singleton et al., but nevertheless it does not support the validity of their central conclusion. In sect.V, we argue that the fully satisfactory theoretical prediction of the time-dependent AB-phase shift is a hard theoretical challenge contrary to naive expectation, but anyhow we try to give a reasonable approximate answer to the problem under some suitably prepared experimental setting. Finally, in sect.VI, we briefly summarize our findings in the present paper.",

      "text": "# II. BRIEF REVIEW OF SINGLETON ET AL.'S CANCELLATION ARGUMENT \n\nThe argument by Singleton et al. starts with the observation that, in the familiar setting of the time-independent magnetic flux, the following two forms of covariant expression for the AB-phase shift are equivalent. (This is unquestionably correct, at least in the situation where the 4 -vector potential $A^{\\mu}$ is time-independent, and no electric field is present in the system.)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { (I) lst form : } \\quad \\phi_{A B}=-e \\oint A_{\\mu} d x^{\\mu}=e\\left[-\\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} A^{0} d t+\\oint \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}\\right] \\\\\n& \\text { (II) 2nd form : } \\quad \\phi_{A B}=-\\frac{e}{2} \\int F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}=e\\left[\\int \\boldsymbol{E} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x} d t+\\int \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(In the present paper, we use the natural unit $\\hbar=c=1$, and the mass and the charge of the electron is denoted as $m$ and $-e$ with $e>0$.) Here, $A^{\\mu}=\\left(A^{0}, \\boldsymbol{A}\\right)$ is a 4 -vector potential, whereas $F_{\\mu \\nu} \\equiv \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}$ is the familiar electromagnetic field strength tensor. The electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ are expressed as $E^{i}=F^{i 0}$ and $B^{i}=-\\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon^{i j k} F^{i j}$ in terms of the field strength tensor. Since the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem represented as\n\n$$\n\\oint A_{\\mu} d x^{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{2} \\int F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}\n$$\n\nis believed to be a very general mathematical identity, Singleton et al. assume that it holds also in the case of timevarying magnetic flux. Then, based on the form (II) of the covariant expression, they argued that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase due to the magnetic flux is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field [1, 2].\n\nIn the following, we briefly review the outline of their demonstration. Consider an infinitely-long solenoid of radius $R$ directed to the $z$-direction, through which uniform but time-dependent magnetic flux is penetrating. The corresponding magnetic field distribution is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\nB(t) \\boldsymbol{e}_{z} & (\\rho<R) \\\\\n0 & (\\rho \\geq R)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nHere, the position vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is expressed as $\\boldsymbol{x}=(\\rho, \\phi, z)$ in the cylindrical coordinate with $\\rho=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. The vector potential reproducing the above magnetic field distribution is given by\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{\\rho B(t)}{2} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho<R) \\\\\n\\frac{R^{2} B(t)}{2 \\rho} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho \\geq R)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nNote that one can set $A^{0}=0$ in the present setting of the problem. (See the discussion in the next section.) Then, from $\\boldsymbol{E}=-\\nabla A^{0}-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}}{\\partial t}$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{\\rho \\tilde{B}(t)}{2} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho<R) \\\\\n-\\frac{R^{2} \\tilde{B}(t)}{2 \\rho} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho \\geq R)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwith $\\dot{B}(t) \\equiv \\frac{d B(t)}{d t}$. This $\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ is nothing but the induced electric field due to the time-varying magnetic field. Then, for a closed space-time path encircling the solenoid, they get for the AB-phase shift\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{A B} & =\\frac{e}{\\hbar}\\left[\\int \\boldsymbol{E} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x} d t+\\int \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\int\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x} d t+\\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\oint \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}=-\\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\oint \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}+\\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\oint \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt was interpreted to show that the effect of induced electric field precisely cancels the effect of magnetic vector potential.\n\nTheir argument goes further as follows. From the sourceless Maxwell equation\n\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\n\nwhich holds in the domain $\\rho \\neq R$, i.e. in the region excluding the surface of the solenoid, combined with the relation $\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}=0$ in the same region, it follows the constraint\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\boldsymbol{E}} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\boldsymbol{E}=0\n$$\n\nUsing the explicit form of $\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ given by Eq.(6), this gives\n\n$$\n0=\\dot{\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\begin{cases}-\\frac{\\rho \\dot{B}(t)}{2} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho<R) \\\\ -\\frac{R^{2}}{-2 \\rho} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho>R)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich in turn dictates that $\\ddot{B}(t) \\equiv d^{2} B(t) / d t^{2}=0$ so that $B(t)$ must be a linear function in time,\n\n$$\nB(t)=B_{0}+B_{1} t\n$$\n\n(They stated that more general time-dependence can be considered, for example, by introducing non-uniform magnetic field distribution inside the solenoid [2].) The above form of $B(t)$ dictates that the vector potential generating the above $B(t)$ also consists of the two part as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\boldsymbol{A}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{x})+\\boldsymbol{A}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\nand it gives\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{x})+\\boldsymbol{B}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{x})=B_{0} \\boldsymbol{e}_{z}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{B}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=B_{1} t \\boldsymbol{e}_{z}\n$$\n\nSince $\\boldsymbol{E}=-\\partial \\boldsymbol{A} / \\partial t$, only $\\boldsymbol{A}_{1}$ part induces electric field. Hence, the time-dependent part of the magnetic field, i.e. $\\boldsymbol{B}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ part, to the AB-phase shift, is cancelled by the effect of the induced electric field, so that only the time-independent AB-phase shift by the $\\boldsymbol{A}_{0}$ part remains. This is the central conclusion by Singleton et al.\n\nWe feel that there is a little odd about the above observation. To understand why, let us consider the setting in which the time-dependence of $B(t)$ is given as shown in the Fig.1. That is, suppose that, before the initial time $t=t_{i}=0$, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is kept a constant value given by $B_{i}$. After $t=t_{i}$, the magnetic field is increased linearly with time until it reaches the value $B_{f}$ at the time $t=t_{f}$. After the time $t=t_{f}$, the magnetic field is kept a constant value $B_{f}$. If Singleton et al.'s cancellation argument were correct, one might predict for the AB-phase shift\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{A B}(t<0) & =e \\pi R^{2} B_{i}=e \\Phi_{i} \\\\\n\\phi_{A B}\\left(0<t<t_{f}\\right) & =e \\Phi_{i} ? \\\\\n\\phi_{A B}\\left(t>t_{f}\\right) & =e \\Phi_{f} ? .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 1. A simple example of time-dependent magnetic flux.\n\nThat is, if one measures the AB-phase shift before $t<t_{i}$, it is undoubtedly given by $e \\Phi_{i}=e \\pi R^{2} B_{i}$. What AB-phase shift does one observe between $t_{i}$ and $t_{f}$ ? If Singleton et al.'s argument is correct, the answer would be given by $e \\Phi_{i}$ since the effect of the $B_{1}$ part of $B(t)$ is precisely cancelled by the effect of the induced electric field. A natural next question is what AB-phase shift does one observe after the time $t_{f}$ ? Intuitively, the answer should be given by $e \\Phi_{f}$, since the problem reduces to the standard time-independent AB-effect with the constant magnetic flux $\\Phi_{f}=\\pi R^{2} B_{f}$. However, if this is the case, there must be a sudden jump of the observed AB-phase shift from $e \\Phi_{i}$ to $e \\Phi_{f}$ at the time $t=t_{f}$, which we think is unlikely. It appears to us that this simple thought experiment already indicates internal contradictions of their cancellation argument.\n\nIf Singleton et al.'s prediction were not justified, what would be the reason ? Some time ago, this question was addressed in the paper by Jing et al. [7]. They claim that Singleton et al's conclusion is not justified and argue in somewhat ad hoc manner that the time-dependent AB-effect can be explained by the effective Hamiltonian of the following form,\n\n$$\nH=\\frac{1}{2 m}[\\boldsymbol{p}+e \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)]^{2}+e \\int_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}^{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{A}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t\\right)}{\\partial t} \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhich contains in it a path-dependent line-integral term. Based on this effective Hamiltonian, they conclude that the AB-phase shift corresponding to time-dependent magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=\\oint \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}=\\int \\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}=e \\Phi(t)\n$$\n\nHowever, their analysis is still lacking a convincing explanation about where and how the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is not justified. To our belief, more orthodox way to answer the above question is to go back to the basic equation of quantum mechanics, i.e. the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of a charged particle under the presence of time-dependent magnetic flux of the solenoid as faithful as possible to the basic principle of quantum mechanics. (We emphasize that a wave function in quantum mechanics is a complex number, which necessarily contains the information of phase, which is essential in the physics of the AB-phase.) This analysis will be performed in the next section.",

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF THE TIME-DEPENDENT AB-PHASE SHIFT \n\nThe basic lagrangian describing the motion of the electron under the influence of the external electromagnetic potential is given by\n\n$$\nL=\\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{2}+e\\left[A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)-\\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $A^{\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\left(A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t), \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right)$ represents the 4 -vector potential generated by externally given charge and current densities. The equation of motion for the electron derived from the above Lagrangian is given by\n\n$$\nm \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{x}}=-e[\\boldsymbol{E}+\\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}]\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E}=-\\nabla A^{0}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\boldsymbol{A}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{B}=\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electron is given by\n\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi=\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 m}(\\nabla+i e \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t))^{2}-e A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right] \\psi\n$$\n\nIf we carry out the gauge transformation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{\\mu}(x) & \\rightarrow A_{\\mu}^{\\prime}(x)=A_{\\mu}(x)-\\partial_{\\mu} \\chi(x) \\\\\n\\psi(x) & \\rightarrow \\psi^{\\prime}(x)=e^{-i e \\chi(x)} \\psi(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe new electron wave function $\\psi^{\\prime}(x)$ is shown to obey the following Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi^{\\prime}=\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 m}\\left(\\nabla+i e \\boldsymbol{A}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right)^{2}-e A^{\\prime 0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right] \\psi^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nInterestingly, we can formally eliminate the vector potential by making use of a gauge transformation. In fact, let us define the new electron wave function $\\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ by\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\equiv e^{i e \\Lambda(x)} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\Lambda(x)=-\\int_{x_{0}^{\\mu}}^{x^{\\mu}} A_{\\mu}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) d x^{\\prime \\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere, $x_{0}^{\\mu}$ is supposed to represent some fixed reference point in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Here we must keep in mind the fact that the line-integral for defining the function $\\Lambda(x)$ generally depends on the choice of the space-time path $C$ connecting $x_{0}^{\\mu}$ and $x^{\\mu}$. Here, by using\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla \\Lambda(x) & =\\nabla \\int_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}}^{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\boldsymbol{A}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t\\right) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}=\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Lambda(x) & =-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} A^{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, t^{\\prime}\\right) d t^{\\prime}=-A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nit can be shown that $\\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ satisfies the following free Schr\u00f6dinger eq.\n\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=-\\frac{1}{2 m} \\nabla^{2} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\nA critically important point is that, in an appropriately chosen simply-connected space-time region corresponding to our problem, the gauge function $\\Lambda(x)$ can be defined as a unique function of space-time coordinate $x^{\\mu}$, that is, independently on the space-time path $C$ connecting $x_{0}^{\\mu}$ and $x^{\\mu}$. (A simply-connected region here means the spacetime region, which never contains the solenoid in it. The above-mentioned property is vitally important for that the whole argument in the present paper is meaningful. Since its proof needs very careful consideration, we discuss it in Appendix A.)\n\nTo sum up, for a simply connected space-time region which we can choose in our problem, the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\n$$\ni \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi=\\left[-\\frac{1}{2 m}(\\nabla+i e \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t))^{2}-e A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\\right] \\psi\n$$\n\ncan be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=e^{i e \\Lambda(x)} \\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 2. Two paths $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ in the Minkowski space, which start from the space-time point $P\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, t_{i}\\right)$ and ends at $Q\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}, t_{f}\\right)$.\nwith\n\n$$\n\\Lambda(x)=-\\int_{x_{0}^{0}}^{x^{\\mu}} A_{\\mu}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) d x^{\\prime \\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ is a solution of free Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nThis implies that the phase change of the electron wave function along the path $C_{1}$ (from space-time point $P$ to $Q)$ illustrated in Fig. 2 is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi_{A B}\\left(C_{1}\\right)=-\\int_{C_{1}} A_{\\mu}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) d x^{\\prime \\mu}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the phase change along the path $C_{2}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi_{A B}\\left(C_{2}\\right)=-\\int_{C_{2}} A_{\\mu}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) d x^{\\prime \\mu}\n$$\n\nIn view of the ambiguity of the vector potential, one may consider the freedom of further gauge transformation\n\n$$\nA_{\\mu}(x) \\rightarrow A_{\\mu}^{\\prime}(x)=A_{\\mu}(x)-\\partial_{\\mu} \\chi(x)\n$$\n\nwith $\\chi(x)$ being an arbitrary scalar function.

Note that the electromagnetic fields appearing in this equation are generated according to the Maxwell equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu} F^{\\mu \\nu}=j^{\\nu}\n$$\n\nwhere $j^{\\nu}(x)$ is the external source current provided by the solenoid. In terms of the vector potential, the above Maxwell equation can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\square A^{\\nu}-\\partial^{\\nu}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu} A^{\\mu}\\right)=j^{\\nu}\n$$\n\nAs is widely known, the vector potential has gauge ambiguity. In our time-dependent problem, it is most convenient to start with the choice of the Lorenz gauge :\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\mu} A^{\\mu}=0\n$$\n\nIn the Lorenz gauge, the 4 -vector potential satisfies a very simple equation\n\n$$\n\\square A^{\\nu}=j^{\\nu}\n$$\n\nIts solution is well-known and given in the form\n\n$$\nA^{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{j^{\\nu}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t_{R}\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{R} \\equiv t-\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right| / c$ is the so-called retardation time. (Although we use the natural unit, we retain the speed of light $c$ only in this expression in order to emphasize the retardation time is controlled by the light speed $c$.) To be more precise, even after Lorenz gauge fixing, there is a freedom of residual gauge transformation represented as\n\n$$\nA^{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{j^{\\nu}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t_{R}\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}+\\partial^{\\nu} \\chi\n$$\n\nWe say it the residual gauge transformation, because the Lorenz gauge condition $\\partial_{\\mu} A^{\\mu}=0$ is retained as long as the gauge function $\\chi$ is chosen to satisfy the condition :\n\n$$\n\\square \\chi=0\n$$\n\nNote however that, since the external gauge potential $A^{\\nu}$ can be treated as classical field in the present problem, we do not need to confine to such a residual gauge transformation in the Lorenz gauge. By allowing any choice of $\\chi$, the vector potential in arbitrary gauge can be expressed in the form given by Eq.(47). In fact, in classical gauge theory, the explicit form of gauge transformation from Lorenz to Coulomb and other gauges are known [12]. (One might suspect that the situation might change drastically, if one allows multi-valued gauge transformations [15]. In fact, in the case of the standard time-independent AB-effect, there were controversial dispute about the existence of the AB -effect itself. At the end, however, it turned out that the physics does not change at all even by multi-valued gauge transformations [14, 16-18]. Here, we take it for granted that it would be also true for the time-dependent AB-effect, thereby confining to regular or single-valued gauge transformations.)\n\nIn any case, from the argument above, we conclude that, in any single-valued gauge, the AB-phase shift for a closed space-time path can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=-e \\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} A_{\\mu}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) d x^{\\prime \\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nA^{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{j^{\\nu}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t_{R}\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}+\\partial^{\\nu} \\chi\n$$\n\nwith $t_{R} \\equiv t-\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right| / c$. If the motion of charged particle is non-relativistic, we can neglect the difference between $t_{R}$ and $t$, so that we get\n\n$$\nA^{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\simeq \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{j^{\\nu}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}+\\partial^{\\nu} \\chi\n$$\n\nOr, in the 3 -vector notation with $j^{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=(\\rho(\\boldsymbol{x}, t), \\boldsymbol{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t))$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) & \\simeq \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{\\rho\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\chi(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) & \\simeq \\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{\\boldsymbol{j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}, t\\right)}{\\left|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\prime}\\right|} d^{3} x^{\\prime}-\\nabla \\chi(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we consider our concrete setting of infinitely-long solenoid with radius $R$. The charge and current densities of such a solenoid are given by $[13,14]$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\rho(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=0 \\\\\n& \\boldsymbol{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\Phi(t) \\delta(\\rho-R) \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} \\quad\\left(\\rho=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis gives\n\n$$\nA^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=0, \\quad \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)=\\boldsymbol{A}^{(S)}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}^{(S)}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\rho \\Phi(t)}{2 \\pi R^{2}} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho<R) \\\\ \\frac{\\Phi(t)}{2 \\pi \\rho} \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\phi} & (\\rho \\geq R)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAs we have already discussed, as long as we confine to regular or single-valued gauge transformations, the AB-phase shift for a closed path is not affected by the arbitrariness of the gauge function $\\chi$. The prediction for the AB-phase shift is therefore given by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=-e\\left[\\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} A^{0}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) d t-\\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}\\right]=e \\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}\n$$\n\nIt seems that everything is going right so far. From this last expression, several authors proceed as follows. (See the paper [7] by Jing et al., for example.) Namely, they naively assume that the Stokes theorem of the following 3-dimensional form holds :\n\n$$\n\\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{x}=\\int(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}=\\int \\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}\n$$\n\nIf it were correct, it would give the following prediction for the time-dependent AB-phase shift,\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=e \\int \\boldsymbol{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t) \\cdot d \\boldsymbol{S}=e \\Phi(t) ?\n$$\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, we realize that the above manipulation is not actually justified if the vector potential $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is time-dependent. The reason is because, on the space-time curves $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, spatial coordinate variable $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and the time variable $t$ cannot be treated as independent integration variables. To understand this subtlety, we find it mandatory to reanalyze the 4 -dimensional Stokes theorem by paying the greatest care. Besides, an important byproduct of this study is more transparent understanding about the validity or invalidity of the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. between the time-dependent magnetic field and the induced electric field.",

      "text": "# IV. ON THE TREATMENT BASED ON THE 4-DIMENSIONAL STOKES THEOREM \n\nThe 4-dimensional Stokes theorem was already written down in (3). However, to understand more precise meaning of this important theorem, it is better to express it in more accurate form as follows :\n\n$$\n\\oint_{C_{1}-C_{2}} A_{\\mu}(x) d x^{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{2} \\iint_{S\\left(C_{1}-C_{2}\\right)} F_{\\mu \\nu}(x) d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}\n$$\n\nHere, the l.h.s of the above equation represents the line-integral of the 4 -vector potential $A_{\\mu}(x)$ along the closed spacetime path $C_{1}-C_{2}$ as illustrated in Fig. 2. On the other hand, the r.h.s. represents the integral of the field-strength tensor $F_{\\mu \\nu}(x)$ over the 2-dimensional surface $S$, the boundary of which is specified by the closed path $C_{1}-C_{2}$ in the Minkowski space.\n\nTo correctly understand the meaning of the equality (60), we consider our concrete situation in which the infinitelylong solenoid with the radius $R$ directed to the $z$-axis is placed at the origin of $x y$-plane, and the space-time path $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ connecting the two space-time points $\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, t_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{f}, t_{f}\\right)$ are parametrized as follows. Namely, suppose that the path $C_{1}$ is given by a circular arc with radius $\\rho_{0}(>R)$ around the coordinate origin, which is taken to be the center of the solenoid. Then, the space-time points on the path $C_{1}\\left(t_{i} \\rightarrow t_{f}\\right)$ can be parametrized as\n\n$$\n\\left(t(\\phi), x(\\phi), y(\\phi), z(\\phi)\\right)=\\left(f(\\phi), \\rho_{0} \\cos \\phi, \\rho_{0} \\sin \\phi, 0\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{i} \\leq \\phi \\leq \\phi_{f}$ with $\\phi_{i} \\equiv \\phi\\left(t_{i}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{f} \\equiv \\phi\\left(t_{f}\\right)$. Here, it is assumed that $\\rho_{0}$ is larger than the radius $R$ of the solenoid. Similarly, the space-time points on the path $-C_{2}\\left(t_{f} \\rightarrow t_{i}\\right)$ are parametrized as\n\n$$\n\\left(t(\\phi), x(\\phi), y(\\phi), z(\\phi)\\right)=\\left(g(\\phi), \\rho_{0} \\cos \\phi, \\rho_{0} \\sin \\phi, 0\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{f} \\leq \\phi \\leq \\phi_{i}+2 \\pi$ with $\\phi_{f} \\equiv \\phi\\left(t_{f}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{i} \\equiv \\phi\\left(t_{i}\\right)$. In the above parametrizations, the functions $f(\\phi)$ and $g(\\phi)$ are supposed to satisfy the conditions\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\phi_{i}\\right)=t_{i}, \\quad f\\left(\\phi_{f}\\right)=t_{f}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ng\\left(\\phi_{f}\\right)=t_{f}, \\quad g\\left(\\phi_{i}+2 \\pi\\right)=t_{i}\n$$\n\nWe also need to parametrize the space-time points on the 2-dimensional surface $S$ surrounded by $C_{1}-C_{2}$. We choose to take as\n\n$$\nt(\\rho, \\phi)= \\begin{cases}F(\\rho) f(\\phi) & \\left(\\phi_{i} \\leq \\phi \\leq \\phi_{f}\\right) \\\\ G(\\rho) g(\\phi) & \\left(\\phi_{f} \\leq \\phi \\leq \\phi_{i}+2 \\pi\\right)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx(\\rho, \\phi)=\\rho \\cos \\phi, \\quad y(\\rho, \\phi)=\\rho \\sin \\phi, \\quad z(\\rho, \\phi)=0\n$$\n\nwith $\\phi_{i} \\leq \\phi \\leq \\phi_{i}+2 \\pi$. Here, $F(\\rho)$ and $G(\\rho)$ with $0 \\leq \\rho \\leq \\rho_{0}$ are any functions for parametrizing points on the 2-dimensional surface surrounded by the boundary $C_{1}-C_{2}$, where $C_{1}$ and $-C_{2}$ are respectively specified by Eq.(61) and Eq.(62).

Note that the l.h.s of the above identity is given as a 2-dimensional area integral, while the r.h.s. is given as a 1-dimensional closed-line integral. This already implies that, for the identity to hold, the 2-dimensional surface integral part of the l.h.s. must be cancelled out in some way. In fact, we have shown that such a cancellation occurs between the contributions from the induced electric field and the magnetic field. On might then tempted to think that this observation might support the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. However, one must remember the fact that, in the analyses by Singleton et al., this cancellation is claimed to happen only between the time-dependent part of the magnetic field and the induced electric field. Accordingly, they claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contribute to the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift even in the situation where the magnetic field varies time-dependently, which amounts to claiming the absence of the timedependent AB-effect. This conclusion is not correct, however. Although the cancellation between the contributions of the magnetic field and the induced electric field to the surface integral certainly happens, what remains after this cancellation is the closed space-time line integral of the 4 -vector potential. As shown in the subsequent sections, this closed line integral is most likely to generate non-trivial time-dependence to observable AB-phase shift.",

Then, following a similar analysis in the previous section, we can show that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{C_{1}} A_{\\mu} d x^{\\mu} & =-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}} d \\phi B(f(\\phi)) \\\\\n\\int_{C_{2}} A_{\\mu} d x^{\\mu} & =-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}-2 \\pi} d \\phi B(g(\\phi))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOne should clearly understand the precise meaning of the above formulas, which unambigously shows that, on the space-time paths $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, the variable $t$ and $\\phi$ cannot be treated as independent integration variables. As we shall see below, this turns out to be vitally important in the proper treatment of the time-dependent AB-effect.\n\nAlthough it may not be so easy to recognize, highly nontrivial effects of induced electric field is mixed in with the above expressions of the line-integral of the 4 -vector potential. In fact, in the case where the magnetic flux inside the solenoid is time-dependent, non-zero electric field is generated even outside the solenoid, and this induced electric field outside the solenoid is thought to affect the motion of the charged particle. As a warm-up to handling this fairly subtle nature of the problem, we think it instructive to begin the analysis with much simpler case of the familiar time-independent AB-effect. Since no electromagnetic force acts on the charged particle moving outside the solenoid in this case, one may simply assume that the charged particle makes a rotational motion around the origin with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. The simplest parametrization of the function $f(\\phi)$ on the path $C_{1}$ is therefore given by (Here, we set the initial time $t_{i}$ to be zero, for simplicity.)\n\n$$\nt \\equiv f(\\phi)=\\frac{\\phi}{\\omega} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\phi=\\omega t\n$$\n\nwith $f\\left(\\phi_{i}\\right)=t_{i} \\equiv 0, \\phi_{i}=0$ and $f\\left(\\phi_{f}\\right)=t_{f}, \\phi_{f}=\\pi$, which dictates that $t_{f}=\\pi / \\omega$. Since the magnetic flux here is time-independent, i.e. $B(t)=B_{0}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}} d \\phi B(f(\\phi))=\\int_{0}^{t_{f}} \\omega d t B_{0}=\\omega B_{0} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / \\omega} d t=\\pi B_{0}\n$$\n\nwhich is independent of $\\omega$. Similarly, the simplest parametrization of $g(\\phi)$ on $C_{2}$ is given by\n\n$$\nt \\equiv g(\\phi)=-\\frac{\\phi}{\\omega} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\phi=-\\omega t\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\ng\\left(\\phi_{i}\\right)=t_{i}=0, \\phi_{i}=0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ng\\left(\\phi_{f}-2 \\pi\\right)=t_{f}, \\phi_{f}-2 \\pi=-\\pi\n$$\n\nwhich also means that $t_{f}=\\pi / \\omega$. Then, for $B(t)=B_{0}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}-2 \\pi} d \\phi B(g(\\phi))=\\int_{0}^{-\\pi} d \\phi B_{0}=B_{0} \\int_{0}^{t_{f}}(-\\omega) d t=-\\pi B_{0}\n$$\n\nUsing the above results, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=-e\\left\\{-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\pi B_{0}-\\left(+\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\pi B_{0}\\right)\\right\\}=e \\pi R^{2} B_{0}=e \\Phi_{0}\n$$\n\nThis precisely reproduces the familiar AB-phase shift in the case of time-independent magnetic flux.\nAfter the above warming-up exercise, we turn to the time-varying magnetic flux case which is of our real concern. Main difficulty in this case is that the angular velocity of the charged particle cannot be regarded as a constant anymore. This is because the angular velocity of the charge particle is changed by the force due to the induced electric field, which exerts along the circumferential direction. This makes the theoretical treatment of the timedependent AB-effect quite complicated. At present, we do not have completely satisfactory solution to this difficult problem. In the following, we therefore consider two simple cases in which we can treat it at least within a reasonable approximation. The first is the case in which the change of the time-dependent magnetic flux is very slow so that the change of the angular velocity of the charge particle is negligibly small within the time interval between $t_{i}=0$ and $t_{f}$. Another is the case in which the magnetic flux is rapidly and sinusoidally oscillating. If the time-period of this sinusoidal oscillation is much shorter than the time interval between $t_{i}=0$ and $t_{f}$, the charged particle feels oscillating Lorentz force along the path due to the induced electric field. This implies that, on the average, the angular velocity of the charged particle can approximately be treated as a time-independent constant. Under these circumstances, we may be able to proceed as follows. That is, the only difference from the above-explained treatment with the time-independent magnetic flux is that the magnetic field $B(t)$ is time-dependent. Then, the 1st integral on the r.h.s. of Eq.(111) can be evaluated as\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}} d \\phi B(f(\\phi))=\\int_{0}^{\\pi / \\omega} \\omega d t B(t)=\\omega \\int_{0}^{t_{f}} d t B(t)=\\omega \\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)=\\pi \\frac{\\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}\n$$\n\nwhere we have introduced an auxiliary function $\\bar{B}(t)$ by\n\n$$\n\\bar{B}(t) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t} d t^{\\prime} B\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nand also used the relation $t_{f}=\\pi / \\omega$.\nSimilarly, the 2nd integral on the r.h.s. of Eq.(111) are evaluated as follows. As a convenient parametrization of $C_{2}$ and $g(\\phi)$, we choose\n\n$$\nt=g(\\phi)=-\\frac{\\phi}{\\omega}, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\phi=-\\omega t\n$$\n\nwith $g\\left(\\phi_{i}\\right)=t_{i}=0, \\phi_{i}=0$ and $g\\left(\\phi_{f}-2 \\pi\\right)=t_{f}, \\phi_{f}-2 \\pi=-\\pi$, which dictates that $t_{f}=\\pi / \\omega$. We thus obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{C_{2}} d \\phi B(g(\\phi))=\\int_{0}^{t_{f}}(-\\omega d t) B(t)=-\\omega \\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)=-\\pi \\frac{\\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}\n$$\n\nIn this way, we eventually get\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=e \\frac{R^{2}}{2}\\left\\{\\pi \\frac{\\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}-(-\\pi) \\frac{\\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}\\right\\}=e \\pi R^{2} \\frac{\\bar{B}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}\n$$\n\nUsing the total magnetic flux $\\Phi(t) \\equiv \\pi R^{2} B(t)$ inside the solenoid, this answer can also be expressed in the form\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=e \\frac{\\bar{\\Phi}\\left(t_{f}\\right)}{t_{f}}\n$$\n\nwith the definition\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Phi}(t) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t} d t^{\\prime} \\Phi\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs a minimal consistency check, let us consider the limit, in which the magnetic flux is time-independent, i.e. $\\Phi(t)=$ $\\Phi_{0}$. In this case, we get\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Phi}\\left(t_{f}\\right)=\\int_{0}^{t_{f}} \\Phi_{0} d t=\\Phi_{0} t_{f}\n$$\n\nwhich legitimately reproduces the familiar expression of the time-independent AB-phase shift, since\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=e \\frac{\\Phi_{0} t_{f}}{t_{f}}=e \\Phi_{0}\n$$\n\nPractically more interesting is the case where the magnetic flux is rapidly and sinusoidally oscillating as considered in the paper by Lee et al. [4]. (It can in principle be generated by oscillating electric current flowing on the surface of a very long solenoid.) For example, suppose that $\\Phi(t)$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi(t)=\\Phi_{0} \\cos \\Omega t\n$$\n\nIn this case, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Phi}\\left(t_{f}\\right)=\\Phi_{0} \\frac{\\sin \\Omega t_{f}}{\\Omega}\n$$\n\nwhich in turn gives\n\n$$\n\\phi_{A B}=e \\Phi_{0} \\frac{\\sin \\Omega t_{f}}{\\Omega t_{f}}\n$$\n\nThis clearly shows that, contrary to the claim by Singleton et al., the time-dependent AB-effect is most likely to exist as claimed by many researchers [4-8], although there are diversities in their theoretical treatments as well as predictions.",

      "text": "# VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nWe have investigated anew the controversy over the time-dependent AB effect. The central objective of our study is to verify the validity of the claim that the effect of time-dependent magnetic vector potential to the AB-phase shift is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect. For that purpose, we go back to basics of quantum mechanics and move forward step by step. First, we carefully analyze the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the electron under the influence of the time-dependent magnetic field confined inside the solenoid. We have then confirmed that this analysis provides a firm theoretical foundation to the 1st covariant expression of the time-dependent AB-phase shift, which is given as a closed line integral of the vector potential in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Next, since the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the closed line integral of the 4 -vector potential is also expressed as a surface integral of the electromagnetic field strength tensor, we carefully re-investigated the derivation of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem in line with our specific setting of infinitely-long solenoid with time-dependent magnetic flux. Through the explicit calculation of the surface integral of the field strength tensor, we have certainly confirmed that a sort of cancellation occurs between the magnetic and induced electric field contributions to the surface integral. However, what remains after this cancellation is the closed line-integral of the 4 -vector potential in the Minkowski space, which is nothing but what is meant by the 4 -dimensional Stokes theorem. We have thus confirmed once again that the time-dependent AB-phase shift is given as the closed space-time line integral of the 4 -vector potential.\n\nUnfortunately, we realize that exact or completely satisfactory evaluation of this closed line integral is a highly nontrivial task. In some previous literature [7], the evaluation of this closed line integral is carried out by following the logic from Eq.(57) to Eq.(59), especially relying upon Eq.(58) in the present paper, which amounts to naively assuming that the Stokes theorem in the 3-dimensional form can be applied here. This manipulation is justified if the vector potential $\\boldsymbol{A}$ contained in Eq.(58) is time-independent, but we found that it is not justified in the case the vector potential $\\boldsymbol{A}$ is time-dependent. Consequently, the prediction for the time-dependent AB-phase shift given by Eq.(59) is not correct as was suspected there. The point is that $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ appearing in Eq.(57) is a space-time paths in the Minkowski space. This means that the spatial variable $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and time variable $t$ cannot be regarded as totally independent integration variables within the line integrals $\\int_{C_{1}} A_{\\mu}(x) d x^{\\mu}$ and $\\int_{C_{2}} A_{\\mu}(x) d x^{\\mu}$. As discussed in sect V, what makes evaluation of this integral difficult is the presence of the induced electric field, which exists even outside of the solenoid. This induced electric field exerts Lorenz force on the charged particle, thereby changing its velocity and/or angular velocity. There are two cases in which at least approximate evaluation of the space-time line-integral is possible. The first is the case in which the time-dependence of the magnetic field inside the solenoid is weak enough so that the effect of the induced electric field outside the solenoid is very small. In such a circumstance, the change of the electrons velocity and/or the angular velocity during the time interval in which the charged particle passes around the solenoid is negligible. Practically more interesting would be the case in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid is rapidly and sinusoidally oscillating. If the time-period of this sinusoidal oscillation is much shorter than the time scale in which the charged particle passes around the solenoid, the charged particle would feel oscillating or alternating Lorenz force along the path. Then, on the average, the velocity or angular velocity of the charged particle may approximately be treated as a time-independent constant. Under these circumstances, we can give explicit theoretical prediction, which at the least definitely confirms the existence of the time-dependent AB-effect. A real remaining question is how to experimentally confirm the existence of the time-dependent AB-effect. We conjecture that the simplest but most likely experiments would be the following. Suppose that we change the magnetic field inside the solenoid rapidly and sinusoidally, while continuously providing the charged particle beam directed to the double-slit panel. If our theoretical prediction is meaningful, the rapid change or oscillation of the interference pattern on the screen is expected to be seen. Undoubtedly, this kind of experiment would be feasible even for more realistic setting by using a troidal coil as adopted by Tonomura et al.'s experiment [19].",

For simplicity, we assume that this closed path is given in the form depicted in Fig.3. The path $C_{1}$ is a circular arc with radius $\\rho_{0}(>R)$ with the initial and final azimuthal angles respectively given by $\\phi_{i}$ and $\\phi_{f}$. On the other hand, the path $-C_{2}$ is given as a sum of three paths. The 1 st is the straight-line path that starts from $\\rho=\\rho_{0}$ and ends at $\\rho=\\rho_{1}\\left(R<\\rho_{1}<\\rho_{0}\\right)$ while keeping the angle $\\phi$ to $\\phi_{f}$. The 2 nd is the circular arc with radius $\\rho_{1}$ with the initial and final azimuthal angles respectively given by $\\phi_{f}$ and $\\phi_{i}$. The 3 rd is the straight-line path that starts from $\\rho=\\rho_{1}$ and ends at $\\rho=\\rho_{0}$ while keeping the angle $\\phi$ to $\\phi_{i}$.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 3. A closed loop $C_{1}-C_{2}$ in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space, which does not encircle the solenoid.\n\nWe first evaluate the contribution of the magnetic field to the surface integral. Proceeding in the same way as in sect.IV, we generally have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}\\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { magnetic }= \\\\\n& \\text { magnetic }\n\\end{aligned}=F_{x y} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}=F_{x y} \\rho d \\rho \\wedge d \\phi\\right.\n$$\n\nNote however that, in the region surrounded by the space-time $C_{1}-C_{2}$, it holds that\n\n$$\nF_{x y}=0 \\text { for } R<\\rho_{1}<\\rho<\\rho_{0}\n$$\n\nThis means that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}\\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { magnetic }= \\\\\n& \\text { magnetic }\n\\end{aligned}=0\\right.\n$$\n\nIt seems to be consistent with the intuition, since the magnetic flux of the solenoid is not included inside the closed space-time curve $C_{1}-C_{2}$.\n\nA little more nontrivial is the contribution of the induced electric field, which extends even outside the solenoid. In the expression\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}=F_{0 x} d t \\wedge d x+F_{0 y} d t \\wedge d y+F_{0 z} d t \\wedge d z\n\\end{aligned}\\right.\n$$\n\nwe use the fact that, for $R<\\rho_{1}<\\rho<\\rho_{0}$, it holds that\n\n$$\nF_{0 x}=\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\tilde{B}(t) \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\sin \\phi, F_{0 y}=-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\tilde{B}(t) \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\cos \\phi, F_{0 z}=0\n$$\n\nWe thus find that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}(\\rho, \\phi)}{\\partial \\rho} d \\rho \\wedge d \\phi\n\\end{aligned}\\right.\n$$\n\nHere, $\\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}(\\rho, \\phi)$ is an auxiliary function defined in (81). In this way, the contribution of the induced electric field to the surface integral turns out to be\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu}= \\\\\n& \\text { electric }=\\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}} d \\phi \\int_{\\rho_{1}}^{\\rho_{0}} d \\rho\\left(-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}(\\rho, \\phi)}{\\partial \\rho}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\int_{\\phi_{i}}^{\\phi_{f}} d \\phi\\left(-\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right)+\\frac{R^{2}}{2} \\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIncidentally, from the requirement that the point $\\left(t\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right), x\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right), y\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right), z\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right)\\right.$ lie on the curve $C_{1}$, we have $F\\left(\\rho_{0}\\right)=1$. Similarly, from the requirement that the point $\\left(t\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right), x\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right), y\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right), z\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right)\\right.$ lie on the curve $-C_{2}$, we have $F\\left(\\rho_{1}\\right)=1$. This dictates that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\phi\\right) & =B\\left(F\\left(\\rho_{0}\\right) f(\\phi)\\right)=B(f(\\phi)) \\\\\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{B}}\\left(\\rho_{1}, \\phi\\right) & =B\\left(F\\left(\\rho_{1}\\right) f(\\phi)\\right)=B(f(\\phi))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, we eventually get\n\n$$\n\\iint_{S\\left(C_{1}-C_{2}\\right)} \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu \\nu} d x^{\\mu} \\wedge d x^{\\nu} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial} f(\\phi))+\\frac{R^{2}}{2} B(f(\\phi))}{\\partial}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nIn this way, we find that\n\n$$\n\\Lambda\\left(x ; C_{1}\\right)-\\Lambda\\left(x ; C_{2}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nwhich proves the path-independence of the gauge function $\\Lambda(x)$ defined by Eq.(28) if the closed path does not encircle the solenoid. This in turn implies that the line-integral connecting the two space-time points is invariant under continuous deformation of the path connecting these two points as long as the curve does not cross the solenoid in the process of deformation. It appears to be a natural generalization of the infinitely-long solenoid problem with time-independent magnetic flux to more general case of time-varying magnetic flux. Alternatively, we may be able to say that the topological nature of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift survives even in the case of time-varying magnetic flux.\n[1] D. Singleton and E.C.

  "abstract": "The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which\nthe magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from\nthe standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to\nsolve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of\nunsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that\nits theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector\npotential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the\n4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential\ncan be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the\n2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned\nclosed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the\nclaim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem,\nwhich states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the\nmagnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced\nelectric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the\npresent paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back\nto the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under\nthe presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined\nwith more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful\nanalysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation\nargument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that\nonly the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the\nAB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified,\nthereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.",
