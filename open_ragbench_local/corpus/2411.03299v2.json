In this paper, we give the first general treatment of privacy against adaptive adversaries for mechanisms that support dataset updates and a variety of queries, all arbitrarily interleaved.

      "text": "# 1. INTRODUCTION \n\nDifferential privacy [6] is the now-standard framework for protecting privacy when performing statistical analysis or machine learning on sensitive datasets about individuals. In addition to having a rich and rapidly growing scientific literature, differential privacy has also seen large-scale adoption by technology companies and government agencies.\n\nThe familiar formulation of differential privacy is for a noninteractive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$, which takes a dataset $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and produces a statistical release (e.g. a collection of statistics or the parameters of a machine learning model) $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$. Differential privacy requires that every two datasets $x$ and $x^{\\prime}$ that \"differ on one individual's data,\" the output distributions $\\mathcal{M}(x)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$ are \"close\" to each other. Formally, we have a neighboring relation $\\sim$ on $\\mathcal{X}$, which specifies which datasets \"differ on one individual's data,\" or more generally what information requires privacy protection. We say that $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ - $D P$ with respect to $\\sim$ if for all $x \\sim x^{\\prime}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\forall S \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y} \\quad \\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{M}(x) \\in S] \\leq e^{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{M}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\in S\\right]+\\delta\n$$\n\nTypically we think of $\\epsilon$ as a small constant, e.g. $\\epsilon=.1$, while $\\delta$ is cryptographically negligible. The case that $\\delta=0$ is referred to as pure differential privacy, and otherwise Inequality 1 is known as approximate differential privacy. This simple definition is very useful and easy to work with, but does not capture many scenarios in which we want to apply differential privacy.\n1.1. Differential Privacy Over Time. Many intended uses of differential privacy involve a system that is set up to run continuously over a long period of time, making more statistical releases as either queries come in or the dataset is updated, for example with people leaving and entering. (The latter case, with dataset updates, is known as differential privacy under continual observation, and was introduced in the concurrent works of Dwork, Naor, Pitassi, and Rothblum [7] and Chan, Shi, and Song [2].) These settings introduce a new attack surface, where an adversary may be adaptive, issuing queries or influencing dataset updates based on the responses it receives.\n\nWhen $\\delta>0$, there are mechanisms that are differentially private against oblivious adversaries but not against adaptive ones. ${ }^{1}$ One natural example is the \"advanced composition theorem\" for differentially privacy [9], which is known to fail if the adversary can select the privacy-loss parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ of the composed mechanisms adaptively [19].\n\nUntil recently, adaptivity has been treated in an ad hoc manner in the differential privacy literature. For example, the aforementioned advanced composition theorem of [9] was formalized in a way that allows an adversary to adaptively choose the mechanisms and pairs of adjacent datasets, just not the privacy-loss parameters, and new composition theorems that allow for adaptive choices of privacy-loss parameters were given by [19]. Other early examples where adaptive queries were analyzed include the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) [8, 11, 17] and the Private Multiplicative Weights algorithm [11].\n\nA few years ago, Vadhan and Wang [20] initiated a systematic study of differentially private mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}$ that support adaptive queries. Specifically, they formalized the notion of an interactive mechanism, which begins with a dataset as input and maintains a potentially secret state as it answers queries that come in over time. (Both SVT and Private Multiplicative Weights utilize a secret state.) They defined $\\mathcal{M}$ to be an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP interactive mechanism if for every pair of adjacent datasets $x \\sim x^{\\prime}$ and every adaptive adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the view of $\\mathcal{A}$ when interacting with $\\mathcal{M}(x)$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable (in the sense of Inequality (1)) from its view when interacting with $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$, where the view of $\\mathcal{A}$ consists of the random coin tosses of $\\mathcal{A}$ and the transcript of the interaction.\n\nVadhan and Wang [20] asked whether our existing composition theorems for differential privacy, where the mechanisms being composed are noninteractive mechanisms, extend to the concurrent\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{~A}$ simple artificial example is the following: the mechanism's first release can include a uniformly random number $r$ from $\\{1,2, \\ldots,\\lceil 1 / \\delta\\rceil\\}$, and then if the adversary's next query is $r$, the mechanism publishes the entire dataset in the clear.\n\ncomposition of interactive mechanisms. In concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms, an adaptive adversary can interleave its queries to the different interactive mechanisms being composed. This is a realistic attack scenario when multiple interactive differentially private mechanisms are deployed in practice, and is also a useful primitive for analyzing differentially private algorithms that use several interactive mechanisms as building blocks. Vadhan and Wang showed that the basic composition theorem for pure differential privacy [6] does extend to concurrent composition, but for approximate differential privacy, they obtained a much weaker bound for the concurrent case. A tight bound for concurrent composition of approximate differential privacy was given by Lyu [18]. A series of works gave concurrent composition theorems for other flavors of differential privacy and composition, such as R\u00e9nyi DP [18], $f$-DP [21], and adaptive choices of privacy parameters [10].\n\nAll of the above works are for the case where the queries to the mechanisms are adaptive, but the dataset $x$ is static, given as input to the mechanism at the start of the interaction. Jain, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith [13] recently gave a formalization of adaptive adversaries under continual observation (where there are dataset updates but the queries are fixed) for the special case of event-level privacy, where two streams of updates are considered adjacent if they differ on only one update. The lack of a more general formalism and toolkit for reasoning about adaptivity in dataset updates has led to complicated and ad hoc proofs of privacy of continual mechanisms (see e.g. [12]). Rectifying this situation is what motivated our work.",

      "text": "# 1.2. Our contributions. In this paper, we: \n\n- Give a formalism that captures privacy against adaptive adversaries for continual mechanisms, which support both queries and dataset updates. This generalizes the previously studied cases of interactive mechanisms (which have static datasets) and continual observation (which answer fixed queries). See Figure 1 for an illustration. We note that specific mechanisms, like variants of SVT, have been proposed to handle both dataset updates and queries [14], but without offering a definition of privacy against adversaries that can adaptively select both the updates and queries.\n- We prove concurrent composition theorems for continual mechanisms. (1) The first shows that, when the privacy-loss parameters are fixed, the standard composition theorems for noninteractive approximate differential privacy extend to the concurrent composition of continual mechanisms. (2) We extend the \"parallel composition theorem\" for noninteractive mechanisms to the concurrent parallel composition of a finite or infinite number of adaptively chosen interactive mechanisms with an adaptively chosen pair of neighboring datasets. (3) Then we extend this further to the concurrent composition of a finite or infinite number of adaptively chosen continual mechanisms when the composed mechanisms satisfy pure differential privacy. (4) We complement the latter with a counterexample for the case of approximate differential privacy.\n- We formalize a set of general conditions on a continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ that runs multiple continual sub-mechanisms such that the privacy guarantees of $\\mathcal{M}$ follow directly using the above concurrent composition theorems on the sub-mechanisms, without further privacy loss.\n- We use our concurrent composition theorems for continual mechanisms, with the aforementioned general conditions, to give a simpler and more modular privacy analysis of a recent continual histogram mechanism [12]. In the case of approximate DP, ours is the first proof that the privacy of the mechanism holds against adaptive adversaries.\nWe elaborate on all of these contributions below.\nA general formalism for privacy against adaptive adversaries. Our basic object of study is a continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$, which is an interactive mechanism that is not given any input at the start, but simply receives and sends messages in a potentially randomized and stateful manner. These\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. Comparison between interactive mechanism (IMs), continual observation $(\\mathrm{CO})$, and continual mechanisms (CMs)\nmessages can represent, for instance, queries or dataset updates. To model static datasets (as in standard interactive differential privacy), the entire dataset can be given to $\\mathcal{M}$ as its first message.\n\nTowards defining privacy, we consider adaptive adversaries $\\mathcal{A}$ that send messages $m_{i}$ for $i=$ $1,2,3, \\ldots$ that always are parsed as pairs $m_{i}=\\left(m_{i}[0], m_{i}[1]\\right)$. Privacy is defined with respect to a verification function $f$ that takes a sequence of such pairs $\\left(m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right)$ and outputs either T or $\\perp$. When $f\\left(m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right)=\\top$, we consider the two sequences $m[0]=\\left(m_{1}[0], m_{2}[0], \\ldots, m_{t}[0]\\right)$ and $m[1]=\\left(m_{1}[1], m_{2}[1], \\ldots, m_{t}[1]\\right)$ to be neighboring.\n\nNow, by the choice of the verification function $f$, we can easily capture previously studied notions of privacy and more. For example, for a standard interactive mechanism, $f\\left(m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right)$ will check that $m_{1}[0] \\sim m_{1}[1]$ are a pair of neighboring datasets, and that $m_{i}[0]=m_{i}[1]$ for all $i>1$ (these represent the adaptive queries). For continual observation under event-level privacy, we interpret all of the $m_{i}[b]$ 's as dataset updates, and $f$ will require that $m[0]$ and $m[1]$ differ in at most one coordinate $i \\in[k]$. For continual observation under \"user-level\" privacy, $f$ will require that the entries in which $m[0]$ and $m[1]$ differ correspond to only one user. For continual mechanisms, we can interleave adaptive queries among the dataset updates by having $f$ require that all $m_{i}[0]=m_{i}[1]$ whenever either one is a query (rather than a dataset update).\n\nTo go from a verification function $f$ to a definition of privacy against adaptive adversaries, we utilize the notion of an interactive post-processing mechanism (IPM) [10], which is a stateful procedure that can stand between an interactive mechanism and an adversary, or two interactive or continual mechanisms, or even two IPMs, and interact with both of them adaptively, sending and receiving messages to the mechanisms on its left and right. Specifically, we place two IPMs between the adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and the continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$. The first is a verifier $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ that, every time it receives a new message pair $m_{k}$ from $\\mathcal{A}$, applies $f$ to the entire history of message pairs $\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}\\right)$ sent by $\\mathcal{A}$, and forwards $m_{k}$ onward only if $f$ returns $\\top$. Otherwise $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ halts the interaction. The second IPM is the identifier $\\mathcal{I}$, which starts out with a secret bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, and every time it receives a message pair $\\left(m_{i}[0], m_{i}[1]\\right)$ from $\\mathcal{V}[f]$, it forwards $m_{i}[b]$ on to the mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$. When $\\mathcal{M}$ returns an answer $a_{i}, \\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ just forward it back to $\\mathcal{A}$. See Figure 2 for an illustration of an interaction between $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}[1] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ consisting of three messages from $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{V}[f]$.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of the interactions between $\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{V}[f], \\mathcal{I}(b)$, and $\\mathcal{M}$\nThis leads to the following definition of differential privacy for continual mechanisms:\nDefinition 1.1 (DP for continual mechanisms). Let $f$ be a verification function. A continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP with respect to $f$ if for every adaptive adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the view of $\\mathcal{A}$ when interacting with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}[0] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable from its view when interacting with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}[1] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThe idea of defining security against adaptive adversaries by having the adversary send pairs of messages and trying to distinguish whether the first message in each pair or the second message in each pair is being used goes back to the notion of left-or-right indistinguishability in crytography [1]. What is different here is its combination with a verification function $f$ to enforce the neighboring condition, which is necessary to capture differential privacy.\n\nAs far as we know, this definition captures all of the previous definitions of privacy against adaptive adversaries as special cases (by appropriate choices of $f$ ), as well as modeling adaptive adversaries in even more scenarios (such as continual observation with user-level privacy, and mixtures of adaptively-chosen dataset updates and queries).\n\nFurthermore, it allows us to reduce the analysis of general continual mechanisms to that of the previously studied notion of interactive mechanisms. Indeed, by inspection, we observe that a\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the interactions between an honest adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and the concurrent composition of $k$ continual mechanisms\ncontinual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP with respect to $f$ if and only if the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)=\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(\\cdot) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP on the dataset space $\\{0,1\\}$ (where $0 \\sim 1$ ).\nConcurrent Composition Theorems for Continual Mechanisms. With the above definitions in hand, we can formulate and prove new concurrent composition theorems for continual mechanisms. Recall that with concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms, an adaptive adversary (or honest analyst) can interleave its queries to the different interactive mechanisms being composed; for concurrent composition of continual mechanisms, we also allow the dataset updates to be interleaved with the queries and each other. (See Figure 3.)\n\nOur first concurrent composition theorem is as follows:\nTheorem 1.2 (concurrent composition of continual mechanisms, informally stated). For every fixed sequence $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ of privacy-loss parameters and verification functions $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{k}$, the concurrent composition of continual mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ that are $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP wrt $f_{i}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for the same $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ that holds for composing noninteractive mechanisms that are $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP.\n\nNotably, this result allows the adversary to adaptively and concurrently choose the neighboring sequences fed to each of the $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ 's based on the responses received from the other mechanisms.\n\nTheorem 1.2 is proven by using the aforementioned reduction from continual to interactive mechanism. Then we use Lyu's result [18] for $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP interactive mechanisms and extend it to hold for infinite (but discrete) answer spaces and an unbounded number of rounds of interaction as follows. In Lyu's proof the restriction on the number of interactions comes from a backward definition of a so-called control function. We define a function which is the limit over this control function and, using monotone convergence, show that this \"limit function\" satisfies all the necessary conditions to be used in the rest of Lyu's proof. This extends the result to an unbounded number of rounds of interaction. Furthermore, Lyu's proof used an algorithmic construction iterating over the answer set, implying that the answer set must be finite. Instead with a mathematical approach, we extend the proof to work with a countable, infinite answer set.\n\nWhile we focus on composing approximate DP with fixed privacy loss parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ in Theorem 1.2, we expect that there should also be analogues of it for other settings in which concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms have been studied, such as R\u00e9nyi DP [18], $f$-DP [21], and adaptively chosen privacy-loss parameters [10].\n\nNext, we explore the concurrent and continual analogue of parallel composition of differential privacy. To review parallel composition, suppose that $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}$ are each $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP noninteractive mechanisms with respect to $\\sim$, where each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ expects a dataset $x_{i}$ as input, and for a parameter $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, \\ell\\}$, we define a neighboring relation $\\sim_{k}$ on $\\ell$-tuples as follows: $\\left(x_{1}[0], \\ldots, x_{\\ell}[0]\\right) \\sim_{k}\\left(x_{1}[1], \\ldots, x_{\\ell}[1]\\right)$ if:\n(1) For every $i \\in[\\ell], x_{i}[0] \\sim x_{i}[1]$ or $x_{i}[0]=x_{i}[1]$.\n\n(2) For at most $k$ values of $i \\in[\\ell], x_{i}[0] \\neq x_{i}[1]$.\n\nWe refer to the mechanism $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)=\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}(\\cdot)\\right)$ with neighbor relation $\\sim_{k}$ as the $k$-sparse parallel composition of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}$. If $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}$ are noninteractive mechanism, then it is known that $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ satisfies the same level of $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP as the (standard) composition of $k$ (rather than $\\ell$ ) $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP mechanisms.\n\nWe study the extent to which parallel composition extends to the concurrent composition of continual mechanisms, meaning the neighboring relation is as above, but the adversary can interact concurrently with the mechanisms, and in particular decide adaptively on which $k$ of them to have different update sequences. Moreover, we also consider the case where $\\ell$ is unbounded, meaning the adversary (or honest analyst) can adaptively decide how many mechanisms to interact with. We refer to this as concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition.\n\nFirst, we extend the parallel composition of noninteractive mechanisms to concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms (where there are adaptive queries but datasets $x_{i}$ are static, rather than dynamically updated).\nTheorem 1.3 (concurrent parallel composition of interactive mechanisms). For every $\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0} \\geq 0$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and every $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$, the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of an unbounded number of copies of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ satisfies the same $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees as the composition of $k$ noninteractive $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP mechanisms.\n\nAs discussed later in the introduction, we also prove a generalization of Theorem 1.3 for the case of composing interactive mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ with differing $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ parameters.\n\nThen we turn to the case of continual mechanisms, where there can also be adaptive dataset updates. We prove a negative result for approximate DP $\\left(\\delta_{0}>0\\right)$ :\nTheorem 1.4 (concurrent parallel composition of approximate DP continual mechanisms, informally stated). For every $\\delta_{0}>0$, there is an $\\left(0, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ such that for every $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the concurrent 1-sparse parallel composition of $\\ell$ copies of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ is not $(0, \\delta)$-DP for any $\\delta<1-\\left(1-\\delta_{0}\\right)^{\\ell}$.\n\nThis theorem says that, at least in terms of the $\\delta$ parameter, concurrent parallel composition of continual mechanisms does not provide any benefit over non-parallel composition, since the bound of $1-\\left(1-\\delta_{0}\\right)^{\\ell}$, is the bound that we would get by just applying composition over all $\\ell$ mechanisms.\n\nHowever, we prove that if $\\delta_{0}=0$, concurrent parallel composition behaves just like non-interactive parallel composition:\nTheorem 1.5 (concurrent parallel composition of pure DP continual mechanisms, informally stated). For every $\\epsilon_{0} \\geq 0$ and integers $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, 0\\right)$-DP mechanisms satisfies the same $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP guarantees as the composition of $k$ noninteractive $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, 0\\right)$-DP mechanisms.\n\nWe note that the constraint of pure DP is only on the mechanisms being composed; we allow $\\delta>0$ in the final privacy guarantee, so we can still, for example, recover the advanced composition bound applied to pure DP mechanisms. Like Theorem 1.3, we also prove a generalization of Theorem 1.5 for the case of composing mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ with differing $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ parameters.\n\nTo prove this theorem, we add a twist to the concurrent composition theorems for interactive mechanisms. Specifically, the papers $[20,18]$ proved their composition theorems for pure and approximate DP by showing that for every $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ and pair $x_{0} \\sim x_{1}$ of adjacent datasets, $\\mathcal{M}$ can be simulated as an interactive post-processing of the noninteractive $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP randomized response mechanism $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}}$. That is, there is an IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ (with no input) such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, \\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{b}\\right)$ is equivalent to $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}}(b)$.\n\nWe show that when $\\delta_{0}=0$, the use of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}}$ by $\\mathcal{T}$ can be delayed until the time that it receives a query that would have different answer distributions under $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{1}\\right)$. While intuitive, Theorem 1.4 tells us that this fact fails when $\\delta_{0}>0$.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4. Illustration of the interactions between an honest adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and a mechanism with $k$ sub-mechanisms\n\nIt is an interesting open problem to see if Theorem 1.5 can be extended to composing approximate DP mechanisms $\\left(\\delta_{0}>0\\right)$, if we allow an additional slackness in the final $\\delta$, as shown necessary by Theorem 1.4.\n\nAn Algorithmic Application. Composition theorems for differential privacy have two main uses. One is to bound the accumulated privacy loss when DP systems are used repeatedly over time. Another is to facilitate the design of complex DP algorithms from simpler ones. The concurrent composition theorems for interactive mechanisms have already found an application in the privacy analysis of matching algorithms in local edge differential privacy model [4]. (This work also has a result in the continual observation model, but the privacy is only proven for oblivious adversaries.)\n\nOur concurrent composition theorem allows for a simpler and more modular privacy analysis of continual mechanisms built out of other continual mechanisms. In particular, we give a new privacy proof for the continual monotone histogram mechanism of Henzinger, Sricharan, and Steiner [12]. This mechanism involves concurrent executions of a simpler continual histogram mechanism and multiple instantations of the Sparse Vector Technique mechanism, and the original privacy analysis was rather intricate even for oblivious adversaries (because the mechanism itself is adaptive in its queries and dataset updates to the building-block mechanisms). With our concurrent composition theorems (both Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.5), we obtain a much simpler privacy proof. Moreover, for the case of approximate DP, the original proof was only for oblivious adversaries, whereas our proof also applies to adaptive adversaries.\nGeneral Conditions for Privacy Analysis of Continual Mechanisms. In the above application, the adversary does not directly interact with the sub-mechanisms, but rather it is the \"main\" HSS mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ that issues messages to its sub-mechanisms, based on the messages it receives. (See Figure 4 for an illustration.) These messages are not necessarily identical to the messages that $\\mathcal{M}$ receives. Instead based on the input that $\\mathcal{M}$ receives from an analyst or an adversary (passed through $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(\\cdot)$ ), it generates an input sequence for its sub-mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ that, on neighboring inputs to $\\mathcal{M}$, must be identical or neighboring for their respective verification functions $f_{i}$. Note that $\\mathcal{M}$ may fix the set of sub-mechanisms at initialization or select these mechanisms adaptively over time. For example, in the application above, the continual monotone histogram mechanism maintains $d$ fixed binary counters while adaptively instantiating an unbounded number of SVT and Laplace mechanisms as need.\n\nThe privacy analysis of such mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}$ is challenging as the creation of sub-mechanisms and their inputs is adaptive and dependent on each other. Moreover, in contrast to concurrent composition of interactive mechanisms, $\\mathcal{M}$ has direct access to the dataset updates, which cannot be revealed without differentially private processing (which needs to be done by the sub-mechanisms). We give a set of conditions for $\\mathcal{M}$ and prove a theorem that shows that under these conditions the privacy of $\\mathcal{M}$ can directly be computed by applying our concurrent composition theorems to\n\nthe continual sub-mechanisms. The general idea is that $\\mathcal{M}$ should only use its input sequence to generate inputs for the differentially private sub-mechanisms and any other action of $\\mathcal{M}$, such as creating new sub-mechanism or generating a response, should be taken based only on the privatized outputs of the sub-mechanisms. This will ensure that $\\mathcal{M}$ does not use any \"privacy budget\" in addition to the privacy budget used by the sub-mechanisms. For example, if $\\mathcal{M}$ executes $k$ continual sub-mechanisms and, upon receiving neighboring inputs, issues neighboring message sequences for the sub-mechanisms, then the privacy of $\\mathcal{M}$ equals the privacy of the concurrent composition of the sub-mechanism, as computed by Theorem 1.2. The same holds for the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of sub-mechanisms, as computed in Theorems 1.3 and 1.5.\n\nOur Variants of Concurrent Composition. Here we elaborate on the different types of concurrent composition that we study in this paper, with more general and more precise formulations than described above.\n(1) Concurrent Composition of Continual Mechanisms: In the concurrent composition of fixed continual mechanism, $k$ continual mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ are fixed at the beginning, and an adversary adaptively issues pairs of messages for them such that for each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$, the sequences formed by the first messages of all message pairs and the sequence formed by the second messages of all message pairs are neighboring. A secret bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ determines whether each mechanism receives the first or second sequence from each pair. The adversary's goal is to guess $b$ using the answers of all $k$ mechanisms. Theorem 4.10, which is the formal statement of Theorem 1.2 above, analyzes the privacy of this composition.\n\nA natural extension is the concurrent composition of continual mechanism with fixed parameters, where instead of fixing the mechanisms themselves, $k$ privacy parameter pairs $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ are fixed in advance. The adversary then adaptively selects mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ over time, ensuring that, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, the mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ DP. The privacy guarantee for this variant is the same as Theorem 4.10 and is stated in Theorem 4.12.\n(2) Concurrent $k$-Sparse Parallel Composition of Continual Mechanisms: This composition generalizes the concurrent composition of continual mechanisms with $k$ fixed parameters by permitting the creation of an arbitrary number of continual mechanisms. As before, $k$ privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ are fixed at the beginning. The adversary adaptively creates a potentially unlimited number of continual mechanisms and issues pairs of messages to each mechanism such that for all but at most $k$ of these mechanisms, each message pair consists of identical messages. Let $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ denote the exceptional mechanisms, which may receive differing message sequences. For each $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, the mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must be $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP, and the sequences of the first and second messages for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must be neighboring.\n\nAs in previous compositions, a secret bit $b$ determines whether each mechanism receives the first or second message from each pair, and the adversary seeks to guess $b$ based on the outputs. Theorem 1.5 analyzes this composition in the special case where $\\delta_{1}=\\cdots=\\delta_{k}=0$ and $\\epsilon_{1}=\\cdots=\\epsilon_{k}=\\epsilon_{0}$. The general version for non-identical $\\epsilon_{i}$ parameters is given in Theorem 5.2.\n(3) Concurrent $k$-Sparse Parallel Composition of Interactive Mechanisms: In this composition, the adversary creates an unbounded number of interactive mechanisms over time, instead of continual ones. As before, $k$ privacy parameter pairs $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ are fixed in advance. Each time the adversary creates an interactive mechanism, they also select a pair of neighboring datasets for it. Instead of message pairs, the adversary adaptively sends (single) queries to each mechanism. A secret bit $b$ determines whether the mechanism is run on the first or second dataset of its respective pair. The adversary then tries to infer $b$ from the responses of all mechanisms. Theorem 1.3 analyzes the privacy of this composition\n\nwhen all $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ are $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP. The more general case for mechanisms with possibly different $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ parameters is stated in Theorem 5.5.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces all necessary notation, including noninteractive mechanisms, interactive mechanisms, and interactive post-processing mechanism. Section 3 defines continual mechanisms, identifiers $\\mathcal{I}$, verification functions $f$, verifiers $\\mathcal{V}$ and differential privacy for continual mechanisms. Concurrent composition of continual mechanisms is defined in Section 4 and our first concurrent composition theorem is proven. Section 5 introduces concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of continual mechanisms and interactive mechanisms, proves the theorems for this type of composition and shows the counterexample. In Section 6, we state the conditions and the theorem for analyzing the privacy of complex continual mechanisms that use non-interactive, interactive and continual sub-mechanisms. Finally, in Section 7, we apply our theorem to analyze the privacy of the continual histogram mechanism of [12]. Appendix A presents our extension of Lyu's result [18] to infinite answer spaces and an unbounded number of rounds of interaction.",

A randomized mechanism $\\mathcal{M}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ is a randomized function that maps a dataset $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ to an element of $\\mathcal{Y}$. We call $\\mathcal{M}$ a non-interactive mechanism (NIM) since it halts immediately after returning an output.\n\nTo define differential privacy, we require the definition of indistinguishability for random variables:\nDefinition 2.1 ( $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishability [16]). For $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, two random variables $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ over the same domain $\\mathcal{Y}$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable if for any subset $Y \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{1} \\in Y\\right] \\leq e^{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{2} \\in Y\\right]+\\delta\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{2} \\in Y\\right] \\leq e^{\\epsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{1} \\in Y\\right]+\\delta\n$$\n\nDifferential privacy is defined relative to a neighbor relation, which is a binary relation on the family of datasets $\\mathcal{X}$. For example, we often consider two tabular datasets $x, x^{\\prime}$ to be neighboring if they differ only by the presence or absence of a single record. Differential privacy for NIMs is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition 2.2 ( $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for NIMs [6]). For $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, a randomized mechanism $\\mathcal{M}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private (or $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for short) with respect to (w.r.t.) a neighbor relation $\\sim$ if for every two datasets $x_{0}, x_{1} \\in \\mathcal{X}$ satisfying $x_{0} \\sim x_{1}$, the random variables $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable.\n\nAn example of an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP NIM is the approximate randomized response, defined as follows:\nDefinition 2.3 $\\left(\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}\\right)$. For $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, the approx randomized response $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$ is a non-interactive mechanism that takes a bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ as input and returns a pair according to the following distribution:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)= \\begin{cases}(b, \\top) & \\text { w.p. } \\delta \\\\ (b, \\perp) & \\text { w.p. }(1-\\delta) \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{1+e^{\\epsilon}} \\\\ (1-b, \\perp) & \\text { w.p. }(1-\\delta) \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\epsilon}}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLemma 2.4 ([15]). For every $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, the approx randomized response $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP.\n\nThe reason [15] introduced $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$ is that it is \"universal\" among $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP NIMs in the following sense:\n\nTheorem 2.5 ([15]). A mechanism $\\mathcal{M}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim$ if and only if for any $x_{0} \\sim x_{1}$, there exists a randomized \"post-processor\" $\\mathcal{P}:\\{0,1\\} \\times\\{\\top, \\perp\\} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ such that for both $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, \\mathcal{M}\\left(x_{b}\\right)$ is identically distributed to $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}\\right)$.\n2.2. Interactive Mechanisms (IM). Unlike an NIM, an interactive mechanism (IM) continues interacting with the analyst and answers multiple adaptively asked queries. An IM is defined formally as follows.\n\nDefinition 2.6 (Interactive Mechanism (IM)). An interactive mechanism (IM) is a randomized state function $\\mathcal{M}: S_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{M}} \\rightarrow S_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times A_{\\mathcal{M}}$, where\n\n- $S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the state space of $\\mathcal{M}$,\n- $Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the set of possible incoming messages or queries for $\\mathcal{M}$,\n- $A_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the set of possible outgoing messages or answers generated by $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nUpon receiving a query $m \\in Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$, according to some distribution, $\\mathcal{M}$ updates its current state $s \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ to a new state $s^{\\prime} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ and generates an answer $m^{\\prime} \\in A_{\\mathcal{M}}$, which is described by $\\left(s^{\\prime}, m^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{M}(s, m)$. The set $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }} \\subseteq S_{\\mathcal{M}}$ denotes the set of possible initial states for $\\mathcal{M}$. For $s^{\\text {init }} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}, \\mathcal{M}\\left(s^{\\text {init }}\\right)$ represents the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ with the initial state $s^{\\text {init }}$.\n\nRemark 2.7. In the differential privacy literature, a query typically refers to a question about the dataset held by a mechanism. However, in this paper, we use query as a shorthand for query message, meaning an input message to a mechanism that requires a response.\n\nThe state of an IM $\\mathcal{M}$ serves as its memory. The initial state of $\\mathcal{M}$ can include secret information, such as a dataset $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, or it can simply be an empty memory. Thus, in some cases, the size of the initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ is as large as the family of datasets $\\mathcal{X}$, while in some other cases, $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ is a singleton consisting of a single state representing the empty memory.\nNotation 2.8. If $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ is a singleton $\\{s\\}$, we denote $\\mathcal{M}(s)$ as $\\mathcal{M}$.\n2.2.1. Interaction of IMs. Two interactive mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ satisfying $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}$ and $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}$ can interact with each other through message passing. For initial states $s_{1} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}^{\\text {init }}$ and $s_{2} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}^{\\text {init }}$, the interaction between $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)$ is defined as follows: It starts with round 1. Mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ sends a message to $\\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)$ in the odd rounds, and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)$ responds in the subsequent even rounds. The interaction continues until one of the mechanisms halts the communication. A mechanism halts the communication by sending the specific message halt at its round.\n\nIn Definition 2.6, we defined an IM as a stateful randomized algorithm mapping its current state and an input message to a new state and an output message. To initiate the interaction and send the first message $m_{1}, \\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ invokes $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}, \\lambda\\right)$, where $\\lambda$ is the empty message.\nDefinition 2.9 (View of an IM). Let $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ be two interactive mechanisms such that $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}$ and $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}$. Let $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ be initial states of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$, respectively. Consider the interaction between $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)$, initiated by a message from $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$. The view of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ in this interaction, denoted $\\operatorname{View}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)\\right)$, is defined as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{View}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\left(s_{1}\\right), \\mathcal{M}_{2}\\left(s_{2}\\right)\\right)=\\left(r_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}, m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, \\ldots\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $r_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}$ represents the internal randomness of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$, and $\\left(m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ is the transcript of messages exchanged between $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$. We define $\\Pi_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\mathcal{M}_{2}}$ as the family of all possible views over all initial states $s_{1} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}^{\\text {init }}$ and $s_{2} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}^{\\text {init }}$.\n\nThroughout the paper, whenever discussing the interaction between two IMs or the view of a mechanism in an interaction, we implicitly assume that the query and answer sets of the involved mechanisms match, i.e., $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}$ and $Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{2}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}$.\n\nDefinition 2.10 (Equivalent IMs). Let $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ be two interactive mechanisms with $Q_{\\mathcal{M}}=Q_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}$ and $A_{\\mathcal{M}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}$. Let $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$ be initial states for $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$, respectively. The mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}(s)$ and $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)$ are equivalent if for any adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ with $A_{\\mathcal{A}}=Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$ and $Q_{\\mathcal{A}}=A_{\\mathcal{M}}$, the random variables $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{M}(s))$ and $\\operatorname{View}\\left(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$ are identically distributed.\n2.2.2. Differential Privacy for IMs. To define differential privacy for an interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$, we compare the views of a so-called adversary interacting with $\\mathcal{M}(s)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s^{\\prime}\\right)$ for neighboring initial states $s, s^{\\prime}$.\n\nDefinition 2.11 (Adversary). An (adaptive) adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ is an interactive mechanism with a singleton initial state space. Let $s^{\\text {init }}$ be the only initial state of $\\mathcal{A}$. By Notation 2.8, we write $\\mathcal{A}$ instead of $\\mathcal{A}\\left(s^{\\text {init }}\\right)$.\n\nThroughout this paper, adversaries always send the first message. Moreover, since adversaries are stateful algorithms, they can choose their messages adaptively based on the history of messages exchanged, meaning that all adversaries in this paper are adaptive.\n\nExisting works $[20,21,18,10]$ view the initial state of $\\mathcal{M}$ is a dataset, i.e., $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}=\\mathcal{X}$, and (as is usual) they define neighbor relations as binary relations on $\\mathcal{X}$. However, for us it will be convenient to conceptually separate $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ from the data (which is changing continuously over time), but still define DP w.r.t. neighbor relations on $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$. This leads to the following definition of differential privacy for IMs.\n\nDefinition 2.12 ( $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-Differential Privacy for IMs). Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be an interactive mechanism, and let $\\sim$ be a neighbor relation on $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$. For $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1, \\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private (or $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for short) w.r.t. $\\sim$ against adaptive adversaries if for every pair of neighboring initial states $s_{0}, s_{1} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ satisfying $s_{0} \\sim s_{1}$ and every adaptive adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the random variables $\\operatorname{View}\\left(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{View}\\left(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)\\right)$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable.\n2.3. Interactive Post-Processing (IPM). For NIMs, a randomized post-processing function $\\mathcal{T}: \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}$ maps the output of a mechanism $\\mathcal{N}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$ to an element of $\\mathcal{Z}$. Differential privacy for NIMs is known to be preserved under post-processing.\n\nHaney et al. [10] generalize post-processing functions to interactive post-processing mechanisms (IPMs) as follows and show that interactive post-processing preserves privacy guarantees for IMs.\n\nDefinition 2.13 (Interactive Post-Processing Mechanism (IPM) [10]). An interactive post-processing mechanism (IPM) is a stateful randomized algorithm $\\mathcal{P}: S_{\\mathcal{P}} \\times\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{R\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow$ $S_{\\mathcal{P}} \\times\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{R\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right)$ that stands between two interactive mechanisms, referred to as the left and right mechanisms, communicating with them via message passing. The state space of $\\mathcal{P}$ is denoted by $S_{\\mathcal{P}}$, while $Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}$ and $Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}$ represent the sets of possible messages received by $\\mathcal{P}$ from the left and right mechanisms, respectively. Similarly, $A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}$ and $A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}$ denote the sets of possible messages $\\mathcal{P}$ sends to the left and right mechanisms. $\\mathcal{P}$ randomly maps its current state $s \\in S_{\\mathcal{P}}$, an indicator $v \\in\\{L, R\\}$ specifying whether the incoming message is from the left or right mechanism, and a message $m \\in Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L} \\cup Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}$ to a new state $s^{\\prime} \\in S_{\\mathcal{P}}$, an indicator $v^{\\prime} \\in\\{L, R\\}$ specifying whether the outgoing message is for the left or right mechanism, and a message $m^{\\prime} \\in A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L} \\cup A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}$. This is described by $\\left(s^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}, m^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}(s, v, m)$.\n\nThe post-processing of an NIM $\\mathcal{N}$ by a non-interactive post-processing function $\\mathcal{T}$, denoted as $\\mathcal{T} \\circ \\mathcal{N}$, is an NIM that first runs $\\mathcal{N}$ on the input dataset and then applies $\\mathcal{T}$ to $\\mathcal{N}$ 's output, returning $\\mathcal{T}$ 's output. In contrast, the post-processing of an IM $\\mathcal{M}$ by an IPM $\\mathcal{P}$, denoted by $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$, is an IM that runs $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ internally. In an interaction with another IM $\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ forwards its input messages from $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{P}$ as left messages. Then, $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ communicate multiple times, with $\\mathcal{M}$ acting as the right mechanism, until $\\mathcal{P}$ returns a response for its left mechanism, at which point $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ returns this response to $\\mathcal{A}$. Note that $\\mathcal{P}$ may return an answer for its left mechanism\n\nimmediately after receiving a left message, without interacting with $\\mathcal{M}$. The formal definition of $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is given below:\n\nDefinition 2.14 (Post-Processing of an IM $\\mathcal{M}$ by an IPM $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}\\right)[10]$ ). Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be an IM and $\\mathcal{P}$ an IPM such that $Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}=A_{\\mathcal{M}}$ and $A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}=Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$. The post-processing of $\\mathcal{M}$ by $\\mathcal{P}$ is an interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}: S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\cdot \\mathcal{M}} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L} \\rightarrow S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\cdot \\mathcal{M}} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}$, defined in Algorithm 1. The initial state space of $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ equals $S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\cdot \\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}=S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }} \\times S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\text {init }}$. For readability, when $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is initialized with the state $\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, s^{\\mathcal{P}}\\right) \\in S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\cdot \\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$, we denote it as $\\mathcal{P}\\left(s^{\\mathcal{P}}\\right) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}\\right)$ instead of $\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}\\right)\\left(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, s^{\\mathcal{P}}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n```\nAlgorithm 1 Post-Processing of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) by \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), denoted by \\(\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}[10]\\).\n    procedure \\(\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}\\right)(s, m)\\) :\n    \\(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, s^{\\mathcal{P}}\\right) \\leftarrow s\\)\n    \\(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{P}}, v, m^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}\\left(s^{\\mathcal{P}}, \\mathrm{L}, m\\right)\\)\n    while \\(v=\\mathrm{R}\\) do\n        \\(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, m\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{M}\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, m^{\\prime}\\right)\\)\n        \\(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{P}}, v, m^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}\\left(s^{\\mathcal{P}}, \\mathrm{R}, m\\right)\\)\n    end while\n    return \\(\\left(\\left(s^{\\mathcal{M}}, s^{\\mathcal{P}}\\right), m^{\\prime}\\right)\\)\nend procedure\n```\n\nHaney et al. [10] shows that if an IM $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private, then for any IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ with a singleton initial state space, $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private. This result is formally stated below.\n\nLemma 2.15 (Post-Processing Lemma for IMs [10]). Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be an IM $\\mathcal{M}$ with an initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ be an IPM with a singleton initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\text {init }}=\\{s\\}$. Let $\\sim$ be a neighbor relation on $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$. Define a binary relation $\\sim$, on $S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\cdot \\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ such that two initial states $\\left(s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{1}, s\\right)$ and $\\left(s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{2}, s\\right)$ satisfy $\\left(s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{1}, s\\right) \\sim_{*}\\left(s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{2}, s\\right)$ if and only if $s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{1} \\sim s_{\\mathcal{M}}^{2}$. If $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the neighbor relation $\\sim$ against adaptive adversaries, then $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the neighbor relation $\\sim_{*}$ against adaptive adversaries. ${ }^{2}$\n\nIPMs are not limited to interacting with IMs. Two IPMs can interact with each other as well, as follows:\n\nDefinition 2.16 (Chain of IPMs). Let $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ be two IPMs satisfying $Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{1}}^{R}=A_{\\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{L}$ and $A_{\\mathcal{P}_{1}}^{R}=Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{L}$. $\\mathcal{P}_{1} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}_{2}$ is an IPM with state space $S_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\circ \\mathcal{P}_{2}}=S_{\\mathcal{P}_{1}} \\times S_{\\mathcal{P}_{2}}$, left query space $Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\circ \\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{L}=Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{1}}^{L}$, left answer space $A_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\circ \\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{L}=A_{\\mathcal{P}_{1}}^{L}$, right query space $Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\circ \\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{R}=Q_{\\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{R}$, and right answer space $A_{\\mathcal{P}_{0} \\circ \\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{R}=A_{\\mathcal{P}_{2}}^{R}$.

Using these key observations, we first reformulate the definition of DP for IMs and continual observation. Then, inspired by the new formulations, we introduce continual mechanisms (CMs) and formally define DP in this setting.\n3.1. An Alternative Definition of DP for IMs. By Definition 2.12, an interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ with initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a neighboring relation $\\sim$, if for any two initial states $s_{0}, s_{1} \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ such that $s_{0} \\sim s_{1}$ and any adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the view of $\\mathcal{A}$ in the interaction with $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable. This means that for the worst-case (i.e., adversarial) choice of neighboring initial states, an adversary by adaptively asking queries should not be able to determine whether $\\mathcal{M}$ is running on $s_{0}$ or $s_{1}$.\n\nIn an alternative definition, an adversary sends a pair of neighboring initial states $\\left(s_{0}, s_{1}\\right)$ as its first message and adaptively asks a sequence of queries $q_{1}, q_{2}, \\ldots$ in the subsequent messages. In this setting, $\\mathcal{M}$ receives one of $s_{0}$ and $s_{1}$ as its first message and responds with an acknowledgment message $\\top$. Thereafter, $\\mathcal{M}$ answers queries based on the received state, and the goal of the adversary is to determine whether $\\mathcal{M}$ was initialized with $s_{0}$ or $s_{1}$. In this definition, the actual initial state of $\\mathcal{M}$ (not the one received as the first message) carries no secret information and serves merely as an empty memory. Therefore, the initial state space of $\\mathcal{M}$ consists of a single fixed initial state.\n\nTo formalize this, we restrict attention to adversaries that send a pair of neighboring initial states $\\left(s_{0}, s_{1}\\right)$ as their first message and pairs of identical queries $\\left(q_{i}, q_{i}\\right)$ in its subsequent messages. We also define an IPM $\\mathcal{I}$ with the initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{I}}^{\\text {init }}=\\{0,1\\}$ to stand between the adversary and $\\mathcal{M}$, filtering the pairs based on its, i.e., $\\mathcal{I}$ 's, initial state. Specifically, for $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, in an interaction between an adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$, upon receiving a message $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right)$ from $\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{I}(b)$ forwards $m_{b}$ to $\\mathcal{M}$ and returns $\\mathcal{M}$ 's answer unchanged to $\\mathcal{A}$. With this formulation, an interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP if for any adversary of the above form, the random variables $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{I}[0] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ and View $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{I}[1] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable.\n\nActually, we will enforce the restrictions on the adversary also by an IPM, which we call a verifier $\\mathcal{V}$. The verifier checks whether the initial message is a pair of neighboring datasets and the subsequent messages of the adversary are of the form $(q, q)$; only if these checks pass, are the messages forwarded to $\\mathcal{I}$.\n3.2. An Alternative Definition of DP under Continual Observation. Dwork, Naor, Pitassi, and Rothblum [7] introduced differential privacy under continual observation, where the dataset is not given at the initialization time and instead evolves over time. In this model, the mechanism receives either an empty record or a data record at each step. If the record is non-empty, the mechanism adds it to its dataset. Then, whether the input record is empty or not, the mechanism answers a predetermined question about its current dataset.\n\nTo capture \"event-level privacy\" (where the privacy unit is a single record), Dwork et al. [7] define neighboring as a binary relation on sequences of data and empty records: two sequences are neighboring if they are identical except for the presence or absence of a record in a single step. They called a mechanism $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP under continual observation if the distributions of answer sequences are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable for any two neighboring input sequences. This definition does not allow for data sequences that are adaptively chosen based on the answers released.\n\nJain, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith [13] formalized the definition of DP against adaptive adversaries in the continual observation model as follows: An adaptive adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ chooses a single (data or empty) record at every step, except for one challenge step, selected by the adversary, where $\\mathcal{A}$ sends a pair of records. They called a mechanism $\\mathcal{M}(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private against adaptive adversaries in the continual observation model if for any such adaptive adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the distributions of $\\mathcal{M}$ 's answer sequences are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable when the first or the second element of the pair in the challenge step is handed to $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nA mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ in the continual observation model can be viewed as an IM with a single possible initial state, representing an empty dataset. The input message set of $\\mathcal{M}$ consists of the empty record and all possible data records. Instead of having a challenge step, we can alternatively restrict to adversaries that send pairs of identical records at every step except for one. Under this formulation, the definition of differential privacy proposed by [13] can be restated as follows: A mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP differential privacy against adaptive adversaries if for every such adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the random variables $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{I}[0] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ and $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{I}[1] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable, where $\\mathcal{I}$ is the interactive post-processing mechanism discussed previously. Again, below we will enforce the restriction on the adversary via another IPM $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nIn this alternative definition, all adversary messages are pairs of identical data or empty records, except for a single message that is a pair of different records. Recall that in the alternative definition of DP for IMs, the first message sent by an adversary must be a pair of neighboring initial datasets, while all subsequent adversary messages must be pairs of identical queries. Next, we generalize the definition of differential privacy by allowing arbitrary conditions on the sequence of pairs sent by adversaries, without restricting the content of the messages.\n3.3. Introducing CMs. As discussed in the alternative formulation of IMs, we can assume that the initial state space of IMs is a singleton and encode its initial state as a message. A continual mechanism is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Continual Mechanism (CM)). A continual mechanism (CM) is an interactive mechanism with a singleton initial state space.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, all mechanisms in DP literature can be represented as CMs:\n\n- Any non-interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{N}$, such as the Laplace mechanism, can be modeled as a CM that receives a dataset $x$ as its first message and returns $\\mathcal{N}(x)$ as a response. Upon receiving any subsequent input message, the CM representing $\\mathcal{N}$ halts the communication.\n\n- Any interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ with an initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ can be modeled as a CM that receives an initial state $s \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ as its first message and responds with an acknowledgment message $\\top$. This CM then answers the next input messages the same as $\\mathcal{M}(s)$.\n- Mechanisms such as the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) [8, 11, 17] and the continual counter [6, $2,3,5]$ in the streaming settings can also be represented as CMs receiving two types of messages: question queries and data-update queries. Question queries request information about the current dataset, while data-update queries consist of instructions for modifying the dataset.\n3.4. DP for CMs. To formulate the general definition of DP for CMs, we introduce two IPMs: an identifier $\\mathcal{I}$ and a verifier $\\mathcal{V}$. As described earlier, an identifier receives a secret bit $b$ as its initial state and maps messages of the form $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right)$ to $m_{b}$. To avoid defining a new family of adversaries for each problem or model, we introduce verifiers.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be a CM and $\\mathcal{I}$ be an identifier for $\\mathcal{M}$. A verifier $\\mathcal{V}$ with a verification function $f$, denoted by $\\mathcal{V}[f]$, stands between an adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ and the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$. Upon receiving a message from $\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{V}[f]$ applies $f$ to verify whether the sequence of pairs sent by the adversary up to that point satisfies a set of properties. Comparing the sequences formed by the first and second elements of the pairs, $f$ can be used to encode a neighboring property. If the pair sequence satisfies the properties, $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ forwards $\\mathcal{A}$ 's message to $\\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$; otherwise, it halts the communication. The formal definitions of identifiers, verification functions, and verifiers are given below.\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Identifier $\\mathcal{I}$ ). An identifier $\\mathcal{I}$ is an IPM with state space $S_{\\mathcal{I}}$ and initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{I}}^{\\text {init }}=\\{0,1\\}$. $\\mathcal{I}$ stands between two IMs, referred to as the left and right mechanisms. While there is no restriction on the format of messages received from the right mechanism, $\\mathcal{I}$ only accepts messages of the form $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right)$ from its left mechanism. Upon receiving a message $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right)$ from the left mechanism, an instance of $\\mathcal{I}$ with an initial state $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ forwards $m_{b}$ to the right mechanism. Upon receiving a message from the right mechanism, $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ forwards the message unchanged to the left mechanism.\n\nDefinition 3.3 (Verification Function). A verification function $f$ takes a sequence of messages as input and returns either $\\top$ or $\\perp$. A message sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}$ is $f$-valid if $f\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}\\right)=\\top$.\n\nRemark 3.4. Since the set of all possible messages does not exist, we assume that all message spaces considered in this paper are subsets of some universal set $\\mathcal{U}$. For instance, in [10], the universal set is taken to be $\\{0,1\\}^{*}$. The domain of verification functions is $\\mathcal{U}^{*}$.\n\nDefinition 3.5 (Verifier $\\mathcal{V}$ ). For a verification function $f$, a verifier $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ is an IPM with the initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{V}[f]}^{\\text {init }}=\\{()\\}$, where () represents an empty sequence. Since the initial state space of $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ is a singleton, we denote an instance of $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ with the initial state () as $\\mathcal{V}[f] . \\mathcal{V}[f]$ stands between two IMs, referred to as the left and right mechanisms. The state of $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ consists of the sequence of messages it has received from the left mechanism so far. Upon receiving a message $m$ from the left mechanism, $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ appends $m$ to its state and applies the verification function $f$. If the sequence is $f$-valid, then $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ forwards the message $m$ to the right mechanism; otherwise, it halts the communication. $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ forwards any message from the right mechanism unchanged to the left mechanism.\n\nRemark 3.6. By definition, for any continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ and any verification function $f$, $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is an IM with two possible initial states. The mechanism $\\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ accepts messages of the form $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right)$, where both $m_{0}$ and $m_{1}$ are in the query space $Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$. Therefore, when analyzing $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$, we assume that the verification function $f$ always returns $\\perp$ whenever a message in its input sequence is not in $Q_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$, even if not explicitly say so.\n\nRemark 3.6 implies that $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ can interact with any other IM. Thus, in the following definition of DP for CMs, we can use the general definition of adversaries given in Definition 2.11,\n\nwithout making any assumptions about the family of adversaries. Instead of defining DP w.r.t. neighboring relations, we introduce a more general formulation in terms of verification functions, as follows:\n\nDefinition 3.7 ( $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-Differential Privacy for CMs). Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a CM and $f$ a verification function. We say that $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private (or $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP for short) w.r.t. $f$ against adaptive adversaries if for any adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the random variables $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ and $\\operatorname{View}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*}$ $\\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M})$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable.\n\nLet $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}=\\left\\{s^{\\text {init }}\\right\\}$ be the initial state space of the continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ in Definition 3.7. By definition, the initial state spaces of $\\mathcal{I}$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ are $\\{0,1\\}$ and $\\{()\\}$, respectively. Thus, the initial state space of $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is $\\left\\{\\left((\\left.(), 0, s^{\\text {init }}\\right),\\left((), 1, s^{\\text {init }}\\right)\\right\\}$. Define $\\sim_{01}$ as a neighboring on this set, where only $\\left((), 0, s^{\\text {init }}\\right) \\sim_{01}\\left((), 1, s^{\\text {init }}\\right)$. Comparing Definition 3.7 and Definition 2.12 leads to the following corollary:\nCorollary 3.8. A continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f$ against adaptive adversaries if and only if the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the neighboring relation $\\sim_{01}$ against adaptive adversaries.\nCMs vs. IMs. In principle, CMs are a special class of IMs with a singleton initial state space. Conversely, as described earlier, IMs can be represented by CMs. Both CMs and IMs are defined by a randomized function mapping a state and query message to another state and an answer message, where message is a general concept. The key distinction between CMs and IMs lies in how differential privacy is defined for each.\n\nBy Definition 2.6, the initial state space of IMs contains multiple states, and DP for IMs is defined based on the neighboring initial states. However, by Definition 3.7, the initial state space of CMs is singleton, and a verifier forces an adversary to generate pairs such that the sequences of the first and second elements of the pairs satisfy certain properties. While the adversary chooses these two mechanisms, the identifier selects one of them to forward. Thus, the definition of DP for CMs is based on a bit.",

Concurrent Composition of Continual Mechanisms \n\nComposition of NIMs. For $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, let $\\mathcal{N}_{i}$ be an NIM with input domain $\\mathcal{X}_{i}$, and let $\\sim_{i}$ be a neighboring relation on $\\mathcal{X}_{i}$. The composition of the NIMs $\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}$ is represented by a non-interactive mechanism $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\right]$ with the domain $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathcal{X}_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathcal{X}_{k}$. This mechanism takes a tuple of datasets $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ as input and returns\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\right](x)=\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nDefine $\\sim$ as a neighboring relation on $\\mathcal{X}$, where two tuples $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ and $x^{\\prime}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, x_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)$ satisfy $x \\sim x^{\\prime}$ if and only if $x_{i} \\sim_{i} x_{i}^{\\prime}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$. The composition of NIMs $\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}$ is said to be $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP if the non-interactive mechanism $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\right]$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $\\sim$ (see Definition 2.2).\n\nIn the proofs of this section, we consider $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\right]$ not as a non-interactive, but instead as an interactive mechanism with initial state space $\\mathcal{X}$ that receives $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ not as input, but instead as its first message. Immediately after receiving this message it executes $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{k}\\right]$ on its initial state and returns its output. Upon receiving a second message, this interactive mechanism halts the communication.\nConcurrent Composition of IMs. Vadhan and Wang [20] extended the definition of the composition of NIMs to the concurrent composition of IMs, where an adversary interacts with $k$ interactive mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ at the same time. In concurrent composition, the adversary generates a message and determines the receiver of this message (one of the $\\mathcal{M}_{i} \\mathrm{~s}$ ) adaptively based on all the previous messages exchanged between the adversary and the mechanisms $M_{1}, \\ldots, M_{k}$. To\n\nformalize this, Vadhan and Wang [20] introduced an interactive mechanism ConComp[ $\\left.\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}\\right]$, which internally runs $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ and, upon receiving a message $(q, j)$, forwards the query $q$ to $\\mathcal{M}_{j}$ and returns its response.\n\nThe initial state space of $\\operatorname{ConComp}\\left[\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}\\right]$ is $S_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}^{\\text {init }} \\times \\cdots \\times S_{\\mathcal{M}_{k}}^{\\text {init }}$, where $S_{\\mathcal{M}_{i}}^{\\text {init }}$ is the initial state space of $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$. Let $\\sim_{i}$ be a neighboring relation on each $S_{\\mathcal{M}_{i}}^{\\text {init }}$, and define the neighboring relation $\\sim$ on $S_{\\mathcal{M}_{1}}^{\\text {init }} \\times \\cdots \\times S_{\\mathcal{M}_{k}}^{\\text {init }}$ as follows: for any two initial states $s=\\left(s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k}\\right)$ and $s^{\\prime}=\\left(s_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, s_{k}^{\\prime}\\right)$, we have $s \\sim s^{\\prime}$ if and only if $s_{i} \\sim_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}$ for every $i \\in[k]$.\n\nVadhan and Wang [20] show that if each IM $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $\\epsilon_{i}$-DP w.r.t $\\sim_{i}$, and if the composition of NIMs $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, 0}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, 0}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then $\\operatorname{ConComp}\\left[\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}\\right]$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against an adaptive adversary. Lyu [18] extends this result for $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP IMs.\n\nIn the concurrent composition of IMs, queries asked to each mechanism are chosen adaptively, not only based on that mechanism's previous responses but also using the responses of the other mechanisms up to that point. The results of [20] and [18] show that this concurrency and additional adaptivity do not compromise privacy guarantees. As a result, all $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP composition theorems for NIMs, such as the basic [6], advanced [9], and optimal [15] composition theorems, can also be applied to the concurrent composition of IMs.\nConcurrent Composition of CMs. We extend the definition of the concurrent composition for IMs to the concurrent composition of CMs, where an adversary can create new CMs or ask pairs of queries from the existing ones. Depending on the type of composition, the created mechanisms are constrained, and the sequence of query pairs asked from each CM satisfies certain properties. Based on a secret bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, each CM either receives the first element of every query pair asked from it or the second element. In Section 4.1, we generalize ConComp to ExtConComp and give a formal definition for the concurrent composition of CMs.\n\nTo extend Lyu's result on the privacy guarantee of the concurrent composition of IMs to the concurrent composition of CMs, we want to use the following intermediate lemma from their paper: For every $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ and any pair of neighboring initial states $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$ for $\\mathcal{M}$, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the IMs $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{M}(b)$ are equivalent. However, as we discuss in Section 4.2, there are hidden assumptions in the proof of this lemma. Additionally, we show there that the construction of $\\mathcal{P}$ in [20], for $\\epsilon_{i}$-DP IMs, satisfies a property, required for a later proof.\n\nIn Section 4.3, we analyze the privacy of the concurrent composition of $k$ fixed $\\mathrm{CMs} \\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$. In this composition, the adversary first creates the mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ and then asks pairs of queries from each mechanism, ensuring that the sequence of query pairs for each mechanism is valid. In Section 4.4, we extend this composition by fixing $k$ privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ and allowing the adversary to adaptively choose the $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ over time.\n4.1. Formalization. We extend the definition of ConComp in [20] and introduce ExtConComp that allows the creation of new mechanisms in addition to queries to existing ones. A creation query $(\\mathcal{M}, s, \\epsilon, \\delta, f)$ is a message that requests the creation of a continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ with the initial state $s$ and asserts that $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the verification function $f$. The mechanism ExtConComp accepts creation queries and messages of the form $(q, i)$, where $q$ is a query for the $i$-th created mechanism. The formal definition of ExtConComp is as follows:\nDefinition 4.1. Extended concurrent composition, ExtConComp, is a continual mechanism that receives two types of messages:\n\n- A creation query $(\\mathcal{M}, s, \\epsilon, \\delta, f)$, where $\\mathcal{M}$ is a CM with a single initial state $s$ that is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f$, and\n- a query-index pair $(q, i)$, where $i$ is a positive integer, and $q$ is any message.\n\nUpon receiving $(\\mathcal{M}, s, \\epsilon, \\delta, f)$, ExtConComp creates an instance of $\\mathcal{M}$ with the initial state $s$, and when receiving $(q, i)$, it forwards $q$ to the $i$-th created mechanism and returns its response. If less than\n\n$i$ mechanisms have been created, ExtConComp halts the communication. The state of ExtConComp is a sequence of pairs $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}, s_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, where the $i$-th pair represents the $i$-th created mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ and its current state $s_{i}^{\\prime}$. The single initial state space of ExtConComp is the empty sequence () . Both query set and answer set of ExtConComp are the universal message set $\\mathcal{U}$ in Remark 3.4.\n\nTo define DP for the extended concurrent composition, we must impose constraints on the created mechanisms and their query pairs to limit the adversary's power. We force a set of constraints using a verifier $\\mathcal{V}[f]$, where $f$ is a verification function returning $\\perp$ whenever the adversary misbehaves. We define variants of the concurrent composition of CMs by choosing different verification functions $f$ :\n\nDefinition 4.2. For any verification function $f$, the $f$-concurrent composition of CMs is the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp.\n\nDifferential privacy for the $f$-concurrent composition of CMs follows the standard definition for IMs:\n\nDefinition 4.3 (DP for $f$-Concurrent Composition of CMs). For a verification function $f$ and privacy parameter $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, the $f$-concurrent composition of CMs is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against adaptive adversaries if the interactive mechanism $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $\\sim_{01}$. Equivalently, this holds if the continual mechanism ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$ against adaptive adversaries.\n\nAlthough verification functions $f$ for ExtConComp vary for different compositions, they must all ensure that the format of the adversary's messages is compatible with $\\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp. An adversary is expected to either create a new CM or send a pair of queries to an existing one. The creation of a new mechanism is independent of the initial state of $\\mathcal{I}$. Thus, when requesting the creation of a new mechanism, the adversary must send a pair of identical creation queries to $\\mathcal{V}[f]$. Moreover, due to the definition of $\\mathcal{I}$ and ExtConComp, to request asking one of the queries $q_{0}$ and $q_{1}$ from the $i$-th created mechanism according to $\\mathcal{I}$ 's initial state, the adversary must send the message $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, i\\right),\\left(q_{1}, i\\right)\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{V}[f]$.\n\nNext, we formalize these shared constraints by defining suitable message sequences. Later, when defining specific verification functions $f$ for different concurrent compositions, we set $f\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}\\right)=$ $\\perp$ whenever the sequence of messages $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}$ is not suitable.\nDefinition 4.4 (Suitable Sequence of Messages). A sequence of messages $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}$ is suitable if for every $1 \\leq j \\leq k$, (i) $m_{j}$ is of the form $\\left(m_{j}^{0}, m_{j}^{1}\\right)$, where $m_{j}^{0}$ and $m_{j}^{1}$ are either identical creation queries or messages of the forms $\\left(q_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ell\\right)$ with the same index $\\ell$; (ii) for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, if $m_{j}^{b}=(q, \\ell)$, then there are at least $\\ell$ creation queries in the sequence $m_{1}^{b}, \\ldots, m_{j-1}^{b}$; (iii) for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, if $m_{j}^{b}=(q, \\ell)$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}$ is the $\\ell$-th mechanism requested to be created in $m_{1}^{b}, \\ldots, m_{j-1}^{b}$, then $q$ is in the query space of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}$, i.e., $q \\in Q_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\ell}}$; and (iv) if $m_{j}^{0}=m_{j}^{1}=(\\mathcal{M}, s, \\epsilon, \\delta, f)$, then $\\mathcal{M}$ is a CM with a single initial state $s$, and it is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$.\n4.2. $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP IMs and $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$. Lyu [18] shows that for every $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP IM $\\mathcal{M}$ and every pair of neighboring initial states $s_{0}$ and $s_{1}$, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ (with a single initial state) such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ are identical. Vadhan and Wang [20] show the same result in the special case where $\\delta=0$.\n\nAlthough not explicitly stated, the constructions of $\\mathcal{T}$ proposed in both [18] and [20] require the answer distributions of $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ to be discrete. This assumption is formally defined as:\nDefinition 4.5. An IM $\\mathcal{M}$ has discrete answer distributions if $A_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is countable, and for every initial state $s$, integer $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, history $\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}\\right) \\in\\left(Q_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times A_{\\mathcal{M}}\\right)^{t-1}$, and new query $q_{t} \\in Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$, the distribution of $\\mathcal{M}(s)$ 's answer in respond to $q_{t}$ conditioned on having the history $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)$ has a probability mass function (PMF).\n\nThis is generally not a restrictive assumption in differential privacy. In practice, the binary nature of computers and the fact that the total number of memory bits in the world is finite ensure that every distribution sampled computationally is inherently discrete. Theoretically, when dealing with real-valued outputs, one can enforce discrete answer distributions by rounding each output to the nearest multiple of a sufficiently small constant $\\alpha$. This discretization post-processing preserves the privacy of the mechanism and has a negligible effect on the accuracy. An example of this approach will be provided in Section 7.\n\nLyu [18] additionally assumes that there exists a pre-fixed upper bound $c$ on the number of queries $\\mathcal{M}$ answers. In Appendix A, we will modify their proof to remove this additional assumption. Let $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ be a continual mechanism that is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f$. By Corollary 3.8, $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ is an IM that is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $\\sim_{01}$. Replacing $\\mathcal{M}$ in Lemma A. 1 with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$, we get:\n\nLemma 4.6 ([18]). For $\\epsilon>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a CM that is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f$. Suppose $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ has discrete answer distributions and responds to at most $c$ queries. Then, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ with a single initial state () such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the IMs $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ are equivalent.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be an IM that is $\\epsilon$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim$. For every pair of neighboring initial states $s_{0}$ and $s_{1}$, Vadhan and Wang [20] construct an IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ (with a single initial state) such that for each bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ are identical. Appendix B, we will review their construction and show that for any query sequence $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$, if the distributions of the $t$ answers of $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ to the queries $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$ are identical, then $\\mathcal{T}$ does not need to know the output of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ in the first $t$ steps. This observation allows us to delay the interaction of $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\operatorname{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ as much as possible.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$, where $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ is an $\\epsilon$-DP CM w.r.t. $f$. By definition, upon receiving a query sequence $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$ where each $q_{j}=\\left(q_{j}^{\\prime}, q_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is a pair of identical queries, $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ have the same answer distribution, implying the following lemma:\n\nLemma 4.7 ([20]). For $\\epsilon \\geq 0$, let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a CM that is $\\epsilon$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f$. Suppose $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ has discrete answer distributions. Then, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ with a single initial state () such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$,\n\n- the IMs $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}$ are equivalent, and\n- as long as $\\mathcal{T}$ receives pairs of identical queries, it does not interact with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$.\n\nRemark 4.8. Since $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$ is a NIM, in both Lemma 4.6 and Lemma 4.7, the IPM $\\mathcal{T}$ interacts with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$ at most once.\n4.3. Concurrent Composition of CMs $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$. For $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, let $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ be a CM with the initial state space $S_{i}=\\left\\{s_{i}\\right\\}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{i}$, and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ has discrete answer distributions. In the concurrent composition of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$, an adversary is restricted to the following steps: (1) It first creates the fixed mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ and (2) then adaptively issues pairs of queries for them such that the sequences of query pairs for each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $f_{i}$-valid. Note that creating the $\\mathrm{CM} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ means creating an instance of $\\mathcal{M}_{i}\\left(s_{i}\\right)$, where $s_{i}$ is the unique initial state of $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$. Based on a secret bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, each CM either receives the first element of every query pair addressed to it or the second element, and the adversary tries to guess $b$ using the answers of all $k$ mechanisms.\n\nTo formalize this type of concurrent composition of CMs, we introduce the verification function $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$. Intuitively, this verification function enforces that the adversary creates the mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ in their first $k$ messages and then only sends messages containing pairs of queries for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ s. Additionally, it ensures that the sequence of query pairs for each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $f_{i}$-valid. The formal definition of $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$ is as follows:\n\nDefinition 4.9 $\\left(f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}\\right)$. For $i \\in[k]$, let $\\alpha_{i}=\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}, s_{i}, \\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}, f_{i}\\right)$ denote a creation query. For any input sequence of messages $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$, the outcome of $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$ returns $\\top$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:\n(i) The sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{k}$ is suitable. For $j \\in[t]$, let $m_{j}=\\left(m_{j}^{0}, m_{j}^{1}\\right)$.\n(ii) For $j \\leq \\min \\{t, k\\}$, the messages $m_{j}^{0}=m_{j}^{1}=\\alpha_{j}$.\n(iii) For $i \\in[k]$, the sequence of $\\left(q^{0}, q^{1}\\right)$ s in the messages of the form $\\left(\\left(q^{0}, i\\right),\\left(q^{1}, i\\right)\\right)$ is $f_{i}$-valid.\n\nWith the above definition of $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$, we refer to the $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$-concurrent composition of CMs as the concurrent composition of the continual mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$. Therefore, the concurrent composition of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against adaptive adversaries if ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$ against adaptive adversaries.\n\nRecall that in Section 3, we generalized the notion of neighboring relations for interactive mechanisms to verification functions for continual mechanisms. The neighboring initial states for an interactive mechanism are chosen non-adaptively at initialization. However, the choice of messages forming a valid sequence w.r.t. a verification function is adaptive and happens over time. That is, an adversary generates two different query sequences for a CM, and the choice of differing sequences is made adaptively throughout the interaction.\n\nIn the concurrent composition of IMs, queries to each mechanism are chosen adaptively, not only based on that mechanism's previous responses but also using the responses of the other mechanisms up to that point. By definition, the choice of neighboring initial states for the interactive mechanisms is non-adaptive. However, in the concurrent composition of CMs, the choice of differences between query sequences, i.e., the neighboring query sequences is adaptive, based on not only the responses of the corresponding mechanism but also the responses of other mechanisms. (Note that, unlike IMs, CMs inherently have a single fixed initial state; hence, no choice of initial state is involved.) Despite this additional adaptivity, in the following theorem, we show that the privacy results of [18] for $\\operatorname{ConComp}\\left[\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}\\right]$ also hold for $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp.\n\nTheorem 4.10. For $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, let $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ be a continual mechanism with initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{M}_{i}}^{\\text {init }}=\\left\\{s_{i}\\right\\}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ is $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{i}$ against adaptive adversaries, and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ has discrete answer distributions. For $\\epsilon>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, if the composition of non-interactive mechanisms $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then the concurrent composition of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against adaptive adversaries.\n\nProof. Let $\\alpha_{i}=\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}, s_{i}, \\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}, f_{i}\\right)$ for each $i \\in[k]$, and let $f$ denote $f^{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{k}}$ for simplicity. Our goal is to show that ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$. To prove so, we construct an IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ with a single initial state and show that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((b)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$ are equivalent.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}$ is an IPM with a single initial state, Lemma 2.15 implies that if $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ DP. Hence, for any adversary $\\mathcal{A}$, the views of $\\mathcal{A}$ when interacting with the mechanisms $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((0)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((1)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$ are $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable. As we will show below, by construction, these views are identical to those obtained by interacting with the original mechanisms $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, implying that the concurrent composition of $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP.\n\nIn $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, when $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ receives pairs of identical creation queries from $\\mathcal{V}[f]$, it forwards one of them to ExtConComp, which then creates an instance of $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ and returns $\\top$. Subsequently, when $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ receives two queries for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$, it forwards them to $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ through ExtConComp and returns its response. This procedure can be equivalently represented by an IM $\\operatorname{IECC}(b)$ as follows: when receiving pairs of identical creation queries from $\\mathcal{V}[f], \\operatorname{IECC}(b)$ creates an instance of $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ and returns $\\top$. Subsequently, when receiving $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, i\\right),\\left(q_{1}, i\\right)\\right)$, it forwards $\\left(q_{0}, q_{1}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ and returns its response. By definition of $f$ and $\\mathcal{I}$, the mechanisms\n\n$\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{IECC}(b)$ are equivalent. Next, we define $\\mathcal{P}$ explicitly and show $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{IECC}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ Comp $\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((b)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$ are equivalent.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$ be the IPM for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ given by Lemma 4.6, and let $t_{i}$ be its single initial state. The initial state of $\\mathcal{P}$ is a pair of empty sequences. Let $\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)$ denote the state of $\\mathcal{P}$. When receiving the first left message, $\\mathcal{P}$ interacts with its right mechanism, Comp $\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((b)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$, and sets $\\sigma_{1}$ to its output sequence $\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{k}\\right) . \\mathcal{P}$ never interacts with its right mechanism again.\n\nUpon receiving a left message $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}, s_{i}, \\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}, f_{i}\\right)^{2}, \\mathcal{P}$ adds $\\left(\\mathcal{T}_{i}, t_{i}\\right)$ to $\\sigma_{2}$ and returns $\\top$. Moreover, upon receiving a left message $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, i\\right),\\left(q_{1}, i\\right)\\right), \\mathcal{P}$ sends $\\left(q_{0}, q_{1}\\right)$ as a left message to $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$ and returns its response. If $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$ requests a sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}}, \\mathcal{P}$ provides it with the previously stored sample $r_{i}$. Formally, $\\mathcal{P}$ executes $\\left(t_{i}, v, m\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{T}_{i}\\left(t_{i}, \\mathrm{~L},\\left(q_{0}, q_{1}\\right)\\right)$ and as long as $v=\\mathrm{R}$, it runs $\\left(t_{i}, v, m\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{T}_{i}\\left(t_{i}, v, r_{i}\\right)$. Once $v=\\mathrm{L}, \\mathcal{P}$ returns the message $m$ to $\\mathcal{V}[f]$. (By Remark 4.8, $v=\\mathrm{R}$ at most once.) By Lemma 4.6, each $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$, provided with the sample $r_{i}$ from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}}$, simulates $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ identically. Hence, by definition of IECC and $\\mathcal{P}$, the mechanisms $\\operatorname{IECC}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]((b)_{\\epsilon=1}^{k})$ are equivalent, finishing the proof.\n4.4. Concurrent Composition of CMs with Fixed Parameters. The concurrent composition of CMs with fixed parameters generalizes the concurrent composition of fixed CMs by allowing the adversary to select the CMs $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ adaptively over time, instead of forcing them to create a fixed set of mechanisms in their first $k$ messages. Each selected mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must be $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{i}$, where the multiset of privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ is fixed in advance, but the verification functions $f_{i}$ are chosen by the adversary. Note that this implies that at most $k$ continual mechanism are created by the adversary. Moreover, due to the aforementioned technical reasons, each $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must have discrete answer distributions.\n\nFor instance, an adversary may first create a continual mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$ that is $\\left(\\epsilon_{3}, \\delta_{3}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{3}$. Then, after interacting with $\\mathcal{M}_{3}$ for some time and analyzing its responses, the adversary may then select a mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ from the class of $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right)$-DP CMs. Similar to the concurrent composition of fixed CMs, the adversary's sequence of query pairs for each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must be $f_{i}$-valid.\n\nTo formally define this composition, we introduce a verification function, $f^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ as follows:\nDefinition 4.11 $\\left(f^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right)$. For any input sequence of messages $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$, the function $f^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ returns $\\top$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:\n(i) The sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$ is suitable.\n(ii) There are at most $k$ pairs of identical creation queries in the sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$. Let $\\mathcal{M}_{i}^{\\prime}$ denote the $i$-th created mechanism and $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $f_{i}^{\\prime}$ be its privacy parameters and verification function, respectively. $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{i}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{i}^{\\prime}$ has discrete answer distributions. Moreover, the multiset of the privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ of the created mechanisms is a sub-multiset of the fixed privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$. Note that $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is adaptively chosen by the adversary, while $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$ is a predetermined publicly-known parameter.\n(iii) For each $i \\in[k]$, the sequence of $\\left(q^{0}, q^{1}\\right)$ s in the messages of the form $\\left(\\left(q^{0}, i\\right),\\left(q^{1}, i\\right)\\right)$ is $f_{i}^{\\prime}$-valid.\n\nWe refer to the $f^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$-concurrent composition of CMs as the concurrent composition of CMs with privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i=1}^{k}$. A slight adaptation of the proof of Theorem 4.10 implies the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 4.12. For $\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}>0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\delta_{k} \\leq 1$, if the composition of non-interactive mechanisms $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then the concurrent composition of $k$ CMs with the privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i=1}^{k}$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against adaptive adversaries.\n\nProof. The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 4.10 with the following modification in the construction of $\\mathcal{P}$ : Recall that $\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{k}\\right)$ denotes the output of $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left[\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right]$. In the proof of Theorem 4.10, the $i$-th creation query was known to be $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}, s_{i}, \\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}, f_{i}\\right)$. Consequently, $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$\n\nexpected $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}}$ as its right mechanism, and when $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$ needed a response from its right mechanism, $\\mathcal{P}$ sent $r_{i}$ to it. However, in the concurrent composition with fixed parameters, the IPM requesting the sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}}$ need not necessarily be $\\mathcal{T}_{i}$. To handle this, we modify $\\mathcal{P}$ so that it maps each output sample $r_{i}$ to the appropriate IPM $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ needing a sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}}$.\n\nLet $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}, s_{j}^{\\prime}, \\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}, f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ denote the $j$-th pair of identical creation queries received by $\\mathcal{P}$ from the verifier, and let $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ be the corresponding IPM given by Lemma 4.6. When $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ requests a sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}, \\mathcal{P}$ iterates over $\\sigma_{1}$ to find the smallest $i^{*} \\in[k]$ such that the $i^{*}$-th element of $\\sigma_{1}$ is not null and $\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}=\\epsilon_{i^{*}}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}=\\delta_{i^{*}}$. After sending $r_{i^{*}}$ to $\\mathcal{T}_{j}, \\mathcal{P}$ updates $\\sigma_{1}$ and sets $r_{i}$ to null. This adjustment ensures that even when there are duplicate privacy parameters among $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$, each sample $r_{i}$ is sent to at most one $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$. Note that by the definition of $f^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}, i^{*}$ always exists.",

Concurrent Parallel Composition of CMs \n\nThe concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition extends the concurrent composition of CMs with $k$ fixed parameters by permitting the creation of an arbitrary number of CMs. Specifically, given a multiset params of $k$ privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$, the adversary can create an unlimited number of CMs with arbitrary privacy parameters. However, the adversary must ask pairs of identical queries to all created mechanisms, except for at most $k$ of them. Let $\\mathcal{M}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{M}_{k}$ be these exceptional mechanisms. Each $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$, selected by the adversary, must be $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{i}$ and with $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right) \\in$ params, and the sequence of query pairs for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ must be $f_{i}$-valid.\n\nIn Section 5.1, we formally define this composition and extend the result of Theorem 4.12 to the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs when $\\delta_{1}=\\cdots=\\delta_{k}=0$. In Section 5.2, we provide a counter example that demonstrates why such an extension is impossible for $\\delta_{j}>0$.\n\nIn Section 5.3, we restrict the verification functions $f_{i}$ of the $k$ mechanisms receiving neighboring input and we show that Theorem 4.12 holds for the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CM in this scenario without any constraints on the values of $\\delta_{j}$.\n5.1. Definition and Composition Theorem for Pure DP. To formally define the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs with parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i=1}^{k}$, we introduce the verification function $f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$, where the subscript $\\infty$ emphasizes that an unbounded number of CMs can be created.\n\nDefinition 5.1 $\\left(f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right)$. For any input sequence of messages $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$, the function $f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ returns $\\top$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:\n(i) The sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$ is suitable.\n(ii) Let $\\mathcal{M}_{i}^{\\prime}$ denote the $i$-th created mechanism and $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $f_{i}^{\\prime}$ be its privacy parameters and verification function, respectively. Define $\\mathcal{J}$ as the set of indices $j$ such that there exists a message $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$ where $q_{0} \\neq q_{1}$. Let params $_{\\mathcal{J}}$ denote the multiset consisting of privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ for each $j \\in \\mathcal{J}$. This condition requires that params $_{\\mathcal{J}}$ be a sub-multiset of the fixed privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$. Note that this implies that $|\\mathcal{J}| \\leq k$.\n(iii) For every $j \\in \\mathcal{J}$, the sequence of $\\left(q_{0}, q_{1}\\right) s$ in the messages of the form $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$ must be $f_{i}$-valid. Note that by definition, for every index $j \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and every message of the form $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$, it holds that $q_{0}=q_{1}$.\n\nWe refer to the $f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$-concurrent composition of CMs as the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs with privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i=1}^{k}$. Therefore, this composition is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ DP against adaptive adversaries if ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ against adaptive adversaries.\n\nTheorem 5.2. For $\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k} \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$, if the composition of non-interactive mechanisms $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, 0}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, 0}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs with the privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, 0\\right)$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against an adaptive adversary.\n\nProof. The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 4.12, except for the definition of IPMs $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ that are executed by the IPM $\\mathcal{P}$. Let $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}, s_{j}^{\\prime}, \\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}, f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ denote the $j$-th pair of identical creation queries received by $\\mathcal{P}$ from $\\mathcal{V}[f]$. To ensure that the proof of Theorem 4.12 remains valid, we must guarantee that the newly defined IPMs $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ satisfy the following properties needed by the proof of Theorem 4.12. These are the only properties that this proof requires for the $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\mathrm{~s}$ :\n\n- The mechanisms $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ are equivalent, and\n- the multiset of privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ corresponding to IMPs $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ that are interacting with their right mechanism $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$ is a sub-multiset of $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, 0\\right)$, implying that the remaining $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ never interact with a $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$.\nThe new definition of $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ is as follows:\n- If $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}>0$, then $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ acts identical to $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}: \\mathcal{T}_{j}$ has a single initial state $\\left((), 0, s^{\\text {init }}\\right)$, where $s^{\\text {init }}$ is the single initial state of $\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$. Upon receiving a right message, $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ halts the communication, and upon receiving a left message, it updates its state and responds identically to $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$.\n- If $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}=0$, then $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ is the IPM corresponding to $\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ given by Lemma 4.7.\n\nBy Definition 5.1 (ii), if $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}>0$, then all future messages $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$ satisfy $q_{0}=q_{1}$. Therefore, by the above definition, for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ are identical, and $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ never interacts with $\\operatorname{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$.\n\nMoreover, when $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}=0$, by Definition 5.1 (iii), Lemma 4.7, and Remark 4.8, for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$ and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ are identical, and $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ interacts with $\\operatorname{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}(b)$ at most once after receiving a pair of non-identical queries.\n\nIn the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition, an unlimited number of CMs can be created, but only at most $k$ of them (here, with $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}=0$ ) can receive non-identical query pairs. By Definition 5.1 (ii), the privacy parameters of these mechanisms is a sub-multiset of $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, 0\\right)$. By design, the IPMs $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ corresponding to these mechanisms may require a sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, 0}$.\n5.2. Counter Example. In this section, we illustrate that extending the result of Theorem 5.2 to general $\\delta_{j}>0$ is impossible. Specifically, let $k=1, \\epsilon_{1}=0$, and $\\delta_{1}=\\delta \\in(0,1]$. We construct, an adversary $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ that interacts with $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{0, \\delta}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and successfully determines the secret bit $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$. Our construction proceeds in three steps: (1) introducing a verification function $g$, (2) constructing a CM $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ that is $(0, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $g$, and (3) designing $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$.\n\nStep 1 (Introducing $g$ ): The verification function $g$ accepts a message sequence $\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right)$ and returns $\\top$ if and only if (i) $t \\leq 2$, (ii) each $m_{j}$ is a pair of binary numbers $\\left(b_{j}, b_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in\\{0,1\\}^{2}$, and (ii) the sequences $\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, b_{t}^{\\prime}\\right)$ differ in at most a single element.\nStep 2 (Constructing $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ ): The CM $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}:\\{\\perp, \\top\\} \\times\\{0,1\\} \\rightarrow\\{\\perp, \\top\\} \\times\\{0,1, \\top, \\perp\\}$ with the initial state space $\\{\\top\\}$ is defined as follows:\n\n- $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ maps state $\\top$ and an input message $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ to state $\\top$ and output message $\\top$ with probability $1-\\delta$ and to state $\\perp$ and output message $\\perp$ with probability $\\delta$.\n- $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ maps state $\\perp$ and an input message $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ to state $\\perp$ and output message $b$ with probability 1 .\nThus, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ has two possible states, $\\top$ and $\\perp$, and accepts binary queries. Initially, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ starts in state $\\top$. On the first query, independent of the value of $b$, it switches to state $\\perp$ with probability $\\delta$ and returns its final state as an output message. On the second query, if the state is $\\top$, the same\n\nas the first query, it switches to state $\\perp$ with probability $\\delta$ and returns the final state as output. However, if the state is $\\perp, \\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ outputs the exact input message $b$.\n\nSince with probability $1-\\delta$, the first two outputs of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ are independent of the input, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ is $(0, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the verification function $g$.\nStep 3 (Designing $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ ): In the interaction with $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{0, \\delta}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, the adversary $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ must determine the secret bit $b . \\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ accepts messages in $\\{0,1, \\top, \\perp\\}$ and sends the following messages: (a) the message $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}, \\top, 0, \\delta, g\\right)^{2}$, which is a pair of identical creation queries requesting the creation of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$, and (b) messages of the form $\\left(\\left(b_{0}, j\\right),\\left(b_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$, where $b_{0}, b_{1} \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ starts the communication by sending $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}, \\top, 0, \\delta, g\\right)^{2}$ and setting its state $s=1$. While receiving $T$ as a response, it increments $s$ and alternates its queries:\n\n- If $s$ is odd, it sends $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}, \\top, 0, \\delta, g\\right)^{2}$.\n- If $s$ is even, it sends $((0, s / 2),(0, s / 2))$.\n\nIn this iterative procedure, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ keeps creating a new instance of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ and asking the query pair $(0,0)$ from it until one instance returns $\\perp$. Since ExtConComp always returns $T$ when creating a mechanism, this loop stops upon receiving a respond to $((0, s / 2),(0, s / 2))$.\n\nOnce $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ receives $\\perp$, without increasing $s$, it sends $((0, s / 2),(1, s / 2))$. That is, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ asks the pair $(0,1)$ from the last created instance of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$, which has returned $\\perp$. If the initial state of the identifier $\\mathcal{I}$ in $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{0, \\delta}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $b$, then $\\mathcal{M}_{\\delta}$ receives the query $b$, and by definition it will return $b$ as output, revealing the secret bit $b$.\n\nTherefore, with probability $1-(1-\\delta)^{t}$, the adversary $\\mathcal{A}_{\\delta}$ can detect the secret bit $b$ by sending at most $2 t+1$ queries. Since $\\delta>0$, as $t$ goes to infinity, this probability tends to 1 .\n5.3. Composition Theorem for Restricted Verification Functions. In Section 5.2, we showed that for any positive $\\delta$, the concurrent 1-sparse parallel composition of CMs with the privacy parameter $(0, \\delta)$ fails to preserve privacy. In our counterexample, the adversary leveraged the first outcome of a $(0, \\delta)$-DP CM to decide whether to spend its budget on issuing non-identical queries to that mechanism. Intuitively, when $\\delta>0$, there might exist certain \"bad first answers\" that occur with low probability; however, once we condition on their occurrences, the distribution of the second answer ceases to be differentially private.\n\nIn this section, we force the adversary to decide whether it will always issue pairs of identical queries to a CM when it sends the first message to that mechanism. Specifically, if the first message sent to a CM includes identical queries, then all subsequent messages for that CM must also have identical queries. This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 5.3 (First-Pair Consistent). A verification function $f$ is first-pair consistent if the following holds: given an input message sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}, f$ returns $\\perp$ if $m_{1}$ is a pair of identical messages, i.e., $m_{1}=\\left(m^{\\prime}, m^{\\prime}\\right)$ for some $m^{\\prime}$, while there exists $2 \\leq j \\leq t$ such that $m_{j}$ is not a pair of identical messages.\n\nFor instance, let $\\mathcal{M}$ be an IM that is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim$. As discussed in Section 3.1, $\\mathcal{M}$ can be represented by a $\\mathrm{CM} \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ (with initial state null) that receives an initial state $s \\in S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$ as the first message and behaves the same as $\\mathcal{M}(s)$ afterwards. Define the verification function $f_{\\sim}$ as follows: given an input message sequence $\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right), f_{\\sim}$ returns $T$ if and only if $m_{1}$ is a pair of neighboring initial states in $S_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text {init }}$, and for all $2 \\leq j \\leq t, m_{j}$ is a pair of identical queries in $Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$. By definition, $f_{\\sim}$ is first-pair consistent.\n\nTo formally define the restricted variant of the concurrent parallel composition of CMs, we introduce the verification function $f_{\\infty, F P C}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$, where $F P C$ stands for first-pair consistency.\nDefinition 5.4 $\\left(f_{\\infty, F P C}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\right)$. For any input message sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$, the function $f_{\\infty, F P C}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ returns $T$ if and only if both of the following conditions hold:\n(i) $f_{\\infty}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}\\left(m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}\\right)=\\top$\n\n(ii) For every message $m_{j}$ of the form $\\left(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}, s^{\\prime}, \\epsilon^{\\prime}, \\delta^{\\prime}, f^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$, the verification function $f^{\\prime}$ is first-pair consistent.\n\nWe refer to the $f_{\\infty, F P C}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$-concurrent composition of CMs as the FPC concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs with privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)_{i=1}^{k}\\right.$.\nTheorem 5.5. For $\\epsilon, \\epsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k} \\geq 0$ and $0 \\leq \\delta, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\delta_{k} \\leq 1$, if the composition of non-interactive mechanisms $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, then the FPC concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs with the privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, 0\\right)$ is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP against an adaptive adversary.\nProof. We denote $f$ as shorthand for $f_{\\infty, F P C}^{\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}}$. This proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 5.2, except for the following modification in the definition of $\\mathcal{P}$ : In the proof of Theorem 5.2, each $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ behaved identically to $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ if $\\delta_{j}^{\\prime}>0$ and was defined according to Lemma 4.7 otherwise. In this proof, each $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ behaves identically to $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$ if the first message of the form $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$ satisfies $q_{0}=q_{1}$, and it is defined by Lemma 4.6 otherwise.\n\nTo implement this, $\\mathcal{P}$ 's state must include an additional sequence $\\sigma_{3}$, storing a flag for each created mechanism, indicating whether the mechanism has previously received any messages. When $\\mathcal{P}$ receives the creation query pair $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}, s_{j}^{\\prime}, \\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}, f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ from the verifier, it adds the pair $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}, s_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ to $\\sigma_{2}$, appends a 0 to the end of $\\sigma_{3}$, and returns $\\top$.\n\nUpon receiving a message of the form $\\left(\\left(q_{0}, j\\right),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$, if the $j$-th element of $\\sigma_{3}$ is $0, \\mathcal{P}$ sets this element to 1 and replaces the entry $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}, s_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ in $\\sigma_{2}$ with $\\left(\\mathcal{T}_{j}, t_{j}\\right)$, defined as follows:\n\n- If $q_{0}=q_{1}$, then $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ is an IPM with the single initial state $s_{j}^{\\prime}$ that never interacts with its right mechanism and interacts with its left mechanism exactly as $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f_{j}^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$.\n- If $q_{0} \\neq q_{1}$, then $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ is the IPM defined by Lemma 4.6 corresponding to $\\mathcal{M}_{j}^{\\prime}$.\n$\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ with the first definition never requires a sample from $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}}$, while a $\\mathcal{T}_{j}$ with the second definition may require at most one sample (see Remark 4.8). We will show that the privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ corresponding to $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\mathrm{~s}$ with the second definition form a sub-multiset of $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$ :\n\nBy Definition 5.4 (ii), we know that for each index $j$, if $q_{0}=q_{1}$ in the first message of the form $\\left((q_{0}, j),\\left(q_{1}, j\\right)\\right)$, then $q_{0}=q_{1}$ in all subsequent messages of this form. Thus, by Definition 5.4 (i) and Definition 5.1 (ii), the privacy parameters $\\left(\\epsilon_{j}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)$ corresponding to $\\mathcal{T}_{j} \\mathrm{~s}$ with the second definition (which receive at least one pair of non-identical queries) form a sub-multiset of $\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\epsilon_{k}, \\delta_{k}\\right)$.\n5.3.1. Concurrent $k$-sparse Parallel Composition of IM. Consider a setting where an adversary creates (an unlimited number of) IMs over time while adaptively asking queries from the existing ones. When creating an IM $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ that is $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim_{i}$, the adversary also selects a pair of neighboring initial states for $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$. This selection depends on the history of queries asked so far and their responses. Based on a secret bit $b$, either all created mechanisms are initialized with the first initial state in their respective pairs, or all are initialized with the second. The goal of the adversary is to guess $b$.\n\nThis scenario is an special case of FPC concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of CMs, where, instead of creating $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ and assigning a pair of initial states to it, the adversary sends $\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right.$, null, $\\left.\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}, f_{\\sim_{i}}\\right)^{2}$, where $\\mathcal{M}_{i}^{\\prime}$ is the CM simulating $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$. Moreover, to ask a query $q$ from the $i$-th created IM, the adversary sends $((q, i),(q, i))$. Since each $f_{\\sim_{i}}$ is first-pair consistent, Theorem 5.5 applies to the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of IM with privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)_{i=1}^{k}\\right.$ (that are differentially private w.r.t. neighbor relations).\n\nNIMs are a special subclass of IMs that halt the communication upon receiving a second input message. Since Theorem 5.5 applies to all IMs, it also holds for the concurrent $k$-sparse parallel composition of NIMs with privacy parameters $\\left(\\left(\\epsilon_{1}, \\delta_{i}\\right)_{i=1}^{k}\\right.$. In the next section, we compare this result to the classical parallel composition theorem.\n\n5.3.2. Comparison with the Parallel Composition of NIMs. Consider a set of $\\ell$ NIMs, $\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{\\ell}$, where each $\\mathcal{N}_{i}$ has a domain $\\mathcal{X}_{i}$ and is $\\left(\\epsilon_{i}, \\delta_{i}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim_{i}$. The $k$-sparse parallel composition of NIMs $\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{\\ell}$ is said to be $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP if the non-interactive mechanism $\\operatorname{Comp}\\left(\\mathcal{N}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{N}_{\\ell}\\right)$ with the domain $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathcal{X}_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathcal{X}_{\\ell}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the neighbor relation $\\sim_{\\text {par }}$, defined as follows: for any two $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots x_{\\ell}\\right)$ and $x^{\\prime}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots x_{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\right)$ in $\\mathcal{X}$, we have $x \\sim_{\\text {par }} x^{\\prime}$ if and only if there exists a subset $\\mathcal{J} \\subseteq\\{1, \\ldots, \\ell\\}$ of size at most $k$ such that $x_{j} \\sim_{j} x_{j}^{\\prime}$ for every $j \\in \\mathcal{J}$, and $x_{j}=x_{j}^{\\prime}$ for every $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, \\ell\\} \\backslash \\mathcal{J}$.\n\nThe concurrent parallel composition of IMs generalizes the parallel composition of NIMs in several key ways: Rather than composing a fixed set of $\\ell$ NIMs, an adversary adaptively selects an unbounded number of IMs with arbitrary privacy parameters. Additionally, instead of non-adaptively selecting worst-case neighboring initial states for (at most) $k$ mechanisms and identical initial states for the other $\\ell-k$ mechanisms, the adversary adaptively (1) chooses pairs of initial states based on prior interactions with other mechanisms, while (2) ensuring that the initial states in at most $k$ pairs are neighboring, and that they are identical in the other pairs. In the concurrent parallel composition of CMs, the adversary is even stronger: instead of choosing a single pair of neighboring initial states, it adaptively selects a sequence of pairs, satisfying the constraints enforced by a verification function.\n\nThe 1-sparse parallel composition of NIMs is commonly used when a dataset is partitioned among $\\ell$ NIMs such that for any two neighboring datasets differing by a single record, all partitions remain identical except for the presence of the differing record in one partition. Consider the case where an adversary creates CMs receiving data or empty records as query messages. In the concurrent parallel composition of CMs , the adversary adaptively determines the number of partitions, assigns records to them, and selects which partitions contain differing sets of records.\n\nIt is known that the $k$-sparse parallel composition of $\\ell\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP NIMs is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP if the composition of $\\ell$ instances of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP. We showed that any NIM that is $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. a neighbor relation $\\sim$ can be modeled by a CM that is $\\left(\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{0}\\right)$-DP w.r.t. $f_{\\sim}$, which is a first-pair consistent verification function. Thus, setting $\\epsilon_{1}=\\cdots=\\epsilon_{k}=\\epsilon_{0}, \\delta_{1}=\\cdots=\\delta_{k}=\\delta_{0}$ in Theorem 5.5 recovers and generalizes the classic parallel composition theorem. Our theorem extends differential privacy guarantees to settings where an adversary can adaptively create an unbounded number of NIMs.",

      "text": "# 6. Designing Complex Continual Mechanisms \n\nSo far we discussed the setting where the messages are issued by an adversary. However, in the design of differentially private mechanisms in the streaming setting, it is common to use existing differentially private interactive mechanisms, such as the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) and continual counters, as sub-mechanisms. Thus, it is the main mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ that issues messages to its sub-mechanisms. The main mechanism may fix the set of sub-mechanisms at initialization or select these mechanisms adaptively over time. For example, in Section 7, we present a mechanism that maintains $d$ fixed binary counters while adaptively instantiating an unbounded number of SVT and Laplace mechanisms as required.\n\nThe privacy analysis of such mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}$ is challenging as the creation of sub-mechanisms and their inputs is adaptive and dependent. The goal of this section is to give a set of conditions for $\\mathcal{M}$ and prove a theorem that shows that under these conditions the privacy of $\\mathcal{M}$ can directly be computed by applying the known concurrent composition theorems for continual mechanisms to the sub-mechanisms. Specifically, given that the $f^{\\prime}$-concurrent composition of CMs is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. some verification function $f^{\\prime}$, we would like to show that $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. the given verification function $f$.\n\nAs discussed in Section 3, these sub-mechanisms can be modeled as CMs. We formalize $\\mathcal{M}$, which runs multiple CMs, as a continual mechanism of the form $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\operatorname{ExtConComp}$, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is an IPM and ExtConComp is the CM defined in Section 4.1. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is a CM, its initial state space is a\n\nsingleton, implying that the initial state space of $\\mathcal{P}$ is also a singleton. Upon receiving a message, $\\mathcal{P}$ may create new differentially private CMs or ask queries from the existing ones by communicating with ExtConComp, possibly multiple times.\n\nTo prove that $\\mathcal{M}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$, we need to show that the view of every adversary $\\mathcal{A}$ interacting with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{M}=\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*}$ $\\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable. Intuitively, the messages that $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp receives from $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ contains information about $b$. Therefore, to deduce that $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$ from the fact that ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f^{\\prime}$, the IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ must not directly use the messages from $\\mathcal{I}$ to respond. Instead, it should only use these messages to determine which queries it wants to send to its its sub-mechanisms via ExtConComp. More precisely, $\\mathcal{P}$ must generate an answer for $\\mathcal{I}$ only based on the privatized answers provided by ExtConComp and not dependent on the un-privatized input sequence (Response Property). Moreover, $\\mathcal{P}$ must decide whether to continue interacting with ExtConComp or to return a response based on these privatized answers (Destination Property).\n\nFinally, we need a property for $\\mathcal{P}$ to convert $f$-valid message sequences to $f^{\\prime}$-valid ones: Let $m_{1}^{0}, m_{2}^{0}, \\ldots$ and $m_{1}^{1}, m_{2}^{1}, \\ldots$ be two sequences such that the sequence $\\left(m_{1}^{0}, m_{1}^{1}\\right),\\left(m_{2}^{0}, m_{2}^{1}\\right), \\ldots$ is $f$-valid. Upon receiving each sequence $m_{1}^{h}, m_{2}^{h}, \\ldots$, the mechanism $\\mathcal{P}$ must send the messages $m_{1}^{h^{\\prime}}, m_{2}^{h^{\\prime}}, \\ldots$ to ExtConComp such that $\\left(m_{1}^{0^{\\prime}}, m_{1}^{1^{\\prime}}\\right),\\left(m_{2}^{0^{\\prime}}, m_{2}^{1^{\\prime}}\\right), \\ldots$ is $f^{\\prime}$-valid ( $f \\rightarrow f^{\\prime}$ Property).\n\nIn Section 6.1, we formalize the above properties for $\\mathcal{P}$, and in Section 6.2, we prove the desired privacy guarantees for $\\mathcal{M}$. Combining this result with the concurrent composition theorems provided in the previous sections, we can avoid complicated privacy analysis for many CMs.\n6.1. Properties. To formally state that $\\mathcal{P}$ maps $f$-valid sequences to $f^{\\prime}$-valid ones, we assume that $\\mathcal{P}$ is deterministic. This means $\\mathcal{P}$ can be expressed as a deterministic function that maps the sequence of received messages to its next output message. This assumption is not restrictive, as randomness can be modeled by a 0 -DP sub-mechanism $\\mathcal{M}_{i}$ that accepts a single message $\\top$, and upon receiving it, generates a sufficiently long sequence of random bits or samples from a fixed distribution.\n\nRecall that the goal of this section is to show $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f^{\\prime}$ if ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$. That is, we need to show that the view of any adversary in the interactions with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable.\n\nThe messages received by $\\mathcal{P}$ from $\\mathcal{I}$ contain information about the bit used by $\\mathcal{I}$ to filter the adversary's pairs. Therefore, to directly use the existing compositions theorems for ExtConComp to analyze the privacy of $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, we need to ensure that $\\mathcal{P}$ only utilizes the messages from $\\mathcal{I}$ to generate queries for the existing private sub-mechanisms executed by ExtConComp. Moreover, we need to guarantee that the sequence $\\left(m_{1}^{0^{\\prime}}, m_{1}^{1^{\\prime}}\\right),\\left(m_{2}^{0^{\\prime}}, m_{2}^{1^{\\prime}}\\right), \\ldots$ is $f^{\\prime}$-valid, where $m_{1}^{b^{\\prime}}, m_{2}^{b^{\\prime}}, \\ldots$ is the sequence of messages that $\\mathcal{P}$ sends to ExtConComp when it receives messages from $\\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{V}[f]$. The following properties formalize these:\n\n- Destination Property. The destination L or R of messages sent by $\\mathcal{P}$ is determined solely based on messages received from its right mechanism (here, ExtConComp). This ensures that if two transcripts contain identical sequences of messages from the right mechanism but different sequences from the left mechanism, $\\mathcal{P}$ will still interact with the same mechanism in the next round.\n- Response Property. The responses sent by $\\mathcal{P}$ to the left mechanism depend only on the messages received from the right mechanism. That is, if two transcripts contain identical sequences of messages from the right mechanism and $\\mathcal{P}$ sends its next message to the left mechanism, then this message is identical in both cases.\n- $f \\rightarrow f^{\\prime}$ Property. For $v \\in\\{\\mathrm{~L}, \\mathrm{R}\\}$, let the pair $(m, v)$ denote a message $m$ sent to or received from the left or right mechanism of $\\mathcal{P}$. For $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, let $\\sigma^{b}=\\left(\\left(m_{1}^{b}, v_{1}^{b}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(m_{t}^{b}, v_{t}^{b}\\right)\\right)$ be a sequence of\n\n$t$ input messages to $\\mathcal{P}$, and let $\\tau^{b}=\\left(\\left(m_{1}^{b t}, v_{1}^{b t}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(m_{t}^{b t}, v_{t}^{b t}\\right)\\right)$ be the corresponding sequence of $t$ output messages from $\\mathcal{P}$. Suppose the following conditions hold:\n(i) $v_{i}^{0}=v_{i}^{1}$ for each $i \\in[t]$, i.e., the sender of messages is identical;\n(ii) $m_{i}^{0}=m_{i}^{1}$ for each $i \\in[t]$ where $v_{i}^{0}=v_{i}^{1}=\\mathrm{R}$, meaning that messages from the right mechanism are identical; and\n(iii) the sequence of $\\left(m_{i}^{0}, m_{i}^{1}\\right)$ s for all $i \\in[t]$ where $v_{i}^{0}=v_{i}^{1}=\\mathrm{L}$ is $f$-valid.\n\nThen, by the destination property of $\\mathcal{P}, v_{i}^{0 t}=v_{i}^{1 t}$ for each $i \\in[t]$, and by the response property, $m_{i}^{0 t}=m_{i}^{1 t}$ for each $i \\in[t]$ with $v_{i}^{0}=v_{i}^{1}=\\mathrm{L}$. The $f \\rightarrow f^{\\prime}$ property states that under these conditions, the sequence $\\left(\\left(m_{i}^{0 t}, m_{i}^{1 t}\\right)\\right)$ for all $i \\in[t]$ where $v_{i}^{0 t}=v_{i}^{1 t}=\\mathrm{R}$ must be $f^{\\prime}$-valid.\n6.2. Privacy Result. In this section, we will prove the following theorem:\n\nTheorem 6.1. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a deterministic interactive post-processing mechanism with a singleton initial state space satisfying the destination, response, and $f \\rightarrow f^{\\prime}$ properties. If ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f^{\\prime}$ against adaptive adversaries, then the continual mechanism $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $f$ against adaptive adversaries.\n\nIn Theorem 6.1, we assume that the view of any adversary interacting with $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable. The goal is to show the same result for $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp. The key idea of the proof is to show that the IMs $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{T} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp are identical, where $\\mathcal{T}$ is an IPM with a singleton initial state space. The proof consists of two steps.\n\nStep 1 (Swapping $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ ). We start by swapping the positions of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ in $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp. The verifier $\\mathcal{V}[f]$ sends pairs of query messages, while $\\mathcal{P}$ expects a single one. Also, the identifier $\\mathcal{I}(b)$ expects pairs of messages, while $\\mathcal{P}$ generates a single response. Therefore, when swapping $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{I}(b)$, we should replace $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b)$ with $\\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{2}$, where $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ is an interactive post-processing mechanism that runs two instances of $\\mathcal{P}$ in parallel. The right mechanism of $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ is $\\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, and its left mechanism is $\\mathcal{V}[f]$. The exact definition of $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ is given below.\nDefinition 6.2 $\\left(\\mathcal{P}^{2}\\right)$. Let $\\mathcal{P}: S_{\\mathcal{P}} \\times\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{\\bar{R}\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow S_{\\mathcal{P}} \\times\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{\\bar{R}\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right)$ be a deterministic interactive post-processing mechanism with a singleton initial state space $S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{\\text {init }}=\\left\\{s^{\\text {init }}\\right\\}$, satisfying the destination and response properties. $\\mathcal{P}^{2}: S_{\\mathcal{P}}^{2} \\times$ $\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{\\bar{R}\\} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow S_{\\mathcal{P}} \\times\\left(\\left(\\{L\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{\\bar{R}\\} \\times A_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}\\right)\\right)$ is an interactive postprocessing mechanism that executes two instances of $\\mathcal{P}$, referred to as $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$. The state of $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ is a pair $\\left(s_{0}, s_{1}\\right)$ denoting the current states of $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$. The initial state space of $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ is $\\left\\{\\left(s^{\\text {init }}, s^{\\text {init }}\\right)\\right\\}$.\n\nWhen $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ receives a message $m \\in Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{L}$ from the left mechanism, it forwards two copies of $m$ to both $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ as left messages. Specifically, it executes $\\left(s_{0}, v_{0}, m_{0}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}_{0}\\left(s_{0}, L, m\\right)$ and $\\left(s_{1}, v_{1}, m_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow$ $\\mathcal{P}_{1}\\left(s_{1}, L, m\\right)$. When $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ receives a pair of messages $\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right) \\in Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{P}}^{R}$ from the right mechanism, it passes each $m_{b}$ to $\\mathcal{P}_{b}$ as a right message. Specifically, it executes $\\left(s_{0}, v_{0}, m_{0}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}_{0}\\left(s_{0}, R, m_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left(s_{1}, v_{1}, m_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{P}_{1}\\left(s_{1}, R, m_{0}\\right)$. By the destination property of $\\mathcal{P}$ and the fact that both $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ receive identical left messages, we have $v_{0}^{\\prime}=v_{1}^{\\prime}$. If $v_{0}^{\\prime}=v_{1}^{\\prime}=R$, then $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ sends $\\left(m_{0}^{\\prime}, m_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ to its right mechanism. If $v_{0}^{\\prime}=v_{1}^{\\prime}=L$, then by the response property, $m_{0}^{\\prime}=m_{1}^{\\prime}$, and $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ returns $m_{0}^{\\prime}$ to its left mechanism.\n\nThe following claim follow directly from the definition of $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ :\nClaim 6.3. For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the interactive mechanisms $\\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{P}^{2} \\circ^{*}$ $\\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp are identical.\nStep 2 (Inserting $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right]$ ). Due to the $f \\rightarrow f^{\\prime}$ property, when $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ receives an $f$-valid message sequence from its left mechanism, it sends an $f^{\\prime}$-valid message sequence to its right mechanism. We insert $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right]$ between $\\mathcal{P}^{2}$ and $\\mathcal{I}$ in $\\mathcal{P}^{2} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp. By definition, when $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right]$ receives an $f^{\\prime}$-valid\n\nmessage sequence from its left mechanism, it acts like it does not exist. Specifically, it forwards every message from its left and right mechanism unchanged to the opposite mechanism. Thus, we have:\n\nClaim 6.4. For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the interactive mechanisms $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{2} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{2} \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{V}[f^{\\prime}] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(b) \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp are identical.\nproof of Theorem 6.1. $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P}^{2}$ in Claim 6.4 is an IPM with a singleton initial state space. Thus, by Lemma 2.15 , that $\\mathcal{V}\\left[f^{\\prime}\\right] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp, is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP w.r.t. $\\sim_{01}$ implies the view of any adversary in the interactions with $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(0) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp and $\\mathcal{V}[f] \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{I}(1) \\circ^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*}$ ExtConComp is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-indistinguishable, which finishes the proof.",

      "text": "# 7. Application (Continual Monotone Histogram Query Problem) \n\nWe next show an application of our technique to the continual monotone histogram query problem. The continual monotone histogram query problem is defined as follows.\n\nDefinition 7.1. Let $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and let $q: \\mathbb{N}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a function that is monotone in its input. The input is a finite stream of row vectors $x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{T}$ with $x^{t} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{d}$ for all $t \\in[T]$. Let $\\sim$ be a neighbor relation on $\\left(\\{0,1\\}^{d}\\right)^{*}$ where two input streams are neighboring if they are identical except for a single step. The output of the (differentially private) continual monotone histogram query problem at each time step $t$ is (an additive approximation to) $q(t)=q\\left(\\left(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{t} x_{i}^{\\ell}\\right)_{i \\in[d]}\\right)$.\n\nNext we define query sensitivity.\nDefinition 7.2. The function $q:\\{0,1\\}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is 1-sensitive if $\\max _{x \\sim y}|q(x)-q(y)|$ is at most 1 .\nHenzinger, Sricharan, and Steiner [12] presented the best known differentially private mechanism for the monotone histogram query problem, where where the query is 1-sensitive. For $\\epsilon$-differential privacy it has, with probability at least $1-\\beta$, an additive error of $O\\left(\\left(d \\log ^{2}\\left(d q^{*} / \\beta\\right)+\\log T\\right) \\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$, and for $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy, it has an additive error of $O\\left(\\left(d \\log ^{1.5}\\left(d q^{*} / \\beta\\right)+\\log T\\right) \\epsilon^{-1} \\log \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)$, where $q^{*}=\\max _{t \\in[T]} q(t)$. The privacy of the mechanism is proven \"from scratch\" using the concept of a privacy game [13] and the latter bound only holds against an oblivious adversary.\n\nIn Section 7.1, we give an overview of the mechanism in [12], which we will call HSS, and in Section 7.2, we give a simple privacy proof for it using our approach. With the new privacy analysis, the result for $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy is stronger and holds against an adaptive adversary.\n7.1. Overview of Mechanism. The mechanism HSS, described in Algorithm 4, employs a variant of the Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) defined by two operations. The first, SVT-init $(\\epsilon, q, h)$, initializes the mechanism with the privacy parameter $\\epsilon$, the histogram query $q$, and an initial $d$-dimensional vector $h$. The second operation, SVT-call $\\left(x^{(t)}\\right.$, Thresh), processes an input value $x^{(t)} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{d}$ along with a threshold Thresh. This algorithm maintains a running sum of all the first parameters from SVT-call and tests in a private manner whether the function $q$ applied to the running sum returns a value that is at least Thresh. If so the algorithm returns $\\top$ and does not accept any further calls. Otherwise it returns $\\perp$ and continues to accept calls. These two algorithms are given in detail in Algorithm 3. The command Lap(b) means that a random value from the Laplacian distribution with parameter $b$ is returned.\n\nThe algorithms SVT-init and SVT-call describe a continual mechanism SVT with state $(h, \\epsilon, q, \\tau)$ that maps input queries in $\\{0,1\\}^{d}$ to answers in $\\{\\top, \\perp\\}$. In our language, whenever HSS calls SVT-init $(\\epsilon / 6, q, h)$, a continual mechanism $\\mathrm{SVT}_{\\epsilon / 6, q, h}$ with the single initial state $(\\epsilon / 6, q, h, \\tau=$ null) is created. Upon receiving the first input message (i.e., when $\\tau=$ null), $\\mathrm{SVT}_{\\epsilon / 6, q, h}$ sets null to a sample from $\\operatorname{Lap}(6 / \\epsilon)$. Then, according to the algorithm SVT-call, it updates the state and returns an output. Receiving the subsequent queries, $\\tau \\neq$ null, and $\\mathrm{SVT}_{\\epsilon / 6, q, h}$ simply updates the variables and generates an output.\n\n```\nAlgorithm 3 Sparse vector technique for histogram queries\n    procedure \\(\\operatorname{SVT}-\\operatorname{INIT}(\\epsilon, q, h)\\) :\n        \\(h_{i} \\leftarrow h_{i}\\) for all \\(i \\in[d]\\)\n        \\(\\epsilon=\\epsilon\\)\n        \\(q=q\\)\n        \\(\\tau \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Lap}(1 / \\epsilon)\\)\n    end procedure\n    procedure SVT-CALL \\((x\\), Thresh \\()\\)\n        \\(h_{i}=h_{i}+x_{i}\\) for all \\(i \\in[d]\\)\n        if \\(q(h)+\\operatorname{Lap}(2 / \\epsilon)>\\) Thresh \\(+\\tau\\) then\n            return \\(\\top\\) and halt\n        else\n            return \\(\\perp\\)\n        end if\n    end procedure\n```\n\nLet $f_{\\sim}$ be a verification function that given a message sequence $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}$, returns $\\top$ if and only if for each $j \\in[t]$, the message $m_{j}$ is of the form $\\left(m_{j}^{0}, m_{j}^{1}\\right)$ and the message sequences $\\sigma_{0}=\\left(m_{1}^{0}, \\ldots, m_{t}^{0}\\right)$ and $\\sigma_{1}=\\left(m_{1}^{1}, \\ldots, m_{t}^{1}\\right)$ satisfy $\\sigma_{0} \\sim \\sigma_{1}$. As part of their privacy proof, the following is shown in [12], which we restate in our own language.\n\nLemma 7.3. If $q$ is a 1-sensitive function, then for every $\\epsilon$ and $h$, the mechanism $S V T_{\\epsilon / 6, q, h}$ is $\\epsilon / 3-D P$ w.r.t. $f_{\\sim}$.\n\nFor positive integers $t$ and $j, \\beta \\in(0,1]$, and $\\epsilon>0$, let $\\gamma(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)$ and $\\xi(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)$ are some deterministic functions. Given an input stream $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots$ with $x_{i} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{d}$, the algorithm partitions the input stream into subsequences, called intervals. At the end of each interval, it gives the $d$-dimensional sum of all the inputs of the interval to a differentially-private histogram mechanism H. Note that H can be used directly to solve the problem; however, the new mechanism HSS has better accuracy bounds in many cases.\n\nH is described by two operations, namely $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{init}(\\epsilon)$ and $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{add}(x)$, where $x$ is a $d$-dimensional vector. The first initializes $d$ empty differentially private continual binary counters with privacy parameter $\\epsilon / d$. The second operation gives each element of the $d$-dimensional vector $x$ to the corresponding binary counter and returns their aggregated outputs as a $d$-dimensional vector. In another version of the algorithm, $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{init}(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ initializes $d$ empty differentially private continual binary counters with privacy parameters $\\epsilon / d$ and $\\delta / d$. In our language, H is a continual mechanism that stores the required variables in its state and upon receiving a query in $\\{0,1\\}^{d}$, updates its state (i.e., the variables) and returns an answer in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The initial state of H is the tuple of initial values for the variables, specified by algorithm H -init.\n\nThe continual histogram query mechanism HSS keeps two $d$-dimensional vectors, called $h$ and $c$, namely for each coordinate $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, d\\}$ a variable $c_{i}$ and a variable $h_{i}$, where $c_{i}$ keeps the actual sum of column $i$ for the current interval and $h_{i}$ keeps the approximate sum of column $i$ for all inputs before in the current interval as computed by H. Both are initially 0 . The algorithm also keeps at any point an instance of SVT and initializes it with $\\epsilon / 6, q$, and $h$. It also initializes Thresh using $\\gamma(1,1, \\beta, \\epsilon)$. On a new input $x^{(t)}$ the algorithm updates $c$ and then calls SVT-call $\\left(x^{(t)}\\right.$, Thresh $)$ using the threshold Thresh. If it returns $\\top$, the algorithm ends the current interval, inputs $c$ to H , sets $h$ to be the output of H , and sets $c$ to the all-zero vector. As SVT has ended, it creates a new instance of SVT with the call SVT-init $(\\epsilon / 6, q, h)$. It then applies the Laplacian mechanism to $q(c+h)$ and compares its outcome with a slightly lower threshold Thresh' that is computed using Thresh and $\\xi(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)$. If it is larger, Thresh is suitably increased. Independent of the outcome of\n\nthis comparison, Thresh is then updated (to reflect the increase in the number of intervals). Finally independent of the output of the call to SVT, $h$ is output and Thresh is again updated (to reflect the increase in the number of input vectors). The algorithm is given in detail in Algorithm 4, the accuracy proof can be found in [12].\n\n```\nAlgorithm 4 Mechanism for answering a monotone histogram query\n    H-init \\((\\epsilon / 3)\\)\n    \\(h_{i} \\leftarrow 0\\) for all \\(i \\in[d], c_{i} \\leftarrow 0\\) for all \\(i \\in[d]\\)\n    out \\(\\leftarrow q(h)\\)\n    \\(j \\leftarrow 1\\)\n    SVT-init \\((\\epsilon / 6, q, h)\\)\n    Thresh \\(=\\gamma(1, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\)\n    for \\(t \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) do\n        \\(c_{i} \\leftarrow c_{i}+x_{i}^{(t)}\\) for all \\(i \\in[d]\\)\n        if \\(\\operatorname{SVT}-\\operatorname{call}\\left(x^{(t)}\\right.\\), Thresh \\()==\\top\\) then\n            \\(h=\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{add}(c)\\)\n            out \\(\\leftarrow q(h)\\)\n            SVT-init \\((\\epsilon / 6, q, h)\\)\n            \\(c_{i} \\leftarrow 0\\) for all \\(i \\in[d]\\)\n            if \\(q(c+h)+\\operatorname{Lap}(3 / \\epsilon)>\\) Thresh \\(-\\xi(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\) then\n                Thresh \\(=\\) Thresh \\(+\\gamma(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\)\n            end if\n            \\(j \\leftarrow j+1\\)\n            Thresh \\(=\\) Thresh \\(-\\gamma(t, j-1, \\beta, \\epsilon)+\\gamma(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\)\n    end if\n    output out\n    Thresh \\(=\\) Thresh \\(-\\gamma(t, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)+\\gamma(t+1, j, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\)\nend for\n```\n\n7.2. New Privacy Analysis. Algorithm 4 describes a CM HSS with query set $\\{0,1\\}^{d}$ and answer set $\\mathbb{N}^{d}$. The state of HSS consists of the variables ( $h, c, j$, out, Thresh), initialized with $\\left(0^{d}, 0^{d}, 1, q\\left(0^{d}\\right), \\gamma(1,1, \\beta, \\epsilon)\\right)$. The summation $q(c+h)+\\operatorname{Lap}(3 / \\epsilon)$ in this algorithm can be rewritten as an in instance of Laplace mechanism with privacy parameter $\\epsilon / 3$ and input $q(c+h)$. Consequently, HSS executes one instance of a histogram mechanism, H, an unbounded number of SVT instances, and an unbounded number of Laplace mechanisms. The Laplace mechanism with privacy parameter $\\epsilon / 3$ is a NIM that is known to be $\\epsilon / 3$-DP when receiving real values differing by at most 1 . In other words, the Laplace mechanism is a CM that is $\\epsilon / 3$-DP w.r.t. a verification function $f_{\\text {Lap }}$ that returns $\\top$ if and only if it receives a single input message $m=\\left(m_{0}, m_{1}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ satisfying $\\left|m_{0}-m_{1}\\right| \\leq 1$.\n\nThe output of H is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$, while the output of the Laplace mechanism is a scalar in $\\mathbb{R}$. Rounding up each real-valued output to the nearest integer does not affect privacy guarantees (by the post-processing lemma) but increases the additive error of each mechanism by at most 1. This extra error is negligible compared to their original error. Therefore, we assume that both H and the Laplace mechanism have discrete answer distributions. Since the answer set of SVT is finite, it also has discrete answer distributions.\n\nBy design, HSS uses the inputs $x^{(t)}$ only to determine the inputs of its sub-mechanisms, and every other action is taken solely based on the privatized outputs of the sub-mechanisms. This allows us to apply Theorem 6.1 to analyze the privacy of HSS based on the privacy parameters of its sub-mechanisms.\n\nBy Lemma 7.3, each instance of SVT created by HSS is $\\epsilon / 3$-DP. Furthermore, for any two neighboring input streams, fixing the history of privatized outputs of the sub-mechanisms, HSS provides identical inputs to all but one SVT instance, which receives neighboring inputs. By Theorem 5.2, the parallel concurrent composition of all SVT instances is $\\epsilon / 3$-DP.\n\nSimilarly, HSS gives identical real-valued inputs to all but one instance of the Laplace mechanism, where the differing inputs vary by at most 1 . This implies that the concurrent composition of all Laplace mechanisms is also $\\epsilon / 3$-DP. Each concurrent composition is itself a continual mechanism. Additionally, it is given that H is $\\epsilon / 3$-DP. By basic composition, the composition of three instances of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon / 3,0}$ is $\\epsilon$-DP. Therefore, by Theorem 4.10, the concurrent composition of all mechanisms-H, SVT instances, and Laplace mechanisms - is $\\epsilon$-DP. Applying Theorem 6.1, the mechanism HSS is $\\epsilon$-DP.\n\nIn the case where H is $(\\epsilon / 3, \\delta)$-DP, since the composition of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon / 3,0}, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon / 3,0}$, and $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon / 3, \\delta}$ is $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, the mechanism HSS is also $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP. Both privacy guarantees provided in this section hold against adaptive adversaries.",

Then, for any two neighboring initial states $s_{0}$ and $s_{1}$, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ are identical.\n\nNotation A.2. For short, let $Q=Q_{\\mathcal{M}}$ and $A=A_{\\mathcal{M}}$. For any $T \\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $[T]=\\{1, \\ldots, T\\}$. For each $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, we define the function $\\mu_{t}^{b}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]$ such that $\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ denotes the probability of $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ returning answers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}$ to the queries $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$.\n\nFixing an upper bound $T$ on the number of queries, Lyu [18] reduces the construction of $\\mathcal{P}$ to defining a sequence of functions $\\phi_{t}^{0}$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}$ for each $t \\in[T]$, satisfying three conditions. They then inductively construct each $\\phi_{t}^{b}$ and verify that it satisfies the required conditions. The definition of these conditions is based on a sequence of control function $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{0}$ and $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{1}$, which have backward recursive definitions for $t$ from $T$ to 1 .\n\nIn Section A.1.1, we overview the definition of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ and its properties. In Section A.1.2, we introduce a new control function $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$ with no dependency on $T$. The goal is to use $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$ instead of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ in [18]'s proofs. So, in Section A.1.3, we show some properties for $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$, required in later proofs.\n\nIn Section A.2, we overview the reduction presented in [18], with the control functions $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ replaced by $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$. In this section, we prove the reduction still holds with the new control functions. Finally, in Section A.3, we present a construction for $\\phi_{t}$ and show it satisfies all three conditions. We note that this construction is identical in essence to one given in [18], but we extend the proof to work with weaker assumptions.",

Control Function $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$ with is the Limit of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}$ (Definition). This section introduces our main new technical contribution. We introduce $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$ as limit of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ and show that it satisfies all properties needed by the proof of [18]. Thus, differently from [18], we will use $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$ to define the functions $\\phi_{t}^{0}$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}$.\n\nHowever, we first need to argue that the limit of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ exists. the value of $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ is upper bounded by 1 . We also show that this function is non-decreasing in $T$. As a result, for each each $t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$ and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$, the limit $\\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ exists. To remove the assumption of having an upper bound $T$ on the number of queries, we introduce the following control function:\nDefinition A. $10\\left(\\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\right)$. For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the function $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]$ is defined as follows: for each transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)=\\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe need the following lemma throughout the section:\nLemma A.11. For every $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1}$, and query $q_{t} \\in Q$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mu_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}\\right)=\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. For $a_{t} \\in A$, let $\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(a_{t} \\mid q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)$ denote the probability that $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ returns the answer $a_{t}$ in response to $q_{t}$ conditioned on $q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}$ being the history of previous queries and answers. By the chain rule, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}, a_{t}\\right) & =\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mu_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(a_{t} \\mid q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mu_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}\\right) \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(a_{t} \\mid q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mu_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, a_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo upper bound $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}$, we first need to upper bound Lower ${ }_{t, T}$ :\nLemma A.12.

For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, \\mathrm{L}_{0}^{b}() \\leq \\delta$.\nCorollary A.17. For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, and transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mathrm{L}_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\leq \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nLemma A.18.

Let $f: \\mathbb{N}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that $\\sum_{m} f(m, 1)>-\\infty$ and that is non-decreasing in the second parameter. Then\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} f(m, n)=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} f(m, n)\n$$\n\nLemma A. 19 combined with Lemma A. 15 implies:\nCorollary A.20. For any $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)=\\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nLemma A.21. For every $b \\in\\{0,1\\}, t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1}$, and query $q_{t} \\in Q$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. First, we will show that for any $T>t-1$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}_{t-1, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $t \\neq T$, by definition of $\\mathrm{L}_{t-1, T}^{b}$ and Corollary A.5, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{L}_{t-1, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right)=\\sup _{q \\in Q} \\operatorname{Lower}_{t, T}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}, q\\right) \\geq \\operatorname{Lower}_{t, T}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)=\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, by Corollary A.20, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{L}_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) & =\\lim _{T \\geq t-1, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t-1, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right)=\\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t-1, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\geq \\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)=\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\lim _{T \\geq t, T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{~L}_{t, T}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)=\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots a_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA.2. Reduction. To define $\\mathcal{P}$, Lyu [18] constructs four families of PMFs $\\mathcal{F}_{(0, \\perp)}, \\mathcal{F}_{(1, \\perp)}, \\mathcal{F}_{(0, \\top)}$, and $\\mathcal{F}_{(1, \\top)}$, corresponding to each outcome of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}$. Intuitively, each family describes an IM. Specifically, each family consists of PMFs over the answer set $A$ for every $t \\in[T]$ and every history $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t} \\times Q$, representing the probability of returning each answer in response to $q_{t}$, conditioned on $q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}$ being the history of queries and answers.\nA.2.1. Constructing $\\mathcal{P}$ using $\\mathcal{F}_{r} s$. Roughly speaking, in the interaction between $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ and an adversary $\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}$ interacts with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ once and stores its output $r$ as thee first parameter in its state. It then answers the adversary's queries by itself using the PMFs provided by $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$. Specifically, $\\mathcal{P}$ has a single initial state (null, ()), where null is an empty field and () represents an empty sequence. Let $h$ denote the sequence of interactions between $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$, which is stored by $\\mathcal{P}$ as second parameter of its state. After interacting with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b), \\mathcal{P}$ updates null to $r$. Moreover, upon receiving a query $q$ and before returning an answer $a, \\mathcal{P}$ appends $q$ and $a$ to the history sequence $h$. To generate a response $a$ to a query $q, \\mathcal{P}$ samples $a$ from the PMF corresponding to $(h, q)$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$, where $h$ is the history of all previous queries and answers.\n\nA.2.2. Constructing $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(b, \\perp\\right)} s$. Lyu [18] constructs a function $\\phi_{t}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]^{2}$ for each $t \\in$ $[T] \\cup\\{0\\}$. Let $\\phi_{t}^{0}$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}$ denote the functions returning the first and second elements of the output pairs of $\\phi_{t}$. For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the family $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(b, \\perp\\right)}$ is defined based on $\\phi_{t}^{b} \\mathrm{~s}$. Intuitively, $\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ represents the probability that $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ returns the answers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}$ to the fixed queries $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$. That is, for each query sequence $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}, \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\cdot, q_{2}, \\cdot, \\ldots, q_{t}, \\cdot\\right)$ is a PMF over $A^{t}$.\n\nWe do not provide the construction of $\\phi_{t}$ in this section. However, assuming the existence of $\\phi_{t}$ satisfying the following three conditions, we show that for every $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{e, \\delta}$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ are equivalent. These three conditions were originally stated in [18], with the control function $\\mathrm{L}_{t, T}^{b}$ instead of $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}$.\n\nFor $t=0$, let $\\phi_{t}()=(1,1)$. Suppose for every $t \\in[T]$, there exists a function $\\phi_{t}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]^{2}$ satisfying the following conditions for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ :\n(I) For any transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\geq \\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\n(II) For any transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\delta \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\leq \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\n(III) For any transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)=\\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the family $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(b, \\perp\\right)}$ consists of functions $f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}: A \\rightarrow[0,1]$ for each $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in \\bigcup_{t=1}^{T}(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$, where $f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}$ is defined as follows:\n\n- If $\\phi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)>0$, then for each answer $a_{t} \\in A$,\n\n$$\nf_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)=\\frac{\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)}{\\phi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)}\n$$\n\n- Otherwise, if $\\phi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)=0, f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)=0$ for every answer, except for one fixed arbitrary answer $a^{*} \\in A$, where $f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a^{*}\\right)=1$. This case is included only for formality, and the corresponding PMFs are never used by $\\mathcal{P}$.\nSince $\\phi_{t-1}$ and $\\phi_{t}$ are non-negative, $f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)$ is also non-negative. Furthermore, by (III), we have $\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}(a)=1$, implying that $f_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)$ is a PMF.\nA.2.3. Constructing $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(b, \\top\\right)} s$. Similar to the previous section, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(0, \\top\\right)}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(1, \\top\\right)}$ are defined based on a sequence of functions $\\psi_{t}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]^{2}$ for each $t \\in[T] \\cup\\{0\\}$. For $t=0, \\psi_{t}()=(1,1)$. For $t \\in[T], \\psi_{t}$ is defined as follows:\n- If $\\delta=1$, then $\\psi_{t}$ is identical to $\\phi_{t}$.\n- Otherwise, for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}, \\psi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ equals\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(1-\\delta)\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)}\\left(e^{\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\delta e^{\\epsilon} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+\\delta \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFor each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the family $\\mathcal{F}_{\\left(b, \\top\\right)}$ consists of functions $g_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}: A \\rightarrow[0,1]$ for each $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in \\bigcup_{t=1}^{T}(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$, where $g_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}$ is defined as follows:\n\n- If $\\psi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)>0$, then for each answer $a_{t} \\in A$,\n\n$$\ng_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)=\\frac{\\psi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)}{\\psi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)}\n$$\n\n- Otherwise, $g_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)=0$ for every answer, except for one fixed arbitrary answer $a^{*} \\in A$, where $g_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a^{*}\\right)=1$.\n\nBy condition (II), each $\\psi_{t}^{b}$ is non-negative. Also, by Lemma A. 11 and condition (III), for every $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}, q_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\psi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)=\\psi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nimplying that each $g_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}$ forms a valid PMF.\nA.2.4. Proof of Lemma A.1. By definition of RR and of $\\mathcal{P}$, for each $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in$ $(Q \\times A)^{t}$, the probability of $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ returning the answers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}$ to the queries $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$ is\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+(1-\\delta) \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{1+e^{\\epsilon}} \\psi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+(1-\\delta) \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\epsilon}} \\psi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nby the definition of $\\psi_{t}$, this probability equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)}\\left(e^{\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\quad-\\delta e^{\\epsilon} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+\\delta \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\quad+\\frac{1}{\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)}\\left(e^{\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\delta e^{\\epsilon} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the views of any adversary interacting with $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, \\delta}(b)$ are identically distributed, implying that these mechanisms are equivalent.\nA.3. Construction of $\\phi_{t}$. In this section, we formalize the construction of [18] differently to remove the finiteness assumption on $A$.\n\nRoughly speaking, Lyu [18] initializes the values of $\\phi_{t}$ with the ones from $\\mathrm{L}_{t}$. Then, for each $q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}$, they iterate over all possible answers $a_{t} \\in A$ in a fixed order and gradually increase the value of $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ to satisfy conditions (II) and (III), while ensuring that condition (I) remains valid. This iterative procedure requires $A$ to be finite; otherwise, the construction algorithm does not terminate. To extend this approach to infinite $A$, we define $\\phi_{t}$ mathematically and apply the transfinite recursion theorem to prove its existence.\n\nFor each $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, knowing that $\\phi_{t-1}$ exists and satisfies condition (I), we construct $\\phi_{t}$ and show it satisfies conditions (I), (II), and (III). For $t=0$, we set $\\phi_{0}()=(1,1)$. By Corollary A.16, $\\phi_{0}$ satisfies condition (I).\n\nRemark A.22. In the rest of this section, we assume $\\phi_{t-1}$ exists and satisfies condition (I).\nIn Section A.3.1, we introduce the necessary preliminaries for formally defining $\\phi_{t}$ when $A$ is infinite. In Section A.3.2, we construct $\\phi_{t}$, and in Section A.3.3, we prove that $\\phi_{t}$ satisfies conditions (I) to (III).\nA.3.1. Preliminaries. In this section, we introduce the fundamental concepts and notations needed for defining $\\phi_{t}$ when $A$ is not finite.\nDefinition A. 23 (Well-Order). A well-order on a set $X$ is a total order (i.e., for every $x, y \\in X$, either $x<y, x>y$, or $x=y$ ) such that every non-empty subset of $X$ has a least element.\n\nSince $A$ is countable, we can inject $A$ into $\\mathbb{N}$. By listing elements of $A$ in the order given by their images under this injection, we get a well-order $<_{A}$ on $A$. Note that for any non-empty subset $B \\subseteq A$, the image of $B$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ has a least element, whose preimage is the least element of $B$ under $<_{A}$. We will later use the following remark when constructing $\\xi_{t}$ and $\\phi_{t}$.\nRemark A.24. By the definition of $<_{A}$, each element of $A$ is either the least element of $A$ or has an immediate predecessor in $A$.\n\nThe query set $Q$ is not necessarily countable. However, by the well-ordering theorem (which is equivalent to the axiom of choice), there exists a well-order $<_{Q}$ on $Q$, regardless of its cardinality.\nDefinition A. 25 (Lexicographic Order $<_{t}$ on $(Q \\times A)^{t}$ ). For $t \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, we define an order $<_{t}$ on $(Q \\times A)^{t}$ by lexicographic comparison: For any two distinct tuples $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ and $\\left(q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{t}^{\\prime}\\right)$ in $(Q \\times A)^{t}$, let $i$ be the smallest index such that $\\left(q_{i}, a_{i}\\right) \\neq\\left(q_{i}^{\\prime}, a_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$. Then:\n\n$$\n\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)<_{t}\\left(q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{t}^{\\prime}\\right) \\text { if and only if }\\left[q_{i}<_{Q} q_{i}^{\\prime}\\right] \\text { or }\\left[q_{i}=q_{i}^{\\prime} \\text { and } a_{i}<_{A} a_{i}^{\\prime}\\right]\n$$\n\nSince $<_{A}$ and $<_{Q}$ are well-orders, $<_{t}$ is also a well-order: $<_{t}$ is clearly a total order. We will show that every non-empty subset $B \\subseteq(Q \\times A)^{t}$ has a least element. Define\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& B_{1}^{Q}=\\left\\{q \\in Q \\mid \\exists a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t} \\in A, \\exists q_{2}, \\ldots, q_{t} \\in Q \\text { such that }\\left(q, a_{1}, q_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in B\\right\\} \\text { and } \\\\\n& B_{1}^{A}=\\left\\{a \\in A \\mid \\exists a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t} \\in A, \\exists q_{2}, \\ldots, q_{t} \\in Q \\text { such that }\\left(q_{1}^{*}, a, q_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in B\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $B$ is non-empty, $B_{1}^{Q}$ is also non-empty. By the well-ordering of $Q, B_{1}^{Q}$ has a least element $q_{1}^{*}$. Similarly, since $B_{1}^{A}$ is non-empty, it has a least element $a_{1}^{*}$.\n\nAgain, since $B_{2}^{Q}$ is non-empty, it has a least element $q_{2}^{*}$. Repeating this process $t$ times, we obtain the least element $\\left(q_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, a_{t}^{*}\\right)$ of $B$.\nLemma A. 26 (Transfinite Recursion). Let $f$ be a function recursively defined over $(Q \\times A)^{t}$ according to the well-order $<_{t}$. If for each sequence $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t}$, the value of $f\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ is uniquely determined by the values $f\\left(q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{t}^{\\prime}\\right)$ for every $\\left(q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{t}^{\\prime}\\right)<_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$, then $f$ exists and is unique.\n\nIn later sections, we define functions $f$ recursively over $(Q \\times A)^{t}$ using the well-order $<_{t}$. Specifically, we determine $f\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ based on the values $f\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)$ for every $a<_{A} a_{t}$. By the definition of $<_{t}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)<_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we define two key sets that will be used in our constructions: for any $a_{t} \\in A$,\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{<a_{t}}=\\left\\{a \\in A \\mid a<_{A} a_{t}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{>a_{t}}=\\left\\{a \\in A \\mid a_{t}<_{A} a\\right\\}\n$$\n\nA.3.2. Defining $\\phi_{t}$ and showing its existence. We define the function $\\phi_{t}:(Q \\times A)^{t} \\rightarrow[0,1]^{2}$ recursively for each $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ based on the $<_{t}$ order. For each $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$, we determine $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ by solving an optimization problem with the variables $\\phi_{t}^{0}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$. The constraints for this problem involve the known functions $\\mu_{t}, \\phi_{t-1}, \\mathrm{~L}_{t}$, and the known values $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)$ for every $a \\in \\Gamma_{<a_{t}}$.\n\nWe define $\\phi_{t}^{0}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ as the largest possible real numbers in $[0,1]$ satisfying the following constraints:\n$(\\phi .1)$ For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\geq \\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\n$(\\phi .2)$ For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{<a_{t}}} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)+\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)+\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{>a_{t}}} \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n$(\\phi .3)$ For each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\delta \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\leq \\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nAlthough $\\Gamma_{<a_{t}}$ is always finite, $\\Gamma_{>a_{t}}$ could be infinite.

The proof consists of two steps: (i) ensuring that the optimization problems are feasible, and (ii) applying the transfinite recursion theorem (Lemma A.26) and proving that $\\phi_{t}$ exists.\n\nFix any $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in(Q \\times A)^{t-1} \\times Q$. By Remark A.24, each answer in $A$ is either the smallest element of $A$ or has an immediate predecessor. We will inductively show that for every $a_{t} \\in A$, the values $\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{0}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ and $\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ satisfy the constraints of the optimization problem defining $\\phi_{t}^{0}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{t}^{1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$.\n$\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ trivially satisfies constraint ( $\\phi .1$ ). Moreover, by Corollary A.17, it satisfies constraint $(\\phi .3)$. To prove constraints $(\\phi .2)$ is satisfied, we need to show that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{<a_{t}}} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)+\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{>a_{t}} \\cup\\left\\{a_{t}\\right\\}} \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe prove this for the base case (i.e., when $a_{t}$ is the smallest element in $A$ ) and the inductive step (i.e., when $a_{t}$ has a predecessor $a^{*}$ ) separately:\n\nBase Case: Suppose $a_{t}$ is the least element of $A$. Then, $\\Gamma_{<a_{t}}$ is empty, reducing our goal to showing that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right) \\leq \\delta \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe know that $\\phi_{t-1}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)$ satisfies condition (I). Thus, by Lemma A.21,\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq \\mathrm{L}_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq \\sum_{a \\in A} \\mathrm{~L}_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)\n$$\n\nfinishing the proof for the base case.\nInductive Step: Let $a_{*}$ be the immediate predecessor of $a_{t}$. Since $\\Gamma_{<a_{t}}=\\Gamma_{<a^{*}} \\cup\\left\\{a^{*}\\right\\}$, constraints ( $\\phi .2$ ) for defining $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a^{*}\\right)$ is identical to (2). By inductive hypothesis, $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a^{*}\\right)$ exists and satisfies these constraints. Thus, inequality (2) holds, completing the induction.\n\nSince $<_{t}$ is a well-order and the value of $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ depends only on preceding values in this order, by the transfinite recursion theorem, the function $\\phi_{t}$ is well-defined and exists.\nA.3.3. Satisfying Conditions (I) to (III). Our main objective is to construct $\\phi_{t}^{b}$ so that it fulfills conditions (I), (II), and (III). Constraints ( $\\phi .1$ ) and ( $\\phi .3$ ) directly imply conditions (I) and (II), respectively. It remains to show $\\phi_{t}$ satisfies conditions (III).\n\nFirst, we claim for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and every transcript $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)$, $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)$ is at most $\\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)$ : By constraint ( $\\phi .2$ ) and non-negativity of $\\mathrm{L}^{b}$, for every $a_{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{<a_{t}} \\cup\\left\\{a_{t}\\right\\}} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, when $A$ is finite and $a^{\\prime}$ is the maximum element of $A$, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)=\\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{<a^{\\prime} \\cup\\left\\{a^{\\prime}\\right\\}}} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, when $A$ is infinite and $a_{1}^{\\prime}<_{A} a_{2}^{\\prime}<_{A} \\ldots$ are the sorted elements of $A$, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}} \\sum_{a \\in \\Gamma_{<a_{k}^{\\prime} \\cup\\left\\{a_{k}^{\\prime}\\right\\}}} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a_{k}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe rest of proof is identical to the proof given in [18]. We repeat it for completeness. For the sake of contradiction, suppose there exists $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$ and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)<\\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nFix $b$. As $\\phi_{t}^{b}$ is lower bounded by $\\mathrm{L}_{t}^{b} / \\delta$, this implies that for every $a_{t} \\in A$, in the optimization problem determining the value of $\\phi_{t}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$, constraint ( $\\phi .2$ ) for $b$ is not tight. Consequently, for every $a_{t} \\in A$, we must have had\n\n$$\n\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)=\\mu_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mu_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\notherwise, the value of $\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)$ could have increased, which contradicts the maximality of $\\phi_{b}^{t}$.\nTaking a sum over all $a_{t} \\in A$, we get\n(4) $\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\delta \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\delta \\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)=\\mu_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\mu_{t-1}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)$\n\nBy (II) and the inductive hypothesis, we know that the RHS is at least\n\n$$\n\\delta \\phi_{t-1}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)-e^{-\\epsilon} \\delta \\phi_{t-1}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nPlugging this to (4) and reformulating it, we get\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq e^{-\\epsilon}\\left(\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy (3), the LHS is negative, implying that the RHS is negative too. Thus, $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}, a\\right)<\\phi_{t-1}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)$. Hence, by an identical argument, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\phi_{t}^{1-b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right) \\geq e^{-\\epsilon}\\left(\\sum_{a_{t} \\in A} \\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)-\\phi_{t}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction when $\\epsilon>0$, which implies that condition (III) holds.",

OVERVIEW OF [20] \n\nFor $\\epsilon \\geq 0$, let $\\mathcal{M}: S_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times Q_{\\mathcal{M}} \\rightarrow S_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times A_{\\mathcal{M}}$ be an $\\epsilon$-DP IM w.r.t. a neighboring relation $\\sim$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{M}$ has discrete answer distributions. Vadhan and Wang [20] shows that for any two neighboring initial states $s_{0}$ and $s_{1}$, there exists an IPM $\\mathcal{P}$ such that for each $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, the mechanisms $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ are identical. In this section, we overview the construction of $\\mathcal{P}$ and show it satisfies the following property:\n\nClaim B.1. For any $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any query sequence $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}\\right) \\in Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{t}$, if the distributions of the first $t$ answers of $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)$ to the queries $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}\\right)$ are identical, then for every $b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, when $\\mathcal{P} \\circ^{*} \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ receives the queries $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}, \\mathcal{P}$ generates answers itself, without interacting with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$.\n\nSince $\\delta=0, \\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ returns $(b, \\perp)$ with probability $\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{1+e^{\\epsilon}}$ and $(1-b, \\perp)$ otherwise. For each $b$ and query sequence $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}\\right) \\in Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{t}$, let $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)}$ denote the distribution of the first $t$ answers of $\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)$ in response to $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}$. If $\\epsilon=0$, then define $\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{b}$ to be identical to $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)}$. Otherwise, set\n\n$$\n\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{b}=\\frac{e^{\\epsilon} \\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{b}\\right)}-\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1-b}\\right)}}{e^{\\epsilon}-1}\n$$\n\nFor $t \\in \\mathbb{N}, b \\in\\{0,1\\}$, and $\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}\\right) \\in\\left(Q_{\\mathcal{M}} \\times A_{\\mathcal{M}}\\right)^{t-1} \\times Q$, if $\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)>0$, the function $T_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}: A_{\\mathcal{M}} \\rightarrow[0,1]$ is defined as\n\n$$\nT_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(a_{t}\\right)=\\frac{\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right)}{\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t-1}}^{b}\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}\\right)}\n$$\n\nVadhan and Wang [20] define $\\mathcal{P}$ as follows: The initial state of $\\mathcal{P}$ is (null, ()$)$, where null is an empty field and () represents an empty sequence. Let $h$ denote the sequence. Let $(r, \\perp)$ denote the outcome of $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$. After interacting with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b), \\mathcal{P}$ updates null to $r$. Moreover, upon receiving a query $q$ and before returning an answer $a, \\mathcal{P}$ appends $q$ and $a$ to the history sequence $h$. To generate a response $a$ to a query $q, \\mathcal{P}$ samples $a$ from the distribution $T_{h, q}^{r}$, where $h$ is the history of all previous queries and answers.\n\nWe observe that as long as $T_{h, q}^{0}$ and $T_{h, q}^{1}$ are identical, $\\mathcal{P}$ does not need to know the value of $r$. Thus, to defer interaction with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$, we define $\\mathcal{P}$ to interact with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}(b)$ only when these distributions are different for the first time.\nProof of Claim B.1. That the distributions $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)}$ and $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{t}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)}$ are identical implies that for every $k \\leq t, \\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{k}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{0}\\right)}$ and $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{k}}^{\\mathcal{M}\\left(s_{1}\\right)}$ are identical. Consequently, by definition, both distributions $\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{k}}^{0}$ and $\\nu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{k}}^{1}$ are identical to $\\mu_{q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{k}}^{0}$. Therefore, the conditional distributions $T_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{0}$ and $T_{q_{1}, \\ldots, a_{t-1}, q_{t}}^{1}$ used by $\\mathcal{P}$ are also identical, implying that $\\mathcal{P}$ does not interact with $\\mathrm{RR}_{\\epsilon, 0}$ to generate the first $t$ answers.",

  "abstract": "Many intended uses of differential privacy involve a $\\textit{continual\nmechanism}$ that is set up to run continuously over a long period of time,\nmaking more statistical releases as either queries come in or the dataset is\nupdated. In this paper, we give the first general treatment of privacy against\n$\\textit{adaptive}$ adversaries for mechanisms that support dataset updates and\na variety of queries, all arbitrarily interleaved. It also models a very\ngeneral notion of neighboring, that includes both event-level and user-level\nprivacy.\n  We prove several $\\textit{concurrent}$ composition theorems for continual\nmechanisms, which ensure privacy even when an adversary can interleave queries\nand dataset updates to the different composed mechanisms. Previous concurrent\ncomposition theorems for differential privacy were only for the case when the\ndataset is static, with no adaptive updates. Moreover, we also give the first\ninteractive and continual generalizations of the \"parallel composition theorem\"\nfor noninteractive differential privacy. Specifically, we show that the\nanalogue of the noninteractive parallel composition theorem holds if either\nthere are no adaptive dataset updates or each of the composed mechanisms\nsatisfies pure differential privacy, but it fails to hold for composing\napproximately differentially private mechanisms with dataset updates.\n  We then formalize a set of general conditions on a continual mechanism $M$\nthat runs multiple continual sub-mechanisms such that the privacy guarantees of\n$M$ follow directly using the above concurrent composition theorems on the\nsub-mechanisms, without further privacy loss. This enables us to give a simpler\nand more modular privacy analysis of a recent continual histogram mechanism of\nHenzinger, Sricharan, and Steiner. In the case of approximate DP, ours is the\nfirst proof showing that its privacy holds against adaptive adversaries.",
