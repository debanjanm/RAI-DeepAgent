Introduction\n\nThe ergodic theorems of Birkhoff, Hopf, von Neumann, Wiener and Yoshida were generalized to the measure free setting of vector lattices (Riesz spaces) in 2007, see [19]. The Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem and Kac's formula in vector lattices were published in\n\n2023, see [1]. In none of the above were the concept of Rokhlin Towers/Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition used and up to the present the concept of Rokhlin Towers/Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition had not been generalized to the vector lattice setting. In this paper, we present a Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for dynamical systems defined by iterates of a Riesz homomorphism acting on a vector lattice (Riesz space). This takes the work of $[5,23,24]$ and others, out of the realm of metric, topological and measure spaces. We note here the contrast between the development in vector lattices and that of [4], where the ergodic theorems were derived as a consequence of the Rokhlin Towers/Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition. Our generalization to vector lattices is with respect to a discrete-time process, but generalizes the underlying space of the process. Other generalizations, see for example [22], have kept the underlying space as a measure space but have extended the time-index space to amenable groups. We refer the reader to [14, 27] for some applications and other generalizations of the Rokhlin Towers/Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition.\n\nThe extension given here, when applied back to probabilistic systems gives the existence of a Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition (also known in this context as Rokhlin towers) for conditionally ergodic processes. A consequence of this is that every conditional expectation preserving system that is aperiodic admits a Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition. Examples are given in each stage of our development to show that the given result cannot be improved without additional assumptions.\n\nIn the probability setting, the Kakutani-Rokhlin lemma gives that, for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon>0$ each a.e. bijective ergodic aperiodic measure preserving transformation, $\\tau$, on the probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu)$, there is a set $B \\in \\mathcal{A}$ so that $\\tau^{-j}(B), j=0, \\ldots, n-1$, are disjoint and $\\mu\\left(\\Omega \\backslash \\cup_{j=1}^{n} \\tau^{1-j}(B)\\right)<\\epsilon$. We refer the reader to [24, Section 3.3] for the specific result and to [13] for a survey of research around such decompositions. The generalization of the Kakutani-Rokhlin lemma to the topology-free, metric-free, measure-free setting of Riesz spaces (vector lattices) is given in Theorem 4.5.\n\nWe begin by giving an $\\epsilon$-free version of the Kakutani-Rokhlin lemma in the Riesz space setting, Theorem 3.2, see [27] for the measure space version. This version applies to conditionally ergodic systems on Riesz spaces (in fact each conditional expectation preserving system of a Riesz space gives rise to a conditionally ergodic system) and does not require aperiodicity. This then forms the foundation of Theorem 4.5, where aperiodicity is essential.\n\nThe remaining foundational aspects of ergodic theory in Riesz spaces needed for the current work can be found in [3, 9] and [16] for the general theory of conditional expectation operators in Riesz spaces. It should be noted that many other stochastic processes have been studied in the Riesz space (vector lattice) framework, for example discrete [15] and continuous $[6,7,26]$ time martingale processes as well as mixing processes [3].\n\nIn Section 2, we recall the basics of conditional expectation preserving systems, ergodic processes, Poincare's recurrence theorem and Kac's formula in Riesz spaces. In Section 3, we give a Riesz space version of the $\\epsilon$-free Kakutani-Rokhlin type decompositions. In Section 4 we introduce aperiodicity in Riesz spaces and use this concept together with the Kac formula and the $\\epsilon$-free Kakutani-Rokhlin type decomposition to give an $\\epsilon$-bound version of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition in Riesz spaces. We conclude in Section 5\n\nwith an application of the Kakutani-Rokhlin Theorem for aperiodic processes to show that every conditionally ergodic process which can be decomposed into aperiodic processes can be approximated by a periodic processes.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Preliminaries \n\nFor Riesz space theory and associated terminology, we refer readers to [28]. The background material on ergodic theory can be found in [5, 23]. Our current work builds on [1], in which many of the foundational results can be found. The concept of a conditional expectation operator on a Riesz space is fundamental to the material presented here and hence we quote its definition from [16].\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let $E$ be an Archimedean Riesz space with weak order unit. A positive order continuous projection $T: E \\rightarrow E$ which maps weak order units to weak order units is called a conditional expectation if the range of $T, R(T)$, is a Dedekind complete Riesz subspace of $E$.\n\nThroughout this work we will assume that the conditional expectation operator $T$ is strictly positive, that is, if $f \\in E_{+}$and $T f=0$ then $f=0$.\n\nThe Riesz space analogue of a measure preserving system was introduced in [10] as a conditional expectation preserving system, see below. The concept was first used and studied in [19], but not given a name there.\n\nDefinition 2.2. The 4-tuple, $(E, T, S, e)$, is called a conditional expectation preserving system (CEPS) if $E$ is a Dedekind complete Riesz space, $e$ is a weak order unit of $E, T$ is a conditional expectation operator on $E$ with $T e=e, S$ is an order continuous Riesz homomorphism on $E$ with $S e=e$ and $T S f=T f$, for all $f \\in E$.\n\nREMARK 2.1. If $(E, T, S, e)$ is a conditional expectation preserving system, then\n\n$$\nT S^{j} f=T f\n$$\n\nfor all $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and $f \\in E$.\nWe also note that if $S$ is a Riesz homomorphism with $T S=T$ where $T$ is a strictly positive conditional expectation operator on a Dedekind complete Riesz space $E$, then $S$ is order continuous, see [12] for a more general study of order continuity Riesz homomorphism. To see this, we let $f_{\\alpha}$ be a downwards directed net in $E^{+}$with $f_{\\alpha} \\downarrow 0$, then $S f_{\\alpha}$ is downwards directed with $S f_{\\alpha} \\downarrow h$ for some $h \\in E^{+}$. However $T S=T$ so, as $T$ is order continuous, $0 \\leftarrow T f_{\\alpha}=T\\left(S f_{\\alpha}\\right) \\rightarrow T h$. The strict positivity of $T$ now gives $h=0$. Hence $S f_{\\alpha} \\rightarrow 0$, making it order continuous.\n\nWe recall, from [16], the concept of $T$-universal completeness, the $T$-universal completion and, from [20], the $R(T)$-module structure of $L^{1}(T)$, see also [2].\n\nDefinition 2.3. If $T$ is a strictly positive conditional expectation operator on a Dedekind complete Riesz space, $E$ with weak order unit $e=T e$, then the natural domain of $T$ is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dom}(T):=\\left\\{f \\in E_{+}^{\\mu} \\mid \\exists \\text { net } f_{\\alpha} \\uparrow f \\text { in } E^{\\mu},\\left(f_{\\alpha}\\right) \\subset E_{+}, T f_{\\alpha} \\text { bounded in } E^{\\mu}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $E^{u}$ denotes the universal completion of $E$. We define\n\n$$\nL^{1}(T):=\\operatorname{dom}(T)-\\operatorname{dom}(T)=\\{f-g \\mid f, g \\in \\operatorname{dom}(T)\\}\n$$\n\nand say that $E$ is $T$-universally complete if $E=L^{1}(T)$.\nFrom the above definition, $E$ is $T$-universally complete if, and only if, for each upwards directed net $\\left(f_{\\alpha}\\right)_{\\alpha \\in \\Lambda}$ in $E_{*}$ such that $\\left(T f_{\\alpha}\\right)_{\\alpha \\in \\Lambda}$ is order bounded in $E^{u}$, we have that $\\left(f_{\\alpha}\\right)_{\\alpha \\in \\Lambda}$ is order convergent in $E$.\n$E^{u}$ has an $f$-algebra structure which can be chosen so that $e$ is the multiplicative identity. For $T$ acting on $E=L^{1}(T), R(T)$ is a universally complete and thus an $f$-algebra, and, further, $L^{1}(T)$ is an $R(T)$-module. From [16, Theorem 5.3], $T$ is an averaging operator, which means that if $f \\in R(T)$ and $g \\in E$ then $T(f g)=f T(g)$.\n\nFrom [19], for each $f \\in L^{1}(T)$, the Ces\u00e0ro mean\n\n$$\nL_{S} f:=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} S^{k} f\n$$\n\nconverges in order, in $L^{1}(T)$, for each Riesz homomorphism $S$ on $E=L^{1}(T)$ with $T S=T$ and $S e=e$. We denote the invariant set of the Riesz homomorphism, $S$, by\n\n$$\nI_{S}:=\\left\\{f \\in L^{1}(T): S f=f\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe say that $p \\in E_{*}$ is a component of $q \\in E_{*}$ if $p \\leq q$ and $(q-p) \\wedge p=0$. We denote the set of components of $q$ by $C_{q}$.\n\nThe conditional expectation preserving system $\\left(E=L^{1}(T), T, S, e\\right)$ is said to be conditionally ergodic if $L_{S}=T$ which is equivalent to $I_{S}=R(T)$, see [9], in which case $S T=T$ and hence $S^{j} T f=T f$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and $f \\in E$.\n\nLEMMA 2.2. If $(E, T, S, e)$ is a conditional expectation preserving system and $T$ is strictly positive then $S g=g$ for all $g \\in R(T)$. In the case of $E$ being an $R(T)$ module this invariance gives that $S(g f)=g S f$ for all $g \\in R(T)$ and $f \\in E$.\n\nProof. Due to the order continuity of $S$ and the order density of the linear combinations of components of $e$ in $E$, it suffices to prove the result for $g \\in C_{e} \\cap R(T)$ and $f \\in C_{e}$.\n\nFor $g \\in C_{e} \\cap R(T)$ we have that\n\n$$\ng=T g=T S g\n$$\n\nThe averaging property of conditional expectations operators in terms of band projections gives that $P_{T S g} \\geq P_{S g}$ where these are respectively the band projections generated by $T S g$ and $S g$, see [18, Corollary 2.3] and [17, Lemma 2.3]. Here $S g$ is a component of $e$ so $P_{S g} e=S g$. Further as $g=T S g$ which is a component of $e$ we have $P_{T S g} e=g$. Thus $g \\geq S g$. As $T$ is strictly positive and $S$ is a Riesz homomorphism by [1, Note 2.3] we have $S g=g$.\n\nFor the second result, if $f \\in C_{e}$ then $f g=f \\wedge g$ so\n\n$$\nS(g f)=S(g) \\wedge S(f)=g \\wedge S(f)=g S f\n$$\n\nsince $S f$ is also a component of $e$.\n\nIn [1, Lemma 3.1] an equivalent formulation for the definition of recurrence in [1, Definition 1.4] was proved. For convenience here we will take this equivalent statement as a our definition of recurrence below.\n\nDefinition 2.4. Recurrence Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditional expectation preserving system with $S$ bijective, then $p \\in C_{q}$ is recurrent with respect to $q \\in C_{e}$ if\n\n$$\np \\leq \\bigvee_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} S^{-n} q\n$$\n\nThe following Riesz space generalization of the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem was proved in [1, Theorem 3.2].\n\nFor brevity of notation, we define the supremum over an empty family of components of $e$ to be zero, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\bigvee_{j=1}^{0} p_{j}:=0\n$$\n\nfor $\\left(p_{j}\\right) \\subset C_{e}$.\nTHEOREM 2.3 Poincar\u00e9.

Kakutani-Rokhlin Lemma - $\\epsilon$-free \n\nWe recall an $\\epsilon$-free version of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for ergodic measurepreserving systems from [21, Theorem 2] and [5, Theorem 6.24].

For this it suffices to prove that $q \\wedge S^{k} q=0$, for all $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$. If $j, m \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, with $i \\geq n(j+1)$ and $r \\geq n(m+1)$ then $n j \\neq n m+k, i>n j$ and $r>n m+k$, so, by (2.2),\n\n$$\nq \\wedge S^{k} q=\\sum_{j, m=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{i \\geq n(j+1)} \\sum_{r \\geq n(m+1)} S^{n j} q(p, i) \\wedge S^{n m+k} q(p, r)=0\n$$\n\nThus $q, S q, \\ldots, S^{n-1} q$ are disjoint.\nWe now proceed to the proof of (3.1).

Consider the Riesz space $E=\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ with componentwise ordering and weak order unit $e=(1,1)$ and order continuous Riesz homomorphism $S(x, y)=(y, x)$. We take as our conditional expectation $T(x, y)=\\frac{x+y}{2}(1,1)$. It is easily verified that $(E, T, S, e)$ is a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system. Taking $p=(1,0)$ in Theorem 3.2 we have that $T p=\\frac{1}{2}(1,1)$ giving\n\n$$\n\\left(P_{T p} e-(n-1) T p\\right)^{+}=\\left((1,1)-\\frac{n-1}{2}(1,1)\\right)^{+}= \\begin{cases}(1,1), & n=1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}(1,1), & n=2 \\\\ (0,0), & n \\geq 3\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe required components of $P_{T p} e=e$ for the respective values of $n$ are $q_{1}=(1,1), q_{2}=$ $(0,1)$ and $q=(0,0)$ for $n \\geq 3$. Then $q_{n}, \\ldots S^{n-1} q_{n}$ are disjoint and\n\n$$\nT\\left(\\bigvee_{j=0}^{n-1} S^{j} q_{n}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n(1,1), n=1 \\\\\n(1,1), n=2 \\\\\n(0,0), n \\geq 3\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFor this example the $\\epsilon$ bound of Theorem 4.5 fails for $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$ and $n=2$.\n\nEXAMPLE 3.4. As in [1, Section 5], let $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu)$ be a probability space, where $\\mu$ is a complete measure. Let $\\Sigma$ be a sub- $\\sigma$-algebra of $\\mathcal{A}$. As the Riesz space $E$ we take the space of a.e. equivalence classes of measurable functions $f: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ for which the sequence $\\left(\\mathbb{E}[\\min (|f(x)|, \\mathbf{n}) \\mid \\Sigma]\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, is bounded above by an a.e. finite valued measurable function. Here $\\mathbf{n}$ is the (equivalence class of the) function with value $n$ a.e. For $f \\in E$ with $f \\geq 0$ we define\n\n$$\nT f=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[\\min (f(x), \\mathbf{n}) \\mid \\Sigma]\n$$\n\nin the sense of a.e. pointwise limits. We now extend $T$ to $E$ by setting $T f=T f^{*}-T f^{-}$. This $T$ is the maximal extension of $\\mathbb{E}[-|\\Sigma|$ as a conditional expectation operator, and we will denote it again by $\\mathbb{E}[-|\\Sigma|$. The space $E$ has the a.e. equivalence class of the constant 1 function as a weak order unit. The space $E$ is a $T$-universally complete Riesz space with weak order unit $\\mathbf{1}$ and $T$ is a strictly positive Riesz space conditional expectation operator on $E$ having $T \\mathbf{1}=\\mathbf{1}$.

Let $\\tau: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\Omega$ be an ergodic measure preserving transformation on a nonatomic measure space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu), n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\epsilon>0$, then there is a measurable set $B \\subset \\Omega$ such that $B, \\tau^{-1} B, \\ldots \\tau^{1-n} B$ are pairwise disjoint and cover $\\Omega$ up to a set of measure less than $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe original $\\epsilon$-bounded version of the decomposition, as developed by Rokhlin, see [24, page 10], was posed for ergodic measure preserving systems which are aperiodic. See also [11].\n\nOn a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$, an aperiodic transformation is a transformation whose periodic points form a set of measure 0 (see [24]), that is $\\mu\\left(\\left\\{x \\in \\Omega \\mid \\tau^{p} x=x\\right.\\right.$ for some $\\left.p \\in\\right.$ $\\mathbb{N}\\})=0$. We recall Rokhlin's 1943 version of the Kakutani-Rokhlin Lemma requiring aperiodicity, quoted from [27].\n\nTHEOREM 4.2. If $\\tau$ is an aperiodic automorphism, then for any natural number $n$ and any positive $\\epsilon$, there exists a measurable set $A \\subset \\Omega$ such that the sets $A, \\tau^{-1} A, \\ldots, \\tau^{1-n} A$ are pairwise disjoint and the complement of their union has measure less than $\\epsilon$.\n\nLet $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$ be a probability space. The measure $\\mu$ is said to be continuous if for any $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $\\mu(A)>0$ and any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $0<\\alpha<\\mu(A)$ there exists $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $B \\subset A$ and $\\mu(B)=\\alpha$. Note that every continuous measure is nonatomic. If $\\mu$ is a continuous measure and $\\tau$ is an ergodic measure preserving transformation, then $\\tau$ is aperiodic. Indeed, as $\\tau$ is ergodic, there exists $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mu\\left(A_{p}\\right)>0$, where $A_{p}=\\left\\{x \\in \\Omega \\mid \\tau^{p} x=x\\right\\}$. Choose $B \\subset A_{p}$ with $0<\\mu(B)<\\frac{1}{p}$, which is possible as $\\mu$ is a continuous measure. The set $C=B \\cup \\tau^{-1} B \\cup \\cdots \\cup \\tau^{1-p} B$ is $\\tau$-invariant and satisfies $0<\\mu(C)<1$ contradicting the assumption of ergodicity.\n\nAn aperiodic transformation on a continuous measure space need not be ergodic. For example, consider the unit square $[0,1] \\times[0,1]$ with Lebesgue measure. The transformation\n\n$$\n\\tau(x, y)=((x+\\alpha) \\bmod 1, y) \\forall(x, y) \\in[0,1] \\times[0,1]\n$$\n\nwith $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$ irrational, is aperiodic but not ergodic.\nWe extend these decompositions to the measure free context of Riesz spaces and begin by giving (a non-pointwise) definition of periodicity in the setting of Riesz spaces.\n\nDefinition 4.1. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditional expectation preserving system and $v$ be a component of $e$. We say that $(S, v)$ is periodic if there is $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ so that for all components $c$ of $v$ with $0 \\neq c \\neq v$ we have that $q(c, k)=0$ for all $k \\geq N$.\n\nThe logic of this definition is that for all such $c$ we have\n\n$$\nc=\\bigvee_{k=1}^{N-1} q(c, k)\n$$\n\nand $S^{k} q(c, k) \\leq c$, for $k=1, \\ldots, N-1$.\nWe note that, as in the measure theoretic setting, aperiodicity is defined as a stronger constraint than the negation of periodicity.\n\nDefinition 4.2. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditional expectation preserving system and $v \\neq 0$ be a component of $e$. We say that $(S, v)$ is aperiodic, if for each $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and each component $c \\neq 0$ of $v$, there exists $k \\geq N$ and a component $u$ of $c$ with $q(u, k) \\neq 0$.\n\nTHEOREM 4.3. Consider $E=L^{1}(\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}, \\mu)$ a probability space with $T f:=\\mathbb{E}[f] \\mathbf{1}$, where $e:=\\mathbf{1}$ is the constant function with value 1 a.e., and $S f:=f \\circ \\tau$ is the von Neumann map generated by $\\tau$, a measure preserving transformation with $\\tau$ a.e. surjective. Further assume\n\nthat there is $G \\in \\mathcal{B}$ with $0<\\mu(G)<1$. In this case the measure theoretic definition of aperiodicity of $\\tau$ is equivalent to the Riesz spaces definition of $(S, e)$ being aperiodic.\n\nProof. Suppose that $(S, e)$ is aperiodic, i.e. for each $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and each component $c$ of $e$ there exists $k \\geq N$ and a component $u$ of $c$ with $q(u, k) \\neq 0$. Let $A$ denote the set of periodic points of $\\tau$. By the way of contradiction, suppose that $\\mu(A)>0$. Hence there exists $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mu\\left(A_{N}\\right)>0$, where $A_{N}$ is the set of points of period $N$. Let $c:=\\chi_{A_{N}}$ then from the aperiodicity of $(S, v)$ there is a component $u$ of $c$ and $k>N$ so that $q(u, k) \\neq 0$. Here there is a measurable subset $B$ of $A_{N}$ so that $u=\\chi_{B}$. Here all points of $B$ are of period $N$, giving $q(u, j)=0$ for all $j \\geq N$, contradicting $q(u, k) \\neq 0$.\n\nConversely, if the set of periodic points of $\\tau$ has measure zero, we show that $(S, e)$ is aperiodic.\n\nDeveloping on [25, Lemma 3.12], we give a meaning to the set of periodic points of $\\tau$ having measure zero in a point-less setting. Let $p_{k}:=\\chi_{A_{k}}$, where $A_{k}$ is the a.e. maximal measurable set which has every measurable subset invariant under $\\tau^{-k}$. In the Riesz space terminology $p_{k}$ is the maximal component of $e$ with $S^{k} v=v$ for each $v$ a component of $p_{k}$. Now $\\tau$ being aperiodic gives that $p_{k}=0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nSuppose that $(S, e)$ is not aperiodic, then there exist $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a component $c \\neq 0$ of $e$, so that, for all $k \\geq N$ and components $u$ of $c$ we have $q(u, k)=0$. Hence\n\n$$\nu=\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} q(u, k)\n$$\n\nfor all $k \\geq N$ and $u$ a component of $c$. Thus\n\n$$\nS^{N!} u=u\n$$\n\nfor all components $u$ of $c$, making $c$ a component of $p_{N!}=0$. Thus $0<c \\leq p_{N!}=0$, a contradiction. Thus $(S, e)$ is aperiodic.\n\nLEMMA 4.4. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system with E T-universally complete and $(S, e)$ aperiodic, then, for each $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there is a component $c_{N}$ of $e$ with $P_{T c_{N}} e=e$ and $S^{i} c_{N} \\wedge S^{j} c_{N}=0$ for all $i, j=0, \\ldots, N$ with $i \\neq j$.\n\nProof. For each component $p \\neq 0$ of $e$ let\n\n$$\nK_{N}(p)=\\sum_{k=N+1}^{\\infty} q(p, k)\n$$\n\nHere $K_{N}(p)$ is a component of $p$ and, by Lemma 2.5,\n\n$$\n0=S^{i} K_{N}(p) \\wedge S^{j} K_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nfor all $0 \\leq i<j \\leq N$.\nLet\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{G}:=\\left\\{\\left(p, T K_{N}(p)\\right) \\mid p \\text { a component of } e\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHere $(e, 0) \\in \\mathfrak{G}$ so $\\mathfrak{G}$ is non-empty. We partially order $\\mathfrak{G}$ by $\\left(p, T K_{N}(p)\\right) \\leq\\left(\\tilde{p}, T K_{N}(\\tilde{p})\\right)$ if and only if $p \\leq \\tilde{p}$ and $T K_{N}(p) \\leq T K_{N}(\\tilde{p})$.\n\nIf $\\left(p, T k_{N}(p)\\right)_{p \\in \\Lambda}$ is a chain (totally ordered subset) in $\\mathfrak{G}$, let\n\n$$\n\\hat{p}=\\bigvee_{p \\in \\Lambda} p\n$$\n\nHere\n\n$$\n\\hat{p}=\\lim _{p \\in \\Lambda} p\n$$\n\nwhere $(p)_{p \\in \\Lambda}$ is an upwards directed net, directed by the partial ordering in the Riesz space. By Lemma 2.4,\n\n$$\nK_{N}(p)=p-\\sum_{k=1}^{N} q(p, k)\n$$\n\nmaking $K_{N}(p)$ order continuous in $p$, see the definition of $q(p, k)$. Thus\n\n$$\nT K_{N}(\\hat{p})=\\lim _{p \\in \\Lambda} T K_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nFurther, by the ordering on $\\mathfrak{G}$, the net $\\left(T K_{N}(p)\\right)_{p \\in \\Lambda}$ is increasing and bounded, thus having\n\n$$\n\\lim _{p \\in \\Lambda} T K_{N}(p)=\\bigvee_{p \\in \\Lambda} T K_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nHence we have\n\n$$\nT K_{N}(\\hat{p})=\\bigvee_{p \\in \\Lambda} T K_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nmaking $\\left(\\hat{p}, T k_{N}(\\hat{p})\\right)$ an upper bound (in fact the supremum) for $\\left(p, T k_{N}(p)\\right)_{p \\in \\Lambda}$.\nThus Zorn's Lemma can be applied to $\\mathfrak{G}$ to give that it has a maximal element, say $\\left(p, T k_{N}(p)\\right)$.\n\nIf $P_{T K_{N}(p)} e \\neq e$, let $u=e-P_{T K_{N}(p)} e$, then $u$ is a non-zero component of $e$, so by the aperiodicity of $(S, e)$, there exists $k>N$ and $c_{k}(u)$ a component of $u$ with $q\\left(c_{k}(u), k\\right) \\neq 0$. As $u \\in R(T)$ we have $S^{j} u=u$, for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and $p \\leq e-u \\in R(T)$ which give\n\n$$\nK_{N}\\left(c_{k}(u)+p\\right)=K_{N}\\left(c_{k}(u)\\right)+K_{N}(p)>K_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nThus\n\n$$\n\\left(p, T K_{N}(p)\\right)<\\left(p+c_{k}(u), T K_{N}\\left(p+c_{k}(u)\\right) \\in \\mathfrak{G}\\right.\n$$\n\ncontradicting the maximality of $\\left(p, T K_{N}(p)\\right)$. Hence $P_{T K_{N}(p)}=e$ and setting $c_{N}=K_{N}(p)$ concludes the proof.\n\nThe Kakutani-Rokhlin Lemma with $\\epsilon$-bound can be formulated in a Riesz space as follows.\n\nTHEOREM 4.5 Riesz space Kakutani-Rokhlin. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system with E T-universally complete and $S$ surjective. If $(S, e)$ is aperiodic, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon>0$ then there exists a component $q$ of $e$ in $E$ with $\\left(S^{i} q\\right)_{i=0, \\ldots, n-1}$ disjoint and\n\n$$\nT\\left(e-\\bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1} S^{i} q\\right) \\leq \\epsilon e\n$$\n\nProof. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon>0$. Take $N>\\frac{n-1}{\\epsilon}$. By Lemma 4.4, there exists a component $c_{N}$ of $e$ with $P_{T c_{N}} e=e$ and $S^{i} c_{N} \\wedge S^{j} c_{N}=0$ for all $i, j=0, \\ldots, N$ with $i \\neq j$. Let $p:=c_{N}$. Then $q(p, k)=0$ for all $k=1, \\ldots, N$ giving that\n\n$$\nN p \\leq n(p)\n$$\n\nBy Theorem 2.6 we have\n\n$$\ne=P_{T p} e=T n(p)\n$$\n\nCombining (4.2) and (4.3), we get\n\n$$\nN T p \\leq T n(p)=e\n$$\n\nSince $N>\\frac{n-1}{\\epsilon}$, (4.4) yields\n\n$$\nT p \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{n-1} e\n$$\n\nBy Theorem 3.2, there exists a component $q$ of $P_{T p} e=e$ such that $q, S q, \\ldots, S^{n-1} q$ are pairwise disjoint and\n\n$$\nT\\left(\\bigvee_{j=0}^{n-1} S^{j} q\\right) \\geq P_{T p} e-(n-1) T p \\geq e-\\epsilon e\n$$\n\nwhich gives the inequality of the theorem.\nOn reading the works of Rokhlin, it appears that the requirement of conditional ergodicity is redundant and only aperiodicity is needed. As we know, that every CEPS is conditionally ergodic with respect to $L_{S}$. So in our case conditional ergodicity can be dispensed with, but we need to be careful to use the conditional expectation operator $L_{S}$ and work in the $L_{S}$-universal completion of $E$, which we will denote by $\\hat{E}$.\n\nCOROLLARY 4.6. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a conditional expectation preserving system with $E$ $T$-universally complete and $S$ surjective, then $\\left(\\hat{E}, L_{S}, S, e\\right)$ is a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system. If $v$ is a component of $e$ in $R\\left(L_{S}\\right)$ with $(S, v)$ aperiodic, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon>0$ then there exists a component $q$ of $v$ in $E$ with $\\left(S^{i} q\\right)_{i=0, \\ldots, n-1}$ disjoint and\n\n$$\nL_{S}\\left(v-\\bigvee_{i=0}^{n-1} S^{i} q\\right) \\leq \\epsilon v\n$$\n\nTheorem 4.5 is the specific case of Corollary 4.6 where $(E, T, S, e)$ is a conditionally ergodic and $E$ is $T$-universally complete, as then $L_{S}=T$.\n\nEXAMPLE 4.7. Continuing on Example 3.4, let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$ be so that $L_{S} \\chi_{A}=\\chi_{A}$. If $\\epsilon>0$ and in addition $\\tau$ is an a.e. aperiodic map on $A$, then Corollary 4.6 gives that there exists $B \\in \\mathcal{A}$ with $B \\subset A$ such that $B, \\tau^{-1}(B), \\ldots, \\tau^{1-n}(B)$ are a.e. pairwise disjoint and\n\n$$\n0 \\leq L_{S}\\left(\\chi_{A}-\\chi_{C}\\right) \\leq \\epsilon \\chi_{A}\n$$\n\nwhere $C=\\bigcup_{j=0}^{n-1} \\tau^{-j} B$.\n\nTo highlight the need for aperiodicity, we now give an example of a conditionally ergodic preserving system $(E, T, S, e)$ which is $T$-universally complete and is neither periodic nor aperiodic and for which the $\\epsilon$ approximation of Theorem 4.5 fails.\n\nExample 4.8. Let $E_{n}=\\ell(n)$, the space of real finite sequences of length $n$ with componentwise ordering. On $E_{n}$ we introduce the conditional expectation\n\n$$\nT_{n}\\left(f_{n}\\right)(i)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} f_{n}(j) \\mathbf{1}_{n}, f_{n} \\in E_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{n}(j)=1$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, n$. Further $\\mathbf{1}_{n}$ is a weak order unit for $E_{n}$. On each $E_{n}$ we take $S_{n}$ as the Riesz homomorphism given by $S_{1}\\left(f_{1}\\right)=f_{1}$, and for $n \\geq 2$,\n\n$$\nS_{n} f_{n}(j)= \\begin{cases}f_{n}((j-1)), & j=2, \\ldots, n \\\\ f_{n}(n), & j=1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nClearly $\\left(E_{n}, T_{n}, S_{n}, \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right)$ is a $T_{n}$-universally complete ergodic conditional expectation preserving system. We take $(E, T, S, \\mathbf{1})$ as the direct product of the spaces $\\left(E_{n}, T_{n}, S_{n}, \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right), n \\in$ $\\mathbb{N}$. Now\n\n$$\nE=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_{n}, \\quad T=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} T_{n}, \\quad S=\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} S_{n}, \\quad \\mathbf{1}=\\left(\\mathbf{1}_{1}, \\mathbf{1}_{2}, \\ldots\\right)\n$$\n\nThe resulting space $(E, T, S, e)$ is a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system with $E T$-universally complete. Further $(S, e)$ is neither periodic nor aperiodic. If we take $n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\backslash\\{1\\}$ and $0<\\epsilon<1 / n$ in Theorem 4.5 and assume that there exists component $p$ of $\\mathbf{1}$ exhibiting the required properties of the theorem, then the disjointness of $S^{j} p$ for $j=0, \\ldots, n$ gives that the components $p_{j}=0$ for $j \\leq n$, but then $S_{j}^{k} p_{j}=0$ for all $k$ and so (4.1) fails.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. Approximation of aperiodic maps \n\nRokhlin proved an interesting consequence of his lemma stating that any aperiodic transformation $\\tau$ can be approximated by periodic ones, see [8, page 75] and [27]. That is, for any positive integer $n$ and any $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a periodic transformation $\\tau^{\\prime}$ of period $n$ such that $d\\left(\\tau, \\tau^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1}{n}+\\epsilon$ where $d\\left(\\tau, \\tau^{\\prime}\\right)=\\mu\\left\\{x: \\tau x \\neq \\tau^{\\prime} x\\right\\}$.\n\nIn this section we apply Theorem 4.5 to obtain an approximation of aperiodic conditional expectation preserving transformations by periodic ones in the conditional Riesz space setting.\n\nTHEOREM 5.1. Let $(E, T, S, e)$ be a $T$-universally complete conditionally ergodic preserving system where $S$ is a surjective Riesz homomorphism and $(S, e)$ aperiodic. For each $1>\\epsilon>0$, there exists a surjective Riesz homomorphism $S^{\\prime}$ such that $\\left(E, T, S^{\\prime}, e\\right)$ is a conditional expectation preserving system with $\\left(S^{\\prime}, e\\right)$ periodic and\n\n$$\n\\sup _{u \\in C_{e}} T\\left|\\left(S-S^{\\prime}\\right) u\\right| \\leq \\epsilon e\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\epsilon>0$ and $n>4 / \\epsilon$.

From (5.9) and (5.10) we get\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime} e=S q+p+(e-h)=e\n$$\n\nFrom (5.10) and (5.9), as $T S=T$,\n\n$$\nT S^{\\prime}=T S P_{q}+T S^{1-n} P_{S^{n-1} p}+T P_{e-h}=T\\left(P_{e-h+q+S^{n-1} p}\\right)=T\n$$\n\nAs $T$ is strictly positive, the condition $T S^{\\prime}=T$ ensures that $S^{\\prime}$ is injective.\nWe now prove that $S^{\\prime}$ is surjective. In particular, for $f \\in E$ set\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}=P_{e-h} f+P_{q} S^{-1} f+P_{S^{n-1} p} S^{n-1} f\n$$\n\nWe show that $S^{\\prime} \\hat{f}=f$.

For $u \\in \\mathcal{C}_{e}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left(S-S^{\\prime}\\right) u=\\left(S-S^{1-n}\\right) P_{S^{n-1} p} u+(S-I) P_{e-h} u\n$$\n\nHere, as $T S^{j}=T, j \\geq 0$, by (5.6),\n\n$$\nT\\left|\\left(S-S^{1-n}\\right) P_{S^{n-1} p} u\\right| \\leq T S^{n} p+T p=2 T p \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} e\n$$\n\nand, by (5.2),\n\n$$\nT\\left|(S-I) P_{e-h} u\\right| \\leq T S(e-h)+T(e-h)=2 T(e-h) \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} e\n$$\n\ngiving\n\n$$\nT\\left|\\left(S-S^{\\prime}\\right) u\\right| \\leq T\\left|\\left(S-S^{1-n}\\right) P_{S^{n-1} P} u\\right|+T\\left|(S-I) P_{e-h} u\\right| \\leq \\epsilon e\n$$\n\nThus (5.1) holds.\n\nAcknowledgements.
