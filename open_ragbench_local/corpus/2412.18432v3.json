To be specific, let $\\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)$ be the set of probability measures $\\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))$ on the product space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ for some $d \\geqslant 1$, with prescribed first and second coordinate marginals $(\\eta, \\mu)$ and densities $\\left(e^{-U}, e^{-V}\\right)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Additionally, let $Q(x, d y)=q(x, y) d y$ be a Markov transition kernel on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with density $q(x, y)$ with respect to (w.r.t.) the Lebesgue measure $d y$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The (regularized) entropic transport problem associated with these mathematical objects is formulated as $[27,55]$\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)}{\\arg \\min }\\left(-\\int \\log q(x, y) \\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))+\\operatorname{Ent}(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\eta \\otimes \\mu)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Ent}(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\eta \\otimes \\mu)$ is the relative entropy of $\\mathcal{P}$ w.r.t. the product measure $\\eta \\otimes \\mu$ (we refer to Section 2.1 for the description of the relative entropy). In the optimal transport literature, the function $c(x, y)=-\\log q(x, y)$ is sometimes called the cost function. As shown in Section 2.4 dedicated to conditioning principles, the function $c(x, y)$ can also be interpreted as a log-likelihood function. The quadratic cost defined by\n\n$$\nc(x, y)=c_{t}(x, y):=\\frac{1}{2 t}\\|x-y\\|^{2}+\\frac{d}{2} \\log (2 \\pi t)\n$$\n\nfor some given $t>0$ corresponds to Gaussian densities and the heat equation semigroup (see for instance Remark 2.3). The optimal transport problem corresponds to the case $t=0$. Indeed, up to a rescaling, when $t=0$ solving (1.1) is equivalent to solving the optimal transport problem\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)}{\\arg \\min } \\int\\|x-y\\|^{2} \\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))\n$$\n\nIn this context, the parameter $t>0$ is seen as a regularization parameter. For a more thorough discussion on these entropically regularized optimal transport problems, we refer to the pioneering article by Cuturi [27] (see also [42, 43]).\n\nChoose $\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)$ of the form\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))=\\eta(d x) \\mathcal{K}(x, d y)\n$$\n\nand set\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{0}(d(x, y)):=\\eta(d x) \\mathcal{Q}(x, d y)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{K}(x, d y)$ and $\\mathcal{Q}(x, d y)$ are Markov kernels. In this context, using the decomposition\n\n$$\n\\frac{d \\mathcal{P}}{d \\mathcal{P}_{0}}=\\frac{d \\mathcal{P}}{d(\\eta \\otimes \\mu)} \\frac{d(\\eta \\otimes \\mu)}{d \\mathcal{P}_{0}}\n$$\n\nwe readily obtain the entropic cost formula\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ent}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\mathcal{P}_{0}\\right)+\\int \\mu(d y) V(y)=-\\int \\log q(x, y) \\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))+\\operatorname{Ent}(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\eta \\otimes \\mu)\n$$\n\nIn other words, the solution of the entropic transport problem (1.1) coincides with the solution of the (static) Schr\u00f6dinger bridge from $\\eta$ to $\\mu$ w.r.t. the reference measure $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$, which is defined by\n\n$$\n\\underset{\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)}{\\arg \\min } \\operatorname{Ent}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\mathcal{P}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is implicitly assumed there exists some $\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\eta, \\mu)$ such that $\\operatorname{Ent}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\mathcal{P}_{0}\\right)<\\infty$. This condition ensures the existence of a Schr\u00f6dinger bridge distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ that solves (1.3) (cf. the seminal article by Csisz\u00e1r [26], as well as Section 6 in the Lecture Notes by Nutz [55], see also the survey article by L\u00e9onard [51] and references therein).\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger bridges can rarely be solved analytically. However, solutions can be approximated efficiently using the Sinkhorn algorithm, also referred to as the iterative proportional fitting procedure $[27,60,61]$. Let $\\mathcal{C}_{X}(\\eta)$ be the set of probability measures $\\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))$ with marginal $\\mathcal{P}^{X}(d x)=\\eta(d x)$ w.r.t. the $x$-coordinate and let $\\mathcal{C}_{Y}(\\eta)$ be the set of probability measures $\\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))$ with marginal $\\mathcal{P}^{Y}(d x)=\\mu(d y)$ w.r.t. the $y$-coordinate. In this notation, the Sinkhorn algorithm starts from $\\mathcal{P}_{0}$ and solves sequentially the following entropic transport problems\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{2 n+1}:=\\underset{\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{Y}(\\mu)}{\\arg \\min } \\operatorname{Ent}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\mathcal{P}_{2 n}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathcal{P}_{2(n+1)}:=\\underset{\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{X}(\\eta)}{\\arg \\min } \\operatorname{Ent}\\left(\\mathcal{P} \\mid \\mathcal{P}_{2 n+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhen $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, Sinkhorn bridges $\\mathcal{P}_{n}$ converge towards the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge from $\\eta$ to $\\mu$.\nIn the dual formulation, these distributions are often written as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{n}(d(x, y))=e^{-U_{n}(x)} q(x, y) e^{-V_{n}(y)} d x d y\n$$\n\nfor a pair of Schr\u00f6dinger potentials $\\left(U_{n}, V_{n}\\right)$ satisfying a system of integral relations starting from $\\left(U_{0}, V_{0}\\right)=(U, 0)$ (see Proposition 6.1). The limiting Schr\u00f6dinger potentials $(\\mathbb{U}(x), \\mathbb{V}(x)):=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(U_{n}(x), V_{n}(x)\\right)$ yield the bridge distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ that solves problem (1.3), i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathcal{P}_{n}(d(x, y))=\\mathcal{P}(d(x, y))=e^{-\\mathbb{U}(x)} q(x, y) e^{-\\mathbb{V}(y)} d x d y\n$$\n\nWhile Sinkhorn iterations as presented in the recursions (1.4) may look appealing and easy to implement, one should note that they are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations with generally no finite-dimensional recursive solutions and, therefore, they do not lead to a practical algorithm. In this paper, we present a self-contained analysis of Schr\u00f6dinger bridges and a tractable Sinkhorn algorithm for a general class of Gaussian models. We provide closed form expression of Schr\u00f6dinger bridges $(\\mathbb{U}, \\mathbb{V})$ as well as the description of the bridge distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ that solves problem (1.3) in terms of transport maps. We also provide a refined convergence analysis with sharp exponential convergence rates for entropic transport distributions $\\mathcal{P}_{n}$ and the dual Schr\u00f6dinger potentials $\\left(U_{n}, V_{n}\\right)$ in expression (1.5).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 1.2 Gaussian models \n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}_{d}^{0}$ be set of positive semi-definite matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, and let $\\mathcal{S}_{d}^{+} \\subset \\mathcal{S}_{d}^{0}$ be the subset of positive definite matrices. Denote by $\\nu_{m, \\sigma}$ the Gaussian distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with mean\n\n$m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and covariance matrix $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_{d}^{+}$. In addition, let $g_{\\sigma}$ denote the probability density function (pdf) of the distribution $\\nu_{0, \\sigma}$, with covariance matrix $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_{d}^{+}$.

As expected, for the Gaussian models in (1.7), the entropic transport problem (1.4) is indeed solved by a finite-dimensional family of Gaussian conditional/conjugate distributions. For instance, if $\\mathcal{P}_{2 n}:=\\operatorname{Law}\\left(X_{n}, Y_{n}\\right)$ then we have $\\mathcal{P}_{2 n+1}(d(x, y))=\\mu(d y) \\mathbb{P}\\left(X_{n} \\in d x \\mid Y_{n}=y\\right)$ and the conditional distribution is Gaussian and can be calculated using least squares and linear regression methods (see for instance the conditioning principles described in Section 2.4 and in Appendix C on page 51). The conditional mean and covariance updates associated with these models coincide with the traditional Kalman update that arises in discrete generation and linear-Gaussian filtering models, see for example Section 9.9.6 in [33].\n\nHence, one of the main goals of this paper is to apply this filtering methodology to solve Schr\u00f6dinger bridges and analyze the convergence of the Sinkhorn algorithm for Gaussian models. In the theory of Kalman filtering, the flow of covariance matrices associated with the Sinkhorn algorithm also satisfies offline matrix difference Riccati equations. The stability analysis and the stationary matrices associated with Riccati matrix flows are well understood, see for instance [35] and references therein. In Appendix B we provide a brief discussion on Riccati matrix flows in the context of the Sinhorn algorithm, including the Floquet-type theory developed in [35], as well as several Lipschitz type inequalities and exponential type decays to equilibrium for Riccati flows and their associated exponential semigroups.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 1.3 Motivation and related work \n\nOptimal transport and its regularized entropic version have become state-of-the-art tools in a variety of application domains, including generative modeling and machine learning [6, 29, 49, 57], statistical barycenter problems [1, 4, 10, 24, 28, 30], economy [12], computer vision $[38,62]$, control theory $[17,18]$, and many others.\n\nFinding and rigorously understanding closed-form solutions for multivariate Gaussian entropic optimal transport is of fundamental importance. Exact recursions for entropic optimal transport in the Gaussian case can serve as a baseline for testing approximate Sinkhorn algorithms on multivariate models, much like the Kalman filter's role in testing approximate filtering algorithms. They can also form the basis for developing novel entropic optimal transport methods for non-Gaussian distributions using well-established nonlinear Kalman filtering ideas. Furthermore, the problem of finding Gaussian distributions on product spaces with prescribed multivariate marginals and conditional constraints is a surprisingly difficult problem arising in graphical models [4, 23, 50]. Gaussian Schr\u00f6dinger bridges related entropic transport problems also arise in solving matching problems as well\n\nas in optimal control theory $[12,17,18]$. These articles provide and utilize closed form expressions for some specific classes of Gaussian Schr\u00f6dinger bridges.\n\nGiven its central importance, the convergence of the Sinkhorn algorithm for Gaussian models has been discussed in prior works. The earliest works to discuss the convergence of Sinkhorn algorithm are [24, 25]. However, these works do not present any closed form solutions or any explicit results on the convergence rates. The more recent article [29] also discusses quantitative exponential decays for Gaussian centered models (where $m=\\bar{m}=0$ and $\\alpha=0$ ) and scalar-type matrices $(\\beta=b I, \\tau=I$ and $\\sigma=t I=\\bar{\\sigma})$ for some real numbers $t \\in] 0, \\infty[$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The type of models, with $m=\\bar{m}=0,(\\alpha, \\beta)=(0, I)$ and scalar-type covariance $\\tau=t I$, is also studied in [47]. In this context, the authors present a closed form expression of limiting Schr\u00f6dinger potential functions in terms of the fixed point of a Riccati-type equation.\n\nWhen $\\beta=I$ and for scalar-type covariance $\\tau=t I$, similar fixed-point equations are also investigated in the series of recent articles $[1,12,14,30,47,53]$. These articles discuss Gaussian bridges and entropic interpolations of the form in Eq. (1.2). They also discuss the effect of the regularization parameter but they do not seek any closed-form expressions of the iterations in the Sinkhorn algorithm or their convergence rates. The regularity properties of the optimal transport map between Gaussian distributions can also be deduced from Caffarelli's contraction theorem [15] on the Lipschitz's regularity properties of the optimal transport map between Gaussian and strongly log-concave distributions.\n\nMost of the literature on Sinkhorn iterates is concerned with finite state spaces [13, 60, $61,63]$ as well as compact state spaces or bounded cost functions using Hilbert projective metrics techniques [19, 31, 41, 54]. It is out of the scope of this article to review all the contributions in this field -we simply refer to the recent book [57] and the references therein.\n\nThere are very few articles on the convergence of Sinkhorn iterates on non-compact spaces and unbounded cost functions that apply to Gaussian models with the notable exception of two recent significant contributions [21, 22]. More precisely, the exponential convergence of the Sinkhorn iterations in (1.4) for cost functions of the form in Eq. (1.2) can be deduced from the recent article [22], which investigate quantitative contraction rates for target marginal distributions $(\\eta, \\mu)$ with an asymptotically positive log-concavity profile and cost functions of the form in (1.2) associated with a sufficiently large regularization parameter. These exponential decays have been recently refined to apply to all values of the regularization parameter in the more recent article [21]. The entropy estimates presented in Proposition 1.3 of [21] also apply directly to Gaussian models of the form (1.7) when the cost function is symmetric and the parameters are $(\\alpha, \\beta)=(0, I)$ and $\\tau=t \\Sigma$, for some symmetric positive-definite matrix $\\Sigma$. These exponential decays presented in [22, 21] are closely related but differ from to the ones based on Floquet-type representation of Riccati flows discussed in the present article (see for instance Theorem 5.1 the estimate (5.6) and Remark 5.10).\n\nExtensions of our results to log-concave models have been developed in [34]. The recent article [2] also develops a semigroup contraction analysis based on Lyapunov techniques to prove the exponential convergence of Sinkhorn algorithm on weighted Banach spaces. These Lyapunov approaches also apply to multivariate linear Gaussian models for sufficiently large regularization parameter as well as statistical finite mixture models including Gaussiankernel density estimation of complex data distributions arising in generative models.\n\nIn the same context, the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations can also be deduced from\n\nTheorem 6.15 in [55] under an exponential integrability condition [55, condition (6.8)] which is again only met for a sufficiently large regularization parameter. To the best of our knowledge, the weakest regularity conditions that ensure the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations are presented in the recent articles $[45,56]$. These are mild integrability conditions of the cost function w.r.t. the target marginal measures $(\\eta, \\mu)$, which apply to general Gaussian models and any choice of the regularization parameter (see Remark 6.10). Nevertheless, the article [56] does not provide convergence results in relative entropy but in total variation, without any explicit rates, and the article [45] presents sub-linear relative entropy rates.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 1.4 Main contributions \n\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a self-contained and refined analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm and Schr\u00f6dinger's bridges for general Gaussian multivariate models.

Let $v_{n}$ be the rescaled covariance matrices defined for any $n \\geqslant 0$ by\n\n$$\nv_{2 n}:=\\bar{\\sigma}^{-1 / 2} \\tau_{2 n} \\bar{\\sigma}^{-1 / 2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v_{2 n+1}:=\\sigma^{-1 / 2} \\tau_{2 n+1} \\sigma^{-1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe theorem below is the second key result in this paper. It yields an offline description of the flow of covariance matrices of the Sinkhorn algorithm in terms of the dual Riccati maps $\\operatorname{Ricc}_{\\varpi_{\\theta}}$ and $\\operatorname{Ricc}_{\\bar{\\varpi}_{\\theta_{1}}}$ defined in (2.11), with the positive-definite matrices $\\left(\\varpi_{\\theta}, \\bar{\\varpi}_{\\theta_{1}}\\right)$ defined in (3.1) and (3.8), respectively.\n\nTheorem 4.3. For any $n \\geqslant 0$, we have the recursions\n\n$$\nv_{2(n+1)}^{-1}=I+\\gamma_{\\theta} v_{2 n+1} \\gamma_{\\theta}^{\\prime} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v_{2 n+1}^{-1}=I+\\gamma_{\\theta}^{\\prime} v_{2 n} \\gamma_{\\theta}\n$$\n\ntogether with the matrix Riccati difference equations\n\n$$\nv_{2(n+1)}=\\operatorname{Ricc}_{\\varpi_{\\theta}}\\left(v_{2 n}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v_{2 n+1}=\\operatorname{Ricc}_{\\bar{\\varpi}_{\\theta_{1}}}\\left(v_{2 n-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe proof of Theorem 4.3 is provided in Appendix B on page 50.\nRemark 4.4. Following Remark 3.5, the matrix difference equations (4.11) coincide for one-dimensional models. In this context, Lemma 4.3 in [36] provides closed-form solutions of Riccati difference equations. For instance, for even indices we find the equation\n\n$$\n\\left(v_{2 n}-r_{\\theta}\\right)=\\left(v_{0}-r_{\\theta}\\right) \\frac{\\left(\\varpi_{\\theta}+2 r_{\\theta}\\right) \\rho_{\\theta}^{n}}{\\left(v_{0}+\\varpi_{\\theta}+r_{\\theta}\\right)\\left(1-\\rho_{\\theta}^{n}\\right)+\\left(\\varpi_{\\theta}+2 r_{\\theta}\\right) \\rho_{\\theta}^{n}}\n$$\n\nwith the positive fixed point $r_{\\theta}$ defined in (3.2) and the exponential decay parameter\n\n$$\n\\rho_{\\theta}:=\\left(1+r_{\\theta}+\\varpi_{\\theta}\\right)^{-2}<1\n$$\n\nThe monotone properties of Riccati maps (see for instance (B.2) in Appendix B) yield the following estimates for the covariance matrices $\\tau_{n}$ and $\\sigma_{n}$, and the gain matrices $\\beta_{n}$.\n\nCorollary 4.5. For any $n \\geqslant 1$ we have the uniform estimates\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\sigma}^{1 / 2}\\left(I+\\varpi_{\\theta}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\bar{\\sigma}^{1 / 2} \\leqslant \\tau_{2 n} \\leqslant \\bar{\\sigma} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sigma^{1 / 2}\\left(I+\\bar{\\varpi}_{\\theta_{1}}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\sigma^{1 / 2} \\leqslant \\tau_{2 n+1} \\leqslant \\sigma\n$$\n\nIn addition, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\beta_{2 n}\\right\\|_{2} \\leqslant\\|\\bar{\\sigma}\\|_{2}\\left\\|\\tau^{-1} \\beta\\right\\|_{2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\beta_{2 n+1}\\right\\|_{2} \\leqslant\\|\\sigma\\|_{2}\\left\\|\\tau^{-1} \\beta\\right\\|_{2}\n$$\n\nas well as\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n} \\geqslant \\bar{\\sigma}^{1 / 2}\\left(I+\\varpi_{\\theta}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\bar{\\sigma}^{1 / 2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sigma_{2 n+1} \\geqslant \\sigma^{1 / 2}\\left(I+\\bar{\\varpi}_{\\theta_{1}}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\sigma^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe last assertion in Corollary 4.5 comes from the fact that\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n} \\geqslant \\tau_{2 n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sigma_{2 n+1} \\geqslant \\tau_{2 n+1}\n$$\n\nRemark 4.6.

We underline that the above condition is met when the regularization parameter $t$ is chosen sufficiently large.

As discussed, this algorithm exactly, iteratively, solves the entropic optimal transport problem and provides estimates of the sufficient statistics of $\\nu_{m, \\sigma}$ and $\\nu_{\\bar{m}, \\bar{\\sigma}}$. Specifically, the sequence $\\left(m_{2 n}, \\sigma_{2 n}\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}$ provides the estimates of $(\\bar{m}, \\bar{\\sigma})$ and converges as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Similarly, the sequence $\\left(m_{2 n+1}, \\sigma_{2 n+1}\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}$ provides estimates for $(m, \\sigma)$ and similarly converges as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Let $\\tau_{0}=t I$. As mentioned in Remark 5.10, the rates presented in [21] correspond to a rate $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\rho_{\\theta(t)}=1 / 2$. We now demonstrate a comparison of the rates we obtain with this asymptotic rate. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4. One can see that, as $t$ grows, our coefficient $\\rho_{\\theta}$ which controls the speed of convergence decays to 0 exponentially fast. We also plot the curve and bounds with $\\rho=1 / 2$ that is the asymptotic rate obtained in [21]. It can be seen that the rates we obtain are sharper than the ones obtained in [21].\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: On the left, we demonstrate the value of $\\rho_{\\theta}$ we obtain w.r.t. the regularization parameter $t$.

These models play an increasingly important role in machine\nlearning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are\ncommonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting\nprocedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based\non nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional\nsolutions cannot be computed.\n  This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the\niterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate\nmodels. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the\ncelebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and\nit yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without\nfurther approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a\nrefined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn\nalgorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and\nSchr\\\"odinger bridges.", "updated": "2025-04-01T22:20:04Z", "published": "2024-12-24T13:49:02Z"}
