Specifically, we show that these models exhibit identical behavior with respect to key combinatorial properties-such as list-decodability and list-recoverability-when the alphabet size is sufficiently large.\n\nWe introduce monotone-decreasing local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, a new class of properties tailored for the large alphabet regime. This class encompasses list-decodability, list-recoverability, and their average-weight variants. We develop a framework for analyzing these properties and prove a threshold theorem for RLCs: for any LCL property $\\mathcal{P}$, there exists a threshold rate $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ such that RLCs are likely to satisfy $\\mathcal{P}$ when $R<R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ and unlikely to do so when $R>R_{\\mathcal{P}}$. We extend this threshold theorem to random RS codes and show that they share the same threshold $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$, thereby establishing the equivalence between the two ensembles and enabling a unified analysis of list-recoverability and related properties.\n\nApplying our framework, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability, proving that both random RS codes and RLCs achieve the generalized Singleton bound. This recovers a recent result of Alrabiah, Guruswami, and Li (2023) via elementary methods. Additionally, we prove an upper bound on the list-recoverability threshold and conjecture that this bound is tight. Our approach suggests a plausible pathway for proving this conjecture and thereby pinpointing the list-recoverability parameters of both models. Indeed, following the release of a prior version of this paper, Li and Shagrithaya (2025) used our equivalence theorem to show that random RS codes are near-optimally list-recoverable.\n\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *Ben-Gurion University. lmat@post.bgu.ac.il\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ Ben-Gurion University. mosheiff@bgu.ac.il.

      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nAn (error-correcting) code of length $n$ is a set $\\mathcal{C}$ of words over some fixed alphabet $\\Sigma$. When $\\Sigma$ is the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ (for some prime power $q$ ) and $\\mathcal{C}$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$, we say that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a linear code. The rate of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\frac{\\log _{|\\Sigma|}|C|}{n}$, which equals $\\frac{\\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{C}}{n}$ when $\\mathcal{C}$ is linear. The distance of a linear code $\\mathcal{C}$ is $\\min _{x \\in \\mathcal{C} \\backslash\\{0\\}} \\operatorname{wt}(x)$, where $\\operatorname{wt}(x)$ is the Hamming weight, which is the number of non-zero entries in $x$.\n\nIn this work, we uncover a deep connection between two of the most important random ensembles of linear codes. These ensembles are:\n\n1. The random linear code (RLC). An RLC of length $n$ and rate $R$ is the kernel $\\mathcal{C}$ of a uniformly random matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{(n-k) \\times n}$ where $k=R n .{ }^{1}$\n2. The random Reed-Solomon (RS) code. A Reed-Solomon code is defined by a length $n$, a dimension $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, an alphabet $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, and a set of evaluation points $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Every codeword is the sequence of evaluations of some polynomial of degree $<k$ over the evaluation points. ${ }^{2}$ Formally, the code is\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) ; k\\right):=\\left\\{\\left(f\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(\\alpha_{n}\\right)\\right) \\mid f \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X], \\operatorname{deg} f<k\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}$ are sampled independently and uniformly from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we say that $\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) ; k\\right)$ is a Random RS Code.\n\nOur research is motivated by the desire to study two ubiquitous combinatorial properties of codes-list-decodability and list-recoverability. We define these notions as follows: let $\\rho \\in[0,1]$ and $L \\in \\mathbb{N}$. A code $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ is $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodable if for every $z \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$,\n\n$$\n|\\{x \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid \\operatorname{wt}(x-z) \\leq \\rho n\\}| \\leq L\n$$\n\nis true. Namely, every Hamming ball of radius $\\rho n$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ contains at most $L$ codewords. Fixing $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the code $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to be $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable if for every list of sets $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}$, each of size at most $\\ell$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left\\{x \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid\\left|\\left\\{i \\in[n] \\mid x_{i} \\notin Z_{i}\\right\\}\\right| \\leq \\rho n\\right\\}\\right| \\leq L\n$$\n\nWe note that $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodability is equivalent to $(\\rho, 1, L)$-list-recoverability, so the latter notion generalizes the former. All of our results mentioned in this section also apply to the average-weight versions of list-decodability and list-recoverability (see Section 2.2).",

      "text": "### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nIn the first part of this work, we develop a new framework for analyzing a broad and natural family of properties, referred to as (monotone-decreasing) local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties. ${ }^{3}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{~A}$ more common definition for an RLC is to sample a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ at uniform from among all subspaces of dimension $k$. Fortunately, the two models are almost identical. See Appendix A for details.\n    ${ }^{2}$ Note that we allows evaluation points to repeat. There exists another model, arguably more common, in which the evaluation points are chosen without repetition. In Appendix A we show that the two models are rather close, in a certain well-defined manner, allowing us to use one as a proxy for the other.\n    ${ }^{3}$ In the main body of the paper (starting from Section 2.3), we define and use the dual notion of a (monotoneincreasing) local coordinate-wise linear property, which allows us to discuss the complements of properties like listdecodability and list-recoverability directly.\n\nNotably, list-decodability, list-recoverability and their average-weight variants fall into this category. For a given LCL property $\\mathcal{P}$, we examine the likelihood that an RLC $\\mathcal{C}$ of rate $R$ satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$. Our main result is a threshold theorem: we identify a specific threshold rate $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ such that $\\mathcal{C}$ is highly likely to satisfy $\\mathcal{P}$ when $R<R_{\\mathcal{P}}$, and highly unlikely to satisfy it when $R>R_{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n\nUsing our characterization of $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability (and its average-weight variant), showing that RLCs approach the generalized Singleton bound [GST22], provided that the alphabet size $q$ is at least $2^{\\mathrm{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)}$. This recovers a recent result from [AGL23], via an elementary approach that does not rely on external results such as the GM-MDS theorem [DSY14; Lov21; YH19b] employed in [AGL23]. Additionally, we show that the threshold rate for $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverability is at most $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\log _{2}(L+1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)+o(1)$ and conjecture this bound to be tight. ${ }^{4}$ This upper bound was shown in a recent prior work by [CZ24] for (Folded) Reed-Solomon codes, who also conjectured that this bound is tight for that code model.\n\nThe second part of this paper focuses on random RS codes. Our main result in this part is a threshold theorem for LCL properties in the random RS model. We show that a threshold exists for any such property $\\mathcal{P}$, and remarkably, this threshold is equal to $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ ! This means that $\\mathcal{P}$ is likely to hold for a random RS code if and only if is likely to hold for an RLC of similar rate, provided the alphabet size $q$ is sufficiently large. We thus say that these two code models are equivalent for LCL properties or locally equivalent.\n\nAn immediate conclusion of this equivalence is that random RS codes and RLCs share the same list-recoverability parameters. For instance, to prove that a random RS code of rate $R$ is $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable, it essentially suffices to establish the same for an RLC, and vice versa. Moreover, our characterization makes it possible to compute the relevant threshold $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$, yielding results applicable to both code models simultaneously.\n\nPrior works such as [BGM23; GZ23; AGL23] have proved that random RS codes also approach the generalized Singleton bound by using a technique first introduced in [BGM23], which made use of an equivalence between the GMS-MDS theorem and list-decoding for random RS codes. Combining the list-decodability result for RLCs from the first part of our work with the equivalence result between random RS codes and RLCs in the second part, we show that random RS codes also approach the generalized Singleton bound. This effectively recovers the main result of the prior works without relying on the GM-MDS theorem.\n\nOur result about the local equivalence between random RS codes and RLCs, besides being interesting in its own right, provides a definite answer to the connection between the two wellstudied code models, which had been hinted at in previous works. Furthermore, our result enables researchers to establish findings regarding local properties in one code model and directly transfer them to the other, allowing them to work with their preferred code model.\n\nSubsequent work. The results of our work have already been used in [LS25] to establish nearoptimal upper bounds on the list size for list-recoverability of random RS codes. Specifically, they showed that random RS codes of rate $R$ are $\\left(1-R-\\varepsilon, \\ell,(\\ell / \\varepsilon)^{O(\\ell / \\varepsilon)}\\right)$-list-recoverable. Their approach proceeds by proving the bound for RLCs, after which the same result holds for random RS codes via our equivalence theorem. Notably, this is the first result on list-recovery of random RS codes\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Since our paper was first published, [LS25] have shown that the same negative bound, $R \\leq$ $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\log _{2}(L+1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)+o(1)$, holds for every linear code.\n\nthat provides reasonable parameters for all rates $R$, whereas previous results were limited to the low-rate regime.",

      "text": "# 1.2 Local Code Properties and the LCL Framework \n\nOur notion of LCL properties extends a general framework, initially introduced in [MRRSW20], for studying list-decodability and list-recoverability as part of a broader class of code properties. A set of words in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ that all lie within the same Hamming ball of radius $\\rho n$ is called $\\rho$-clustered. A set of words $X \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ is said to be $(\\rho, \\ell)$-recovery-clustered if there exists a sequence of sets $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n} \\subseteq$ $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, each of size at most $\\ell$, such that for every $x \\in X$, the condition $\\left|\\left\\{i \\in[n] \\mid x_{i} \\notin Z_{i}\\right\\}\\right| \\leq \\rho n$ holds. Thus, a code $\\mathcal{C}$ is $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodable (or $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable) if and only if it does not contain a $\\rho$-clustered (or $(\\rho, \\ell)$-recovery-clustered) set of size $L+1$. We interpret a clustered (or recovery-clustered) set of codewords in $\\mathcal{C}$ as a witness to the code's non-list-decodability (or non-list-recoverability). This leads to the observation that list-decodability and list-recoverability have short witnesses, drawing a natural analogy to CO-NP languages or $\\Pi_{1}$ logical formulas.\n\nIn [MRRSW20], this viewpoint was used to study list-decodability and list-recoverability within a newly defined class of (monotone-decreasing) local code properties. A property is said to be local if it has short witnesses, like clustered sets for list-decodability. The main finding of [MRRSW20] is that Gallagher codes, a random ensemble of LDPC codes, possess local properties similar to those of RLCs, meaning they are just as list-decodable and list-recoverable (with high probability). Later, [GM22] extended this framework to show that randomly punctured low-bias codes also share local properties with RLCs. These results can be seen as reductions between code ensembles. ${ }^{5}$\n\nThe reduction results in [MRRSW20] and [GM22] stem from the threshold theorem for local properties for RLCs [MRRSW20, Theorem 2.8]. This theorem states that for any local property $\\mathcal{P}$, there is a threshold rate $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ such that RLCs with a rate below $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ are likely to satisfy $\\mathcal{P}$, whereas those with a rate above $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ are unlikely to do so. An analogous theorem for plain random codes is proven in [GMRSW22].\n\nThe threshold theorem crucially relies on the property $\\mathcal{P}$ having short witnesses. For instance, if $\\mathcal{P}$ is the property of $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodability, the witnesses are $\\rho$-clustered sets of size $L+1$. To apply the theorem, subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ (where $b=L+1$ ) are classified into types, and the theorem uses the expected number of these witnesses in a code $\\mathcal{C}$ to determine whether $\\mathcal{C}$ is likely to satisfy $\\mathcal{P}$. However, the number of types grows exponentially in $q^{b}$, which is manageable for fixed $q$ but becomes unwieldy when $q$ increases with $n$. For a more formal treatment of this technique, see [MRSY24].\n\nThis exponential growth in the number of types motivates the need for a refined approach. Our framework of LCL properties avoids explicitly enumerating types and can handle cases where $q$ is large, often keeping the complexity independent of $q$ (see Remark 3.3).\n\nNotably, random RS codes arise as random puncturings of the full RS code $\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q} ; k\\right)$, which is known to have low bias, suggesting that the results of [GM22] could apply to their analysis. However, the methods developed in [MRRSW20; GM22] are tailored to codes over relatively small alphabets and do not extend to RS codes, where $q \\geq n$ is required. Our LCL framework fills this gap by extending the local properties approach to the large-alphabet regime.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ Note that [MRRSW20; GM22] only prove one-sided reductions, transferring monotone-decreasing local properties from RLCs to other ensembles. In contrast, the reduction in the present paper goes both ways.\n\nInformally, a property $\\mathcal{P}$ is $b$-LCL if it is witnessed by a small set of codewords $x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{b} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ such that, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, the vector $\\left(x_{i}^{1}, \\ldots, x_{i}^{b}\\right)$ satisfies certain linear constraints. For example, $\\rho$-clusteredness is characterized by a large number of equality constraints (which are, in particular, linear) among $x_{i}^{1}, \\ldots, x_{i}^{b}$ for many coordinates $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We provide a formal treatment in Section 2.3.\n\nAs mentioned, the LCL framework encompasses list-decodability and list-recoverability, along with their average-weight variants. It also naturally captures other properties, such as average pairwise distance (defined in [CGV13]) and list-decodability from burst errors (e.g., [RV09]) under a unified lens.",

      "text": "# 1.3 Background ${ }^{6}$\n### 1.3.1 List-Decodability and List-Recoverability of RS Codes\n\nIn light of the importance of RS codes, it is a major open problem to explicitly construct RS codes with good list-decodability or list-recoverability parameters. Currently, no non-trivially listdecodable or list-recoverable explicit RS codes are known. For list-decodability, this means that known explicit RS codes are only list-decodable up to the Johnson bound ([Sud97], [GS98]). A negative list-decodability result for the full RS code $\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q} ; k\\right)$ in some parameters regimes is given in [BKR09].\n\nLacking explicit constructions, much attention has been given to the corresponding existential problems. List-decodability of random RS codes was studied in [RW14; ST20; GLSTW21a; FKS22; GST23]. Finally, in [BGM23; GZ23; AGL23] it was shown that random RS codes are list-decodable up to capacity, ${ }^{7}$ and, furthermore, that they achieve the Elias bound ${ }^{8}$ and the generalized Singleton bound [ST20]. [BGM23] noted an interesting connection between the GM-MDS theorem (proven in [Lov21; YH19a]) and list-decoding of RS codes, which allowed them to prove that random RS code can achieve the Generalized Singleton bound, but with exponential field size. In [BDG24] the authors prove that in order to achieve the Generalized Singleton bound exactly, exponential field size is in fact necessary. However, [GZ23] circumvent this by showing that it is possible to approach the bound arbitrarily closely with only quadratic field size, which was improved to linear by the work of [AGL23]. Recent works have generalized these results to Algebraic-Geometric codes [BDGZ24], other polynomial based code ensembles [BDG23], and also to Gabidulin codes in the rank metric [GXYZ24]. We note that [BGM23; GZ23; AGL23; BDG23; BDGZ24; GXYZ24] all utilize a common framework that relies on the GM-MDS theorem, or a variant of it as a crucial component. It is not yet clear whether this framework can be extended to deal with other local properties, such as list-recovery.\n\nMuch less is known about list-recovery of RS codes, even in the random setting. The existing\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ This section describes the state of knowledge as it stood prior to the initial publication of this work. It does not reflect the subsequent contribution of [LS25], discussed in Section 1.1, which established a new result on the list-recoverability of RLCs in the large alphabet regime and, using our main theorem, significantly advanced the known bounds for list-recoverability of random RS codes.\n    ${ }^{7}$ A family of codes is list-decodable up to capacity if it achieves $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodability with rate $1-h_{q}(\\rho)-\\varepsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon$ and $L \\leq \\operatorname{poly}(n)$.\n    ${ }^{8} \\mathrm{~A}$ family of codes achieves the Elias bound if it satisfies $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodability with rate $1-h_{q}(\\rho)-\\varepsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon$ and $L \\leq O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This is a stricter requirement than achieving list-decoding capacity. Essentially, codes achieving the Elias bound are at least as list-decodable as plain random codes. See [MRSY24].\n\nresults include [LP20; GLSTW21b; GST23]. The first is a non-trivial list-recovery result for random RS codes, where the rate decreases to zero as $n$ grows, while the second shows the existence of random RS codes of rate $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sqrt{\\ell \\cdot \\log 1 / \\varepsilon}}\\right)$ that are $(1-\\varepsilon, \\ell, O(\\ell / \\varepsilon))$-list-recoverable. The third result shows that random RS codes are $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable with rate approaching $\\frac{1-\\rho}{\\ell+\\rho}$.\n\nWe mention that for explicit Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes, there have been a series of recent works [KRSW18; Tam23; Sri24; CZ24] which prove positive list-decodability and listrecoverability results for these codes. In particular, [Tam23] proved that explicit FRS codes having relative distance $\\delta$ are $(\\delta-\\varepsilon, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable with $L \\leq O\\left(\\frac{\\ell^{O\\left(\\frac{1+\\log \\ell}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. For the setting of list-decoding, [CZ24] proved that the codes meet the generalized Singleton bound, and thus are $(1-R-\\varepsilon, L)$-list-decodable with $L \\leq O(1 / \\varepsilon)$. Additionally, they also prove a negative result for the list-recoverability of Folded Reed-Solomon codes, showing that every Folded Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ having distinct evaluation points cannot be $\\left(1-R-\\varepsilon, \\ell, \\ell^{\\frac{R}{2 \\varepsilon}}-1-1\\right)$ list-recoverable. This result holds for every constant folding parameter $s \\geq 1$, and hence also holds for Reed-Solomon codes having distinct evaluation points.",

Collectively, these works demonstrate that RLCs achieve the Elias bound in the following settings:\n\n- When $q=2$ [GHSZ02; LW21].\n- When $q \\leq O(1)$ and $\\rho$ is bounded away from $\\frac{q-1}{q}$ [GHK11].\n- When $q \\geq 2^{\\Omega\\left(\\frac{L}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}$, as shown in [AGL23] and in this work.\n\nThe studies [CGV13; Woo13; RW14] provide positive results in the regime where $\\rho \\rightarrow \\frac{q-1}{q}$, though these do not achieve the Elias bound. A significant open problem remains: proving that RLCs meet the Elias bound across all parameter settings, ideally through a unified proof technique.\n\nThe study of list-recoverability for RLCs can be divided into the large $q$ and small $q$ regimes. For large $q$ (e.g., when $q$ is exponentially large in $L$ ), the only known positive result comes from a straightforward application of the Zyablov-Pinsker Lemma [ZP81], which provides a weak lower bound on the threshold rate that rapidly diminishes as $q$ or $L$ increase. In this work, we establish the upper bound $R_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\log _{q}(L+1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)$ and conjecture that this bound is tight. This is the same bound that was first proven in a recent prior work by [CZ24] for $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-listrecoverability of (Folded) Reed-Solomon codes. Importantly, our result indicates that RLCs do not reach an analogue of the Elias bound for list-recovery in the large $q$ regime, meaning they are not as list-recoverable as plain random codes.\n\nList-recovery in the regime where $\\ell \\geq q^{\\Omega(1)}$ is studied in [RW14; RW18], which give positive results. However, [GLMRSW22] demonstrates that when $q$ is a large power of a small prime, RLCs underperform significantly compared to plain random codes in this setting as well.",

      "text": "# 1.4 Open Problems\n### 1.4.1 List-Recovery and Non-Local Properties\n\nDetermining the threshold for list-recovery in the large $q$ regime remains a significant open problem, as it would reveal the list-recovery parameters of both random RS codes and RLCs. As noted earlier, we conjecture this threshold to be $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\log _{2}(L+1)}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)$.\n\nAnother challenge arises in the small $q$ regime, such as when $q=\\operatorname{poly}(\\ell)$. Our current methods cannot directly address list-recoverability in this setting due to the exponential dependence of $q$ on locality. Relaxing this dependence is an important goal, as it could deepen our understanding of list-recovery in this regime.\n\nFurthermore, extending our framework to analyze highly non-local properties would be valuable. Consider the following example: fix a large $q$ and let $0<R<1, q^{(1-R)}<\\ell<q$, and $\\varepsilon>0$. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ represent the property of $(0, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverability for codes in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$, where $L=\\ell^{n} \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n} \\cdot(1+\\varepsilon)$. Note that $\\mathcal{P}$ is not a local property, since $L$ is typically exponential in $n$, but it is a natural one to consider.\n\nNotice that $\\ell^{n} \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n}$ is the expected size of the set $\\mathcal{C} \\cap Z_{1} \\times Z_{2} \\times \\cdots \\times Z_{n}$, where $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ is a fixed code of rate $(1-R)$, and $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ are independent uniformly random subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of size $\\ell$. Thus, a code $\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$ if its maximum intersection with any product set $Z_{1} \\times Z_{2} \\times \\cdots \\times Z_{n}$ is at most $(1+\\varepsilon)$ times this expectation. From a pseudorandomness perspective, a code satisfying $\\mathcal{P}$ can be said to fool product sets (also known as combinatorial rectangles) within a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ factor.\n\nConsider the question of whether any linear code satisfies this property. In particular, do RLCs satisfy it? Both questions were essentially answered in the affirmative by [MPSW21] when $R>\\frac{1}{2}$ and $q$ is a large prime. For $R \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$, these questions remain open. We conjecture that the answer is again positive, provided that $q$ is a sufficiently large prime.",

This gap highlights the differences between the two methods used to study local properties. The proof for the constant $q$ case [GHK11] aligns well with the classical local properties framework, whereas our proof for the large $q$ case (Corollary 3.6) is captured within the LCL framework. Developing a unified local property framework may provide a uniform proof that RLCs achieve the Elias bound across all alphabet sizes.",

The fundamental observation underlying these works is that any code that is not list-decodable must contain a subset of codewords that exhibit significant agreement with some fixed vector in the ambient space. Equivalently, these codewords must agree with one another on a substantial number of coordinates. [ST20] and [GZ23] leveraged this insight by representing codewords as columns of a matrix, where coordinate-wise agreements among codewords manifest as linear constraints on the matrix rows. (Reduced) Intersection Matrices serve as symbolic matrices that encode such agreement constraints. The concept of a $b$-local profile extends this framework by encoding constraints on coordinates in a more general manner, permitting the representation of linear constraints rather than merely agreement constraints. This generalization plays a crucial role in establishing the threshold theorem for RLCs and in demonstrating the equivalence between RLCs and random RS codes.\n\nAs shown by the following proposition, this framework allows us to capture natural code properties such as list-decodability and list-recoverability.",

The usefulness of Theorem 3.1 depends on having a clear characterization of $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ in terms of certain first-moment terms. Such a characterization is developed and given explicitly in Eq. (14) in Section 4.\n\nRemark 3.3 (The alphabet size and \"reasonable\" properties). As demonstrated by the second and third parts of Theorem 3.1, the usefulness of the theorem hinges on $\\mathcal{F}$ not being too large in terms of $q$. For the probability bound to be meaningful, we need\n\n$$\nq \\geq|\\mathcal{F}|^{\\Omega\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\n$$\n\nat the very least. It seems that many natural LCL properties have $|\\mathcal{F}| \\geq 2^{\\Omega(n)}$ at the very least, making $q \\geq 2^{\\Omega\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}$ a minimum requirement.\n\nInformally, we define a property $\\mathcal{P}$ as reasonable if its associated set of local profiles satisfies\n\n$$\n|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq q^{a_{q \\rightarrow \\infty}(n)}\n$$\n\nNote that only a reasonable property can satisfy Eq. (1). Fortunately, the complements of listrecoverability and list-decodability with fixed list-size are reasonable (Proposition 2.2).\n\nFurthermore, let $\\mathcal{P}$ denote a b-LCL property and let $M=\\left\\{\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\mid \\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}\\right\\}$, the set of all linear subspaces of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ that can appear in a profile in $\\mathcal{F}$. It is not hard to see that $|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq|M|^{n}$. Hence, as long as $|M|$ depends only on $b$ but not on $q$, the property $\\mathcal{P}$ is reasonable.\n\nFor example, suppose that $\\mathcal{P}$ is the property of not being $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable. As demonstrated in the proof of Proposition 2.2, each element of $M$ is defined by an equivalence relation over $[b]$, and thus, $|M| \\leq b^{b}$. Therefore, Eq. (2) is satisfied, making $\\mathcal{P}$ reasonable.\n\nIn the classic local property framework (see [MRRSW20]), the number of types associated with a b-local property is equal to the number of ways to distribute $n$ unlabeled balls between $q^{b}$ labeled bins, a term which grows exponentially in $q$. In the present LCL framework, $|M|$ can be seen as analogous to the base $n$ logarithm of the number of types. The fact that $|M|$ can remain constant as $q$ grows is crucial to the suitability of LCL properties for studying the large alphabet regime.\n\nIn Section 5 we use the characterization mentioned in Remark 3.2 to compute the threshold rate for (average-weight) list-decodability and to give an upper bound on the threshold for listrecoverability.\n\nTheorem 3.4 (RLC threshold for list-decodability). Fix $\\rho \\in[0,1]$ and $L \\in$ $\\mathbb{N}$. Consider the properties $\\mathcal{P}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, L)$-list-decodable $\\}$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}:=$ $\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, L)$-average-weight list-decodable $\\}$. Then,\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}} \\geq R_{\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}} \\geq \\max \\left\\{1-\\rho \\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right), 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, if $n$ is divisible by $\\binom{L+1}{(1-\\rho)(L+1)}$ then the above bound is tight, namely,\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}}=R_{\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}}=\\max \\left\\{1-\\rho \\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right), 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nRemark 3.5. The hard part of this theorem is proving the lower bound on $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$. This is a positive result about RLCs, which also follows from [AGL23]. The reasoning in [AGL23] relies on that paper's main result about random RS codes, and, in particular, on the GM-MDS theorem. In contrast, our proof is more direct and elementary.\n\nOur upper bound on $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ can also be inferred from the generalized Singleton bound [GST22] (see Section 1.4.3). Here we prove it directly (assuming the proper divisibility condition) within the LCL framework.\n\nTheorems 3.1 and 3.4 and Proposition 2.2 immediately yield the following corollary.\nCorollary 3.6 (List-decodability of RLCs). Fix $\\rho \\in[0,1]$ and $L \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ be an RLC of rate $R$. Let $\\varepsilon>0$. The following now holds.\n\n1.

In particular, if $R \\leq 1-\\rho \\cdot\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right)-\\varepsilon$ and $q>2^{\\frac{2(L+1)}{\\varepsilon}}$ then $\\mathcal{C}$ is $(\\rho, L)$-average-weight list-decodable with probability at least $1-q^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon n}{2}+(L+1)^{2}}$.\n\nRemark 3.7. A very similar result to Corollary 3.6 is proved in [AGL23].\nTheorem 3.8 (Upper bound on RLC threshold for list-recoverability). Fix $\\rho \\in[0,1]$ and $\\ell, L \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\ell \\geq 2$ and $L+1=\\ell^{m}$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Consider the properties $\\mathcal{P}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable $\\}$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}:=$ $\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-average-weight list-recoverable $\\}$. Suppose that $n \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)$ is divisible by $m$ and $(L+1) \\rho n$ is divisible by $\\binom{L+1}{\\ell}$. Then,\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq\\left(1-\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)\n$$\n\nRemark 3.9. The divisibility conditions in Theorems 3.1 and 3.8 are not very significant, as the theorems provide nearly identical bounds even if the length $n$ does not satisfy these conditions. Indeed, one can puncture the RLC $\\mathcal{C}$, removing a tiny fraction of its coordinates to obtain a shortened code $\\mathcal{D}$ that satisfies the divisibility condition, allowing the theorem to be applied. Moreover, $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ differ only slightly in their list-decodability and list-recoverability parameters, so the result for $\\mathcal{D}$ also gives a close bound for $\\mathcal{C}$.",

The sharpness of this transition increases rapidly with $q$. Crucially, the threshold matches that of RLCs, implying that an RLC and a random RS code with similar rates are likely to satisfy the same local properties. Indeed, any positive result about local properties of RLCs can immediately be transferred to random RS codes, and vice versa. We illustrate this paradigm by the following corollary.\nCorollary 3.11 (List-recoverability of random RS codes).

Our required lower bound on $q$ is somewhat more demanding than the $q \\geq n+k \\cdot 2^{10 L / \\varepsilon}$ bound stipulated by [AGL23].\nCorollary 3.12 (List-decodability of random RS codes). Fix $\\rho \\in[0,1], L, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $\\varepsilon n \\geq 2(L+1)(L+2)$.

Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ be an $R L C$ of rate $R$ and let $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times b}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}[A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}]=q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{rank} A}\n$$\n\nProof. Write $\\mathcal{C}=\\operatorname{ker} P$ where $P \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{(1-R) n \\times n}$ is uniformly random. Now,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}[A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}]=\\operatorname{Pr}[\\forall i \\in[(1-R) n] \\quad P_{i *} \\cdot A=0]=\\prod_{i=1}^{(1-R) n} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[P_{i *} \\cdot A=0\\right]=q^{-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{rank} A}\n$$\n\nWe are interested in the probability that an RLC $\\mathcal{C}$ of rate $R$ satisfies a given $b$-LCL property $\\mathcal{P}$. In particular, we would like to estimate $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ contains $\\mathcal{V}]$ for a given linear profile $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)^{n}$. As a first-order estimate, it makes sense to first compute the expectation\n\n$$\nE\\left|\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }} \\mid A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\\right|=\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}} \\operatorname{Pr}[A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}]=\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}} q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{rank} A}\n$$\n\nwhere the last transition is due to Lemma 4.1. As we shall see, to understand the likelihood of $\\mathcal{C}$ containing $\\mathcal{V}$ we will need a more nuanced expectation argument, in which we classify the matrices in $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}$ according to their row span. For each $U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ we define\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}=\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}} \\mid \\text { row-span }(A)=U\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf there exists $A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$ such that $A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}$, we say that $\\mathcal{C}$ contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$. Let\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)=\\left\\{U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\mid \\forall 1 \\leq i<j \\leq b \\exists x \\in U \\text { such that } x_{i} \\neq x_{j}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand note that a matrix $A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}$ if and only if row-span $(A) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\max _{U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\exists A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}, A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right] \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{C} \\text { contains } \\mathcal{V}\\right] \\leq \\sum_{U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\exists A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}, A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right]\n$$\n\nObserve that the left-hand and right-hand sides differ by a factor of at most $\\left|\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right| \\leq q^{b^{2}}$. For constant $b$, this is merely polynomial in $q$ and will thus end up being negligible. We therefore turn to estimating the probability that $\\mathcal{C}$ contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$ for a given fixed $U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. Analogously to Eq. (5), we have\n$\\mathbb{E}\\left\\|\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\mid A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\\right\\|=\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}} q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{rank} A}=\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}} q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U}=\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right| \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U}$.\nTo bound the right-hand side we need to bound the term $\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right|$. To this end, we define\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}=\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}} \\mid \\text { row-span }(A) \\subseteq U\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand note that $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}$. Notice that even when $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Diat }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$, the set $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}$ will also include some matrices with non-distinct columns, in contrast to $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$. In particular, observe that the all-zero matrix is always an element of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}$.\n\nThe cardinality of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}$ is easier to compute than that of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$ since the former is a linear subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times b}$. Indeed, a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times b}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}$ if and only if $A_{i *} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U$ for all $i \\in[n]$. Hence,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)\n$$\n\nDefining the potential function ${ }^{10}$\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U\n$$\n\nwe conclude from Eq. (6) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\mid A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\\right|\\right] & =\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right| \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U} \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*}\\right| \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U} \\\\\n& =q^{\\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}^{*} \\cdot q^{-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U}} \\\\\n& =q^{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\geq \\Omega(n)$ we shall say that the potential is large, whereas a potential satisfying $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq-\\Omega(n)$ will be called small. In our informal discussion we will ignore the middle case in which a potential is neither large nor small. To justify this dichotomy, observe that a potential is \"almost always\" either large or small. Namely, if $-\\omega(n) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq \\omega(n)$ then for any fixed $\\varepsilon$ we have $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R+\\varepsilon)=\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)+\\varepsilon n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U \\geq \\Omega(n)$ and $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R-\\varepsilon)=$ $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\varepsilon n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U \\leq-\\Omega(n)$.\n\nEq. (9) yields an immediate upper bound on the probability that $\\mathcal{C}$ contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$. Namely, Markov's bound yields\n$\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\exists A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}, A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right]=\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\left|\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\mid A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\\right| \\geq 1\\right] \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left\\|\\left\\{A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\mid A \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\\right\\| \\leq q^{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)}$.\nHence, $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$ being large is a necessary condition for $\\mathcal{C}$ to be likely to contain $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$. One immediately wonders whether this is also a sufficient condition. The answer turns out to be no. In the following example, $\\mathcal{C}$ is very unlikely to contain $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$ despite $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$ being large.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ Although $n$ does not appear explicitly as a parameter to $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$, it is given implicitly as the length of the profile $\\mathcal{V}$. Thus, Eq. (8) is indeed a proper definition.\n\nExample 4.2. Let $b=2$ and $U=\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$. Define $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\right)^{n}$ by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}_{i}= \\begin{cases}\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} & \\text { if } 1 \\leq i \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\\\ \\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} \\mid x_{1}=x_{2}\\right\\} & \\text { if } \\frac{n}{2} \\leq i \\leq n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}, R\\right) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\right)-(1-R) n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)-2(1-R) n \\\\\n& =\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot 2+\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot 1-2(1-R) n=n \\cdot\\left(2 R-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn particular, taking $R=\\frac{1}{3}$ yields $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}, R\\right)=\\frac{n}{6} \\geq \\Omega(n)$, which is large.\nWe claim that, in spite of the above, an RLC $\\mathcal{C}$ of rate $\\frac{1}{3}$ is very unlikely to contain $\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\right)$. Indeed, suppose that $\\mathcal{C}$ contains a matrix $A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}}$. Let $A^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times 1}$ consist of the difference between the two columns of $A$. Observe that $A^{\\prime}$ must belong to the set $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}}$, where $\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}\\right)^{n}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{\\prime}= \\begin{cases}\\mathbb{F}_{q} & \\text { if } 1 \\leq i \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\\\ \\{0\\} & \\text { if } \\frac{n}{2} \\leq i \\leq n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIndeed, since $A$ satisfies $\\mathcal{V}$, the matrix $A^{\\prime}$ must satisfy $\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}$, and since row-span $(A)=\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$, it must hold that row-span $\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)=\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Thus, to contain $\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}, \\mathcal{V}\\right)$, the code $\\mathcal{C}$ must also contain $\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}, \\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}\\right)$. However, Eq. (10) bounds that probability of the latter event by $q^{\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}, R\\right)}$, where\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}, R\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)-(1-R) n=\\frac{n}{2}-(1-R) n=n \\cdot\\left(R-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nTaking $R=\\frac{1}{3}$ yields\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{C} \\text { contains }\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\right)\\right] \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\mathcal{C} \\text { contains }\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}\\right)\\right] \\leq q^{\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{F}_{q^{\\prime}}^{1}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)}=q^{-\\frac{n}{6}} \\leq q^{-\\Omega(n)}\n$$\n\nIn Example 4.2, the expectation bound based on $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$ is not tight because, informally, the constraints presented by $\\mathcal{V}$ are skewed towards a certain part of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ (in this case, the difference between the two coordinates). Thus, a tighter bound is obtained by considering the potential $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, U^{\\prime}, R\\right)$ (here $U^{\\prime}=\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}$ ), which we informally think of as implied by $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$. As we show in the following threshold proposition, considering $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U)$ as well as $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, U^{\\prime}\\right)$ for all $\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, U^{\\prime}\\right)$ implied by $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$, yields a necessary and sufficient condition for $\\mathcal{C}$ to contain $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$ with high probability.\n\nProposition 4.3 (RLC Thresholds for linear profiles). Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and let $q$ be a prime power (which may depend on $n$ ). Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ be an $R L C$ of rate $R \\in[0,1]$.\n\nFix $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\backslash\\{\\{0\\}\\}$ and let $\\mathcal{V} \\in\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$. Let\n\n$$\nM=\\min \\left\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\mid W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\text { and } W \\subsetneq U\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe following then holds.\n\n1. If $M<0$ then $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)] \\leq q^{M}$.\n2. If $M>0$ then $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)] \\geq 1-q^{-M+b^{2}}$.\n\nBefore proving Proposition 4.3, we discuss the proposition and its implications. We first note that $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V},\\{0\\}, R)=0$ for every $\\mathcal{V}$ and $R$. Hence, the condition $M>0$ in the proposition implies in particular that $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)=\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V},\\{0\\}, R)>0$. As we have already seen in Eq. (9), large potential is indeed a necessary condition for $\\mathcal{C}$ to be likely to contain $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$.\n\nLet us now revisit Example 4.2 in light of Proposition 4.3. In that example, consider the vector space $W=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} \\mid x_{1}=x_{2}\\right\\}$. It is not difficult to see that $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)=R n$, which is larger than $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}, R\\right)=\\left(2 R-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) n$ whenever $R<\\frac{1}{2}$. Proposition 4.3 thus implies that an RLC of rate $<\\frac{1}{2}$ is unlikely to contain $\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\right)$. In Example 4.2 we reached a similar conclusion by projecting the rows of a matrix $A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}}$ onto their difference. The kernel of this projection $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{1}$ is exactly $W$. The proof of the first part of Proposition 4.3 generalizes this method. The second part of the proposition says that this method is essentially tight.\n\nWe refer to Proposition 4.3 as a threshold result since, given $U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\backslash\\{\\{0\\}\\}$ and $\\mathcal{V} \\in$ $\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$, the proposition gives a threshold rate $R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$ such that, essentially, an RLC of rate below the threshold is very unlikely to contain $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$, while an RLC of rate above the threshold almost surely contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$. The threshold rate is given by\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{V}, U}:=\\max _{\\substack{W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\\\ W \\subseteq U}}\\left\\{1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W)\\right)}{n \\cdot(\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W)}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIndeed, one can verify that the term $M$ in Proposition 4.3 is positive if and only if $R>R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$. In other words,\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{V}, U}=\\min \\{R \\in[0,1] \\mid \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\geq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\text { for every linear subspace } W \\subseteq U\\}\n$$\n\nRecall that a code $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to contain $\\mathcal{V}$ if and only if it contains $(\\mathcal{V}, U)$ for some $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. We thus define\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{V}}:=\\min _{U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)}\\left\\{R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right\\}=\\min _{U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)} \\max _{\\substack{W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\\\ W \\subseteq U}}\\left\\{1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)\\right)}{n \\cdot(\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W)}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}$ be a $b$-LCL property whose associated profile family is $\\mathcal{F}$. Recall that $\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$, if $\\mathcal{C}$ contains some $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}$. We thus define\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}}:=\\min _{\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}}\\left\\{R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right\\}=\\min _{\\substack{\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F} \\\\ U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)}}\\left\\{R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe now state and prove Theorem 4.4-a more detailed version of Theorem 3.1. Theorem 4.4 states that Eq. (14) correctly characterizes the threshold rate for LCL properties of RLCs.\n\nTheorem 4.4 (More detailed version of Theorem 3.1). Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be a b-LCL property of codes in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ and let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)^{n}$ be the corresponding family of profiles. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ be an $R L C$ of rate $R$. Define $R_{\\mathcal{P}}$ as in Eq. (14). The following now holds\n\n1. If $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{P}}+\\varepsilon$ then $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\left.\\mathcal{P}] \\geq 1-q^{-\\varepsilon n+b^{2}}$.\n2. If $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}}-\\varepsilon$ then $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\left.\\mathcal{P}] \\leq|\\mathcal{F}| \\cdot q^{-\\varepsilon n+b^{2}}$.\n3. In particular, if $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}}-\\varepsilon$ and $q \\geq 2^{\\frac{2 \\log q|\\mathcal{F}|}{\\varepsilon n}}$ then $\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\left.\\mathcal{P}] \\leq q^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon n}{2}+b^{2}}\\right$.\n\nProof. Suppose first that $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{P}}+\\varepsilon$. Let $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ such that $R_{\\mathcal{P}}=R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$, so $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}+\\varepsilon$. Let $M$ be as in Proposition 4.3, namely\n\n$$\nM=\\min \\left\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\mid W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\text { and } W \\subsetneq U\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFix a subspace $W \\subsetneq U$ and write $d=\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W$ and $g=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)\\right)$. By Eq. (11), $R_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\geq 1-\\frac{g}{n d}$. Thus,\n\n$$\nM:=\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)=g-(1-R) n \\cdot d \\geq g-\\left(1-R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}-\\varepsilon\\right) n \\cdot d \\geq \\varepsilon n d \\geq \\varepsilon n\n$$\n\nTherefore, by Proposition 4.3,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C} \\text { satisfies } \\mathcal{P}] \\geq \\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C} \\text { contains }(\\mathcal{V}, U)] \\geq 1-q^{-M+b^{2}} \\geq 1-q^{-\\varepsilon n+b^{2}}\n$$\n\nWe turn to proving the second claim. Let $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}}-\\varepsilon$. Let $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. Let $W \\subsetneq U$ be a linear space such that $R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}=1-\\frac{g}{n d}$ where $d=\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W$ and $g=$ $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)\\right)$. Then, $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}}-\\varepsilon \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}-\\varepsilon=1-\\frac{g}{n d}-\\varepsilon$. Hence,\n\n$$\nM_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)=g-n d(1-R) \\leq-\\varepsilon n d\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C} \\text { contains }(\\mathcal{V}, U)] \\leq q^{-\\varepsilon n d} \\leq q^{-\\varepsilon n}\n$$\n\nby Proposition 4.3. Now,\n$\\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}$ satisfies $\\left.\\mathcal{P}] \\leq \\sum_{\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathbb{F}} \\sum_{U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)} \\operatorname{Pr}[\\mathcal{C}\\right.$ contains $\\left.(\\mathcal{V}, U)] \\leq|\\mathcal{F}| \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right| \\cdot q^{-\\varepsilon n}=|\\mathcal{F}| \\cdot q^{-\\varepsilon n+b^{2}}$.\nFinally, the third claim follows immediately from the second claim.\nWe turn to proving Proposition 4.3.\nProof of Proposition 4.3. We begin with the first statement. Suppose that $M<0$ and let $W \\in$ $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ such that $\\Phi(V, U, R)-\\Phi(V, W, R)=M$. Write $d=\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W$ and let $\\varphi: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ be a linear map such that $\\operatorname{ker} \\varphi=W$. Let $B \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b \\times d}$ such that $x B=\\varphi(x)$ for all $x \\in U$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{C}$ is a linear code, to contain a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times b}$ the code must also contain the matrix $A B$, whose columns are merely linear combinations of the columns of $A$. Hence, in order to contain a matrix from $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$, the code $\\mathcal{C}$ must also contain some matrix from the set $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U} B:=$ $\\left\\{A B \\mid A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U}\\right\\}$. Observe that every matrix in the latter set is of rank $d$.

In other words, the projection of a vector $x \\in W$ onto its first $\\operatorname{dim} W$ coordinates is a bijection from $W$ onto $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\\operatorname{dim} W}$. Now, consider the linear transformation $\\pi: \\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times W} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}^{\\operatorname{dim} W}$ which maps a matrix to the submatrix consisting of its first $\\operatorname{dim} W$ columns.

It turns out that threshold rate $R_{\\mathcal{V}}$, defined in Eq. (13), has another convenient characterization. Concretely, we have the following lemma.\n\nLemma 4.5. Let $n, b \\in \\mathbb{N}, q$ a prime power and $\\mathcal{V} \\in\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$. For $R \\in[0,1]$, denote\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, *, R)\\}:=\\left\\{U \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\mid \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)=\\max _{W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe following then holds:\n\n1.

For all $R \\in\\left(R_{\\mathcal{V}}, 1\\right]$ we have $\\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, *, R)\\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$.\n3. $\\operatorname{argmax}\\left\\{\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, *, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)\\right\\}$ contains an element of $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ and an element of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$.\n\nThe following is an immediate corollary obtained by taking the contrapositives of the two statements in Lemma 4.5.\n\nCorollary 4.6. Let $n, b \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $q$ a prime power and $\\mathcal{V} \\in\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$. Let $R \\in[0,1]$. The following holds.\n\n1. If $\\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, *, R)\\}$ contains an element of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ then $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{V}}$.\n2. If $\\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, *, R)\\}$ contains an element of $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ then $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}}$.\n\nOur proof of Lemma 4.5 relies on the following lemma, which we prove immediately after Lemma 4.5.\n\nLemma 4.7. Let $n, b \\in \\mathbb{N}, q$ a prime power, $\\mathcal{V} \\in\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$. Fix $R \\in[0,1]$ and let $U, W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)+\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U \\cap W, R)+\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U+W, R)\n$$\n\nProof of Lemma 4.5. The third statement follows from the first two since $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$ is continuous in $R$.\n\nWe will prove the contrapositives of the first two statements. For the first statement, suppose there exists some $U \\in \\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(V, *, R)\\} \\cap \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. We need to show that $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{V}}$. Indeed, by Eq. (13),\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{V}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}=\\max _{\\substack{W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\\\ W \\subseteq U}}\\left\\{1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)\\right)}{n \\cdot(\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W)}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFix $W \\subsetneq U$. To prove that $R \\geq R_{\\mathcal{V}}$ it suffices to show that\n\n$$\nR \\geq 1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)\\right)}{n \\cdot(\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W)}\n$$\n\nThe above is equivalent to $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\geq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)$, which follows from our assumption that $U \\in \\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(V, *, R)\\} \\cap \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$\n\nWe turn to the second statement. We now assume that there is some $W \\in \\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(V, *, R)\\} \\cap$ $\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)$ and need to prove that $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}}$. Fix $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. By Eq. (13), it suffices to prove that $R \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}, U}$. By Eq. (11), the latter would follow if we show that\n\n$$\nR \\leq 1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)}{n \\cdot\\left(\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} W^{\\prime}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor some $W^{\\prime} \\subsetneq U$. We take $W^{\\prime}=W \\cap U$. Note that $W^{\\prime}$ is indeed strictly contained in $U$ since $W \\notin \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ and thus so does any subspace of $W$, including $W^{\\prime}$. By assumption, $U \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$, so $W^{\\prime} \\neq U$ and thus the containment is indeed strict. Now, Eq. (18) is equivalent to the statement\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U \\cap W, R)\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 4.7,\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U \\cap W, R)+\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U+W, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U \\cap W, R)\n$$\n\nwhere the second inequality is due to the maximality of $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)$.\nProof of Lemma 4.7. Fix $Z \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{q}^{b}\\right)$. Now,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{dim}(U \\cap W \\cap Z)+\\operatorname{dim}((U+W) \\cap Z) & \\geq \\operatorname{dim}(U \\cap W \\cap Z)+\\operatorname{dim}((U \\cap Z)+(W \\cap Z)) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{dim}(U \\cap Z)+\\operatorname{dim}(W \\cap Z)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U \\cap W, R)+\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U+W, R) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap W \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)+\\operatorname{dim}\\left((U+W) \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(U \\cap W)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(U+W)\\right) \\\\\n\\geq & \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)+\\operatorname{dim}\\left(W \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(U \\cap W)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(U+W)\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)+\\operatorname{dim}\\left(W \\cap \\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(U)-(1-R) \\cdot \\operatorname{dim}(W)\\right) \\\\\n= & \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)+\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

(19).\nFor the second case, suppose that $K:=U+E \\subsetneq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$. For a set $J \\subseteq[L+1]$, denote $f(J):=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(K \\cap D_{J}\\right)$. We claim that there exists a set $T \\subseteq[L+1]$ with the following properties:\n\n1. $|T| \\geq 2$\n2. $f(T)=1$\n3. Every nonempty $T^{\\prime} \\subsetneq T$ has $f\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)=0$.\n\nWe turn to construct such a set. Let $I=\\{i \\in[L+1] \\mid e_{i} \\notin K\\}$. Observe that $I \\neq \\emptyset$ by our assumption that $K \\neq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$. Note that $f(\\{i\\})=0$ for all $i \\in I$.\n\nOn the other hand, we claim that $\\mathbf{1}_{I} \\in K \\cap D_{I}$, so $f(I) \\geq 1$. Indeed, $\\mathbf{1} \\in E$, so it is also in $K=U+E$. By definition of $I$ we have $e_{i} \\in K$ for all $i \\in[L+1] \\backslash I$. Thus, $\\mathbf{1}_{I}=\\mathbf{1}-\\sum_{j \\in[L+1] \\backslash I} e_{j} \\in$ $K \\cap D_{I}$.\n\nHence, one can take $T \\subseteq I$ to be an inclusion-minimal nonempty set with $f(T) \\geq 1$. We show that $T$ satisfies Conditions 1 to 3 above. Condition 3 follows immediately from the minimality of $T$. Condition 1 holds since $f(\\{i\\})=0$ for all $i \\in I$, implying that $|T|>1$. Finally, let some $z \\in T$ and observe that $f(T) \\leq f(T \\backslash\\{z\\})+1=1$, where the equality is due to Condition 3 . Since $f(T) \\geq 1$ by the definition of $T$, Condition 2 follows.\n\nTake $W=\\left(K+D_{T}\\right) \\cap E_{T}$. Note that $W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right)$. We turn to prove that $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)$.\n\nFor $t \\in T$, define the linear map $\\varphi_{t}(x): K \\rightarrow W$ by\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{t}(x)= \\begin{cases}x_{j}, & j \\notin T \\\\ x_{t}, & j \\in T\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $\\varphi_{t}$ is a bijection. First we establish that the image is indeed contained in $W$. It is evident that $\\varphi_{t}(x) \\in E_{T}$ and $\\varphi_{t}(x)-x \\in D_{T}$. Therefore, $\\varphi_{t}(x)=x+\\left(\\varphi_{t}(x)-x\\right) \\in K+D_{T}$ and thus $\\varphi_{t}(x) \\in\\left(K+D_{T}\\right) \\cap E_{T}=W$.\n\nTo prove injectivity of $\\varphi_{t}$, assume there is a non-zero $x \\in K$ such that $\\varphi_{t}(x)=0$. Let $T^{\\prime}=T \\backslash\\{t\\}$. The definition of $\\varphi$ implies that $x_{i}=0$ for all $i \\in([L+1] \\backslash T) \\cup\\{t\\}$, so $x \\in D_{T^{\\prime}}$. By Condition 3, $K \\cap D_{T^{\\prime}}=\\{0\\}$, so $x=0$.\n\nFinally, to prove surjectivity of $\\varphi_{t}$, let $w \\in W$. Since $W=\\left(K+D_{T}\\right) \\cap E_{T}$, there are $x \\in K$ and $y \\in D_{T}$ such that $x+y=w$. By Conditions 2 and 3, there is a vector $z \\in K$ whose support is exactly $T$. Evidently, $w=\\varphi_{t}(x+\\alpha z)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$.\n\nWe now claim that $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(K \\cap E_{Z}\\right) \\leq \\operatorname{dim}\\left(W \\cap E_{Z}\\right)$ for every $Z \\subseteq[L+1]$. If $Z \\cap T=\\emptyset$ choose an arbitrary $t \\in T$ and if $Z \\cap T \\neq \\emptyset$ choose some $t \\in Z \\cap T$. The claim follows since, in both cases, $\\varphi_{t}$ injectively maps $K \\cap E_{Z}$ to $W \\cap E_{Z}$.\n\nNote that $\\operatorname{dim} W=\\operatorname{dim} K$ since there is a bijection between $W$ and $K$. This and the above inequality imply\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(E_{Z_{i}} \\cap W\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} K \\\\\n& \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(E_{Z_{i}} \\cap K\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} K=\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, K, R)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLastly, denote $d:=\\operatorname{dim} K-\\operatorname{dim} U$, and observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, K, R)-\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap K\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)\\right)-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot d \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d-(1-R) \\cdot n \\cdot d=\\operatorname{Rnd} \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand thus $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R) \\geq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$.\nProof of $R_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq 1-\\rho\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right)$ :\nLet $R=1-\\rho\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right)$. We will construct a linear profile $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\leq \\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}, R\\right)\n$$\n\nfor every subspace $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$. This would imply that $\\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, *, R)\\} \\cap \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right)$ is nonempty, whence $R_{\\mathcal{V}} \\leq R$ by virtue of Corollary 4.6. Eq. (14) then yields\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}} \\leq R=1-\\rho\\left(1+\\frac{1}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now describe the aforementioned linear profile $\\mathcal{V}$. Let $s:=(1-\\rho)(L+1)$. Note that $0 \\leq \\rho \\leq \\frac{L}{L+1}$. Write $t=\\binom{L+1}{s}$. Recall that $n$ is divisible by $t$. Let the sequence $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ consist of $\\frac{n}{t}$ instances of each subset of $[L+1]$ of size $s$. Let $\\mathcal{V}_{i}=E_{Z_{i}}$ for all $i \\in[n]$. Observe that $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{F}$. We turn to proving Eq. (20).\n\nFirst, observe that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{V}_{i}=\\operatorname{dim} E_{Z_{i}}=L+2-\\left|Z_{i}\\right|=(L+1) \\cdot \\rho+1\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}, R\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{V}_{i}-n(L+1)(1-R) & =n \\cdot((L+1) \\cdot \\rho+1-(L+1)(1-R)) \\\\\n& =n \\cdot\\left(\\frac{(L+1)(1-\\rho)-1}{L}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, let $U \\subsetneq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$. We need to show that Eq. (20) holds with regard to $U$. Denote $d:=\\operatorname{dim} U$. We provide an alternative formulation of $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R)$ in terms of linear maps. Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1-d}$ be a full rank linear map such that $\\operatorname{ker} \\phi=U$. We can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) & =\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U\\right)-(1-R) n d \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i}\\left(\\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{V}_{i}-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)\\right)\\right)-(1-R) n d \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim} \\mathcal{V}_{i}-\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)\\right)-(1-R) n d \\\\\n& =((L+1) \\cdot \\rho+1) \\cdot n-\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)\\right)-\\frac{L-(1-\\rho)(L+1)+1}{L} \\cdot n d\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe turn to bound the term $\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)\\right)$. Denote $L^{\\prime}:=L+1-d$. Let $M \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L^{\\prime} \\times(L+1)}$ be a matrix representing the linear map $\\phi$ in the standard basis. Because $\\phi$ is full rank, $M$ has rank exactly $L^{\\prime}$. Therefore, there exists a set of linearly independent columns from $M$ of size exactly $L^{\\prime}$. Denote the coordinates of such a set of columns by $I \\subseteq[L+1]$ (so $|I|=L^{\\prime}$ ). Let $\\pi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L^{\\prime}}$ denote the projection map into the coordinate set $I$. Let $M^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L^{\\prime} \\times L^{\\prime}}$ denote the restriction of the matrix $M$ to the columns indicated by $I$, and let $\\phi^{\\prime}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L^{\\prime}}$ be the bijective linear map represented by $M^{\\prime}$. Observe that for any linear space $V \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim} \\phi(V) \\geq \\operatorname{dim} \\phi^{\\prime}(\\pi(V))=\\operatorname{dim} \\pi(V)\n$$\n\nIn particular, if $V=E_{Z}$ for some $Z \\subseteq[L+1]$ then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim} \\phi(V) \\geq \\operatorname{dim} \\pi(V)=L^{\\prime}+1-\\max \\{|I \\cap Z|, 1\\}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim} \\phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right)=\\sum_{i} \\operatorname{dim} \\phi\\left(E_{Z_{i}}\\right) \\geq n \\cdot\\left(L^{\\prime}+1-\\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\\max \\{|I \\cap Z|, 1\\}]\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the expectation is over a uniformly random set $Z \\subseteq[L+1]$ of size $s$. Since\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\\max \\{|I \\cap Z|, 1\\}]=\\mathbb{E}[|I \\cap Z|]+\\operatorname{Pr}[|I \\cap Z|=0] & =(1-\\rho) L^{\\prime}+\\frac{\\binom{L+1-s}{L^{\\prime}}}{\\binom{L+1}{L^{\\prime}}} \\\\\n& \\leq(1-\\rho) L^{\\prime}+\\left(\\frac{d}{L+1}\\right)^{s} \\\\\n& =(1-\\rho) L^{\\prime}+\\left(\\frac{d}{L+1}\\right)^{(1-\\rho)(L+1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $\\left(\\frac{d}{(L+1)}\\right)^{(1-\\rho)(L+1)} \\leq 1-\\frac{L^{\\prime} \\cdot \\rho}{L+1}$ for all $0 \\leq \\rho \\leq \\frac{L}{L+1}$. Since the left-hand side is convex in $\\rho$, it suffices to verify the claim for $\\rho=0$ and $\\rho=\\frac{L}{L+1}$, both of which are straightforward to check.

Fix $\\rho \\in[0,1]$ and $\\ell, L \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\ell \\geq 2$ and $L+1=\\ell^{m}$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Consider the properties $\\mathcal{P}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable $\\}$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}:=$ $\\left\\{\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n} \\mid \\mathcal{C}\\right.$ is not $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-average-weight list-recoverable $\\}$. Suppose that $n \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)$ is divisible by $m$ and $(L+1) \\rho n$ is divisible by $\\binom{L+1}{\\ell}$. Then,\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq\\left(1-\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\alpha:=1-\\frac{L+1}{L+1-\\ell} \\cdot \\rho$ and $R=\\left(1-\\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\cdot \\alpha$. We construct a profile $\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right)^{n}$ that belongs to the local profile family associated with $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverability. We then prove that $R_{\\mathcal{V}} \\leq R$. Eq. (14) then yields $R_{\\mathcal{P}} \\leq R$. This suffices to prove the theorem, since, clearly, $R_{\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n\nWe turn to describe the profile $\\mathcal{V}$. Given $x \\in[L+1]$ and $i \\in[m]$, let $(x)_{i}$ denote the $i$-th symbol in the $\\ell$-ary representation of $x$. For $i \\in[m]$, let\n\n$$\nE_{i}=\\left\\{u \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1} \\mid \\forall x, y \\in[L+1] \\quad(x)_{i}=(y)_{i} \\Longrightarrow u_{x}=u_{y}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn the profile $\\mathcal{V}$, each of the subspaces $E_{j}(j \\in[L+1])$ appears $\\frac{n \\cdot \\alpha}{m}$ times. The other $(1-\\alpha) \\cdot n$ entries of $\\mathcal{V}$ are $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}$. Let $G=\\left\\{i \\in[n] \\mid \\mathcal{V}_{i}=\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nObserve that a code containing $\\mathcal{V}$ is not $(\\rho, \\ell, L)$-list-recoverable. Indeed, let $A \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}$. We claim that the columns of $A$ are $(\\rho, \\ell)$-recovery-clustered. This is straightforward to verify given the input lists $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ that we now define. For $i \\in[n] \\backslash G$ take $Z_{i}$ to be the set of all letters in $A_{i *}$ and observe that this is a set of size at most $\\ell$. Next, fix sets $P_{i}$ for all $i \\in G$ such that when $i$ is uniformly sampled from $G$, the set $P_{i}$ is uniform over $\\binom{[L+1]}{\\ell}$. For $i \\in G$, let $Z_{i}=\\left\\{A_{i, j} \\mid j \\in P_{i}\\right\\}$.\n\nLet $U$ denote the linear space $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} E_{i}$. Clearly, $U \\in \\mathcal{L}^{\\text {Dist }}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{L+1}\\right)$, since every $x \\neq y \\in[L+1]$ have some $i \\in[m]$ for which $(x)_{i} \\neq(y)_{i}$. We claim that $\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, U, R) \\geq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R)$ for every linear subspace $W \\subseteq U$. By Eqs. (12) and (13), this implies that $R_{\\mathcal{V}} \\leq R_{\\mathcal{V}, U} \\leq R$, and the lemma follows.\n\nTo proceed, we need the observation that\n\n$$\nE_{j} \\cap\\left(\\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[m] \\backslash\\{j\\}} E_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)=\\operatorname{span}\\{\\mathbf{1}\\}\n$$\n\nfor all $j \\in[m]$. Indeed, let $u \\in E_{j}$ and suppose that $u \\notin \\operatorname{span} \\mathbf{1}$. Then, there exist $x, y \\in[L+1]$ such that $u_{x} \\neq u_{y}$. Let $z \\in[L+1]$ such that $(z)_{j}=(y)_{j}$, and $(z)_{r}=(x)_{r}$ for all $r \\in[m] \\backslash\\{j\\}$. Note that $u_{z}=u_{y}$ since $z \\sim_{j} y$. Hence, $u_{z} \\neq u_{x}$. But, $z \\sim_{r} x$ for all $r \\neq j$, so $v_{x}=v_{y}$ for all $v \\in \\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[m] \\backslash\\{j\\}} E_{\\sim_{j^{\\prime}}}$. Therefore, $u \\notin \\sum_{j^{\\prime} \\in[m] \\backslash\\{j\\}} E_{\\sim_{j^{\\prime}}}$.\n\nBy Eq. (22), $\\operatorname{dim} U=(\\ell-1) m+1$.

Write $U=T \\oplus S$ for some linear subspace $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ satisfying $\\operatorname{dim} S=\\operatorname{dim} U-\\operatorname{dim} T$. Let $\\pi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b} \\rightarrow S$ denote the projection map onto $S$ with regard to this direct sum. Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\\operatorname{dim} S} \\rightarrow S$ be a linear bijection.

Let $W^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\\operatorname{dim} S}\\right)$ and set $W=\\phi\\left(W^{\\prime}\\right)+T$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, W^{\\prime}, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap W^{\\prime}\\right)-\\left(1-R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right) \\operatorname{dim} W^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\pi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right) \\cap \\phi\\left(W^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)-\\left(1-R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)(\\operatorname{dim} W-\\operatorname{dim} T) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\pi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right) \\cap W\\right)-\\left(1-R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)(\\operatorname{dim} W-\\operatorname{dim} T) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap T\\right)\\right)-\\left(1-R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)(\\operatorname{dim} W-\\operatorname{dim} T) \\\\\n& =\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, W, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)-\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, T, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe penultimate equality follows from the rank nullity theorem applied to the linear map $\\pi$ and the vector space $\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W$, and the observation that $\\pi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)=\\pi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i}\\right) \\cap W$.\n\nObserve that $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, T, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)$ does not depend on $W^{\\prime}$. Therefore, $\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, W^{\\prime}, R_{V}\\right)$ is maximized when $W^{\\prime}$ corresponds to a space $W \\in \\operatorname{argmax}\\left\\{\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}, *, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)\\right\\}$. In particular $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\\operatorname{dim} S}$ and $\\{0\\}$ correspond to $U$ and $T$, respectively. Thus, by Eq. (26), $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\\operatorname{dim} S},\\{0\\} \\in \\operatorname{argmax}\\left\\{\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}, *, R_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)\\right\\}$ and so by Corollary 4.6, $R_{\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}}=R_{\\mathcal{V}}$. If Eq. (25) applies to $\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}$ then it also applies to $\\mathcal{V}$ since, by linearity of $\\mathcal{C}$, containing $\\mathcal{V}$ implies containing $\\mathcal{V}^{\\prime}$. It therefore suffices to prove Eq. (25) under the assumption that $U=\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ and $T=\\{0\\}$. We proceed to do so.\n\nDenote $K=\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}$. By Eq.

Let $E_{u, v}$ denote the event that $\\operatorname{dim} K_{u, v} \\geq d$. We claim that if none of the events $E_{u, v}$ hold then $\\mathcal{C}$ contains $\\mathcal{V}$. Indeed, assume that no event $E_{u, v}$ holds. Note that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap M_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}=K \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}=K \\backslash\\left(\\bigcup_{u, v} K_{u, v}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap M_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }}\\right| \\geq|K|-\\sum_{u, v}\\left|K_{u, v}\\right| \\geq q^{d}-\\binom{b}{2} \\cdot q^{d-1}>0\n$$\n\nwhere the last inequality is by our assumption that $q>k b \\geq \\varepsilon n b \\geq 2 b^{2}(b+1)$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap M_{\\mathcal{V}}^{\\text {Dist }} \\neq \\emptyset\n$$\n\nso $\\mathcal{C}$ contains $\\mathcal{V}$ and thus satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$.\nWe turn to bound the probability of $E_{u, v}$ for some fixed $u, v$. To this end, we find a necessary condition for this event. Let $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n} ; k-t\\right)$, where $t=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{d-1}{b-1}\\right\\rfloor$. Observe that $\\mathcal{D}$ is a linear subspace of $\\mathcal{C}$ of codimension $t$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{D}^{b} \\cap \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times U_{u, v}}$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times U_{u, v}}$, with codimension $t \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} U_{u, v}=t \\cdot(b-1)$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{D}^{b} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U_{u, v}}^{*}\\right) \\geq \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{b} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U_{u, v}}^{*}\\right)-t(b-1)=\\operatorname{dim} K_{u, v}-t(b-1)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the event $E_{u, v}$ implies that $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{D}^{b} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathcal{V}, U_{u, v}}^{*}\\right) \\geq 1$. We next bound the probability of the latter.\n\nLet $\\psi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b-1}$ be the projection map onto the coordinate set $[b] \\backslash\\{u\\}$. Define the $(b-1)$-local profile $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b-1}\\right)^{n}$ by $\\mathcal{T}_{i}=\\psi\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap U_{u, v}\\right)$.

Moreover, let $W^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b-1}\\right)$ and let $W \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)$ such that $W \\subseteq U_{u, v}$ and $\\psi(W)=W^{\\prime}$. Then, denoting $\\delta=\\frac{t}{n}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi\\left(\\mathcal{T}, W^{\\prime}, R_{\\mathcal{V}}-\\delta\\right) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{T}_{i} \\cap W^{\\prime}\\right)-\\left(1-\\left(R_{\\mathcal{V}}-\\delta\\right)\\right) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_{i} \\cap W\\right)-\\left(1-\\left(R_{\\mathcal{V}}-\\delta\\right)\\right) \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W \\\\\n& =\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R_{\\mathcal{V}}-\\delta)=\\Phi(\\mathcal{V}, W, R_{\\mathcal{V}})-\\delta \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W \\\\\n& \\leq \\Phi(\\mathcal{V},\\{0\\}, R_{\\mathcal{V}})-\\delta \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W \\leq-\\delta \\cdot n \\cdot \\operatorname{dim} W\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality is due to Eq.

A tuple of polynomials $\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{a}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a}$ is said to be $k$-bounded if $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(P_{i}\\right)<k$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq a$. We denote the set of all $k$-bounded tuples by\n\n$$\nQ_{k, a}=\\left\\{\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{a}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a} \\mid \\forall 1 \\leq i \\leq a, \\quad \\operatorname{deg}\\left(P_{i}\\right)<k\\right\\}\n$$\n\nObserve that $Q_{k, a}$ is an $F_{q}$-linear space. If $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a}$ consists of $k$-bounded tuples, we say that $S$ itself is $k$-bounded.\n\nFor $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{P}=\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{a}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a}$, we denote the evaluation $\\boldsymbol{P}(\\alpha):=\\left(P_{1}(\\alpha), \\ldots, P_{a}(\\alpha)\\right)$. For $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a}$, we denote $S(\\alpha):=\\{\\boldsymbol{P}(\\alpha) \\mid \\boldsymbol{P} \\in S\\}$. If $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{m \\times m^{\\prime}}$ is a matrix of polynomials, let $A(\\alpha) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{m \\times m^{\\prime}}$ denote the entry-wise evaluation matrix of $A$ on $\\alpha$.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$ denote the field of univariate rational functions over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We naturally embed $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$ by considering each $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ as the constant rational function $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$. By abuse of notation, both objects will be denoted by $\\alpha$. Note that every $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space is also $F_{q^{-}}$ linear. Throughout this section we use dim and Dim to refer to linear dimension of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$, respectively. We similarly distinguish between span and Span, and between rank and Rank. Observe that the space $Q_{k, a}$ is $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear but not $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear.\n\nThe following fact will be useful.\nLemma 7.1 (Dimension of $S(\\alpha)$ ). Let $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}$ be an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear space and write $D=\\operatorname{DimSpan} S$. The following now holds:\n\n1. $\\operatorname{dim} S(\\alpha) \\leq D$ for every $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$.\n2. If $S$ is $k$-bounded $(k \\in \\mathbb{N})$ then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\alpha \\sim \\mathbf{U}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}\\right)}[\\operatorname{dim} S(\\alpha)=D] \\geq 1-\\frac{D k}{q}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{[S] \\times b}$ be a matrix (possibly with infinitely many rows) whose rows are the elements of $S$. Denote $t:=\\operatorname{dim} S(\\alpha)=\\operatorname{rank} A(\\alpha)$. Note that $A$ contains a minor $M \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{t \\times t}$ such that $\\operatorname{rank} M(\\alpha)=t$. Thus,\n\n$$\n(\\operatorname{det} M)(\\alpha)=\\operatorname{det}(M(\\alpha)) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nimplying that $\\operatorname{det} M$ is a non-zero polynomial, so $M$ has full rank over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$. Thus,\n\n$$\nD=\\operatorname{Rank} A \\geq \\operatorname{Rank} M=t=\\operatorname{dim} S(\\alpha)\n$$\n\nThe first claim follows.\nWe turn to the second claim. Suppose that $S$ is $k$-bounded. Let $M^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{D \\times D}$ be a minor of $A$ with Rank $M^{\\prime}=D$, so $\\operatorname{det} M^{\\prime} \\neq 0$. Since the entries of $M^{\\prime}$ are polynomials of degree at most\n\n$k$, the non-zero polynomial $\\operatorname{det} M^{\\prime}$ has degree at most $D k$. Hence, a uniformly random $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ satisfies $\\left(\\operatorname{det} M^{\\prime}\\right)(\\alpha) \\neq 0$ with probability at least $1-\\frac{D k}{q}$. Suppose that this event holds. Then,\n\n$$\nD \\geq t=\\operatorname{rank} A(\\alpha) \\geq \\operatorname{rank} M^{\\prime}(\\alpha) \\geq D\n$$\n\nso $\\operatorname{dim} S(\\alpha)=t=D$.\nWe turn to define the notion of a local polynomial profile.\nDefinition 7.2. An $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear map $\\psi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a}$ is said to be polynomial if $\\psi\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}\\right) \\subseteq$ $\\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a}$. In other words, $\\psi$ is polynomial if it is represented in the standard basis by a matrix with polynomial entries. We use $\\operatorname{deg} \\psi$ to denote the maximum degree (as a polynomial) of an entry in this matrix.\n\nDefinition 7.3. A b-local polynomial profile is a sequence $\\Psi=\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\ldots \\psi_{n}\\right)$ of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear polynomial maps $\\psi_{i}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b_{i}}$ (for some $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ). We denote $\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq n} \\operatorname{deg} \\psi_{i}$.\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. A tuple of polynomials $\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{b}\\right)$ is said to satisfy $(\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ if for every $i \\in[n]$ it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\psi_{i}\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{b}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nFor an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear space $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}$, we denote\n\n$$\nS[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}]=\\{\\boldsymbol{P} \\in S \\mid \\boldsymbol{P} \\text { satisfies }(\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\\}\n$$\n\nNote that $S[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}]$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear space.\nPolynomial profiles provide a framework for directly analyzing and manipulating message vectors, which, in the case of random RS codes, correspond to the coefficient vectors of low-degree polynomials. This generalization enables one to define profiles that are well-suited for the stochastic process to proceed until completion (see Section 7.4 for further details). Additionally, we require a notion that is related to the concept of $\\Phi$, which is defined for subspaces of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$.\n\nDefinition 7.4 (Strength). For an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear subspace $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ and a polynomial map $\\psi$, we denote $\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\psi):=\\operatorname{Dim} \\psi(U)$. Note that when $U=\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$, we have $\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\psi)=\\operatorname{Rank} \\psi$.\n\nFor an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear subspace $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ and a polynomial profile $\\Psi=\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\ldots \\psi_{n}\\right)$, we denote $\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\Psi)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{strength}_{U}\\left(\\psi_{i}\\right)$.\n\nDefinition 7.5. Given $T, U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$, where $U$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear subspace, we say that $U$ is $T$-live if $\\operatorname{Span}(T \\cap U)=U$. Otherwise, we say that $U$ is $T$-dead.\n\nOur goal is to rephrase Proposition 6.1 in terms of local polynomial profiles. We require the following lemma to do so.\n\nLemma 7.6. Let $n \\leq q$ with $q$ a prime power. Let $\\mathcal{V}=\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{n}\\right) \\in\\left(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}\\right)\\right)^{n}$ be a b-local profile. Then, there exists a b-local polynomial profile $\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}$ with $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}\\right)=0$ such that, for every $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the following holds:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n} ; k\\right) \\text { contains a nonzero } n \\times b \\text { matrix satisfying } \\mathcal{V} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\operatorname{dim} Q_{k, b}\\left[\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right]>0\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for every $Q_{k, b}$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ there exists an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear space $U^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ with $\\operatorname{Dim} U=\\operatorname{dim} U^{\\prime}$ and\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\Psi) \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{Dim} U-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U^{\\prime} \\cap V_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. For $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, let $\\varphi_{i}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b-\\operatorname{dim} V_{i}}$ be an $F_{q}$-linear map with $\\operatorname{ker} \\varphi_{i}=V_{i}$. Take $\\psi_{i}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b-\\operatorname{dim} V_{i}}$ to be an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear map whose restriction to $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{b}$ is $\\varphi_{i}$. In other words, the matrix representation of $\\psi_{i}$ in the standard basis is the same as that of $\\varphi_{i}$. In particular, $\\operatorname{deg} \\psi_{i}=0$. Observe that $\\varphi_{i}(\\boldsymbol{P}(\\alpha))=\\psi_{i}(\\boldsymbol{P})(\\alpha)$ for all $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $\\boldsymbol{P} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}$. Finally, take $\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}=\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{n}\\right)$ and note that $\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}=0$.\n\nNow, suppose that $\\mathcal{C}:=\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n} ; k\\right)$ contains a non zero matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n \\times b}$ that satisfies $\\mathcal{V}$. By definition of the RS code, there is a tuple of distinct polynomials $\\mathbf{0} \\neq \\boldsymbol{P}:=\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{b}\\right) \\in Q_{k, b}$ such that $A_{i, j}=P_{j}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq b$. Observe that $\\boldsymbol{P}$ satisfies $\\left(\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)$. Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\psi_{i}(\\boldsymbol{P})\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=\\varphi_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{P}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)\\right)=\\varphi_{i}\\left(A_{i *}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nsince $A_{i *} \\in V_{i}=\\operatorname{ker} \\varphi_{i}$. Therefore, $\\boldsymbol{P} \\in Q_{k, b}\\left[\\Psi_{\\mathcal{V}}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right]$, and thus $\\operatorname{dim} Q_{k, b}[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}]>0$.\nWe turn to proving the last part of the lemma. Let $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ be $Q_{k, b}$-live and denote $D=\\operatorname{Dim} U$. Let $S=Q_{k, b} \\cap U$.

We take $U^{\\prime}=S(\\alpha)$. It remains to show that $U^{\\prime}$ satisfies Eq. (29).\n\nFix $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.

To prove Lemma 7.7 we need to bound the probability that $Q_{k, b}[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}] \\supseteq\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$. To this end, we will tackle a more general question: given a finite $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear space $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}$, how likely is it that $S[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}] \\supseteq\\{\\mathbf{0}\\}$ ? To help answer this question, we define a potential function $\\Pi$.

Also, $\\Psi_{1 \\cdots i}=\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{i}\\right)$ and $\\Psi_{i \\cdots n}=\\left(\\psi_{i}, \\ldots, \\psi_{n}\\right)$.

Suppose that $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is sampled uniformly at random from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. One may hope to show that $S[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}] \\cap W=\\{0\\}$ holds in this setting with high probability. However, this is not always true.

It suffices to prove Eq. (33), since the latter implies Eq. (32) by taking $L^{\\prime}=0$. We turn to prove Eq. (33). Let $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ be uniformly sampled from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n$ denote $S_{i}=S\\left[\\Psi_{1 \\cdots i}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{1 \\cdots i}\\right]$ and $p_{i}=\\Pi_{W}\\left(S_{i}, \\Psi_{i+1 \\cdots n}\\right)$. Recall that $p_{0}=-L$.\n\nObserve that the bad event $E_{L^{\\prime}}$ implies that there is some $1 \\leq t \\leq n$ such that $W$ is $S_{t-1}$-live and $p_{t} \\geq-L^{\\prime}$. Indeed, suppose that $E_{L^{\\prime}}$ holds and consider two cases. If $W$ is $S_{n}$-dead, then taking $t=s$ (recall that $s$ is the minimum index for which $W$ is $S_{s}$-dead) satisfies the claim. Otherwise, take $t=n$. Since $W$ is $S_{n}$-live it is also $S_{n-1}$-live. Now,\n\n$$\np_{t}=p_{n}=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(W \\cap S_{n}\\right) \\geq 0 \\geq-L^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nand the claim holds. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[E_{L^{\\prime}}\\right] \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[p_{t} \\geq-L^{\\prime}\\right]\n$$\n\nLet\n\n$$\nM=\\left\\{i \\in[n] \\mid p_{i+1}>p_{i}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nnamely, $M$ is the set of steps in which the potential function strictly increases. By the first part of Lemma 7.9, each step in $M$ increases the potential by at most $D$. Hence,\n\n$$\np_{t} \\leq p_{0}+D \\cdot|M \\cap[t]|=-L+D \\cdot|M \\cap[t]|\n$$\n\nThus, a necessary event for $p_{t} \\geq-L^{\\prime}$ is that $|M \\cap[t]| \\geq m$, where $m=\\left\\lceil\\frac{L-L^{\\prime}}{D}\\right\\rceil$. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n$, let $G_{i}$ denote the event that $W$ is $S_{i}$-live (note that $G_{i}$ implies $\\left.G_{0}, \\ldots, G_{i-1}\\right)$. Note that the events $G_{0}, \\ldots, G_{t-1}$ hold by definition of $t$.

To prove Eq. (33), it suffices to show that each of these terms is at most $\\left(\\frac{(k+q) D}{q}\\right)^{m}$. We proceed to do so.\n\nFix $I \\subseteq[n]$ with $|I|=m$. Write $I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{m}\\right\\}$ where $i_{1}<i_{2}<\\cdots<i_{m}$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots \\alpha_{i_{m}}}\\left[I \\subseteq M \\wedge G_{i_{m}-1}\\right] & =\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots \\alpha_{i_{m}}}\\left[(I \\subseteq M) \\wedge G_{0} \\wedge G_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge G_{i_{m}-1}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}}}\\left[i_{j} \\in M \\mid\\left(\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{j-1}\\right\\} \\subseteq M\\right) \\wedge G_{i_{j}-1}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe inequality follows from the fact that $G_{i}$ implies $G_{0} \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge G_{i-1}$. To finish the proof we show that each term on the right-hand side is at most $\\frac{(k+q) D}{q}$. Let $1 \\leq j \\leq m$.\n\nCondition on $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}-1}$ for which $\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{j-1}\\right\\} \\subseteq M \\wedge G_{i_{j}-1}$ holds.

Furthermore, recall that $i_{j} \\in M$ is the event where the potential function increases after substituting a random $\\alpha_{i_{j}}$. Thus, for all $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}-1}$ for which $\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{j-1}\\right\\} \\subseteq M \\wedge G_{i_{j}-1}$ holds, by the second part of Lemma 7.9, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}}}\\left[i_{j} \\in M \\mid \\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}-1}\\right] \\leq \\frac{(k+g) D}{q}\n$$\n\nBecause the events $\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{j-1}\\right\\} \\subseteq M$ and $G_{i_{j}-1}$ only depend on $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{i_{j}-1}$, we see that the $j$-th term in the product above is at most $\\frac{(k+g) D}{q}$.",

The claim follows by applying Lemma 7.10 to $S:=Q_{k, b}$ and $\\Psi$. Note that $g=b \\cdot k$. Also, Eq. (30) yields\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{U}(S, \\Psi)=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap Q_{k, b}\\right)-\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\Psi) \\leq k \\cdot \\operatorname{Dim} U-\\operatorname{strength}_{U}(\\Psi) \\leq-\\lambda \\cdot \\operatorname{Dim} U\n$$\n\nfor every $Q_{k, b}$-live $U \\subseteq W$. The first inequality, $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap Q_{k, b}\\right) \\leq k \\cdot \\operatorname{Dim} U$, follows from the following argument. Let $G \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b \\times \\operatorname{Dim} U}$ be a generating matrix for $U$ in systematic form, namely, $U=\\left(G x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{\\operatorname{Dim} U}\\right)$. Therefore, $G$ contains a $\\operatorname{Dim} U \\times \\operatorname{Dim} U$ identity matrix as a sub-matrix. Due to the systematic form of $G$, we have\n\n$$\nU \\cap Q_{k, b} \\subseteq\\left(G x \\mid x \\in Q_{k, \\operatorname{Dim} U}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\left|U \\cap Q_{k, b}\\right| \\leq\\left|Q_{k, \\operatorname{Dim} U}\\right|=q^{k \\cdot \\operatorname{Dim} U}\n$$\n\nand so,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap Q_{k, b}\\right)=\\log _{q}\\left|U \\cap Q_{k, b}\\right| \\leq k \\cdot \\operatorname{Dim} U\n$$\n\nOne may attempt to prove Lemma 7.10 by the following straighforward approach. Denote $S_{n}=S[\\Psi, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}]$. An equivalent condition for $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$, is that every $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ is $S_{n}$-dead. Eq. (34) and Lemma 7.8 imply that this is very likely for any given $U$, so it seems reasonable to attempt a union bound over all $S$-live subspaces $U$ (an analogous union bound over subspaces is inherent to our proof of Proposition 4.3). Unfortunately, the number of $S$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$ linear subspaces (roughly $q^{\\Omega\\left(k \\cdot k^{2}\\right)}$ ) is too large for this approach to work. Therefore, we require a subtler strategy.\n\nIn our proof of Lemma 7.10, we follow the run of the iterative stochastic process described at the opening of this subsection. We run the process until a time $s$ in which one of two stopping conditions occurs. The first condition is that the space $W$ (namely, the $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-span of $S$ ) is $S_{s}$-dead, at which point we continue the run with regard to $S_{s}$, whose $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-span is now smaller. This is the simple case.\n\nThe second stopping condition is that some $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-subspace $U \\subseteq W$ has become \"worrisome\". By this, we mean that $p_{U, s}:=\\Pi_{U}\\left(S_{s}, \\Psi_{s+1 \\cdots n}\\right)$ has increased and gotten too close to zero from the negative side. This is indeed worrying since, if this potential becomes positive, it is guaranteed that $S_{n} \\cap U \\neq\\{0\\}$, so we cannot hope to have $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$. In this case, we proceed recursively by analyzing two different runs. First, we consider the set $S_{s} \\cap U$ and show the remaining negative potential $p_{U, t}$ is still negative enough to ensure that $S_{n} \\cap U=\\{0\\}$ with high probability. Second, we define a \"quotient set\" $S / U$ and \"quotient profile\" $\\Psi / U$. Using the fact that $p_{U, s}$ is only slightly negative, we show that this quotient run likely leads to the $\\{0\\}$-set, meaning that $S_{n} \\subseteq U$ is likely. Together, $S_{n} \\cap U=\\{0\\}$ and $S_{n} \\subseteq U$ imply that $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$.\n\nProof of Lemma 7.10. Throughout this proof, if $U$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space, we denote $D_{U}=$ $\\operatorname{Dim} U$. We prove the claim by induction on $D_{W}$. The case $D_{W}=0$ is immediate. Suppose that $D_{W} \\geq 1$. Write $L=\\lambda \\cdot D_{W}$ and let $L^{\\prime}=\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{W}$, where\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{*}=\\left\\lceil\\frac{\\left(D_{W}-1\\right) \\cdot \\lambda}{D_{W}}+D_{W}\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ be sampled uniformly from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n$, denote $S_{i}=S\\left[\\Psi_{1 \\cdots i}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{1 \\cdots i}\\right]$ and $p_{U, i}=$ $\\Pi_{U}\\left(S_{i}, \\Psi_{i+1 \\cdots n}\\right)$ (where $U \\subseteq W$ is $F_{q}(X)$-linear).\n\nLet $1 \\leq t$ denote the minimal index at which $W$ is $S_{t}$-dead (if such an index does not exist, let $t=\\infty)$. Let $F$ denote the event that $t<\\infty$ and $p_{W, t}<-L^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $1 \\leq s$ denote the minimal index in which at least one of the following two events occur:\n\n1. $W$ is $S_{s}$-dead OR\n2. For some $S_{s}$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space $\\{0\\} \\neq U \\subsetneq W$, there holds\n\n$$\np_{U, s}>-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{U}\n$$\n\nLet $F^{\\prime}$ denote the event that $s<\\infty$ and $p_{W, s}<-L^{\\prime}$. Observe that $F$ implies $F^{\\prime}$. Indeed, assume that $F$ holds. Clearly, $s \\leq t$, so $s<\\infty$. By Lemma $7.9, p_{W, 0}, \\ldots, p_{W, n}$ is non-decreasing, so\n\n$p_{W, s} \\leq p_{W, t}<-L^{\\prime}$, implying $F^{\\prime}$. Therefore, by Lemma 7.8,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[\\overline{F^{\\prime}}\\right] \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}[\\bar{F}] & \\leq\\left(\\frac{n}{\\left\\lceil\\frac{L-L^{\\prime}}{D_{W}}\\right\\rceil}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{(k+\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi) \\cdot D_{W}}{q}\\right)^{\\left\\lceil\\frac{L-L^{\\prime}}{D_{W}}\\right\\rceil} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\frac{n}{\\left\\lceil\\frac{L-L^{\\prime}}{D_{W}}\\right\\rceil}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{2 g \\cdot D_{W}}{q}\\right)^{\\left\\lceil\\frac{L-L^{\\prime}}{D_{W}}\\right\\rceil} \\\\\n& =\\binom{n}{\\left\\lceil\\lambda-\\lambda^{*}\\right\\rceil} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{2 g \\cdot D_{W}}{q}\\right)^{\\left\\lceil\\lambda-\\lambda^{*}\\right\\rceil} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\frac{2 e \\cdot n \\cdot g \\cdot D_{W}}{\\left(\\left\\lceil\\lambda-\\lambda^{*}\\right\\rceil\\right) q}\\right)^{\\left\\lceil\\lambda-\\lambda^{*}\\right\\rceil} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot n \\cdot g \\cdot D_{W}^{2}}{\\lambda q}\\right)^{\\left\\lceil\\lambda-\\lambda^{*}\\right\\rceil} \\quad \\text { by Eqs.

(36) } \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot n \\cdot g \\cdot D_{W}^{2}}{\\lambda q}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 D_{W}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe will show that, given $F^{\\prime}$, the event $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$ is highly likely. This statement, combined with Eq. (38), will complete the proof.\n\nHenceforth, we condition on the event $F^{\\prime}$. Note that $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{s}$ fully determine $F^{\\prime}$ and $s$. Therefore, the evaluation points $\\alpha_{s+1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}$ are unaffected by this conditioning and remain uniformly distributed and independent.\n\nWe will assume that $S_{s} \\neq\\{0\\}$, because otherwise $S_{n} \\subseteq S_{s}=\\{0\\}$, and we are done. We select an $S_{s}$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear subspace $U \\subsetneq W$ as follows. If $W$ is $S_{s}$-dead, we set $U=\\operatorname{Span} S_{s}$. Otherwise, by our assumption of $F^{\\prime}$ and definition of $s$, there exists an $S_{s}$-live subspace $\\{0\\} \\neq U \\subsetneq W$ with $p_{U, s}>-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{U}$. We then take $U$ to be some inclusion-maximal subspace with this property. Note that in either case, $U \\neq\\{0\\}$ and therefore $\\operatorname{Dim} U \\geq 1$.\n\nWe now consider two events: $S_{n} \\cap U=\\{0\\}$ and $S_{n} \\subseteq U$. We will prove that each of these events is very likely, and thus, so is their conjunction, namely, $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$.\n\nProbability of $S_{n} \\cap U=\\{0\\}$\nTo prove that $S_{n} \\cap U=\\{0\\}$ is very likely, we apply the induction hypothesis to the set $S^{\\prime}:=S_{s} \\cap U$ and the polynomial profile $\\Psi^{\\prime}:=\\Psi_{s+1 \\cdots n}$. Recall that $U$ is $S_{s}$-live, which implies $U$ is also $S^{\\prime}$-live, therefore $U=\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\cap U\\right)=\\operatorname{Span} S^{\\prime}$ holds. Moreover $D_{U}<D_{W}$, so the induction hypothesis is indeed valid here.\n\nSince $S$ is $k$-bounded, so is $S^{\\prime}$. Similarly, $\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi^{\\prime} \\leq g$.\nLet $V \\subseteq U$ be $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear and $S^{\\prime}$-live. Denote $D_{V}:=\\operatorname{Dim} V$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pi_{V}\\left(S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}\\right) & =p_{V, s} \\\\\n& \\leq p_{V, s-1}+D_{V} \\\\\n& \\leq-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{V}+D_{V} \\\\\n& =-\\left(\\lambda^{*}-1\\right) \\cdot D_{V}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby the first part of Lemma 7.9\n\nAlso,\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{*}-1 \\geq \\frac{\\left(D_{W}-1\\right) \\cdot \\lambda}{D_{W}} \\geq 2 \\cdot\\left(D_{W}-1\\right)\\left(D_{W}+1\\right) \\geq 2 D_{U}\\left(D_{U}+1\\right)\n$$\n\nHence, $\\lambda^{*}-1$ satisfies Eqs. (34) and (35). The induction hypothesis thus yields\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\cap U \\supseteq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\leq\\left(2^{D_{U}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{U}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q\\left(\\lambda^{*}-1\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}-1}{2 D_{U}}}\n$$",

If $W$ is $S_{s}$-dead then $U=$ $\\operatorname{Span} S_{s} \\supseteq S_{n}$, so the event holds deterministically. We therefore proceed under the assumption that $W$ is $S_{s}$-live, and that $U$ is an $S_{s}$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear subspace satisfying $p_{U, s}>-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{U}$.\n\nOur strategy is to use $\\Psi$ to construct a new polynomial profile $\\Psi^{\\prime}$, such that applying the induction hypothesis to $\\Psi^{\\prime}$ implies that $S_{n} \\subseteq U$ with high probability. For each entry $\\psi_{i}$ in $\\Psi$, the corresponding entry $\\psi_{i}^{\\prime}$ of $\\Psi^{\\prime}$ is a polynomial map chosen so that the following diagram commutes:\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nHere, $\\pi$ is a polynomial map whose kernel is $U$, and the kernel of $\\chi$ is $\\psi(U)$. In order to apply the induction hypothesis to $\\Psi^{\\prime}$, we also need to control the degrees of the polynomial maps $\\pi$ and $\\psi^{\\prime}$. This construction is achieved by Claims 7.11 to 7.14 , which rely on notions from Definition 7.2.\n\nClaim 7.11. Let $\\mathbf{T} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{p \\times e}(p \\geq e)$ be a full-rank (over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$ ) matrix of $d$-bounded polynomials $(d \\in \\mathbb{N})$. Then, there is a full-rank matrix $\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{(p-e) \\times p}$ of $(e \\cdot d)$-bounded polynomials such that $\\operatorname{ker} \\mathbf{T}^{*}=\\operatorname{Im} \\mathbf{T}$.\n\nProof. Suppose without loss of generality that $\\mathbf{T}$ can be written as a block matrix $\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\mathbf{T}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{T}_{2}\\end{array}\\right]$ where $\\mathbf{T}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{e \\times e}$ has full-rank over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$, and $\\mathbf{T}_{2} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{(p-e) \\times e}$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{(p-e) \\times p}$ be the block matrix $\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\mathbf{T}_{1}\\right) \\cdot\\left[-\\mathbf{T}_{2} \\mathbf{T}_{1}^{-1} \\mid \\mathbf{I}_{p-e}\\right]$. Observe that $\\operatorname{ker} \\mathbf{T}^{*}=$ $\\operatorname{Im} \\mathbf{T}$. By Cramer's Rule, every entry of $\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\mathbf{T}_{1}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{T}_{1}^{-1}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $(e-1) \\cdot d$. Thus, every entry of $\\mathbf{T}^{*}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $e \\cdot d$.\n\nClaim 7.12. There exists an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear polynomial map $\\pi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b-D_{U}}$ with $\\operatorname{ker} \\pi=$ $U$ and $\\operatorname{deg} \\pi \\leq D_{U} \\cdot k$.\n\nProof. Since $U$ is $S_{s}$-live, there is a matrix $\\mathbf{T} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b \\times D_{U}}$ such that $\\operatorname{Im} \\mathbf{T}=U$ and the columns of $\\mathbf{T}$ belong to $S_{s}$. In particular, because $S_{s}$ is a $k$-bounded space, every entry of $\\mathbf{T}$ is a polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]$ of degree at most $k$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{T}$ satisfies the conditions of Claim 7.11 with $p=b, e=D_{U}$, and $d=k$. Let $\\mathbf{T}^{*}$ be the matrix guaranteed by Claim 7.11. Take $\\pi$ to be the $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear map that $\\mathbf{T}^{*}$ represents in the standard basis. The claim follows immediately.\n\nClaim 7.13. Let $\\pi$ be as in Claim 7.12 and let $\\psi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a}(a \\leq b)$ be an $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$ linear polynomial map of degree $d$ and rank a. Then, there exist $r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear maps $\\psi^{\\prime}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b-d_{U}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{r}$ and $\\chi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{r}$ with the following properties:\n\n- $\\chi \\circ \\psi=\\psi^{\\prime} \\circ \\pi$.\n- $\\psi^{\\prime}$ is a polynomial map of degree at most $\\max \\left\\{b \\cdot d, b \\cdot D_{U} \\cdot k\\right\\}$\n- $\\operatorname{ker} \\chi=\\psi(U)$\n\nProof. In this proof, all dimensions and ranks are with regard to the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$. Let $\\mathbf{M}_{\\pi} \\in$ $\\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{\\left(b-D_{U}\\right) \\times b}$ and $\\mathbf{M}_{\\psi} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{a \\times b}$ be full-rank matrices representing $\\pi$ and $\\psi$ in the standard basis, respectively. By Claim 7.12 we know that every entry in $\\mathbf{M}_{\\pi}$ is a polynomial having degree at most $D_{U} \\cdot k$. By hypothesis, we assume that every entry in $\\mathbf{M}_{\\psi}$ is a polynomial having degree at most $d$. By a slight abuse of notation, we will use $\\operatorname{Span}(\\mathbf{M})$ to denote the $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-span of the columns of some matrix $\\mathbf{M}$.\n\nLet\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr & :=\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\operatorname{Span}\\left(\\mathbf{M}_{\\psi}^{\\top}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Span}\\left(\\mathbf{M}_{\\pi}^{\\top}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =b-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\psi+\\operatorname{ker} \\pi) \\\\\n& =b-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\psi)-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\pi)+\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\psi \\cap \\operatorname{ker} \\pi) \\\\\n& =a-(\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\pi)+\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\psi \\cap \\operatorname{ker} \\pi))=a-(\\operatorname{Dim}(U)-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\psi \\cap U)) \\\\\n& =a-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\psi(U))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first equality follows by the rank-nullity theorem and De-Morgan's law. Let $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{\\left(b-D_{U}+a\\right) \\times b}$ denote the block matrix $\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{M}_{\\pi}}{\\mathbf{M}_{\\psi}}\\right]$. Define $e:=b-D_{U}+a-r \\leq b$ and note that Rank $\\mathbf{Z}=e$. Let $\\mathbf{T} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{\\left(b-D_{U}+a\\right) \\times e}$ be a submatrix of $\\mathbf{Z}$ obtained by selecting a set of $e$ columns so that Rank $\\mathbf{T}=e$. Let $\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{r \\times\\left(b-D_{U}+a\\right)}$ be the matrix guaranteed by Claim 7.11, corresponding to T. In particular, $\\operatorname{ker} \\mathbf{T}^{*}=\\operatorname{Span}(\\mathbf{T})=\\operatorname{Span}(\\mathbf{Z})$.\n\nWrite $\\mathbf{T}^{*}$ as a block matrix $\\left[\\mathbf{P} \\mid \\mathbf{Q}\\right]$ where $\\mathbf{P} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{r \\times\\left(b-D_{U}\\right)}$ and $\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{r \\times a}$. We take $\\psi^{\\prime}$ and $\\chi$ to be the $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear maps represented by $\\mathbf{P}$ and $-\\mathbf{Q}$, respectively. We turn to show that $\\psi^{\\prime}$ and $\\chi$ satisfy the required properties.\n\nThe first property is equivalent to $-\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{M}_{\\psi}=\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{M}_{\\pi}$. This is true since $\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\mathbf{T}=0$, thus, implying $\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\mathbf{Z}=0$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n0=\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\mathbf{Z}=\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{M}_{\\pi}+\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{M}_{\\psi}\n$$\n\nFor the second condition, Claim 7.11 guarantees that each entry of $\\mathbf{T}^{*}$, and thus also of $\\mathbf{P}$, has degree at most $\\max \\left\\{d, D_{U} \\cdot k\\right\\} \\cdot e \\leq \\max \\left\\{b \\cdot d, b \\cdot D_{U} \\cdot k\\right\\}$.\n\nFor the third condition, let $u \\in U$, and recall that $U=\\operatorname{ker} \\pi$. Then,\n\n$$\n0=\\mathbf{T}^{*} \\mathbf{Z} u=\\mathbf{P M}_{\\pi} u+\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{M}_{\\psi} u=\\psi^{\\prime}(\\pi(u))+\\chi(\\psi(u))=\\chi(\\psi(u))\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi^{\\prime}(\\pi(u))=0$ as $u \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\pi$, so $\\psi(U) \\subseteq \\operatorname{ker} \\chi$. On the other hand, suppose that $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a}$ such that $\\chi(x)=0$. Let $y:=\\mathbf{0}_{b-D_{U}} \\circ x$ denote the concatenation of $b-D_{U}$ zeros and $x$. Then, $\\mathbf{T}^{*} y=\\mathbf{Q} x=\\chi(x)=0$, so $y \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\mathbf{T}^{*}=\\operatorname{Im} \\mathbf{Z}$. Let $w \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b}$ be such that $\\mathbf{Z} w=y$. Then, $\\pi(w)=$ $\\mathbf{M}_{\\pi} w=0$ and $\\psi(w)=\\mathbf{M}_{\\psi} w=x$ hold by the definition of $y$. This implies that $w \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\pi=U$ and $x \\in \\psi(U)$.\n\nClaim 7.14. Let $\\chi: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{r}$ be a polynomial map. Let $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $p \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]^{b}$ be such that $p(\\alpha)=0$. Then, $\\chi(p)(\\alpha)=0$.\n\nProof. It suffices to prove the claim for $r=1$. Write $\\chi(p)=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} q_{i} p_{i}$ where $q_{i} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]$ for each $i$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\chi(p)(\\alpha)=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} q_{i}(\\alpha) \\cdot p_{i}(\\alpha)=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} q_{i}(\\alpha) \\cdot 0=0\n$$\n\nTo lower bound the probability of $S_{n} \\subseteq U$ we apply the induction hypothesis to a space of polynomials and a polynomial profile that we now construct. Let $\\pi$ be as in Claim 7.12 and let $S^{\\prime}=\\pi\\left(S_{s}\\right)$. Recall that $\\Psi$ is a $b$-local polynomial profile, therefore for every $i$ such that $s+1 \\leq i \\leq n$, we have a polynomial map $\\psi_{i}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a_{i}}$, for some $0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq b$. By applying Claim 7.13 for $\\pi$ and every $\\psi_{i}$ for $s+1 \\leq i \\leq n$, we see that there exists an $r_{i}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear maps $\\psi_{i}^{\\prime}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{b-D_{U}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{r_{i}}$ and $\\chi_{i}: \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{a_{i}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)^{r_{i}}$. Let $\\Psi^{\\prime}=\\left(\\psi_{s+1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, \\psi_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)$. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{\\prime}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{s+1 \\cdots n}$.\n\nWe claim that\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}\\left[\\Psi^{\\prime}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{\\prime}\\right]=\\{0\\} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad S_{n} \\subseteq U\n$$\n\nIndeed, suppose that $S^{\\prime}\\left[\\Psi^{\\prime}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{\\prime}\\right]=\\{0\\}$ and let $p \\in S_{n}$. We need to show that $p \\in U$. Let $p^{\\prime}=\\pi(p)$ and let $i$ be such that $s+1 \\leq i \\leq n$. Since $p \\in S_{n}$, we have $\\psi_{i}(p)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=0$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\psi_{i}^{\\prime}\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=\\left(\\left(\\psi_{i}^{\\prime} \\circ \\pi\\right)(p)\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=\\left(\\left(\\chi_{i} \\circ \\psi_{i}\\right)(p)\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=\\chi_{i}\\left(\\psi_{i}(p)\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nWhere the last equality is due to Claim 7.14. Therefore, $p^{\\prime} \\in S^{\\prime}\\left[\\Psi^{\\prime}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{\\prime}\\right]$, whence $\\pi(p)=p^{\\prime}=0$. Thus, $p \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\pi=U$.\n\nApplying the induction hypothesis: Observe that because $W$ is $S_{s}$-live and $S_{s} \\subseteq S \\subseteq$ $W$, $\\operatorname{Span} S_{s}=W$ holds. Therefore $\\operatorname{Span} S^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{Span} \\pi\\left(S_{s}\\right)=\\pi\\left(\\operatorname{Span} S_{s}\\right)=\\pi(W)$. Recall that $\\operatorname{Dim} U \\geq 1$, let $W^{\\prime}:=\\operatorname{Span} S^{\\prime}=\\pi(W)$ and note that $\\operatorname{Dim} W^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{Dim} W-\\operatorname{Dim}(\\operatorname{ker} \\pi \\cap W)=$ $\\operatorname{Dim} W-\\operatorname{Dim} U<\\operatorname{Dim} W$. We will now apply the induction hypothesis to $S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}$ and $W^{\\prime}$, after showing that they satisfy the required conditions. First, note that $W^{\\prime}$ satisfies $W^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{Span} S^{\\prime}$ by definition, and we just showed that $\\operatorname{Dim} W^{\\prime}<\\operatorname{Dim} W$.\n\nWe now prove that for every $S^{\\prime}$-live $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear space $V^{\\prime} \\subseteq W^{\\prime}$, the following holds\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{V^{\\prime}}\\left(S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{V^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nThis is easily seen to be true when $V^{\\prime}$ is the zero subspace, hence assume that it is not. Let $U^{\\prime}=\\pi^{-1}\\left(V^{\\prime}\\right)$ and note that $U \\subset U^{\\prime} \\subseteq W$. We now prove the following claim:\n\nClaim 7.15. Let $S_{s}, S^{\\prime}, V^{\\prime}, U^{\\prime}$ be as defined above. The following holds:\n\n$$\n\\pi\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)=\\pi\\left(S_{s}\\right) \\cap \\pi\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)=S^{\\prime} \\cap V^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nProof. The second equality is true by definitions of $S^{\\prime}, U^{\\prime}$, so we prove the first equality. The containment $\\pi\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right) \\subseteq \\pi\\left(S_{s}\\right) \\cap \\pi\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)$ is easy to see. The other containment is proved as follows: fix a $p \\in \\pi\\left(S_{s}\\right) \\cap \\pi\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)$. Because $p \\in S^{\\prime}$, there is a $q \\in S_{s}$ so that $p=\\pi(q)$. Now $q$ must also be in $U^{\\prime}$, because if not, then $\\pi(q) \\notin V^{\\prime}$ by the definition of $U^{\\prime}$, which would contradict the fact that $\\pi(q)=p \\in V^{\\prime}$.\n\nCombining Claim 7.15 and the following two equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{ker} \\pi \\cap\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)=U \\cap S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}=U \\cap S_{s} \\\\\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\pi\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\operatorname{ker} \\pi \\cap\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwe see that the following is true\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\cap V^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap S_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nObserve that we have used dim (and not Dim) in the previous sentence. Because the spaces and maps we are considering are $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear (in fact, they are $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linear) subspaces and maps respectively, we can apply rank-nullity theorem while viewing them as linear over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$.\n\nNote that for $s+1 \\leq i \\leq n$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}^{\\prime}\\left(V^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) & =\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}^{\\prime} \\circ \\pi\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\left)=\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\chi_{i} \\circ \\psi_{i}\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)-\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{ker} \\chi_{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}\\left(U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)-\\operatorname{Dim}\\left(\\psi_{i}(U)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used the fact that $\\operatorname{ker} \\chi_{i}=\\psi_{i}(U)$ for the last equality. Now, by Eq. (42) and Eq. (43) we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pi_{V^{\\prime}}\\left(S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}\\right) & =\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\cap V^{\\prime}\\right)-\\operatorname{strength}_{V^{\\prime}}\\left(\\Psi^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)-\\operatorname{dim}\\left(U \\cap S_{s}\\right)-\\operatorname{strength}_{U^{\\prime}}\\left(\\Psi_{s+1 \\cdots n}\\right)+\\operatorname{strength}_{U}\\left(\\Psi_{s+1 \\cdots n}\\right) \\\\\n& =p_{U^{\\prime}, s}-p_{U, s}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe will now prove\n\n$$\np_{U^{\\prime}, s} \\leq-\\lambda^{*} D_{U^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nObserve that because $U$ is an inclusion-maximal $S_{s}$-live subspace such that $p_{U, s}>-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{U}$, it is suffices to prove that $U^{\\prime}$ is $S_{s}$-live. Note that $\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\cap V^{\\prime}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$ because $V^{\\prime}$ is $S^{\\prime}$-live, and by Claim 7.15 and $\\mathbb{F}_{q}(X)$-linearity of $\\pi$, we see that\n\n$$\nV^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\cap V^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{Span}\\left(\\pi\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)=\\pi\\left(\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBecause $U$ is $S_{s}$-live, $\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)$ contains $\\operatorname{ker} \\pi=U$ and therefore we have that $\\pi^{-1}\\left(\\pi\\left(\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S_{s} \\cap\\right.\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\left)=\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)$. This together with Eq. (44) implies $\\operatorname{Span}\\left(S_{s} \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)=\\pi^{-1}\\left(V^{\\prime}\\right)=U^{\\prime}$, and so $U^{\\prime}$ is $S_{s}$-live.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\Pi_{V^{\\prime}}\\left(S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq-\\lambda^{*}\\left(D_{U^{\\prime}}-D_{U}\\right)=-\\lambda^{*} \\cdot D_{V^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nThe last equality holds by the rank-nullity theorem applied on the subspace $U^{\\prime}$ and map $\\pi$. By Eq. (34) applied to $\\lambda$, and Eq. (36),\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{*} \\geq \\frac{\\left(D_{W}-1\\right) \\cdot \\lambda}{D_{W}} \\geq \\frac{2 D_{W}\\left(D_{W}+1\\right)\\left(D_{W}-1\\right)}{D_{W}}=2\\left(D_{W}+1\\right)\\left(D_{W}-1\\right) \\geq 2\\left(D_{W^{\\prime}}+1\\right) \\cdot D_{W^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nso $\\lambda^{*}$ satisfies Eq. (34) with regard to $D_{W^{\\prime}}$. Recall that $g$ was equal to $\\max (\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi, b \\cdot k)$, and set $k^{\\prime}:=b \\cdot D_{U} \\cdot k$ and $g^{\\prime}:=b^{2} g$. By Claim 7.11 and Claim 7.12, $S^{\\prime}$ is $k^{\\prime}$-bounded. By Claim 7.13,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi^{\\prime} \\leq \\max \\left\\{b \\cdot \\operatorname{deg} \\Psi, b \\cdot D_{U} \\cdot k\\right\\} \\leq b g\n$$\n\nNote that $g^{\\prime} \\geq \\max \\left\\{\\operatorname{deg} \\Psi^{\\prime}, b \\cdot k^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. We have now proven that $S^{\\prime}, \\Psi^{\\prime}$, and $W^{\\prime}$ indeed satisfy the required conditions, with $g^{\\prime}, \\lambda^{*}$ being the new value for $g, \\lambda$ respectively, and therefore by Eq. (40),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\not \\subseteq U \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] & \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S^{\\prime}\\left[\\Psi^{\\prime}, \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{\\prime}\\right] \\supseteq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(2^{D_{W^{\\prime}}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W^{\\prime}}} \\cdot g^{\\prime} \\cdot(n-s)}{q \\cdot \\lambda^{*}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}}{2 D_{W^{\\prime}}}} \\\\\n& =\\left(2^{D_{W^{\\prime}}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W^{\\prime}}} \\cdot b^{2} \\cdot g \\cdot(n-s)}{q \\cdot \\lambda^{*}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}}{2 D_{W^{\\prime}}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPutting it All Together - Probability of $S_{n}=\\{0\\}$\nRecall that because $U \\subsetneq W$ and because $U$ is a non-trivial subspace, $D_{W}>1$ holds. Eqs. (39) and (45) yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\leq & \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\cap U \\neq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right]+ \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\nsubseteq U \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n\\leq & \\left(2^{D_{U}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{U}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q\\left(\\lambda^{*}-1\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}-1}{2 D_{U}}} \\\\\n& \\left(2^{D_{W^{\\prime}}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2\\left(D_{W^{\\prime}}+1\\right)} \\cdot g \\cdot(n-s)}{q \\cdot \\lambda^{*}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}}{2 D_{W^{\\prime}}}} \\\\\n\\leq & \\left(2^{D_{W}}-2\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q\\left(\\lambda^{*}-1\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda^{*}-1}{2 D_{W}}} \\\\\n\\leq & \\left(2^{D_{W}}-2\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q \\cdot \\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 D_{W}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe second last inequality is true because $D_{W^{\\prime}}<D_{W}, D_{U}<D_{W}$ are true, and the last inequality is true by Eq. (36).\n\nRecall that Eq. (38) yields an upper bound on $\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[\\overline{F^{\\prime}}\\right]$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\}\\right] & \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[\\overline{F^{\\prime}} \\wedge S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\}\\right]+\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\} \\wedge F^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[\\overline{F^{\\prime}}\\right]+\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[F^{\\prime}\\right] \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[\\overline{F^{\\prime}}\\right]+\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\left[S_{n} \\neq\\{0\\} \\mid F^{\\prime}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot D_{W}^{2} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q \\cdot \\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 D_{W}}}+\\left(2^{D_{W}}-2\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q \\cdot \\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 D_{W}}} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(2^{D_{W}}-1\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{4 e \\cdot b^{2 D_{W}} \\cdot g \\cdot n}{q \\cdot \\lambda}\\right)^{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 D_{W}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich yields the lemma.",

      "text": "# A Random Code Models\n## A. 1 Models of Random Linear Codes\n\nIn this work, a random linear code of rate $R$ is the kernel $\\mathcal{C}$ of a uniformly random matrix $P \\in$ $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{(n-k) \\times n}$. We note that if $P$ happens not to have full rank, the code $\\mathcal{C}$ would have rate larger than $R$. An arguably more accurate way to interpret the notion of random linear code is to sample a code $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ uniformly at random from among all linear subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ of dimension $R n$. However, the former model is usually nicer to work with because it satisfies the elegant Lemma 4.1. We justify our use of the former model rather than the latter by the following observation.\n\nLemma A.1. Write $k=R n$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the kernel of a uniformly random matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{(n-k) \\times n}$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a uniformly random subspace of $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ of dimension $k$. Then, the statistical difference between $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ is at most $1-e^{-q^{-R n} \\cdot n}$.\n\nProof. It is a well known fact that $P$ has full rank with probability\n\n$$\n\\prod_{i=k+1}^{n}\\left(1-q^{-i}\\right) \\geq\\left(1-q^{-k}\\right)^{n} \\geq e^{-q^{-R n} \\cdot n}\n$$\n\nThe lemma follows since, conditioned on $P$ having full rank, $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ have the same distribution.",

      "text": "## A. 2 Models of Random RS Codes\n\nFor us, a random RS code is a code $\\mathcal{C}=\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) ; k\\right)$ where $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}$ are sampled independently and uniformly from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Consider now the random code $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{RS}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q}}\\left(\\left(\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n}\\right) ; k\\right)$ where $\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n}$ are sampled uniformly from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ without repetitions. While we have chosen to work with the former model out of convenience, we show that our results about list-decodability and list-recoverability essentially apply to the latter model as well. In fact, any result about the geometry of $\\mathcal{C}$ also holds approximately for $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$. This is due to the following lemma, which gives a coupling between the two models such that there exists an approximately distance preserving map between the two, provided that $\\frac{n}{q}$ is small enough.\nLemma A.2. Write $k=R n$. Then, exists a coupling $\\left(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ is a random $R S$ code of dimension $k$ and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ is a random $R S$ code of dimension $k$ without repetitions, such that there exists a linear bijection $\\varphi: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ with\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\max _{x \\in \\mathcal{C}}\\{\\operatorname{wt}(x-\\varphi(x))\\} \\geq n-q\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right) \\cdot(1-\\delta)\\right] \\leq\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\delta}}{(1-\\delta)^{1-\\delta}}\\right)^{q\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $0<\\delta<1$.\nProof. Sample $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}$ uniformly and independently at random from $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Let\n\n$$\nI=\\left\\{i \\in[n] \\mid \\exists j<i \\quad \\alpha_{i}=\\alpha_{j}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSample $\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n}$ as follows: For each $i \\in[n] \\backslash I$, take $\\beta_{i}=\\alpha_{i}$. Then, sample $\\beta_{i}$ for all $i \\in I$ to complete the sequence in a uniform repetition-less manner.\n\nLet $\\varphi: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ map $\\left(Q\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right), \\ldots, Q\\left(\\alpha_{n}\\right)\\right)$ to $\\left(Q\\left(\\beta_{1}\\right), \\ldots, Q\\left(\\beta_{n}\\right)\\right)$ for every $Q \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]$ with $\\operatorname{deg} Q \\leq k$. Clearly, $\\operatorname{wt}(x-\\varphi(x)) \\leq|I|$ for each $x \\in \\mathcal{C}$. Hence, to prove the lemma it suffices to give a probabilistic upper bound on $|I|$.\n\nConsider a balls and bin scenario in which $n$ balls are each thrown into one of $q$ bins with uniform probability. Let $X$ denote the number of non-empty bins. Note that $|I|$ is distributed identically to $n-X$. Let $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{q}$ be variables such that $X_{i}$ takes 1 if the $i$-th bin is full, and 0 if it is empty. Note that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{i}\\right]=1-\\left(1-\\frac{1}{q}\\right)^{n} \\geq 1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[X] \\geq q \\cdot\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right)$.\n\nObserve that $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{q}$ are in negative association (see [Waj17]). Indeed, by [Waj17, Theorem 10], the occupancy numbers, indicating the number of balls in each bin, are in negative association. Since $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{q}$ are monotone-increasing functions of the occupancy numbers, the relevant closure property [Waj17, Lemma 9], implies that $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{q}$ are also negatively associated. Thus, a Chernoff-Hoeffding bound [Waj17, Theorem 5] applies to their sum. Thus,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[|I| \\geq n-q\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right) \\cdot(1-\\delta)\\right]=\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X \\leq q\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right) \\cdot(1-\\delta)\\right] \\leq\\left(\\frac{e^{-\\delta}}{(1-\\delta)^{1-\\delta}}\\right)^{q\\left(1-e^{-\\frac{n}{q}}\\right)}\n$$",

  "abstract": "We establish an equivalence between two important random ensembles of linear\ncodes: random linear codes (RLCs) and random Reed-Solomon (RS) codes.\nSpecifically, we show that these models exhibit identical behavior with respect\nto key combinatorial properties -- such as list-decodability and\nlist-recoverability -- when the alphabet size is sufficiently large.\n  We introduce monotone-decreasing local coordinate-wise linear (LCL)\nproperties, a new class of properties tailored for the large alphabet regime.\nThis class encompasses list-decodability, list-recoverability, and their\naverage-weight variants. We develop a framework for analyzing these properties\nand prove a threshold theorem for RLCs: for any LCL property ${P}$, there\nexists a threshold rate $R_{P}$ such that RLCs are likely to satisfy ${P}$ when\n$R < R_{P}$ and unlikely to do so when $R > R_{P}$. We extend this threshold\ntheorem to random RS codes and show that they share the same threshold $ R_{P}\n$, thereby establishing the equivalence between the two ensembles and enabling\na unified analysis of list-recoverability and related properties.\n  Applying our framework, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability,\nproving that both random RS codes and RLCs achieve the generalized Singleton\nbound. This recovers a recent result of Alrabiah, Guruswami, and Li (2023) via\nelementary methods. Additionally, we prove an upper bound on the\nlist-recoverability threshold and conjecture that this bound is tight.\n  Our approach suggests a plausible pathway for proving this conjecture and\nthereby pinpointing the list-recoverability parameters of both models. Indeed,\nfollowing the release of a prior version of this paper, Li and Shagrithaya\n(2025) used our equivalence theorem to show that random RS codes are\nnear-optimally list-recoverable.",
