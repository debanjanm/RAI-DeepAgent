INTRODUCTION\n\nGiven a smooth Riemannian $(n+1)$-manifold with boundary $\\left(X^{n+1}, h\\right)$, functions $\\sigma \\in$ $C^{1}(\\partial X)$ satisfying $\\sigma \\in(-1,1)$ and $g \\in C^{1}(X)$, and an open subset $E \\subset X$, the Gauss' free energy is\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}(E)=\\mathscr{H}^{n}\\left(\\partial^{*} E \\cap \\hat{X}\\right)-\\int_{\\partial^{*} E \\cap \\partial X} \\sigma(x) d \\mathscr{H}^{n}+\\int_{E} g(x) d x\n$$\n\nStationary points (subject to a volume contraint) to the Gauss' free energy model the equilibrium state of incompressible fluids. Indeed, letting $X$ be the container and $E$ the portion of the fluid, the three terms in (1.1) represent the free surface energy (proportional\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (C) Otis Chodosh, Nick Edelen, and Chao Li\n    (C) (1) Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY).\n\nto area of the separating surface), the wetting energy (modeling the adhesion of the fluid with the wall of the container), and the gravitational energy, respectively. The interface, $M=\\partial E \\cap \\hat{X}$, is usually called a capillary surface. Formally, if $E$ is a stationary point of $\\mathscr{A}$, then the capillary surface $M$ should have prescribed mean curvature $g$ and boundary contact angle $\\cos ^{-1}(\\sigma)$. However, it is well-known that minimizers of $\\mathscr{A}$ may have a singular set. The main result of this paper gives improved bounds for the size of this singular set.\n\nTheorem 1.1. There exist $\\varepsilon_{0}, \\varepsilon_{1}>0$ such that the following holds. Let $\\left(X^{n+1}, h\\right)$ be a smooth manifold with boundary, $\\sigma \\in C^{1}(\\partial X),-1<\\sigma<1$, and $g \\in C^{1}(X)$. Suppose that $E \\subset X$ is a Caccioppoli set that minimizes (1.1). Then $M=\\operatorname{spt}(\\partial E \\cap \\hat{X})$ is a smooth hypersurface of $M$ away from a closed set $\\operatorname{sing}(M)$.\n(1) We always have that $\\operatorname{dim}(\\operatorname{sing}(M) \\cap \\partial X) \\leqslant n-4$;\n(2) Let $S_{1}=\\left\\{x \\in \\partial X: \\sigma(x) \\in\\left(-1,-1+\\varepsilon_{0}\\right) \\cup\\left(1-\\varepsilon_{0}, 1\\right)\\right\\}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\operatorname{sing}(M) \\cap S_{1}\\right) \\leqslant n-5\n$$\n\n(3) Let $S_{2}=\\left\\{x \\in \\partial X: \\sigma(x) \\in\\left(-\\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{1}\\right)\\right\\}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\operatorname{sing}(M) \\cap S_{2}\\right) \\leqslant n-7\n$$\n\nPreviously, the best known partial regularity, $\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{sing}(M) \\leqslant n-3$, was proven by Taylor in [26]. This was extended to the anisotropic case (extending the free surface energy to an elliptic integral depending on the surface unit normal) by De Philippis-Maggi in [10]. When $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the surface $M$ is usually called a free-boundary minimal surface, and satisfies the sharp estimate $\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{sing}(M) \\leqslant n-7$ by Gr\u00fcter-Jost [16]. Capillary surfaces have shown potential applications in comparison geometry (see, e.g. [19, 20]), where a major stumbling block was the lack a satisfactory boundary regularity in the form of Theorem 1.1.\n\nBy the $\\varepsilon$-regularity and compactness theorems due to De Philippis-Maggi [10], the monotonicity formula of Kagaya-Tonegawa [18] (see also [9]), and Federer's dimension reduction, Theorem 1.1 follows from the classification of capillary minimizing cones with an isolated singularity. Thus, for every open set $U \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$, let us consider the functional (recall that $\\cos \\theta=\\sigma$ by the first variation)\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}_{U}^{\\theta}(\\Omega)=\\left|\\partial^{*} \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1} \\cap U\\right|-\\cos \\theta\\left|\\partial^{*} \\Omega \\cap \\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1} \\cap U\\right|\n$$\n\nWe denote $\\mathscr{A}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n+1}}^{\\theta}$ simply by $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$, where $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}=\\left\\{x_{1}>0\\right\\}$ is an open half space. We say that a Cacciopolli set $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ minimizes $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$, if for every pre-compact open set $U \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}_{U}^{\\theta}(\\Omega) \\leqslant \\mathscr{A}_{U}^{\\theta}\\left(\\Omega^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor every Cacciopolli set $\\Omega^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ such that $\\Omega \\Delta \\Omega^{\\prime}$ is compactly contained in $U$.\nTheorem 1.1 is thus a consequence of the following classification result for cones.\nTheorem 1.2. There exist $\\theta_{0}, \\theta_{1}>0$ such that the following holds. Let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ be a minimizing cone for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ and $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Assume that $M$ is smooth away from 0 . Suppose one of the following holds:\n(1) $n \\leqslant 3$;\n\n(2) $n=4, \\theta \\in\\left(0, \\theta_{0}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\pi-\\theta_{0}, \\pi\\right)$;\n(3) $4 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 6, \\theta \\in\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_{1}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\theta_{1}\\right)$.\n\nThen $M$ is flat.\nSince any $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$-minimizer $\\Omega$ gives a $\\mathscr{A}^{\\pi-\\theta}$-minimizer $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1} \\backslash \\Omega$, we may, without loss of generality, assume that $\\theta \\in\\left(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$. With this in mind, each of the three cases in Theorem 1.2 is treated differently. Case (1) follows from an Almgren-type argument as in [1] by analyzing the stability inequality on the spherical link $\\Sigma=M \\cap S^{n}(1)$, and a topological classification result for embedded capillary disks analogous to Fraser-Schoen [15] in the freeboundary case. Case (3) is analogous to the previous work by Li-Zhou-Zhu on the stable Bernstein theorem for capillary surfaces [21, Appendix C], which follows from a careful Simons-type computation as in [25], extending the one for stable free-boundary minimal hypersurfaces.\n1.1. Relationship with one-phase free boundary problem. The most interesting part of Theorem 1.2 is Case (2), and it relies on a novel application of the connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem. To motivate the discussion, let us assume, for simplicity, that $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}=\\left\\{x_{1}>0\\right\\}$, and $M$ is contained in the graph over the $x_{1}$-direction of a Lipschitz function $u$ - i.e. there exists $u \\in \\operatorname{Lip}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}=\\left\\{x_{1}=0\\right\\}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\nM=\\left\\{\\left(u\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right), x^{\\prime}\\right): x^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n}, u\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nhere $x^{\\prime}=\\left(x_{2}, \\cdots, x_{n}\\right)$. Set $v=\\frac{u}{\\tan \\theta}$. Assuming that $|\\operatorname{Lip}(v)|$ is uniformly bounded as $\\theta \\rightarrow 0$, we compute that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}(\\Omega) & =\\int_{\\{u>0\\} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n}}\\left(\\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta 1_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right) d x^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\{u>0\\}}\\left(\\sqrt{1+\\tan ^{2} \\theta|D v|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta 1_{\\{v>0\\}}\\right) d x^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\{u>0\\}}\\left((1-\\cos \\theta) 1_{\\{v>0\\}}+\\frac{1}{2} \\tan ^{2} \\theta|D v|^{2}+O\\left(\\theta^{3}\\right)\\right) d x^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\tan ^{2} \\theta \\int_{\\{u>0\\}}\\left(|D v|^{2}+1_{\\{v>0\\}}+O(\\theta)\\right) d x^{\\prime}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, as $\\theta \\rightarrow 0, v=\\frac{u}{\\tan \\theta}$ should be an one-homogeneous minimizer of the functional\n\n$$\nJ(v)=\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}\\left(|D v|^{2}+1_{\\{v>0\\}}\\right) d x^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThe functional (1.3) is the well-known one-phase Alt-Caffarelli functional, and the above argument shows heuristically that $J$ should be the linearization of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ as $\\theta \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nThere is a vast literature concerning regularity of minimizers of the Alt-Caffarelli functional; see, for example, [2], [6], [17], [27]. We also refer the readers to the book by CaffarelliSalsa [7] for an excellent expository of the problem. We note that the idea of $J$ being the linearization of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ is well-known to the experts (see e.g. [4, 14] and [13, Section 5]), but\n\nthis seems the first time that the fine approximation (1.2) has been rigorously established and used to deduce geometric consequences.\nTheorem 1.3. Let $\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow 0+, \\Omega_{i}$ be a sequence of cones minimizing $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{i}}$ with an isolated singularity at 0 , and $M_{i}=\\partial \\Omega_{i} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Then for $i$ sufficiently large, $M_{i}$ is contained in the graph of a Lipschitz function $u_{i}$ over $\\mathbf{R}^{n}=\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Moreover, up to a subsequence, $\\left\\{\\frac{u_{i}}{\\tan \\theta_{i}}\\right\\}$ converges in $\\left(W_{l o c}^{1,2} \\cap C^{\\alpha}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ to an one-homogeneous minimizer $v$ to the Alt-Caffarelli functional J for all $\\alpha \\in\\{0,1\\}$, and the free-boundaries $\\partial\\left\\{u_{i}>0\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\partial\\{v>0\\}$ in the local Hausdorff distance.\n\nTherefore a smooth (away from 0 ) capillary cone with small angle has a fine approximation in by 1-homogenous minimizers to $J$. Additionally, in low dimensions (e.g. $n \\leqslant 4$ by $\\{6,17\\}\\}$ ), it is known that an one-homogeneous minimizer to (1.3) is $(x \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_{+}$for some unit vector $\\mathbf{n}$. In this case, we show that the improved convergence\n\n$$\n\\frac{u_{i}}{\\tan \\theta_{i}} \\rightarrow v\n$$\n\nholds actually in $C^{2}$ away from the origin. We use this to prove case (2) of Theorem 1.2. More generally, we have the following result.\nTheorem 1.4. Let $n \\geqslant 2$. Assume that the only one-homogeneous minimizers of $J$ on $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ are given by $(x \\cdot \\mathbf{n})_{+}$for some unit vector $\\mathbf{n}$. Then there exists $\\theta_{0}=\\theta_{0}(n)>0$, such that any minimizing cone for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ with an isolated singularity at 0 is flat.\n1.2. Organization. In Section 2 we recall some preliminaries for capillary surfaces, minimal cones in the Euclidean space and the Alt-Caffarelli functional. In Section 3 we prove case (1) of Theorem 1.2. We carry out the rigorous relation between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem in Section 4, and prove case (2) of Theorem 1.2. Finally, we prove case (3) of Theorem 1.2 in Section 5.\n1.3. Acknowledgements.

We take $(X, h)$ to be a smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary, $E \\subset X$ an open set with $M=\\partial E \\subset \\hat{X}$ smooth.

First and second variation of capillary functional. Say $E$ is stationary for the capillary functional (1.1), if $\\left.\\frac{d}{d t}\\right|_{t=0} \\mathscr{A}\\left(E_{t}\\right) \\geqslant 0$ for all variations $E_{t}$. Take $M=\\partial E \\cap \\hat{X}$.

If $U=\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ we will simply write $J_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}=J$, and call any minimizer of $J_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}$ an entire minimizer of $J$.\n\nWe require the following basic fact.\nLemma 2.1.

The lower bound follow from [2, Corollary 3.6], and the sharp upper bound is a consequence of the estimate $|D u| \\leqslant 1$ (see, e.g. [17, Section 2.2]).\n\nWe will also make important use of the classification of entire minimizers.\nTheorem 2.2 ([17]).

By [15, Theorem 2.2], we have that $\\phi$ is a holomorphic function in $D$. Now consider the boundary behavior of $\\phi$. For this, take $(r, \\theta)$ the polar coordinates on $D$, so that $z=r e^{i \\theta}$. Set $w=\\log z=\\log r+i \\theta$.

Without loss of generality (by replacing $W$ by a compact set containing it), we can assume that $W=\\pi^{-1}\\left(W_{0}\\right) \\cap B_{r}$ for $W_{0} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ and $r<1$. Since $M \\equiv \\partial \\Omega \\cap B_{1} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is a smooth minimal hypersurface and (by the maximum principle) meets $\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ only at $\\partial M$, there is an $\\varepsilon>0$ so that\n\n$$\nd\\left(x, \\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}\\right) \\geqslant 2 \\varepsilon \\quad \\forall x \\in \\partial \\Omega \\cap W\n$$\n\nDefine the piecewise linear map $p_{\\varepsilon}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n+1}\\right)=\\left(\\max \\left\\{x_{1}, \\varepsilon\\right\\}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n+1}\\right)$, and define $F_{\\varepsilon}=F \\cup\\left(\\left\\{x_{1}>\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{1}\\right)$. We have $\\partial^{*} F_{\\varepsilon}=p_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\partial^{*} F\\right)$ and $p_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\partial^{*} F\\right) \\cap W=p_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\partial^{*} F \\cap W\\right)$, and so since $\\operatorname{Lip}\\left(p_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\leqslant 1$ we get the inequality $\\left|\\partial^{*} F_{\\varepsilon} \\cap W\\right| \\leqslant\\left|\\partial^{*} F \\cap W\\right|$. From (4.1) we have $F_{\\varepsilon} \\Delta \\Omega \\subset \\subset W \\cap\\left\\{x_{1}>0\\right\\}$. Therefore if we set $\\Omega^{\\prime}=F_{\\varepsilon} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ we can make the comparison $\\mathscr{A}_{W}^{\\theta}(\\Omega) \\leqslant \\mathscr{A}_{W}^{\\theta}\\left(\\Omega^{\\prime}\\right)$. But since $\\partial^{*} \\Omega^{\\prime} \\cap \\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}=\\partial^{*} \\Omega \\cap \\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$, we can deduce the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\left|\\partial^{*} E \\cap W\\right|=\\left|\\partial^{*} \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1} \\cap W\\right| \\leqslant\\left|\\partial^{*} \\Omega^{\\prime} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1} \\cap W\\right|=\\left|\\partial^{*} F_{\\varepsilon} \\cap W\\right| \\leqslant\\left|\\partial^{*} F \\cap W\\right|\n$$\n\nWe next recall the following application of the Allard regularity theorem.\nTheorem 4.4. There is an $\\varepsilon_{1}(n)$ such that the following holds. Let $T=\\partial\\{E\\}$ be a massminimizing boundary in $B_{r}$ such that\n\n$$\n0 \\in \\operatorname{spt} T, \\quad \\sup _{\\operatorname{spt} T \\cap B_{r}} r^{-1}\\left|x_{1}\\right|<\\varepsilon \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{1}\n$$\n\nThen $\\operatorname{spt} T \\cap B_{r / 2}=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ for some $C^{2}$ function $u$ with the estimate\n\n$$\nr\\left|D^{2} u\\right|+|D u|+r^{-1}|u| \\leqslant c_{1}(n) \\varepsilon, \\quad \\text { in } B_{r / 2}\n$$\n\nProof. The estimate is scaling invariant so we assume $r=1$ without loss of generality. Assume the Proposition fails: then for any predetermined $c(n)$, there exists a sequence of mass-minimizing boundaries $T_{j}=\\partial\\left\\{E_{j}\\right\\}$ and numbers $\\varepsilon_{j} \\rightarrow 0$, so that $0 \\in \\operatorname{spt} T_{j}$ and $\\sup _{\\operatorname{spt} T_{j} \\cap B_{1}}\\left|x_{1}\\right| \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{j}$, but $\\operatorname{spt} T_{j} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$ is not the graph of a $C^{2}$ function over $\\left\\{x_{1}=0\\right\\}$ satisfying $|u|_{C^{2}} \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon_{j}$.\n\nPassing to a subsequence, by compactness of mass-minimizing boundaries we can assume $E_{j} \\rightarrow E$ and $T_{j} \\rightarrow T=\\partial\\{E\\}$ for some mass-minimizing boundary $T$. However our contradiction hypothesis implies $0 \\in \\operatorname{spt} T$ and $\\operatorname{spt} T \\subset\\left\\{x_{1}=0\\right\\}$. Therefore we must have $T= \\pm \\partial\\left\\{\\left\\{x_{1}<0\\right\\}\\right\\}$, and hence $T_{j} \\rightarrow\\left\\{\\left\\{x_{1}=0\\right\\}\\right\\}$ with multiplicity-one. Allard's them implies that for $j \\gg 1$, $\\operatorname{spt} T_{j} \\cap B_{1 / 2}=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ with $|u|_{C^{2}} \\leqslant c(n) \\sup _{\\operatorname{spt} T_{j} \\cap B_{3 / 4}}\\left|x_{1}\\right| \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon_{j}$, which is a contradiction.\n\nWe recall the Harnack inequality for harmonic functions on mass-minimizing boundaries by Bombieri-Guisti [3].\n\nTheorem 4.5 ([3, Theorem 5]). Let $T=\\partial\\{E\\}$ be a mass-minimizing boundary in $B_{1}^{n+1}$. There are constants $\\sigma(n) \\in(0,1), c_{2}(n)$ such that if $u \\in C^{1}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\int \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\phi d \\mu_{T}=0, \\quad \\forall \\phi \\in C_{0}^{1}\\left(B_{1}\\right), u>0 \\text { on } \\operatorname{spt} T\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\operatorname{spt} T \\cap B_{\\sigma}} u \\leqslant c_{2} \\inf _{T \\cap B_{\\sigma}} u\n$$\n\nRemark 4.6. It would be interesting to prove a version of Theorem 4.5 on the reduced boundary of a capillary minimizer, which holds up to the boundary (cf. [11]). This would simplify the arguments below.\n\nOur final preliminary lemma rules out a minimizer $\\Omega$ of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ having large pieces that stay too close to the boundary.\n\nLemma 4.7. There is $\\varepsilon_{3}(n)>0$ so that the following holds. Let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ be a minimizer for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in $B_{1}$, and $u: B_{1}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ a non-negative Lipschitz function. Suppose either: $\\Omega \\cap B_{1}=$ $\\left\\{x \\in B_{1}: 0<x_{1}<u(\\pi(x))\\right\\}$ and $\\sup _{B_{1 / 2}^{n}} u \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{3} \\theta$; or $\\Omega \\cap B_{1}=\\left\\{x \\in B_{1}: u(\\pi(x))<x_{1}\\right\\}$ and $\\sup _{B_{1 / 2}^{n}} u \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{3}$. Then $u \\equiv 0$ in $B_{1 / 4}^{n}$.\nProof. By allowing for $\\theta \\in(0, \\pi)$ in the below proof, and replacing $\\Omega$ with $B_{1} \\backslash \\Omega, \\theta$ with $\\pi-\\theta$ as necesary, there will be no loss of generality in assuming we are in the first case. We loosely follow the ideas of $\\{2$, Lemma 3.4$\\}$. Let $\\phi(r=|x|)$ be the graphing function of the upper half of the standard catenoid, defined on $\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n}:|x|>1\\right\\}$. Standard estimates (e.g. $\\{23\\})$ imply that as $r \\rightarrow \\infty$,\n\n$$\n\\phi(r)= \\begin{cases}a \\log (r)+O(1) & n=2 \\\\ b_{n}-d_{n} r^{2-n}+O\\left(r^{1-n}\\right) & n \\geqslant 3\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nfor some constants $a, b_{n}, d_{n}>0$. Choose $\\lambda(n, \\varepsilon, \\theta), \\mu(n, \\varepsilon, \\theta)>0$ (and ensure $\\varepsilon(n)$ is small) so that if\n\n$$\nv=\\max \\{\\lambda \\phi(|x| / \\lambda)-\\mu, 0\\}\n$$\n\nthen $v(r=1 / 4)=0$ and $v(r=1 / 2)=2 \\varepsilon \\theta$. We note it then follows from our choice of $\\lambda$, the structure of $\\phi$ and the smallness of $\\varepsilon(n)$ that $\\left|\\partial_{r} v\\right|_{r=1 / 4} \\mid \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon \\theta$.\n\nThe graph of $v$ is a scaled and translated portion of the catenoid. Write $v$ for the unit normal vector of $\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(v)$ such that $v \\cdot e_{1}>0$, and extend $v$ to be defined on all of $\\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ so it is constant in the $x_{1}$ direction. A standard computation shows that in $\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}:|\\pi(x)| \\geqslant\\right.$ $1 / 4\\}$, the $n$-form $\\omega:= \\star v$ is a calibration for $\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(v)$. Let us define the hypersurface\n\n$$\nS=\\left\\{x=\\left(x_{1}, x^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}^{n}:\\left|x^{\\prime}\\right|=1 / 4 \\text { and } 0<x_{1}<u\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nendowed with the inward-pointing orientation, and define the cylinder\n\n$$\nU=\\left\\{x=\\left(x_{1}, x^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}^{n}: u\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)>v\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\text { and } x^{\\prime} \\in B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\backslash B_{1 / 4}^{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nso that, because $v>u$ on $\\partial B_{1 / 2}^{n}$,\n\n$$\n\\partial U=\\left\\{\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u) \\cap U\\right\\}-\\left\\{\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(v) \\cap U\\right\\}+S\n$$\n\n(here we equip the graphs with an orientation so its unit normal vectors point into positive $x_{1}$ direction). Now since $\\min (u, v)$ is a Lipschitz function which agrees with $u$ along $\\partial B_{1 / 2}^{n}$, we can make the comparison\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}(\\Omega) \\leqslant \\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}\\left(\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\min \\left(u(\\pi(x)), v(\\pi(x))\\right)\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nand thereby compute:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{B_{1 / 4}^{n} \\cap(u>0]} \\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta d x \\leqslant \\int_{\\{u>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\backslash B_{1 / 4}^{n}} \\sqrt{1+|D \\min (u, v)|^{2}}-\\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}} d x \\\\\n& =\\mathscr{H}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(v) \\cap U\\right)-\\mathscr{H}^{n}\\left(\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u) \\cap U\\right) \\leqslant \\int_{\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(v) \\cap U} \\omega-\\int_{\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u) \\cap U} \\omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\int_{S} \\omega=\\int_{\\partial B_{1 / 4}^{n}} \\frac{\\partial_{r} v}{\\sqrt{1+|D v|^{2}}} u \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon \\theta \\int_{\\partial B_{1 / 4}^{n}} u\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, we claim we have the estimate\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial B_{1 / 4}^{n}} u \\leqslant c(n) \\theta^{-1} \\int_{B_{1 / 4}^{n} \\cap(u>0)} \\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta d x\n$$\n\nCombining (4.2) with (4.3) will give $\\int_{\\partial B_{1 / 4}^{n}} u=0$ provided $\\varepsilon(n)$ is sufficiently small, which by a trivial comparison argument implies $u=0$ on $B_{1 / 4}$.\n\nTo prove (4.3), we break into two cases. For $\\theta \\in[0, \\pi / 2]$, we first note that we have the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}}-|D u| \\theta-1 & \\geqslant \\sqrt{4-\\theta^{2}}-1 \\\\\n& \\geqslant 1-\\theta^{2} / 3 \\\\\n& \\geqslant 1-\\theta^{2} / 2+\\theta^{4} / 24 \\\\\n& \\geqslant \\cos \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first inequality follows by considering the minimum of the function $t \\mapsto 2 \\sqrt{1+t^{2}}-$ $t \\theta-1$ on $\\{t \\geqslant 0\\}$; the second and the third hold for $\\theta \\in\\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$ by elementary algebra; the fourth holds by the Taylor remainder theorem.\n\nNow using the trace inequality, then our bound $|u| \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\theta$, and then the above inequality, we can estimate\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\partial B_{1 / 4}^{n}} u & \\leqslant c(n) \\int_{B_{1 / 4}^{n}}(|D u|+u) d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant c(n) \\theta^{-1} \\int_{\\{u>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 4}^{n}}(|D u| \\theta+1-\\cos \\theta) d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant 2 c(n) \\theta^{-1} \\int_{\\{u>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 4}^{n}}\\left(\\sqrt{1+|D u|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta\\right) d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis proves the assertion when $\\theta \\in[0, \\pi / 2]$. When $\\theta \\in[\\pi / 2, \\pi]$, then we can obtain the last two inequalities by the fact $\\cos \\theta \\leqslant 0$ and the inequality $t+1 \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{t^{2}+1}$. This proves the Lemma.\n4.2. Inhomogenous blow-up to Alt-Caffarelli. We show here that capillary minimizers of small angle with good a priori estimates near the boundary are graphical, and that the graphing function looks close to a minimizer of the Alt-Caffarelli energy at the scale of the angle. We first prove that non-degeneracy estimates (4.4) near the boundary can be extended to graphical estimates at both near and far from the boundary. In Section 4.3, we shall prove using a bootstrap-type argument that estimates like (4.4) hold in a neighborhood of uniform size.\n\nLemma 4.8 (Graphical propogation). Given $\\gamma>0$, there exists $\\theta_{0}, \\varepsilon, c$ positive and depending only on $(n, \\gamma)$ so that the following holds. Suppose $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is a smooth minimizer for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in $B_{1}$ for some $\\theta \\leqslant \\theta_{0}$, and let $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Assume that $0 \\in \\partial M$, and\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 c_{0}} \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M) \\leqslant x_{1} \\leqslant 2 \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M)\n$$\n\nfor all $x \\in M \\cap B_{\\gamma}(\\partial M)$, where $c_{0}$ as in Lemma 2.1.\nThen there exists a Lipschitz function $u: B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ and so that the following holds:\n(1) $\\Omega=\\left\\{x: 0<x_{1}<u(\\pi(x))\\right\\} \\mathscr{L}^{n+1}$-a.e. in $\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$;\n(2) $M=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ in $\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$;\n(3) $\\partial M=\\partial\\{u>0\\}$ in $B_{1 / 2}^{n}$;\n(4) $\\operatorname{Lip}(u) \\leqslant c \\tan \\theta$.\n(5) for every $z \\in B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\cap\\{u>0\\}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c} \\tan \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\}) \\leqslant u(z) \\leqslant c \\tan \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\})\n$$\n\nRemark 4.9. If $\\Omega$ is smooth, then assumptions (4.4) will always hold for some $\\gamma$.\nProof. Let $\\varepsilon_{1}, c_{1}$ be the constants from Theorem 4.4, $\\sigma, c_{2}$ be the constants from Theorem 4.5, and $\\varepsilon_{3}$ the constant from Lemma 4.7. Define\n\n$$\n\\rho=\\frac{\\sigma \\gamma}{8}, \\quad K=\\frac{c_{0} c_{2}^{\\lceil 1 / \\rho\\rceil}}{\\rho}, \\quad \\varepsilon=\\frac{4 \\varepsilon_{1}}{K}, \\quad \\tan \\theta_{0}=\\frac{\\rho}{100 c_{1} c_{2} K} \\min \\left\\{\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{3}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHere $\\lceil 1 / \\rho\\rceil$ is the smallest integer that is larger than or equal to $1 / \\rho$. We claim that\n\n$$\nM \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{3 / 4} \\backslash B_{\\gamma / 4}(\\partial M) \\subset\\left\\{\\tan \\theta / K<x_{1}<K \\tan \\theta\\right\\}\n$$\n\nBy our choice of constants, and since $0 \\in \\partial M$, to prove (4.7), it will suffice to prove by induction that for $N=0,1,2, \\ldots,\\lceil 1 / \\rho\\rceil$, we have the inclusion\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& M \\cap\\{\\gamma / 4<d(x, \\partial M)<\\gamma / 2+N \\rho\\} \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<4 \\varepsilon_{1} \\rho / c_{2}^{N}\\right\\} \\cap B_{3 / 4} \\\\\n& \\quad \\subset\\left\\{\\left(\\gamma / 8 c_{0}\\right) \\tan \\theta / c_{2}^{N}<x_{1}<2 \\gamma c_{2}^{N} \\tan \\theta\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhen $N=0$ then (4.8) trivially holds by our hypothesis (4.4). Let $N \\geqslant 1$, and suppose by inductive hypothesis (4.8) holds with $N-1$ in place of $N$. Take $y \\in \\mathbf{R}^{n} \\cap \\partial B_{\\gamma / 2+(N-1) \\rho}(\\partial M) \\cap$ $B_{3 / 4}$, and consider the ball $B_{4 \\rho}(y)$. In $B_{4 \\rho / \\sigma}(y), M$ is a minimizing boundary. If $M \\cap$ $B_{4 \\rho}(y) \\cap B_{4 \\varepsilon_{1} \\rho / c_{2}^{N}}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing$, then by Theorem 4.5 (with $u(x)=x_{1}$ ) we must have $M \\cap B_{4 \\rho}(y) \\subset$ $B_{4 \\varepsilon_{1} \\rho / c_{2}^{N-1}}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$, and hence by Theorem $4.4 M \\cap B_{2 \\rho}(y)=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ for some smooth function $u$ satisfying $|u| \\leqslant 4 \\varepsilon_{1} \\rho / c_{2}^{N-1}$.\n\nIn particular, there is a point $z \\in M \\cap B_{2 \\rho}(y) \\cap B_{\\gamma / 2+(N-1) \\rho}(\\partial M) \\cap B_{4 \\varepsilon_{1} \\rho / c_{2}^{N-1}}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$, which by our inductive hypothesis satisfies $\\left(\\gamma / 8 c_{0}\\right) \\tan \\theta / c_{2}^{N-1}<z_{1}<2 \\gamma c_{2}^{N-1} \\tan \\theta$. Using Theorem 4.5 again, we deduce $M \\cap B_{2 \\rho}(y) \\cap B_{4 \\varepsilon_{2} \\rho / c_{2}^{N}}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{\\left(\\gamma / 8 c_{0}\\right) \\tan \\theta / c_{2}^{N}<x_{1}<2 \\gamma c_{2}^{N} \\tan \\theta\\right\\}$. Repeating this argument for every admissible $y$ proves (4.8), and hence (4.7) follows by induction.\n\nLet $M^{\\prime}=M \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\}$. Given $y=\\left(y_{1}, y^{\\prime}\\right) \\in M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{3 / 4}$ take $r=\\min \\left\\{d\\left(y^{\\prime}, \\partial M\\right) / 16, \\rho\\right\\}$, and note that by (4.4), (4.7), (4.6) we have\n\n$$\ny_{1} \\leqslant(K / \\rho) \\tan \\theta r \\leqslant \\frac{\\min \\left\\{\\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{3}\\right\\}}{100 c_{1} c_{2}} r \\leqslant r / 100\n$$\n\nso that in particular we have $y \\in M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{r / 4}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$. By Theorem 4.5, we have $M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{4 r}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{x_{1}<\\right.$ $c_{2}(K / \\rho) \\tan \\theta r\\}$, and so by (4.9) and Theorem $4.4 M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{2 r}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ for $u: B_{r}^{n}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow$\n\n$\\mathbf{R}$ a smooth function satisfying\n\n$$\nr^{-1}|u|+|D u| \\leqslant c_{1} c_{2}(K / \\rho) \\tan \\theta\n$$\n\nBy our choice of $\\theta_{0}$, Lemma 4.7 then implies that\n\n$$\n\\Omega \\cap B_{r / 2}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left\\{x \\in B_{r / 2}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right): 0<x_{1}<u(\\pi(x))\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFrom (4.10), we deduce that $\\pi\\left(M^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n}$ is an open subset of $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$, and $M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{1 / 2}=$ $\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u) \\cap B_{1 / 2}$ for $u: \\pi\\left(M^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ a smooth positive function satisfying\n\n$$\nd(x, \\partial M) \\tan \\theta / c \\leqslant u(x) \\leqslant c d(x, \\partial M) \\tan \\theta, \\quad|D u(x)| \\leqslant c \\tan \\theta\n$$\n\nfor all $x \\in \\pi\\left(M^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n}$, with $c=c(n, \\gamma)$. The upper bounds in (4.12) follow from (4.10), and the lower bound from (4.4), (4.7). By (4.10) and our choice of $\\theta_{0}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\partial \\pi\\left(M^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n}=\\partial M \\cap B_{1 / 2}^{n}\n$$\n\nand so we can extend $u$ by zero to all of $B_{1 / 2}^{n}$ to obtain a Lipschitz function satisfying the required properties (2), (3), (4), (5).\n\nFinally, we observe that if $\\Omega^{\\prime}$ is any connected component of $\\Omega \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\}$, then by (4.4) necessarily $\\partial \\Omega^{\\prime} \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{3 / 4}$ is a non-empty subset of $M^{\\prime} \\cap B_{3 / 4}$. From this and (4.11) we obtain property (1).\n\nBy a trivial modification of the above proof, we also obtain a version of the graphical propogation for smooth cones.\n\nLemma 4.10 (Graphical propogation for cones). Given $\\gamma>0$, there exist $\\theta_{0}(n, \\gamma), c(n, \\gamma)$ so that the following holds. Suppose $\\theta \\leqslant \\theta_{0}$, and $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is a dilation-invariant minimizer for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ which is smooth away from the cone point 0 . Write $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Assume that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 c_{0}} \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M) \\leqslant x_{1} \\leqslant 2 \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M)\n$$\n\nfor all $x \\in M \\cap B_{\\gamma}(\\partial M) \\cap \\partial B_{1}$, where $c_{0}$ as in Lemma 2.1.\nThen there exists a 1-homogenous Lipschitz function $u: \\mathbf{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ so that:\n(1) $\\Omega=\\left\\{x: 0<x_{1}<u(\\pi(x))\\right\\} \\mathscr{L}^{n+1}$-a.e.;\n(2) $M=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ in $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$;\n(3) $\\partial M=\\partial\\{u>0\\}$;\n(4) $\\operatorname{Lip}(u) \\leqslant c \\tan \\theta$;\n(5) for every $z \\in\\{u>0\\}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c} \\tan \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\}) \\leqslant u(z) \\leqslant c \\tan \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\})\n$$\n\nProof. We first note that by the maximum principle in the sphere $M \\cap \\partial B_{1}$ is necessarily connected, and by the maximum principle for stationary varifold cones we must have $\\partial M \\cap \\partial B_{1} \\neq \\varnothing$. By an essentially verbatim argument as Lemma 4.8, we can therefore find a 1-homogenous (because $M$ is conical) Lipschitz function $u: B_{2}^{n} \\backslash B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ satisfying properties (1)-(5) of Lemma 4.8 (except with $B_{1 / 2}^{n}$ replaced with $B_{2}^{n} \\backslash B_{1 / 2}^{n}$ ).\n\nEnsuring $\\theta(n, \\gamma)$ is sufficiently small so that $|u|<\\varepsilon$ on $B_{2}^{n} \\backslash B_{1 / 2}^{n}$, property (1) and connectivity of $M$ implies that in fact (1), (2) hold without the restriction on $x_{1}$. If we extend $u$\n\nto $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ by 1-homgeneity, then (1)-(5) will continue to hold on $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$, as the estimates in (4), (5) are invariant under 1-homogenous rescaling.\n\nAs $\\theta \\rightarrow 0$, the graphing function of Lemmas 4.8, 4.10 resembles more closely a minimizer of the Alt-Caffarelli functional. This is made precise below.\n\nProposition 4.11 (Inhomogenous blow-up). Let $\\theta_{\\mu}>0$ be a sequence approaching $0, \\Omega_{\\mu} \\subset$ $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ a sequence of (not necessarily smooth!) minimizers for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{\\mu}}$ in $B_{1}$, and $M_{\\mu}=\\partial \\Omega_{\\mu} \\cap$ $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Assume there are fixed $\\Gamma, \\varepsilon>0$ and Lipschitz functions $u_{\\mu}: B_{1}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ satisfying\n(1) $\\Omega_{\\mu}=\\left\\{x: 0<x_{1}<u_{\\mu}(\\pi(x))\\right\\}$ in $B_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\cap B_{1}$,\n(2) $M_{\\mu}=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}\\left(u_{\\mu}\\right)$ in $\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\} \\cap B_{1}$,\n(3) $0 \\in \\partial M_{\\mu}=\\partial\\left\\{u_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$ in $\\mathbf{R}^{n} \\cap B_{1}$,\n(4) $\\operatorname{Lip}\\left(u_{\\mu}\\right) \\leqslant \\Gamma \\tan \\theta_{i}$,\n(5) for every $z \\in B_{1}^{n} \\cap\\left\\{u_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$, we have the estimate\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\Gamma} \\tan \\theta_{\\mu} d\\left(z, \\partial\\left(u_{\\mu}>0\\right)\\right) \\leqslant u_{i}(z) \\leqslant \\Gamma \\tan \\theta_{\\mu} d\\left(z, \\partial\\left(u_{\\mu}>0\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThen up to a subsequence,\n\n$$\nv_{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{\\tan \\theta_{\\mu}} u_{\\mu}\n$$\n\nconverges in $\\left(W_{l o c}^{1,2} \\cap C_{l o c}^{\\alpha}\\right)\\left(B_{1 / 2}^{n}\\right)$, for all $\\alpha<1$, to a Lipschitz function $v: B_{1 / 2}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ that minimizes the Alt-Caffarelli functional J in $B_{1 / 2}^{n}$, and the free-boundaries $\\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\partial\\{v>0\\}$ in the local Hausdorff distance in $B_{1 / 2}^{n}$.\nIf, additionally, one assumes the $M_{\\mu}$ are smooth and admit an upper bound of the form\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\mu} \\sup _{B_{1}} \\theta_{\\mu}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{\\mu}}\\right|<\\infty\n$$\n\nthen $\\partial\\{v>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$ is entirely regular, and the convergence $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ is $C_{l o c}^{2, \\alpha}\\left(B_{1 / 2}^{n}\\right)$ in the sense of Hodograph transforms. In particular, we get\n\n$$\n\\sup _{B_{r}} \\theta_{\\mu}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{\\mu}}\\right| \\rightarrow \\sup _{B_{r}^{n} \\cap\\{v>0\\}}\\left|D^{2} v\\right| \\quad \\forall r<1 / 2\n$$\n\nRemark 4.12. We shall show in Lemmas 4.13, 4.8 that hypotheses (1)-(5) will always hold for any sequence of smooth minimizers with $\\theta_{\\mu} \\rightarrow 0$. Additionally, we shall show in Lemma 4.14 that (4.14) always holds for a sequence of smooth minimizers of dimension $n \\leqslant 4$ (or more generally $n+1 \\leqslant k^{*}$, see Remark 4.2).\nProof. We first prove the $C_{l o c}^{\\alpha} \\cap W_{l o c}^{1,2}$ and Hausdorff convergence for $u_{\\mu}$ satisfying only properties (1)-(5). By our hypothesis, we know that the functions $v_{\\mu}$ are uniformly bounded in $W^{1, \\infty}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, and so passing to a subsequence we have $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ in $C_{l o c}^{\\alpha}\\left(B_{1}^{n}\\right)$ for all $\\alpha<1$, for some $v \\in W^{1, \\infty}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ satisfying $|v|+\\operatorname{Lip}(v) \\leqslant c(n, \\gamma)$.\n\nWe claim that $\\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\partial\\{v>0\\}$ in the local Hausdorff distance in $B_{1 / 2}$, which will imply among other things that $1_{\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} \\rightarrow 1_{\\{v>0\\}}$ in $L_{l o c}^{1}\\left(B_{1 / 2}\\right)$ also. If $x \\in \\partial\\{v>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$, then for any $\\varepsilon>0$ small, choose $z \\in B_{\\varepsilon}(x)$ with $0<v(z)<\\varepsilon$. For $\\mu \\gg 1$, we must have $0<v_{\\mu}(z)<2 \\varepsilon$, and hence by (4.5) we have $d\\left(x, \\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}\\right) \\leqslant c(n, \\gamma) \\varepsilon$. Thus we obtain a sequence $x_{\\mu} \\in \\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$ with $x_{\\mu} \\rightarrow x$. Conversely, suppose we have $x_{\\mu} \\in \\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$ with\n\n$x_{\\mu} \\rightarrow x \\in B_{1 / 2}$. If $x \\notin \\partial(v>0)$, then there is a ball $B_{2 r}(x)$ on which $v=0$. But then since $v_{i} \\rightarrow 0$ on $B_{r}(x)$, Lemma 4.7 implies $v_{\\mu} \\equiv 0$ on $B_{r / 2}(x)$ for $\\mu \\gg 1$, contradicing our choice of $x_{\\mu}$. So we must have $x \\in \\partial(v>0)$. This proves our claim.\n\nFor any fixed $B_{2 r}(p) \\subset\\{v>0\\}$, then $B_{2 r}(p) \\subset\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$ for all $\\mu \\gg 1$. Since each $u_{\\mu}$ solves the minimal surface equation in $B_{2 r}(p)$, by standard elliptic estimates $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ smoothly in $B_{r}(p)$. So $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ smoothly on compact subsets of $B_{1 / 2} \\cap\\{v>0\\}$. Together with the uniform Lipschitz bounds on $v_{\\mu}$ and the local Hausdorff convergence $\\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\partial(v>0)$, we get $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ in $W_{i o c}^{1,2}\\left(B_{1 / 2}\\right)$.\n\nWe now prove that $v$ minimizes $J$ in $B_{1 / 2}$. For this, let $r<1 / 2$ and let $w$ be a Lipschitz function satisfying $\\operatorname{spt}(w-v) \\subset B_{r}$. Choose a smooth function $\\eta: B_{1 / 2} \\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ with $\\operatorname{spt}(w-$ $v) \\Subset \\operatorname{spt} \\eta \\subset B_{r}$. Define the functions $w_{\\mu}=w+(1-\\eta)\\left(v_{\\mu}-v\\right)$, and the domains\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mu}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{x \\in B_{1 / 2}^{n+1}: 0<x_{1}<\\max \\left(0, \\tan \\theta_{\\mu} w_{\\mu}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen $\\Omega_{\\mu} \\Delta \\Omega_{\\mu}^{\\prime} \\Subset B_{1 / 2}^{n+1}$ for $\\mu \\gg 1$, and so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{\\mu}}\\left(\\Omega_{\\mu}\\right) \\leqslant \\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{\\mu}}\\left(\\Omega_{\\mu}^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow \\int_{\\left\\{u_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{r}} \\sqrt{1+\\left|D u_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta_{\\mu} 1_{\\left\\{u_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\int_{\\left\\{w_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{r}} \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\tan \\theta_{\\mu}\\right)^{2}\\left|D w_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}}-\\cos \\theta_{\\mu} 1_{\\left\\{w_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow \\int_{B_{r}} \\frac{1}{2}\\left|D u_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}+\\left(1-\\cos \\theta_{\\mu}\\right) 1_{\\left\\{u_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\int_{B_{r}} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\tan \\theta_{\\mu}\\right)^{2}\\left|D w_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}+\\left(1-\\cos \\theta_{\\mu}\\right) 1_{\\left\\{w_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x+O\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}^{3}\\right) \\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow \\int_{B_{r}}\\left|D v_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}+1_{\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\int_{B_{r}}\\left|D w_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}+1_{\\left\\{w_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}} d x+O\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\int_{B_{r}}|D w|^{2}+2 D w \\cdot D\\left((1-\\eta)\\left(v_{\\mu}-v\\right)\\right)+\\left|D\\left((1-\\eta)\\left(v_{\\mu}-v\\right)\\right|^{2} d x\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{B_{r}} 1_{\\{w>0\\}}+1_{\\{\\eta<1\\}} d x+O\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn the second implication we used the bound $\\left|D u_{\\mu}\\right| \\leqslant c(n, \\gamma) \\tan \\theta$. Taking $\\mu \\rightarrow \\infty$ gives\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{r}}|D v|^{2}+1_{\\{v>0\\}} d x \\leqslant \\int_{B_{r}}|D w|^{2}+1_{\\{w>0\\}}+1_{\\{\\eta<1\\}} d x\n$$\n\nand then letting $\\eta$ approximate $1_{B_{r}}$ we conclude that\n\n$$\nJ_{B_{1 / 2}}(v) \\leqslant J_{B_{1 / 2}}(w)\n$$\n\nFinally, for a general $w-v \\in W_{0}^{1,2}\\left(B_{r}\\right)$ we can approximate $w-v$ in $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1 / 2}\\right)$ by a Lipschitz function $\\tilde{w}$ compactly supported in $B_{1 / 2}$, and apply the above reasoning to $v+\\tilde{w}$.\n\nWe now assume the bound (4.14), and prove $C_{l o c}^{2, \\alpha}$ convergence $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ near the freeboundary, and convergence as in (4.15). We have\n\n$$\n\\left|D^{2} v_{\\mu}(z)\\right|=\\left(1+O\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)\\right) \\theta_{\\mu}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{\\mu}}\\left(z+u_{\\mu}(z)\\right)\\right|\n$$\n\nand so (4.14) implies\n\n$$\n\\sup _{B_{1} \\cap\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}}\\left|D^{2} v_{\\mu}\\right| \\leqslant \\Lambda<\\infty\n$$\n\nfor some fixed constant $\\Lambda$. Since $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ smoothly on compact subsets of $\\partial\\{v>0\\}$, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{B_{1} \\cap\\{v>0\\}}\\left|D^{2} v\\right| \\leqslant \\Lambda\n$$\n\nalso. It follows that any tangent solution at any $x \\in \\partial\\{v>0\\}$ is linear, and hence (by e.g. [2]) $\\partial\\{v>0\\}$ is entirely regular. It also follows that if $x_{\\mu} \\rightarrow x \\in\\{v>0\\} \\cap B_{1}$, then $\\theta_{\\mu}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{\\mu}}\\left(x_{\\mu}+\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.u_{\\mu}\\left(x_{\\mu}\\right)\\right)\\right| \\rightarrow|D v(x)|$.\n\nFix $x \\in \\partial\\{v>0\\} \\cap B_{1 / 2}$. We shall show that in some small ball $B_{r}(x)$ the Hodograph transforms of $v_{\\mu}$ convergence in $C^{2, \\alpha}$ to Hodograph transform of $v$. Given any $\\varepsilon>0$ (to be fixed later to depend only on $n$ ), we claim there is a radius $r>0$ so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& r^{-1}\\left|v_{\\mu}(y)-(y-x) \\cdot D v(x)\\right|+\\left|D v_{\\mu}(y)-D v(x)\\right| \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\quad \\text { in } B_{r}(x) \\cap\\left\\{v_{i}>0\\right\\} \\\\\n& r^{-1}|v(y)-(y-x) \\cdot D v(x)|+r^{-1}|D v(y)-D v(x)| \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\quad \\text { in } B_{r}(x) \\cap\\{v>0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe second estimate (4.19) follows from the regularity of $\\partial\\{v>0\\}$, with $r=r(v, x, \\varepsilon)$. The Hausdorff convergence of free boundaries implies there is a sequence $x_{\\mu} \\in \\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\rightarrow x$, and from the bound (4.17) (and the boundary condition $\\partial_{n} v_{\\mu}=-1$ along $\\partial\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\}$ ), we can shrink $r=r(n, \\Lambda)$ as necessary to get\n\n$$\nr^{-1}\\left|v_{\\mu}(y)-\\left(y-x_{i}\\right) \\cdot D v_{\\mu}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right|+\\left|D v_{\\mu}(y)-D v_{\\mu}\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\quad \\text { in } U_{\\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{\\mu}$ is the connected component of $\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{r}(x)$ containing $x_{\\mu} \\in \\partial U_{\\mu}$. Combining (4.19), (4.20), with the $C_{l o c}^{0}$ convergence $v_{i} \\rightarrow v$ we deduce $\\left|D v_{i}\\left(x_{i}\\right)-D v(x)\\right| \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon$ and $\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{r}(x)=U_{\\mu}$. The first estimate (4.18) (with $c(n) \\varepsilon$ in place of $\\varepsilon$ ) then follows. This proves our claim.\n\nFor convenience, after rotating/translating/dilating, there will be no loss in taking $x=0$, $r=1$, and $D v(x \\equiv 0)=e_{n+1}$, so that\n\n$$\n\\left|D v_{\\mu}(y)-e_{n+1}\\right|+\\left|v_{\\mu}(y)-\\left(y_{n+1}\\right)_{+}\\right| \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\quad \\text { in }\\left\\{v_{\\mu}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{1}\n$$\n\nEnsuring $\\varepsilon(n)$ is sufficiently small, the inverse function theorem implies we can find smooth functions $g_{\\mu}\\left(y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{n}\\right):\\left\\{y_{1}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{1} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\{\\left(v_{\\mu}\\left(y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{n+1}\\right), y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{n+1}\\right): y \\in\\left\\{v_{i}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{1}\\right\\} \\cap B_{9 / 10} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{\\left(y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{n}, g_{\\mu}\\left(y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{n}\\right)\\right): y \\in\\left\\{y_{1}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{1}\\right\\} \\cap B_{9 / 10}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand similarly we can find a $g$ satisfying (4.22) with $g, v$ in place of $g_{\\mu}, v_{\\mu}$. From (4.21), we have\n\n$$\n\\left|g_{\\mu}\\left(y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{n}\\right)-y_{1}\\right|+\\left|D g_{\\mu}-e_{1}\\right| \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon \\quad \\text { in }\\left\\{y_{1}>0\\right\\} \\cap B_{9 / 10}\n$$\n\nand similarly for $g$. The $C_{l o c}^{0}$ convergence $v_{\\mu} \\rightarrow v$ implies that $g_{\\mu} \\rightarrow g$ in $C^{0}\\left(B_{9 / 10}^{+}\\right)$.\nBy differentiating (4.22), we have for every $2 \\leqslant i, j \\leqslant n$ the relations\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1=D_{n+1} v D_{1} g, \\quad 0=D_{i} v+D_{n+1} v D_{i} g \\\\\n& 0=D_{n+1, n+1}^{2} v D_{1} g D_{1} g+D_{n+1} v D_{11}^{2} g \\\\\n& 0=D_{n+1, i}^{2} v D_{1} g+D_{n+1, n+1}^{2} v D_{1} g D_{i} g+D_{n+1} v D_{1, i}^{2} g \\\\\n& 0=D_{i j}^{2} v+D_{i, n+1}^{2} v D_{j} g+D_{j, n+1}^{2} D_{i} g+D_{n+1, n+1}^{2} v D_{i} g D_{j} g+D_{n+1} v D_{i j}^{2} g\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand the same with $g_{\\mu}, v_{\\mu}$ in place of $g, v$. From the above, the bound (4.17), and the estimates (4.21), we get the uniform bound\n\n$$\n\\sup _{B_{9 / 10}^{+}}\\left|D^{2} g_{\\mu}\\right| \\leqslant c(n) \\Lambda\n$$\n\nand since $D v(0)=e_{n+1}$, we have\n\n$$\nD g(0)=e_{1}, \\quad\\left|D^{2} g(0)\\right|=\\left|D^{2} v(0)\\right|\n$$\n\nWe show that the $g_{\\mu}$ satisfy a good elliptic PDE with Neumann-type boundary conditions, which we use to establish a priori $C^{2, \\alpha}$ bounds. For a general smooth function $g\\left(y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{n}\\right): B_{1}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$, define\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{graph}^{\\theta}(g)=\\left\\{\\left(\\tan \\theta y_{1}, y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{n}, g\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)\\right): y_{1}>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nso that we have $M_{\\mu} \\cap B_{8 / 10}=\\operatorname{graph}^{\\theta_{\\mu}}\\left(g_{\\mu}\\right) \\cap B_{8 / 10}$. Denote by\n\n$$\nD^{\\theta} g=\\left(\\frac{D_{1} g}{\\tan \\theta}, D_{2} g, \\cdots, D_{n} g\\right)\n$$\n\nThen the upward unit normal $v$ and volume form $d$ Vol for graph ${ }^{\\theta}(g)$ have the expressions\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& v(g)=\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\left|D^{\\theta} g\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}}\\left(-\\frac{D_{1} g}{\\tan \\theta},-D_{2} g, \\cdots,-D_{n} g, 1\\right) \\\\\n& d \\operatorname{Vol}=\\left(1+\\left|D^{\\theta} g\\right|\\right)^{1 / 2} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that by (4.23) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\tan \\theta_{\\mu}\\left(1+\\left|D^{\\theta_{\\mu}} g_{\\mu}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}-1\\right|_{C^{0}\\left(B_{9 / 10}^{+}\\right)} \\leqslant c(n) \\varepsilon, \\quad \\text { for } \\mu \\gg 1\n$$\n\nThus, in $B_{8 / 10}^{+}$each $g_{\\mu}$ is stationary for the area functional\n\n$$\nA\\left(\\operatorname{graph}^{\\theta_{\\mu}}\\left(g_{\\mu}\\right)\\right)=\\int\\left(1+\\left|D^{\\theta_{\\mu}} g\\right|\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nwith boundary condition $v\\left(g_{\\mu}\\right) \\cdot\\left(-e_{1}\\right)=\\cos \\theta_{\\mu}$ when $y_{1}=0$.

A priori estimates. For smooth minimizers, we can \"bootstrap\" the convergence of Proposition 4.11 to show that the non-degeneracy estimates (4.4) hold for a uniform choice of $\\gamma$.\n\nLemma 4.13 (Bootstrap non-degeneracy near free-boundary). There are constants $\\theta_{0}(n)$ and $d_{0}(n)$ so that the following holds. Let $\\Omega$ be a smooth minimizer of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in $B_{1} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ with $\\theta \\in\\left(0, \\theta_{0}\\right)$. Then writing $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 c_{0}} \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M)<x_{1}<2 \\tan \\theta d(\\pi(x), \\partial M)\n$$\n\nfor all $x \\in M \\cap B_{1 / 2} \\cap B_{d_{0}}(\\partial M)$, where $c_{0}$ is as in Lemma 2.1.\nProof. Given a smooth minimizer $\\Omega$ of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in some ball $B_{R}$, and taking $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ and $r<R$, define $D\\left(M, B_{r}\\right)$ to be the largest number $D$ so that (4.46) holds with $B_{D}(\\partial M)$ in place of $B_{d_{0}}(\\partial M)$ and $B_{r}$ in place of $B_{1 / 2}$. Note that $D\\left(M, B_{r}\\right)$ is always positive (by our\n\nassumptions that $M$ is smooth and $r<R$ ), and that $r \\mapsto D\\left(M, B_{r}\\right)$ is decreasing. Note also the scaling $D\\left(\\lambda M, B_{\\lambda r}\\right)=\\lambda D\\left(M, B_{r}\\right)$.\n\nAfter replacing $B_{1}$ with $B_{3 / 4}$, there will be no loss of generality in assuming $D\\left(M, B_{1}\\right)>0$.

There are absolute constants $C, \\varepsilon, \\theta_{0}$ so that the following holds. Take $n \\leqslant 4$, and let $\\Omega$ be a smooth minimizer of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}$ in $B_{1} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$, for $\\theta \\in$ $\\left(0, \\theta_{0}\\right)$, and write $M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$. Then, assuming $0 \\in \\partial M$, we have the curvature bound $\\sup _{M \\cap B_{c}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\cap B_{1 / 8}} \\theta^{-1}\\left|A_{M}\\right| \\leqslant C$.\n\nProof. After replacing $B_{1}$ with $B_{1 / 4}$ there will be no loss in assuming that $\\sup _{B_{1}}\\left|A_{M}\\right|<\\infty$. Moreover, ensuring $\\theta_{0}$ is sufficiently small, by Lemmas $4.13,4.8$ there is also no loss in assuming we have a Lipschitz function $u: B_{1}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ and absolute constant $\\varepsilon>0$ so that $M=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}(u)$ in $B_{1} \\cap\\left\\{0<x_{1}<\\varepsilon\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Lip}(u) \\leqslant c \\theta$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c} \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\}) \\leqslant u(z) \\leqslant 2 c \\theta d(z, \\partial\\{u>0\\})\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in B_{1}^{n} \\cap\\{u>0\\}$. Here $c$ is an absolute constant.\nWe will show that $\\theta^{-1}\\left|A_{M}(x)\\right|(1-|x|)$ is bounded by an absolute constant, provided $\\theta$ is sufficiently small, which will clearly prove the Lemma. Suppose otherwise: there are sequences $\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow 0, \\Omega_{i}$ minimizing $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{i}}$ in $B_{1}$, so that if $M_{i}=\\partial \\Omega_{i} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ then\n\n$$\n\\sup _{x \\in B_{1}} \\theta_{i}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{i}}(x)\\right|(1-|x|) \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nas $i \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Write $u_{i}$ for the graphing functions for $M_{i}$ as in the first paragraph. We break into two cases.\n\nCase 1: $\\sup _{i} \\lambda_{i}^{-1} d\\left(x_{i}, \\partial M_{i}\\right)<\\infty$. Define the rescaled domains $\\Omega_{i}^{\\prime}=\\lambda_{i}\\left(\\Omega_{i}-\\pi\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)$, surfaces $M_{i}^{\\prime}=\\lambda_{i}\\left(M_{i}-\\pi\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right) \\equiv \\partial \\Omega_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap \\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$, and points $x_{i}^{\\prime}=\\lambda_{i}\\left(x_{i}-\\pi\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)$. Then for a suitable $R_{i} \\rightarrow \\infty$, the $\\Omega_{i}^{\\prime}$ are minimizers of $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{i}}$ in $B_{R_{i}}(0) \\equiv B_{R_{i}}\\left(\\pi\\left(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$, satisfying\n\n$$\n\\sup _{i} d\\left(0, \\partial M_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)<\\infty, \\quad \\theta_{i}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{i}^{\\prime}}\\left(x_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=1, \\quad \\sup _{B_{R_{i}}} \\theta_{i}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{i}^{\\prime}}\\right| \\leqslant 2\n$$\n\nMoreover, if we let $u_{i}^{\\prime}(z)=\\lambda_{i} u_{i}\\left(\\left(z-\\pi\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right) / \\lambda_{i}\\right)$, then $M_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap B_{R_{i}}=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}\\left(u_{i}^{\\prime}\\right), \\operatorname{Lip}\\left(u_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant$ $c(\\rho) \\theta_{i}$, and the $u_{i}^{\\prime}$ continue to satisfy (4.50) on $B_{R_{i}}^{n} \\cap\\left(u_{i}^{\\prime}>0\\right)$.\n\nWe can therefore apply Proposition 4.11 (after passing to a subsequence as necessary) to deduce there is entire Lipschitz minimizer $v: \\mathbf{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ of the Alt-Caffarelli functional $J$ so that $\\theta_{i}^{-1} u_{i}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow v$ in $\\left(C_{l o c}^{a} \\cap W_{l o c}^{1,2}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$.

Proof of Theorems 1.3, 1.4, 4.1. Theorems 1.3, 4.1 follow by directly combining Lemma 4.10, Proposition 4.11, with Lemmas 4.13 and 4.14. The basic strategy for Theorem 1.4 involves three key ingredients: we can write $M_{i}=\\operatorname{graph}\\left(u_{i}\\right)$ and blow-up $\\theta_{i}^{-1} u_{i} \\rightarrow v$ for some 1-homogenous $v$ minimizing the Alt-Caffarelli energy (Theorem 1.3); in low dimensions $v$ must be linear, and so the improved convergence of Proposition 4.11 implies $\\theta_{i}^{-1}\\left|A_{M_{i} \\cap \\partial B_{1}}\\right| \\rightarrow$ 0 ; a rigidity-type theorem for minimal capillary surfaces $\\Sigma$ in the sphere with small angle $\\theta$ and $\\theta^{-1}\\left|A_{\\Sigma}\\right|$ small. We first state the rigidity theorem.\n\nLemma 4.15 (Rigidity of almost-planar capillary cones with small angle). There is a $\\delta(n)$ so that the following holds. Let $M$ be a stationary capillary cone in $\\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ making contact angle $\\theta>0$ with $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$, and with smooth link $\\Sigma$.

Suppose, towards a contradiction, there are sequences $\\theta_{i} \\rightarrow 0$ and cones $\\Omega_{i}$ minimizing $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta_{i}}$, so that each $M_{i}:=\\partial \\Omega_{i} \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is smooth away from 0 but nonplanar. For $i \\gg 1$, we can apply Lemma 4.13 at points in $\\partial M_{i} \\cap \\partial B_{1}$ to get the non-degeneracy condition (4.13) with some absolute constant $\\gamma$. We can then use Lemma 4.10 and Proposition 4.11 to deduce $M_{i}=\\operatorname{graph}_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}\\left(u_{i}\\right)$, where $u_{i} / \\theta_{i} \\rightarrow v$ for some 1-homogenous minimizer $v$.\n\nBy our dimensionality hypothesis $v$ must be linear, and without loss of generality $v(x)=$ $\\left(e_{n+1} \\cdot x\\right)_{+}$.

There exists $\\theta_{1}=\\theta_{1}(n)$ such that if $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ is a stable minimal cone for $\\mathscr{A}^{\\theta}, M=\\partial \\Omega \\cap \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is smooth away from 0 , and $\\theta \\in\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta_{1}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$, then $M$ is flat.\n\nRemark 5.2. It will be clear from the proof that $\\theta_{1}$ can be explicitly computed depending on $n$ (compare to $\\{21$, Appendix C $\\}$ ).\n\nWe first recall the following consequence of the Simons's equation on a minimal cone.\nLemma 5.3. Let $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ be a minimal cone. Then for every $\\lambda \\in(0,1)$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|A|^{2}\\right)+|A|^{4} \\geqslant 2 \\lambda|x|^{-2}|A|^{2}+\\left[(1-\\lambda)\\left(1+\\frac{2}{n}\\right)+\\lambda\\right]|\\nabla| A \\|^{2}\n$$\n\non $M$.\nProof. Fix a point $p \\in M$ and take normal coordinates $\\left\\{x_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ around $p$, then the Simons equation gives\n\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|A|^{2}\\right)+|A|^{4}=\\sum_{i, j, k=1}^{n} A_{i j, k}^{2}\n$$\n\nWe write the right hand side of the above as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}|A|^{2}\\right)+|A|^{4}=\\lambda\\left(\\sum_{i, j, k=1}^{n} A_{i j, k}^{2}-\\sum_{i, j, k=1}^{n}|A|^{-2}\\left(A_{i j} A_{i j, k}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\\\\n&+(1-\\lambda) \\sum A_{i j, k}^{2}+\\lambda \\sum|A|^{-2}\\left(A_{i j} A_{i j, k}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\sum|A|^{-2}\\left(A_{i j} A_{i j, k}\\right)^{2}=|\\nabla| A \\|^{2}$. On one hand, since $M$ is a cone, we have that (see $[24, \\mathrm{~B} .9])$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i, j, k=1}^{n} A_{i j, k}^{2}-\\sum_{i, j, k=1}^{n}|A|^{-2}\\left(A_{i j} A_{i j, k}\\right)^{2} \\geqslant 2|x|^{-2}|A(x)|^{2}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, we have the following Kato type inequality (see [8, (2.22)]):\n\n$$\n\\sum A_{i j, k}^{2} \\geqslant\\left(1+\\frac{2}{n}\\right)|\\nabla| A \\|^{2}\n$$\n\n(5.1) follows from combining the above two estimates.\n\nNext, we establish the following trace type inequality on $M$. This was proven in [21, Lemma C.3]. We include it here for completeness. (Compare to Lemma 4.15, where a similar trace type inequality holds when $\\theta$ is close to 0 ).\nLemma 5.4. Suppose $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ is a smoothly immersed hypersurface, meeting $\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{+}^{n+1}$ at constant angle $\\theta$. Then for any $u \\in W^{1,1}(M)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial M} u \\leqslant \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\int_{M}|\\nabla u|+\\left|H_{M} u\\right|\n$$\n\nProof. For $R>0$, let $\\varphi_{R}:[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a smooth function such that $\\varphi_{R}(t)=1$ when $t \\leqslant$ $R, \\varphi_{R}(t)=0$ when $t \\geqslant 2 R$, and $\\left|\\varphi_{R}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant \\frac{2}{R}$. Consider the vector field $\\zeta=-\\varphi_{R}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\partial_{1}$. By assumption, we have that $\\eta \\cdot \\zeta=\\sin \\theta$ along $\\partial M$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\partial M} u & =\\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\int_{\\partial M} u \\eta \\cdot \\zeta \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\int_{M} \\operatorname{div}_{M}\\left(u \\zeta^{T}\\right) \\leqslant \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\int_{M}|\\nabla u||\\zeta|+u \\operatorname{div}_{M} \\zeta+\\left|u H_{M}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta} \\int_{M}|\\nabla u|+\\frac{2}{R} u+\\left|H_{M} u\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSending $R \\rightarrow \\infty$ gives the result.\nProof of Theorem 5.1. For $p \\in\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right)$ to be chosen later, by (5.1), we have that (here and after we use $r=|x|$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\left(|A|^{2 p}\\right)= & p|A|^{2 p-1} \\Delta|A|+p(2 p-1)|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}\\right. \\\\\n\\geqslant & p|A|^{2 p-1}\\left[-|A|^{3}+2 \\lambda r^{-2}|A|+|A|^{-1}\\left((1-\\lambda) \\frac{2}{n}\\right)|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}\\right]\\right. \\\\\n& +p(2 p-1)|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}\\right. \\\\\n= & p\\left(2 p-2+\\lambda+(1-\\lambda)\\left(1+\\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\right)|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}-p|A|^{2 p+2}+2 p \\lambda|A|^{2 p} r^{-2}\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor a compactly supported radial Lipschitz function $f=f(r)$, plug $f|A|^{p}$ into (2.2) and obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\cot \\theta \\int_{\\partial M} A(\\eta, \\eta)|A|^{2 p} f^{2}+\\int_{M}|A|^{2 p+2} f^{2} \\leqslant \\int_{M}\\left|\\nabla\\left(f|A|^{p}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\\\\n& =\\int_{M} p^{2}|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} f^{2}+|A|^{2 p}|\\nabla f|^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\nabla|A|^{2 p}, \\nabla\\left(f^{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\right. \\\\\n& =\\int_{M} p^{2}|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} f^{2}+|A|^{2 p}|\\nabla f|^{2}-\\int_{M} f^{2} \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta\\left(|A|^{2 p}\\right)+\\int_{\\partial M} f^{2} \\frac{\\partial|A|^{2 p}}{\\partial \\eta}\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe note that each integral on the right hand side of the above inequality is finite. Here one only needs to check the integral involving $\\left|A^{2 p-2}\\right||\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}\\right.$ is finite. To see this, recall that the Simons equation implies that\n\n$$\nc(n)|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} \\leqslant|A| \\Delta|A|+|A|^{4}\\right.\n$$\n\nfor some $c(n)>0$. Thus, we have that\n\n$$\nc(n)|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} \\leqslant|A|^{2 p-1} \\Delta|A|+|A|^{2 p+3}\\right.\n$$\n\nNow both terms on the right hand side are integrable on $M \\cap S^{n}(1)$, and hence $|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} f^{2}\\right.$ is integrable on $M$ if $f$ is compactly supported.\n\nWe treat boundary term in (5.3) first. By [21, Lemma C.2], we have that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial|A|}{\\partial \\eta}\\right| \\leqslant 3 \\sqrt{n-1}|\\cot \\theta||A|^{2}\n$$\n\nThus, using (5.2) we estimate\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\cot \\theta \\int_{\\partial M}\\right. & A(\\eta, \\eta)|A|^{2 p} f^{2}-\\int_{\\partial M} f^{2} \\frac{|A|^{2 p}}{\\eta} \\mid \\\\\n& \\leqslant c(n)|\\cot \\theta| \\int_{\\partial M} f^{2}|A|^{2 p+1} \\\\\n& \\leqslant c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right| \\int_{M}\\left|\\nabla\\left(f^{2}|A|^{2 p+1}\\right)\\right| \\\\\n& \\leqslant c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right| \\int_{M} f^{2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2}|A|^{2 p-2}+f^{2}|A|^{2 p+2}+|\\nabla f|^{2}|A|^{2 p}\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $c(n)$ is a constant that may change from line to line, but depends only on $n$. We have used that $p \\leqslant 1$ and the Young's inequality $2 a b<a^{2}+b^{2}$ above.\n\nPlug this into (5.3), and use (5.1), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & \\leqslant \\int_{M}\\left((p-1)+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|\\right)|A|^{2 p+2} f^{2} \\\\\n& +\\int_{M}\\left(p^{2}-p((1-\\lambda)(1+2 / n)+\\lambda+2(p-1))+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|\\right)|A|^{2 p-2}|\\nabla| A\\left\\|^{2} f^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{M}\\left(1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|\\right)|A|^{2 p}|\\nabla f|^{2}-2 \\lambda p|A|^{2 p} f^{2} / r^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& =: I+I I+I I I\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $\\varepsilon>0$ to be chosen later, set\n\n$$\nf= \\begin{cases}r^{1+\\varepsilon} & r \\leqslant 1 \\\\ r^{2-n / 2-\\varepsilon} & r>1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThough $f$ is not compactly supported, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{n-3-2 p} f(r) d r$ is finite (since $p \\in[1 / 2,1]$ and $n \\geqslant 2$ ), and thus the right hand side of (5.3) is finite with this choice of $f$. Morever, we see that $I I I$ becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI I I= & \\int_{M \\cap\\{r \\leqslant 1\\}}\\left((1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|)(1+\\varepsilon)^{2}-2 \\lambda p\\right)|A|^{2 p} f^{2} / r^{2} \\\\\n& +\\int_{M \\cap\\{r \\geqslant 1\\}}\\left((1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|)(2-n / 2-\\varepsilon)^{2}-2 \\lambda p\\right)|A|^{2 p} f^{2} / r^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf we can make the coefficients in integrals I, II, II all $<0$, it will follow that $A \\equiv 0$, proving our Theorem. We therefore seek to find $p \\in(1 / 2,1), \\varepsilon \\in(0,1), \\lambda \\in(0,1), \\theta_{1}>0$ to ensure the following inqualities hold whenever $\\theta \\in\\left(\\pi / 2-\\theta_{1}, \\pi / 2\\right]$ and $2 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 6$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p-1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|<0 \\\\\n& p^{2}-p((1-\\lambda)(1+2 / n)+\\lambda+2 p-2)+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|<0 \\\\\n& (1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|)(1+\\varepsilon)^{2}-2 \\lambda p<0 \\\\\n& (1+c(n)\\left|\\frac{\\cot \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}\\right|)(2-n / 2-\\varepsilon)^{2}-2 \\lambda p<0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOne can readily check that when $\\theta=\\pi / 2$ (and $2 \\leqslant n \\leqslant 6$ ), then taking $p=1-\\varepsilon, \\lambda=$ $1-10 \\varepsilon, \\varepsilon=1 / 100$ will make all of the above inequalities true. Therefore by continuity there is a $\\theta_{1}>0$ so that all inequalities remain sharp if $\\theta \\in\\left(\\pi / 2-\\theta_{1}, \\pi / 2\\right]$.
