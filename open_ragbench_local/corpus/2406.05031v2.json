The long de Broglie wavelength of these particles suppresses the formation of small-scale structures, offering a natural solution to the cusp-core problem, which refers to the mismatch between the cuspy density profile predicted by N-body simulations and the flatter ones observed in galactic centers [2]. With mass much less than 40 eV , ultralight dark matter can be described by classical field theory, and its wave mechanics is governed by the Schroedinger equation coupled to gravity through Poisson's equation [3-5]. Simulating such a wave system, it has been shown that the density profile of each dark matter halo can be well fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile [6] at large radii, while the core is described by a soliton [7-16].\n\nHere, we refer to solitons as stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations whose boundary conditions at infinity are the same as those for the physical vacuum state. ${ }^{1}$ In the literature, they sometimes appear with different names depending on the contexts. If the mass of fields is not in the fuzzy regime, i.e., with mass $m \\gg 10^{-20} \\mathrm{eV}$, solitons could be cold stellar configurations called boson, Bose, or soliton stars [17-19]. ${ }^{2}$ Solitons constituting axions or\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ More generally, there are topological solitons whose boundary conditions at infinity are topologically different from those of the physical vacuum state.\n    ${ }^{2}$ In early examples, complex scalar solitons were called Klein-Gordon geons [20, 21].\n\naxionlike particles are also called dense or dilute axion stars [22-26], depending on whether the self-interactions (SIs) of the fields are important or not. Using the Klein-Gordon and Einstein equations for scalar fields, solitons are sometimes called oscillatons [27, 28]. In cases where attractive SIs dominate over gravity, they can be referred to as Q-balls [29, 30] if they are complex-valued or oscillons/I-balls/quasi-breathers [31-33] if they are real-valued. ${ }^{3}$ For massive vector fields, their corresponding solitons are sometimes called Proca stars [38], Proca Q-balls [39], vector solitons [40, 41], or vector oscillons [42]. In the literature, these solitonic objects are typically regarded as different entities and their phenomenological implications are often discussed in an uncorrelated manner. For reviews, see [43, 44].\n\nConsidering their diverse and distinct applications, in this work, I aim to provide a unified understanding of these solitonic objects in the nonrelativistic regime, e.g., dark matter solitons. A clear connection between these solitons will be established by examining field equations governing the nonrelativistic dynamics of real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter. This extends the previous result that oscillons have an approximate conserved particle number, e.g., see [42, 45, 46]. Notably, we will see that real vector dark matter provides the most general scenario, in the sense that its field equations could reduce to the other three cases through a few simple manipulations of variables. Therefore, we will use it as an example to explore the universal properties of dark matter solitons, such as conserved quantities, mass-radius relation, stability, and profiles.\n\nIn addition to the SIs of dark matter, I will also take into consideration its nonminimal gravitational interactions (NGIs). They could arise from quantum corrections and are essential for the renormalization of field theories in curved spacetime [47-51]. Their phenomenological implications have been studied in various contexts, such as dark matter [52-56], inflation [57-64], and modified gravity [65-70].\n\nFor the rest of the paper, we derive the nonrelativistic effective field theory for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter in section 2. The symmetries preserved by the nonrelativistic effective actions and the associated conserved charges are discussed in appendix A. Soliton equations are derived, and the impacts of SIs and NGIs are qualitatively discussed in section 3. In section 4, we explore the stability and mass-radius relation both analytically and numerically. Soliton solutions are numerically calculated using the Mathematica package \"DMSolitonFinder\", whose details are provided in appendix B.

In this section, I will start with the relativistic actions for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter fields, including SIs and NGIs, and derive their effective actions and field equations in the nonrelativistic regime. We will see that the model of real vector dark matter offers the most general scenario, capable of reducing to the other three cases through a few simple manipulations of variables. Based on the nonrelativistic actions, conserved charges such as particle number and angular momentum will be clarified.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ In 1-dimensional space, there could exist exact periodic solutions for real scalar field equations called breathers, e.g., breathers in the sine-Gordon equation. In 3-dimensional space, there are only approximate periodic solutions which slowly emit classical radiation [34-37].\n\nA full action $S$ may be decomposed into a minimal gravity part and a matter part, $S=S_{\\mathrm{G}}+S_{\\mathrm{M}}$, where the former is given by\n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{G}}=\\int d^{4} x \\sqrt{-g} \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{P}}^{2}}{2} R\n$$\n\nwith $R$ being the Ricci scalar.

In an expanding universe, it is convenient to work with a comoving scalar perturbation $\\Phi \\equiv a A$. Since dark matter fields are dominated by oscillations with a frequency $\\simeq m$, it is useful to perform a comoving and nonrelativistic expansion for dark matter fields,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Real scalars: } \\quad \\phi(t, \\boldsymbol{x})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 m a^{3}}}\\left[e^{-i m t} \\psi(t, \\boldsymbol{x})+e^{i m t} \\psi^{*}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})\\right] \\\\\n& \\text { Complex scalars: } \\quad \\phi(t, \\boldsymbol{x})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 m a^{3}}} e^{-i m t} \\psi(t, \\boldsymbol{x}) \\\\\n& \\text { Real vectors: } \\quad X_{\\mu}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 m a}}\\left[e^{-i m t} \\psi_{\\mu}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})+e^{i m t} \\psi_{\\mu}^{*}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})\\right] \\\\\n& \\text { Complex vectors: } \\quad X_{\\mu}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 m a}} e^{-i m t} \\psi_{\\mu}(t, \\boldsymbol{x})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the field mass, and $\\psi$ and $\\psi_{\\mu}$ are complex comoving fields that slowly vary in time. Here I have denoted real and complex fields with the same letters, but the meaning of the notations should be clear based on the context. To ensure that the redefinition for real scalars preserves the number of propagating degrees of freedom, one can employ a constraint that keeps the field equation of $\\psi$ first-order in time derivatives, $e^{-i m t} \\dot{\\psi}+e^{i m t} \\dot{\\psi}^{*}=0$ [72], and a similar constraint can be used for real vectors. In what follows, I will give a brief review of a systematic approach for power counting based on the comoving and nonrelativistic fields and then derive the leading-order low-energy effective actions and field equations for dark matter.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 2.1 Power counting \n\nAs we take the nonrelativistic limit of a relativistic theory, several small parameters or operators appear, allowing us to organize different terms that arise in the effective theory.

These parameters must be less than unity, since in the nonrelativistic regime a mass term is the dominant contribution to the time evolution of the original field and all other effects are suppressed. If the relativistic action of dark matter\n\nincludes a quartic SI term, $\\lambda \\phi^{4}$, and a NGI term, $\\xi \\phi^{2} R$, we must have two more small parameters\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\lambda} \\equiv \\frac{|\\lambda| \\phi^{2}}{m^{2}}, \\quad \\epsilon_{\\xi} \\equiv\\left|\\frac{\\xi R}{m^{2}}\\right|\n$$\n\nSince the comoving mass density $\\rho \\sim a^{3} m^{2} \\phi^{2}$ and $R \\approx 3 H^{2}+2 a^{-3} \\nabla^{2} \\Phi \\sim a^{-3} M_{\\mathrm{P}}^{-2} \\rho$, the requirement of $\\epsilon_{\\lambda}, \\epsilon_{\\xi}$ being small at the radiation-matter equality sets an upper limit on $|\\lambda|$ and $|\\xi|$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& |\\lambda| \\ll \\frac{m^{4}}{(1+z)^{3} \\rho}=3 \\times 10^{-72}\\left(\\frac{m}{10^{-18} \\mathrm{eV}}\\right)^{4}\\left(\\frac{10^{-6} \\mathrm{GeV} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{\\rho}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3400}{1+z}\\right)^{3} \\\\\n& |\\xi| \\ll \\frac{m^{2} M_{\\mathrm{P}}^{2}}{(1+z)^{3} \\rho}=2 \\times 10^{19}\\left(\\frac{m}{10^{-18} \\mathrm{eV}}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{10^{-6} \\mathrm{GeV} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{\\rho}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3400}{1+z}\\right)^{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn general, the small parameters are not independent of each other and we do not know a priori the relative magnitudes between them, thus a reliable power counting strategy would require the system of equations to be expanded up to a homogeneous order of all small parameters. For notation convenience, let us denote all small parameters collectively by $\\epsilon=\\left\\{\\epsilon_{H}, \\epsilon_{t}, \\epsilon_{k}, \\epsilon_{\\psi}, \\epsilon_{\\Phi}, \\epsilon_{\\lambda}, \\epsilon_{\\xi}\\right\\}$. The impact of relativistic modes on the nonrelativistic modes is then regulated by the largest value of $\\epsilon$.\n\nDue to the oscillating factors in the equations of motion, the dynamics of slowly varying quantities are affected by rapidly oscillating terms, whose frequencies are typically integer multiples of the field mass $m$. Generally speaking, a nonrelativistic variable $Q$ can be expanded into\n\n$$\nQ=\\sum_{\\nu=-\\infty}^{\\infty} Q_{\\nu} e^{i \\nu m t}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{\\nu}$ are modes that vary slowly in time and typically $Q_{0}$ dominates over nonzero modes. For the purpose of this work, we will only be interested in the zero modes and thus need to integrate out the rest of the modes. To systematically solve for the nonzero modes using power counting, we expand them into a power series in $\\epsilon$,\n\n$$\nQ_{\\nu}=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Q_{\\nu}^{(n)} \\quad(\\nu \\neq 0)\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript ( $n$ ) indicates the term's order of magnitude relative to the zero mode, i.e., $\\left|Q_{\\nu}^{(n)} / Q_{0}\\right| \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{n}\\right)$. By plugging these expansions for all comoving and nonrelativistic variables into their field equations, we can solve the nonzero modes perturbatively and then substitute the solutions back into the equations for the zero modes. The detailed procedure is outlined in [73]. Up to the leading-order terms containing $\\Phi$, the gravity action becomes\n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{G}, \\mathrm{NR}}=\\int d^{4} x M_{\\mathrm{P}}^{2} a\\left(-3 \\dot{a}^{2}+a^{-2} \\Phi \\nabla^{2} \\Phi-6 \\ddot{a} \\Phi\\right)\n$$\n\nFor clarity in notation, here I have omitted the subscript \" $0_{0}$ \" on the zeros modes defined in (2.11) and will apply the same approach to other nonrelativistic fields.

To assess the effect, one approach is to examine whether the mass density $\\widetilde{\\rho}$ is enhanced or reduced after incorporating the modification due to $\\widetilde{\\xi}$. Assuming that soliton profiles can be approximated by a Gaussian function $\\widetilde{f}(r)=\\widetilde{C} e^{-\\widetilde{r}^{2} / \\widetilde{R}_{e}^{2}}$, the Laplacian of $\\widetilde{\\rho}$, which becomes $4\\left(4 \\widetilde{r}^{2}-3 \\widetilde{R}_{e}^{2}\\right) \\widetilde{f}^{2} / \\widetilde{R}_{e}^{4}$, is negative within the soliton core but reverses sign in the outer regions.

It has been observed that while solitons can become increasingly compact under the influence of repulsive SIs, attractive SIs destabilize solitons when their energy becomes comparable to the gravitational energy [13]. However, the presence of the NGIs could change the scenario: Solitons are predicted to collapse if their amplitudes reach the critical value (3.11).

Note that this relation is also applicable to scalar and complex vector solitons if we replace $\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}$ with $\\widetilde{\\lambda}$, consistent with the results for scalar solitons [88-90]. The mass-radius relation is shown in figure 2 .\n\nFor $\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}<0$, the SI term dominates over the gravity term in (4.1) when the soliton radius is small. Numerical calculations yield $c_{2}=2.53$. According to (4.6), the maximum mass of solitons occurs at\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}\\right|^{-1 / 2} \\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }=c_{2}^{1 / 2}, \\quad\\left|\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}\\right|^{1 / 2} \\widetilde{M}_{s}^{\\max }=\\frac{c_{1}}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{c_{2}}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nwhich well approximate the numerical results $\\left|\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}\\right|^{-1 / 2} \\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }=1.49$ and $\\left|\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}\\right|^{1 / 2} \\widetilde{M}_{s}^{\\max }=36.0$. At this point, $d \\widetilde{M}_{s} / d \\widetilde{R}_{s}=0$, indicating the smallest radius of stable solitons. For a dark matter clump with $\\widetilde{M}>\\widetilde{M}_{s}^{\\max }$, it would collapse to a black hole unless some other processes such as virialization halt the shrinking.

A dark matter clump initially in the unstable branch of the massradius relation may either collapse into a black hole or relax towards the stable branch.\n\nFor $\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}>0$, there exists a minimum soliton radius\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }=\\sqrt{c_{2} \\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}}\n$$\n\nTo determine the value of $c_{2}$, we can apply the Thomas-Fermi approximation to solve the soliton profile.

This implies that solitons with a radius $\\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }$ are localized in space with a size $\\widetilde{R}$. The radius enclosing $95 \\%$ of the total mass is related to $\\widetilde{R}$ through $\\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }=0.895 \\widetilde{R}$, leading to the determination of $c_{2}=0.988$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 4.3 Nonminimal gravitational interactions: $\\widetilde{\\lambda}_{\\sigma}=0$ and $\\widetilde{\\xi} \\neq 0$ \n\nIf $\\xi$ satisfies (2.16), NGIs may play a significant role in soliton dynamics.

As noted in section 3.3, there exists a critical soliton solution whose amplitude is given by (3.11).

Instead, to make the analytical approximation (4.14) agree with the numerical results $|\\widetilde{\\xi}|^{-1 / 2} \\widetilde{R}_{s}=6.94$ and $|\\widetilde{\\xi}|^{1 / 2} \\widetilde{M}_{s}=7.86$, we can require $c_{2}=2.13$ and $c_{3}=15.0$. Note that the analytical approximation does not capture the behavior near the critical point, indicated as the solid blue point in figure 3, where the amplitude of solitons approaches (3.11) and the soliton profile becomes sharply peaked at the center (see figure 4). Analogous to the case with SIs,\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3. Mass-radius relation for solitons with NGIs.

Two dots represent solitons with the critical amplitude (3.11), beyond which no soliton solutions exist.

For $\\xi>0$, the maximum mass and smallest radius of solitons are given by (4.16).\na dark matter clump with $\\widetilde{M}>\\widetilde{M}_{s}^{\\max }$ would collapse to a black hole unless some other processes stop the contraction.

More generally, in the presence of both SIs and NGIs with $\\widetilde{\\gamma}<0$ and $\\widetilde{\\xi}<0$, one should compare the marginally stable point (4.7) due to $\\widetilde{\\gamma}$ and the critical point (4.13) due to $\\widetilde{\\xi}$ in order to estimate the maximum mass and the minimum radius of solitons.\n\nFor $\\widetilde{\\xi}>0$, the mass and radius of the critical soliton are given by\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\xi}^{1 / 2} \\widetilde{M}_{s}^{\\max }=30.8, \\quad \\widetilde{\\xi}^{-1 / 2} \\widetilde{R}_{s}^{\\min }=6.91\n$$\n\nTo make the prediction of (4.12) agree with (4.16), we can choose $c_{2}=1.60+0.00131 c_{3}^{2}$. By varying the values of $c_{3}$, one can show that $c_{3}=20.3$ and thus $c_{2}=2.14$ provide an excellent approximation for the numerical mass-radius relation, as shown in figure 3.

To achieve this, we begin with Lorentz-invariant\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5. Mass-radius relation for solitons with gradient-dependent SIs. The notation follows that of figure 3.\nactions, including the leading SIs and NGIs of dark matter, and derive the nonrelativistic effective field theory following the strategy in [72, 73]. Some of our key findings in the nonrelativistic regime include:\n\n1. Real vector dark matter represents the most general scenario, in the sense that the field equations can reduce to the other three cases-where dark matter consists of real scalars, complex scalars, or complex vectors-through a few simple manipulations of variables.\n2. Under the assumption that dark matter fields are even under the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ reflection symmetry, it is challenging to distinguish between real and complex scalar dark matter, and consequently, their solitons, without accounting for relativistic effects or interactions beyond SIs and NGIs.\n3. The quartic SI of real vector dark matter incorporates (macroscopic) spin-spin interactions, which break the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry in each component of the field in orthonormal polarization bases and prohibits the superposition of extremally polarized solitons [41]. Moreover, the NGIs of dark matter introduce gradient-dependent SIs and modify Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential.\n\nBased on these findings, we demonstrate that dark matter solitons in these four scenarios share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability, and profiles. Specifically, we study the mass-radius relation of real vector solitons for several benchmark examples, including the case with NGIs and purely gradient-dependent SIs (a combination of the SIs and NGIs). The stability of solitons against perturbations is ensured if $d M_{s} / d R_{s}<0$. Here, numerical calculations are performed using the Mathematica package \"DMSolitonFinder\", which dynamically adjusts the boundary conditions and the spatial range of solutions until localized solutions are found with the requested precision and accuracy. See appendix B for more details.\n\nDark matter solitons could form through gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation in the kinetic regime $[8,15,91,92]$. After their formation, solitons continue to grow and at some stages SIs start to become important [13]. For example, solitons with attractive SIs (e.g.,\n\naxion stars) collapse upon reaching a critical mass when their SI energy becomes comparable to their gravitational energy; while those with repulsive SIs keep growing without collapsing. The presence of the NGIs could change the story: Solitons are predicted to collapse if their amplitudes reach the critical value (3.11), regardless of the sign of the coupling. This imposes an upper bound on solitons' mass at the level of $\\sim 40 M_{\\mathrm{P}}^{2} /[m|\\xi|^{1 / 2}]$, thereby affecting their mass distribution and phenomenology. Moreover, the NGIs modify Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential. With a NGI coupling $\\xi<0$, solitons become more compact compared to those without the NGIS. On the other hand, if $\\xi>0$, a core with \"repulsive gravity\" could form for solitons whose amplitudes are close to the critical value (3.11). This may lead to novel signals in gravitational lensing, which will be explored in future work.\n\nIn summary, dark matter solitons constituting real or complex, scalar or vector particles can be regarded as related objects. We explore their mass-radius relation and stability, and discuss the impacts of SIs and NGIs.

For simplicity, let us first consider a nonexpanding universe, i.e., setting $a=1, H=0$, and $\\bar{\\rho}_{\\xi}=0$. At the end I will discuss the impact of the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn a nonexpanding universe, the nonrelativistic action is invariant under an infinitesimal spacetime translation $x^{\\mu} \\rightarrow x^{\\mu}+a^{\\mu}$. The associated Noether's current is the energymomentum tensor, and here we are interested in the $0 \\nu$ component, which is given by\n\n$$\nT^{0}{ }_{\\nu}=-i \\psi_{j}^{*} \\partial_{\\nu} \\psi_{j}+\\delta_{\\nu}^{0} \\mathcal{L}\n$$\n\nThe energy density of the system is $-T^{0}{ }_{0}$ and thus the total energy is\n\n$$\nE=\\int d^{3} x\\left[\\frac{1}{2 m} \\partial_{j} \\psi_{i} \\partial_{j} \\psi_{i}^{*}+\\frac{1}{2} \\Phi \\rho_{\\xi}+\\frac{\\lambda}{48 m^{2}}\\left(|\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{2}+2|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{4}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere the gravitational energy is\n\n$$\n\\int d^{3} x \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi \\rho_{\\xi}=-\\frac{G}{2} \\int d^{3} x d^{3} y \\frac{\\rho_{\\xi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\rho_{\\xi}(\\boldsymbol{y})}{|\\boldsymbol{y}-\\boldsymbol{x}|}\n$$\n\nTo retain the Newton's law for gravity, we may define the mass of a field configuration as\n\n$$\nM=\\int d^{3} x \\rho_{\\xi}\n$$\n\nThe nonrelativistic action is invariant under an infinitesimal global $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ transformation $\\psi_{i} \\rightarrow \\psi_{i}-i \\alpha \\psi_{i}$ and $\\psi_{i}^{*} \\rightarrow \\psi_{i}^{*}+i \\alpha \\psi_{i}^{*}$. The associated conserved charge may be identified as the particle number\n\n$$\nN=\\int d^{3} x n\n$$\n\nwhere $n \\equiv \\rho / m=|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{2}$ is the particle number density.\nThe nonrelativistic action is invariant under an infinitesimal global $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ transformation $\\psi_{j} \\rightarrow \\psi_{j}-\\omega_{j k} \\psi_{k}$, where $\\omega_{j k}=-\\omega_{k j} \\equiv \\varepsilon_{i j k} \\theta_{i}$ and $\\theta_{i}$ is the rotation angle. The associated conserved charge can be identified as the internal spin\n\n$$\nS_{i}=\\int d^{3} x \\mathcal{S}_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{S}_{i} \\equiv i \\varepsilon_{i j k} \\psi_{j} \\psi_{k}^{*}$ is the spin density. It thus turns out that the $\\lambda$-dependent term in (A.2) depends on spin,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda}{48 m^{2}}\\left(|\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{2}+2|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{4}\\right)=\\frac{\\lambda}{48 m^{2}}\\left(3|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{4}-\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { S } ^ { 2 }}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $|\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { S }}|^{2}=|\\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{4}-|\\boldsymbol{\\psi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\psi}|^{2}$. As discussed in the main text, the existence of the spinspin interaction tends to increase (decrease) the total energy for attractively (repulsively) self-interacting real vector dark matter.\n\nThe nonrelativistic action is also invariant under an infinitesimal space rotation $x_{j} \\rightarrow$ $x_{j}-\\omega_{j k} x_{k}$, for which case the field $\\psi_{j}$ changes as $\\psi_{j}(x) \\rightarrow\\left[\\delta_{j}^{k}-\\frac{i}{2} \\omega_{m n}\\left(J^{m n}\\right)_{j}{ }^{k}\\right] \\psi_{k}(x+\\omega x)$, where $\\left(J^{m n}\\right)_{j}{ }^{k}=-i\\left(\\delta_{j}^{m} \\eta^{n k}-\\eta^{m k} \\delta_{j}^{n}\\right)$ and $\\eta^{\\mu \\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. The associated conserved charge can be identified as the total angular momentum\n\n$$\nJ_{i}=L_{i}+S_{i}=\\int d^{3} x \\mathcal{L}_{i}+S_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{i} \\equiv \\varepsilon_{i j k} x^{j} T^{0 k}=-i \\varepsilon_{i j k} x^{j} \\psi_{l}^{*} \\partial_{k} \\psi_{l}$ is the orbital angular momentum density. The total spin and orbital angular momentum are conserved separately.\n\nIn an expanding universe, the time translation symmetry is broken and the energy (A.2) is no longer conserved. However, the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ symmetry in field configurations and space are still preserved. The foregoing definitions of mass, particle number, and angular momentum now should be regarded as comoving and appropriate factors in terms of the scale factor $a(t)$ should be taken into account for quantities in physical coordinates.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 19, "text": "# B Mathematica package: DMSolitonFinder \n\nIn this work, I develop the Mathematica package \"DMSolitonFinder\", available on https: //github.com/hongyi18/DMSolitonFinder/, to solve dark matter soliton profiles in an automated way. To solve soliton profiles, it will dynamically change the boundary conditions and the spatial range of solutions until localized solutions are found under the requested precision and accuracy. For example, soliton solutions with central amplitude $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r}=0)=0.01$, particle spin $\\sigma=1$, SI coupling $\\widetilde{\\lambda}=30$, and NGI coupling $\\widetilde{\\xi}=-5$ could be found by using the function ShootFields, e.g.,\n\nShootFields[0.01, SI->30, NGI->-5, Spin->1]\nThe output of ShootFields is a list of soliton solutions in the form of $\\{\\{\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r}), \\widetilde{\\Psi}(\\widetilde{r})\\}, \\widetilde{r}_{f}\\}$, where $\\widetilde{r}_{f}$ is the outer boundary of the solutions. The basic algorithm used in ShootFields (as appeared in \"DMSolitonFinder\" version 1.0) is described as follows:\n\n1. Given the central amplitude $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r}=0)$ and other optional conditions (e.g., the values of $\\widetilde{\\lambda}, \\widetilde{\\xi}, \\sigma)$, solve the soliton profile equation (3.2) with an initial guess of $\\widetilde{\\Psi}(\\widetilde{r}=0)$, which is demanded to be less than the central value of the true solution such that the first local minimum of $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r})$ from small to large radii is negative.\n2. Solve the equation (3.2) with a central value of $\\widetilde{\\Psi}$ increased by $d \\widetilde{\\Psi}$, where $d \\widetilde{\\Psi}$ is a small positive number, until the first minimum of the new $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r})$ becomes positive.\n3. Stop the calculation and return the solutions if the values of the new $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r})$ near the outer boundary $r_{f}$ is small enough compared to the central amplitude $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r}=0)$, which is determined by the option AmpTolerance and the default value is $10^{-4}$.\n4. If the first minimum of the new $\\widetilde{f}(\\widetilde{r})$ is located near the outer boundary $r_{f}$, then increase the boundary $r_{f}$ for better convergence of soliton solutions, otherwise revert back to the last $\\widetilde{\\Psi}(\\widetilde{r}=0)$ and reduce the value of $d \\widetilde{\\Psi}$.\n5. Repeat the step $2-4$ until solutions that satisfy AmpTolerance are found. Warning messages will be generated if the target solutions could not be found or other problems arise; check the package website for possible solutions.\n\nOnce soliton solutions are found, one can calculate the mass, radius, particle number, frequency (chemical potential), and energy of the soliton by using the functions CalMass, CalRadius, CalParticleNumber, CalFrequency, and CalEnergy.
