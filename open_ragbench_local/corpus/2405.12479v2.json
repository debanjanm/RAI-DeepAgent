The model allows for the study, within a unified framework, of asset pricing in a natural world that experiences the possibility of negative security prices or riskless rates. In contrast to classical Black-Scholes-Merton, we show that option pricing in the unified model displays a difference depending on whether the replicating, self-financing portfolio uses riskless bonds or a single riskless bank account. We derive option price formulas and extend our analysis to the term structure of interest rates by deriving the pricing of zero-coupon bonds, forward contracts, and futures contracts. We identify a necessary condition for the unified model to support a perpetual derivative. Discrete binomial pricing under the unified model is also developed. In every scenario analyzed, we show that the unified model simplifies to the standard Black-Scholes-Merton pricing under specific limits and provides pricing in the Bachelier model limit. We note that the Bachelier limit within the unified model allows for positive riskless rates. The unified model prompts us to speculate on the possibility of a mixed multiplicative and additive deflator model for risk-neutral option pricing.\n\n\nKeywords: dynamic asset pricing; Bachelier model; Black-Scholes-Merton model; option pricing; perpetual derivative; binomial model; term structure of interest rates; price deflators", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThis paper develops a unified Bachelier and Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) market model for dynamic asset pricing. By incorporating a weighted mixture of arithmetic and geometric Brownian motion, the unified model enables the study of asset pricing in a natural world that experiences the possibility of negative security prices and riskless rates. The model provides a cohesive framework that leverages the strengths of both formulations while mitigating their respective weaknesses.\n\nThe seminal work of Bachelier (1900) introduced the precursor of what is now referred to as arithmetic Brownian motion. However, since the latter half of the $20^{\\text {th }}$ century, asset pricing theory has been dominated by that of the BSM model based on geometric Brownian motion (Black and Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1973). While there has been extensive discussion of, and effort to, address the restrictive assumptions of the BSM model, its strengths (such as positive asset prices and positive riskless rates) have been challenged by the realities of $21^{\\text {st }}$ century financial markets. What was perceived as a primary weakness of the arithmetic Brownian motion model (the possibility of negative asset prices and negative riskless rates) is now seen as having application to price processes for certain derivatives (such as commodity futures) as well as a dynamic theory of asset pricing that includes environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores (Lauria et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2024; Rachev et al., 2024).\n\nThe ESG ratings industry continues to mature and its place in the U.S. financial system continues to be debated. Previous works (Hu, Lindquist and Rachev, 2024; Lauria et al. 2022, P\u00e1stor, Stambaugh and Taylor, 2022; Zerbib, 2022; Pedersen, Fitzgibbons and Pomorski, 2021) have explored how ESG ratings might affect asset valuation. As argued in Rachev et al. (2024), the ESG-adjusted stock price of company $X$ at time $t \\geq 0$ is\n\n$$\nA_{t}=S_{t}^{\\mathrm{ESG}}=S_{t}^{(X)}\\left(1+\\gamma^{\\mathrm{ESG}} Z_{t}^{(X ; \\mathcal{I})}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\quad Z_{t}^{(X ; \\mathcal{I})}=\\frac{Z_{t}^{(X)}-Z_{t}^{(I)}}{Z_{t}^{(I)}} \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere: $S_{t}^{(X)}>0$ is the stock price of the company; $Z_{t}^{(X)} \\in[0,100]$ is the ESG score of the company; $Z_{t}^{(I)} \\in[0,100]$ is the ESG score of the market index $I$ to which the company stock belongs; and the parameter $\\gamma^{\\mathrm{ESG}} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ measures the ESG affinity of the market. As\n\n$Z_{t}^{(x ; \\mathcal{J})}$ will be negative for low ESG stocks, if the market ESG-affinity is valued at $\\gamma^{\\text {ESG }}<$ $1 /\\left|Z_{t}^{(x ; \\mathcal{J})}\\right|$, the ESG-adjusted price $A_{t}$ will be negative for such stocks. A Bachelier model, rather than the BSM model, is then required for modeling ESG-adjusted prices.\n\nNegative asset valuation challenges economists and practitioners whose worldview is anchored in BSM theory. Under the Rachev et al. model, a company may have a negative ESG-adjusted stock price while retaining a positive financial stock price. Such a company has a negative valuation relative to its contribution to the long-term survival of the planet while retaining financial solvency. While stocks continue to be bought and sold under financial prices, the ESG-adjusted price adds sustainability as a third dimension in assessing the value of an asset. ${ }^{1}$ In this regard, the ESG incorporating models of Hu et al. (2024), Lauria et al. (2022), and Rachev et al. (2024) contrast with models of P\u00e1stor et al. (2022), Zerbib (2022) and Pedersen et al. (2021), who incorporate ESG ratings strictly within the BSM world of positive prices. The unified model presented here widens the BSM worldview, incorporating BSM as one limit of a larger dynamic pricing model.\n\nIn contrast to the BSM model, which has driven continuous-time finance theory based upon stochastic differential equations, leading to important results such as the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (Delbaen, 1994; Delbaen, 1998), and the development of discrete pricing models (Cox, Ross and Rubenstein 1979; Jarrow and Rudd, 1983), the academic literature on Bachelier's model has been \"scarce\" and \"scattered\" (Choi, 2022). Prior to the work of Rachev et al. (2024), published Bachelier models have either:\n(i) used a risk-free rate of zero (e.g., Bachelier, 1900; Shiryaev, 1999; Schachermayer, 2008);\n(ii) used arithmetic Brownian motion for the risky asset with a continuously compounded risk-free asset (Choi, 2022); or\n(iii) utilized an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the risky asset (Brooks, 2017).\n\nOf these three choices, only (i) results in a correct model. However, with no risk-free rate, model (i) has limited practical use. Choices (ii) and (iii) produce price solutions (either\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ It becomes an academic exercise to consider whether ESG-valuation and financial valuation are correlated, and to what degree. In our view, that exercise is irrelevant to the critical importance of sustainability.\n\nunder the risk-neutral measure or under the natural measure) whose mean value will eventually diverge to infinity if a positive risk-free rate is chosen. Choosing a negative riskfree rate (for all time) is financially unrealistic, while we have noted that the choice of a zero risk-free rate is of limited use.\n\nWe refer to our unified model as the Bachelier-BSM (BBSM) model. In section 2 we define the BBSM market pricing models. Appropriate parameter choices reduce the unified model to either the traditional BSM model based upon geometric Brownian motion or to a \"modernized\" Bachelier model based upon arithmetic Brownian motion (Rachev, 2024). In particular the modernized Bachelier (MB) limit allows for either a negative or positive risk-free rate (with no solution divergence). We note that negative interest rates indeed materialized for significant periods as a result of the 2007-2009 Great Recession (Neufeld, 2022) as central banks of several developed economies implemented negative interest rate policies to stimulate economic activity and combat deflationary pressures.\n\nIn contrast to the BSM model, the BBSM model produces different equivalent martingale measures (EMMs) and different option price solutions depending on whether the replicating, self-financing portfolio treats the riskless asset as a financial product issued in units (i.e. a bond) or as a single bank account. Pricing for a European contingency claim under these two replicating portfolios is presented in Sections 3 and 4. In Appendices A and B, we develop closed form call option price solutions for the BBSM and MB models assuming time-independent coefficients.\n\nIn Section 5 we examine option pricing in the case of a dividend-paying risky asset. The question of the existence of a perpetual derivative in the BBSM model is investigated in Section 6 where we show a necessary condition for its existence. In Section 7 we shift our attention to discrete option pricing in the BBSM model using binomial trees. In Section 8 , we investigate the term structure of interest rates in this model by examining the pricing of zero-coupon bonds, forward contracts, and futures contracts. Section 9 explores the calibration of the model's parameters to empirical data.\n\nWhile the BSM model and the BBSM model under the replicating portfolio of Section 3 result in equivalent martingale measures obtained by multiplicative price deflators, the\n\nreplicating portfolio of Section 4 produces deflated prices that can be described as a combination of multiplicative and additive deflation. In Section 10 we suggest an approach using real derivative (stock option and bond) prices to calibrate whether (and to what extent) the actions of the U.S. central bank result in such a deflator combination.\n\nA final discussion of the model is presented in Section 11.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2.

We define the standard Brownian motion $B_{t}^{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}}, t \\geq 0$, having the dynamics $d B_{t}^{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}}=d B_{t}+\\left(\\left[\\phi_{t}-r_{t} A_{t}\\right] / \\psi_{t}\\right) d t$ on $\\mathbb{P}$. Under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}_{2} \\sim \\mathbb{P}$, the deflated process $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{t}}=D_{2 t} A_{t}, t \\geq 0$, is an $\\mathbb{F}$-martingale with $d \\Phi_{\\mathrm{t}}=D_{2 t} \\psi_{t} d B_{t}^{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}}$, $A_{0}>0$.

The EMM $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$ is unique and the market $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B}, \\mathcal{C})$ is complete.\n\nFrom the solution (4), it is straightforward to show\n\n$$\n\\beta_{t}=D_{2 t}^{-1}\\left[D_{2 T} \\beta_{T}-\\int_{t}^{T} D_{2 s} \\rho_{s} d s\\right]\n$$\n\nWriting the price vector as $X_{t}=\\left(A_{t}, B_{t}\\right)^{\\mathrm{T}}$ and the continuous rate vector as $\\mathfrak{D}_{t}=\\left(0, \\rho_{t}\\right)^{\\mathrm{T}}$, the results (20) and (21) can be summarized as\n\n$$\nX_{t}=D_{2 t}^{-1} \\mathbb{E}_{t}^{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}}\\left[D_{2 T} X_{T}-\\int_{t}^{T} D_{2 s} d \\mathfrak{D}_{s}\\right]\n$$\n\nin agreement with the development of arbitrage pricing with dividends (Duffie, 2001, Chapter 6L, pp. 123-125). Thus, the term $\\rho_{t}$ in the riskless bank account of (16a), (16b) has the effect of adding a continuous dividend rate $\\rho_{t} d t$ to the market $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B}, \\mathcal{C})$. The difference with the development in Duffie is that the dividend rate appears in the riskless asset, rather than in the risky asset. In contrast, from the solution (9a) (equivalently (12)) we see that the term $\\rho_{t}$ appearing in the riskless bond price of the replicating portfolio (7a), (7b) does not result in the addition of a continuous dividend rate to the market $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B}, \\mathcal{C})$.\n\nAs the market is complete, the option price process $C_{t}=f\\left(A_{t}, t\\right), t \\in[0, T]$, with terminal payoff $C_{T}=g\\left(A_{T}\\right), D_{t} C_{t}$ must also be an $\\mathbb{F}$-martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}_{2}$. From (19a),\n\n$$\nC_{t}=D_{2 t}^{-1} \\mathbb{E}_{t}^{\\mathbb{Q}_{2}}\\left[D_{2 T} g\\left(A_{T}\\right)-\\int_{t}^{T} D_{2 s} \\rho_{s} d s\\right]\n$$\n\nRegardless of the asset generating the dividend rate, the option price (23) reflects that rate. While the development of arbitrage pricing with dividends in Duffie (2001, Chapter 6L) is silent regarding the form of the self-financing trading strategy, we have identified an appropriate replicating, self-financing trading strategy in (16a), (16b) for the price processes (1), (3) and (6) with $\\rho_{t} \\neq 0$. Duffie's development is also silent on the dynamics of the price processes for the risky and riskless asset. Equations (16a) (16b) constitute the only possible trading strategy with prices (1) and (3) producing the result (19a), (19b).\n\nThe solutions (22) and (23) can be interpreted as the results of a process $\\Phi_{t}=D_{m t} X_{t}+$ $D_{a t}$ obtained via multiplicative $D_{m t}$ and additive $D_{a t}$ deflators.

A Perpetual Derivative Price Process \n\nShirvani et al, (2020) introduced a new class of hedging instruments, specifically perpetual derivatives (i.e., options with perpetual maturities). Consider a classical BSM market having a risky asset $\\mathcal{A}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ and riskless asset $\\mathcal{B}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ whose price process are given, respectively, by (1) with $a_{t}=v_{t}=0, \\mu_{t}=\\mu, \\sigma_{t}=\\sigma>0$, and (3) with $\\rho_{t}=0, r_{t}=r$. For $\\delta=-2 r / \\sigma^{2} \\in R, V_{t}=A_{t}^{\\delta}, t \\geq 0$, represents the price of a perpetual derivative $\\mathcal{V}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ in the complete no-arbitrage market $\\left(\\mathcal{A}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}, \\mathcal{B}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}, \\mathcal{V}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}\\right)$. There are two major applications of $\\mathcal{V}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$. The first is to use $\\mathcal{V}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ when the trader does not have access to the riskless bank account $\\mathcal{B}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$. The trader can then form a self-financing portfolio of $\\mathcal{A}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ and $\\mathcal{V}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ to replicate $\\mathcal{B}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$. The second is the use of $\\mathcal{V}^{(B S M)}$ in forming a hedging portfolio in trinomial option pricing. In trinomial option pricing, the hedger (the trader taking a short position in the option contract) requires three assets to form a self-financing portfolio that replicates the value of an option (having $\\mathcal{A}^{(\\mathrm{BSM})}$ as underlying) on each node of the tree.\n\nWe investigate the development of a perpetual derivative in the more general case of the BBSM market model. The perpetual derivative for the BSM model was studied in Lindquist and Rachev (2024) by considering separable solutions of the form\n\n$$\nf(x, t)=g(x) h(t)+w(t)\n$$\n\nfor the risk-neutral PDE. Using (29), (8) becomes\n\n$$\ng(x) h^{\\prime}(t)+\\left[\\frac{\\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t}}\\left(x g^{\\prime}(x)-g(x)\\right)+\\frac{\\psi^{2}}{2}(x, t) g^{\\prime \\prime}(x)\\right] h(t)=-w^{\\prime}(t)+\\frac{\\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t}} w(t)\n$$\n\nThe right-hand-side is deterministic, whereas the left-hand-side contains the stochastic process $x=A_{t}$. Thus, both sides must separately vanish, giving the ordinary differential equations,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nw^{\\prime}(t) \\frac{\\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t}} w(t)=0 \\\\\ng(x) h^{\\prime}(t)+\\left[\\frac{\\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t}}\\left(x g^{\\prime}(x)-g(x)\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\psi^{2}(x, t) g^{\\prime \\prime}(x)\\right] h(t)=0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe solution to (30a) is\n\n$$\nw(t)=D_{1 t}^{-1} w(0)\n$$\n\nEquation (30b) suggests solutions of the form $g(x)=x^{\\gamma}$. Substituting into (30b) produces\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime}(t)=\\eta(x, t) h(t), \\quad \\eta(x, t)=(1-\\gamma)\\left[\\frac{\\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t}}+\\frac{1}{2} \\psi^{2}(x, t) \\gamma x^{-2}\\right]\n$$\n\nEquation (32) admits a solution as long as $\\eta(x, t)=\\eta(t)$, which is possible as long as $v_{t}=$ 0 , in which case\n\n$$\n\\eta(t)=(1-\\gamma)\\left[\\frac{2 \\chi_{t}}{\\beta_{t} \\sigma_{t}^{2}}+\\gamma\\right] \\frac{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}{2} \\equiv \\xi(\\gamma) \\sigma_{t}^{2} / 2\n$$\n\nFor the BSM model $\\left(a_{t}=v_{t}=\\rho_{t}=0\\right)$ the behavior of the function $\\xi(\\gamma)$ for timeindependent coefficients $r_{t}=r, \\sigma_{t}=\\sigma$, was studied by Lindquist and Rachev (2024). In that case $\\xi(\\gamma)=(1-\\gamma)(\\delta+\\gamma)$ with $\\delta \\equiv 2 r / \\sigma^{2}$. This produced a one-parameter family of solutions to (32), one of which is the parameter value $\\gamma=-\\delta=-2 r / \\sigma^{2}$, as previously used by Shirvani et al. (2020).\n\nFor the BBSM model, as long as $v_{t}=0$, (8) admits a perpetual derivative of the form (29), where $w(t)$ is given by (31) and $h(t)$ is given by\n\n$$\nh(t)=h(0) \\exp \\left((1-\\delta) \\int_{0}^{t}\\left[\\frac{\\chi_{s}}{\\beta_{s}}+\\delta \\frac{\\sigma_{s}^{2}}{2}\\right] d s\\right)\n$$\n\nUnder time-independent coefficients, $r_{t}=r, \\sigma_{t}=\\sigma, \\rho_{t}=\\rho$, examination of $\\xi(\\gamma)$ in (33) shows it has the form $\\xi(\\gamma)=(1-\\gamma)(d(t)+\\gamma)$. Thus, at a fixed time value $t$, the analysis of the form of $\\xi(\\gamma)$ in Lindquist and Rachev (2024) holds with the replacement $\\delta \\rightarrow d(t)$. For example, if $r>0$, then $d(t)$ changes monotonically from $d(0)=\\delta+2 \\rho /\\left(\\beta_{0} \\sigma^{2}\\right)$ to $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} d(t)=\\delta$. We summarize the principal result of this section in the following lemma. LemmA 2. The requirement $v_{t}=0$ is a necessary condition for the BBSM to support a perpetual derivative having a solution of the form (29). As a corollary to this, the MB model cannot admit such a perpetual derivative.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 7. Discrete Binomial Option Pricing \n\nWe consider binomial option pricing in the BBSM market model $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B}, \\mathcal{C})$.

The Term Structure of Interest Rates \n\nWe consider the price structure of a zero-coupon bond, a forward contract, and a futures contract under the BBSM market model. The prices require knowledge of the dynamics of the interest rates $r_{t}$ and $\\rho_{t}$. A complete description of a model for the term structure of interest rates (TSIR) requires a relationship between interest rates and maturity terms (Chen 2021). There are numerous models that have been developed for interest rates; ${ }^{10}$ any of these models can be considered for $r_{t}$ and $\\rho_{t}$. However, we raise a significant issue regarding these models, each of which requires knowledge of the risk neutral probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ or, equivalently, the probability $p_{t}^{(\\mathbb{Q})}$ of an upward risk-neutral price movement. Almost always, implementation of these models involves an ad hoc choice. As examples, both the Ho-Lee and Black-Derman-Toy models use $p_{t}^{(\\mathbb{Q})}=1 / 2$ (Shreve, 2004, Vol. I, Chapter 6). In our view, the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the characterization of $p_{t}^{(\\mathbb{Q})}$ must come from the appropriate market. As demonstrated in Hu, Shirvani, Lindquist, et al. (2020, Figure 3), the value of $p_{t}^{(\\mathbb{Q})}$ is often far from $1 / 2$. We suggest that fitting an interest rate model to option prices based on a broad-based ETF as underlying, such as the SPDR S\\&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is the appropriate way to develop values for $p_{t}^{(\\mathbb{Q})}$.

Calibration of Model Parameters \n\nThe unified BBSM model has a rich parameter space $\\left(a_{t}, \\mu_{t}, v_{t}, \\sigma_{t}, \\rho_{t}, r_{t}\\right)$.

Note, however, that there are parameter choices, such as $\\mu_{t}=\\sigma_{t}=\\rho_{t}=0$, which result in a risky asset whose price follows arithmetic Brownian motion while the riskless asset price is continuously compounded (geometric). This parameter choice produces a model in which the dynamics of the risky and riskless assets are incompatible with each other.\n\nWe address how the model parameters can be calibrated to empirical data. Consider, for example, the calibration of $\\phi_{t}=a+\\mu A_{t}$ to the historical price series of asset $\\mathcal{A}$. Let $A_{k}$ be the price at the time $k$. Let $\\phi_{k}$ denote the mean value of $\\mathcal{A}$ 's price over the time period $[k-\\tau+1, k] .{ }^{17}$ Repeating this process for times $k, k-1, k-2, \\ldots, k-n+1$ will generate data for a robust regression model to fit the series\n\n$$\n\\phi_{t-k}=a+\\mu A_{t-k}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, n-1\n$$\n\nfor the parameters $a$ and $\\mu$. A similar procedure can be used to calibrate $\\psi_{k}^{2}=\\left(v+\\sigma A_{k}\\right)^{2}$, where $\\psi_{k}^{2}$ is estimated from the variance of the data over the time period $[k-\\tau+1, k]$. Again, robust regression should be used to fit the series\n\n$$\n\\psi_{t-k}=v+\\sigma A_{t-k}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, n-1\n$$\n\nbut now subject to the restriction $\\psi_{t-k} \\geq 0, k=0, \\ldots, n-1$.\nThe calibration of $\\chi_{t}=\\rho+r \\beta_{t}$ must be done in a risk-neutral setting, i.e. from option prices. Consider (under time-independent parameters) the recursion formula for the risk neutral valuation for the option price on the binomial tree (37) which employs the riskneutral probability (39). The parameters $a, \\mu, v$ and $\\sigma$ are estimated from spot prices as described above. The probability of upward price movement $p_{n}$ can be directly estimated from price changes $A_{t-k}-A_{t-k-1}, k=0, \\ldots, n-2$.

Thus (52) can be recast as $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{t}}=D_{\\mathrm{m} t} A_{t}+c D_{\\mathrm{a} t}$.\n\nIf we assume that the effect of the central bank's actions on setting U.S. treasury rates produces the riskless rate dynamics $d \\beta_{t}=\\left(c \\rho_{t}+r_{t} \\beta_{t}\\right) d t$, then in (53),\n\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{m} T}=\\exp \\left[-\\int_{0}^{t} r_{u} d u\\right], \\quad D_{\\mathrm{at}}=\\int_{0}^{t} D_{\\mathrm{ms}} \\rho_{s} d s\n$$\n\nand the option price model (23) is identical to (53) under the change $\\rho_{t} \\rightarrow c \\rho_{t}$.\nSupport for a multiplicative deflator, under which the transition from the natural world to the risk-neutral world involves a multiplicative change of num\u00e9raire, has strong theoretical underpinnings. The existence of a multiplicative deflator is equivalent to the noarbitrage condition (Duffie, 2001, p. 4). Under the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, no-arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of an equivalent martingale measure (Delbaen and Schachermayer, 1994). As noted by Duffie (2001, Chapter 2C), no-arbitrage requires positive asset prices.\n\nThe existence of additive deflation has not been subjected to theoretical scrutiny. We make the following informal observations. Under the MB limit of the unified BBSM model (and possibly under the unified model as long as $\\rho_{t} \\neq 0$ ), there is no limit on how negative prices can go, and consequently there is no relationship between the existence of a riskneutral measure and no-arbitrage. In fact, this observation suggests the argument that the opportunity for arbitrage should play no role in the existence of a risk-neutral measure. It is generally accepted in real financial markets that the risk-neutral world is the world of the central bank (R. Roll, private communication). Decisions made by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee effectively determine the deflator model for the U.S. economy. It would appear that Committee members pay no attention to the possibility of arbitrage in\n\nmaking their decisions. Rather, the enforcement of no-arbitrage in the U.S. financial system appears to be a by-product of the efficiency of its markets.\n\nIs it possible, therefore, that the connection between no-arbitrage and risk-neutral measures is a spurious consequence of strict focus on the BSM model? The forms (1), (3) and (6) of the asset price dynamics under the unified BBSM model suggest a continuous diffusion process with time-varying parameters. ${ }^{19}$ If we accept the idea that asset pricing should be considered fair, under this general model there exists the possibility of an equivalent martingale measure under a linear transformation $c D_{\\mathrm{at}}+D_{\\mathrm{mt}} A_{t}$ of prices, containing both drift (additive) and scale (multiplicative) deflation terms.\n\nTesting such an assumption on a large ensemble of empirical option and bond prices would determine which of the models (i) $D_{\\mathrm{at}}=0, D_{\\mathrm{mt}} \\neq 0$; (ii) $D_{\\mathrm{at}} \\neq 0, D_{\\mathrm{mt}}=0$; or (iii) $D_{\\mathrm{at}} \\neq 0, D_{\\mathrm{mt}} \\neq 0$ provides a better fit. Assuming time-independent parameters for simplicity, the BBSM model, with the addition of $c \\equiv a / b$ in (52), provides seven fitting parameters under which to determine the admixture of BSM and MB models, and additive and multiplicative deflators. Under the ESG-adjusted valuation discussed in the Introduction, the parameter set is further augmented by $\\gamma^{\\text {ESG }}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 11. Discussion \n\nWe have developed the unified BBSM model in response to $21^{\\text {st }}$ century finance which, under new financial crises, has experienced negative commodity prices and interest rates. As noted in the Introduction, we are also motivated by a desire to embed ESG ratings (a quantifier of corporate sustainability action) as a third dimension to the usual financial risk, financial reward worldview of finance. This contrasts with proposed models that treat ESG ratings as yet another financial risk factor. A consequence of our approach is negative ESGadjusted valuations, which require a Bachelier-type model. We have effected this through a larger unified BBSM model, which contains the BSM model as well as a \"modernized\" Bachelier model as particular parameter limits. As discussed in the Introduction, our MB model corrects significant deficiencies of existing Bachelier models.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ This is reinforced by the development of asset pricing in Duffie (2001, pp. 86 and 106).\n\nCurrent models for the TSIR seek the EMM only within the market of riskless bonds and their derivatives. (In particular, as demonstrated by Hu, Shirvani, Lindquist, et al. (2020, Figure 3), the use of $q=1 / 2$ for the EMM in the binomial Ho-Lee and Black-Derman-Toy TSIR models is not acceptable.) As shown in Section 8.1, the appropriate EMM used in determining the value of the zero-coupon bond is fixed by the stock option market. Thus, our BBSM model correctly notes that EMMs for bonds and stock options must be the same, otherwise there is an effective assumption of two central banks, one governing risk-neutral valuation of equities, and the other governing risk-neutral valuation of default-free assets.\n\nOur study of the BBSM shows that certain results of the traditional BSM model are highly constrained.\n\n1. It is well known that the BSM limit restricts prices and interest rates to be positive. We have not fully explored the BBSM model to determine in what parameter neighborhood of the BSM model this positivity holds; it does not hold for the full parameter space. ${ }^{20}$\n2. While the BSM model produces the same option pricing results under the two common variations of the replicating, self-financing portfolio (Sections 3 and 4), in general the two portfolios produce different option prices. In particular, option pricing under the portfolio of Section 4 can be interpreted in terms of a combination of multiplicative and additive deflators. In Section 10 we have explored this possibility in greater generality.\n3. While the BSM model supports a perpetual derivative solution (of separable form), a large subset of the BBSM model parameter space, which includes the MB model, does not.\n\nIt is critical to note that our unified BBSM market model is complete, resulting in a unique EMM. ${ }^{21}$ While it is well-intentioned to address the stylized facts of asset prices\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ As a simple example, evaluating (4) assuming $\\rho_{t}=\\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $r_{t}=r \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are time independent shows that the riskless asset price $\\beta_{t}$ remains positive only if $r \\beta_{0}+\\rho\\left(1-e^{-r t}\\right)>0$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n    ${ }^{21}$ Whose form is \"a function of\" the parameters of the model.\n\nusing L\u00e9vy processes to model the underlying price dynamics, such attempts result in uncountably many equivalent martingale measures, making the choice amongst them arbitrary. While the semimartingale approach to asset pricing based on the Strasbourg school of stochastic processes is beautiful, it has a fundamental drawback: all interesting non-Gaussian models exhibit infinitely many EMMs. Consequently, we submit that\n\nAny meaningful market model should be complete, and arbitrage free, guaranteed by the existence of a unique EMM.\n\nIn our view this completeness is cemented by fact that the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the \"Fed\") is dominant in the global financial system. (i.e. there is effectively only one global central bank). In support of this statement, we note the following points that speak to the global impact of the Fed's policies and actions: (i) the status of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency; (ii) the size and influence of the U.S. economy; (iii) the Fed's role as a lender of last resort; (iv) the Fed's reputation for independence and expertise; and (v) the network effect of the dominance of the U.S. dollar.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# Appendix A.

The model\nallows for the study, within a unified framework, of asset pricing in a natural\nworld that experiences the possibility of negative security prices or riskless\nrates. In contrast to classical Black-Scholes-Merton, we show that option\npricing in the unified model displays a difference depending on whether the\nreplicating, self-financing portfolio uses riskless bonds or a single riskless\nbank account. We derive option price formulas and extend our analysis to the\nterm structure of interest rates by deriving the pricing of zero-coupon bonds,\nforward contracts, and futures contracts. We identify a necessary condition for\nthe unified model to support a perpetual derivative. Discrete binomial pricing\nunder the unified model is also developed. In every scenario analyzed, we show\nthat the unified model simplifies to the standard Black-Scholes-Merton pricing\nunder specific limits and provides pricing in the Bachelier model limit. We\nnote that the Bachelier limit within the unified model allows for positive\nriskless rates. The unified model prompts us to speculate on the possibility of\na mixed multiplicative and additive deflator model for risk-neutral option\npricing.", "updated": "2024-06-10T16:41:01Z", "published": "2024-05-21T03:48:55Z"}
