Introduction and statement of the results \n\nWe consider a complex manifold $\\Sigma$ of (complex) dimension $n$ with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)$ holomorphic in $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ and $\\Sigma$ jointly. For most cases in this paper, the complex manifold is open unless specified otherwise. We assume that $\\left(\\Sigma, \\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)\\right)$ satisfies the conditions: the action $\\sigma$ is proper, the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$part $\\sigma(\\rho)$ is globally free, the $S^{1}$ part $\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{i \\theta}\\right)$ is locally free (meaning the finite isotropy condition at any point of $\\Sigma$ ) and the orbit space $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (or $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ ) is compact. For simplicity we sometimes write $z \\circ x$ or $z x$ for the action of $\\sigma(z), z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$, on $x$ of $\\Sigma$.\n\nExamples satisfying our assumption include $i$ ) the total space (zero-section removed) of a holomorphic line bundle over a compact complex manifold with the fibre-multiplication as a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action and $i i) X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$as $\\Sigma$ where $X$ is a compact CR manifold with a transversal CR locally free $S^{1}$-action, endowed with the naturally induced complex structure and holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. See Section 2 for more details. More sophisticated and complete examples have been described by D. Gross [42], with the previous works by A. Bialynicki-Birula, A. Sommese, J. Swiecieka and J. B. Carrell [9], [10], [14]. See also the survey monograph [8].\n\nLet $\\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ denote the space of all $C^{\\infty}(0, q)$-forms on $\\Sigma$. For any integer $m$, we define\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma):=\\left\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma): \\sigma(\\lambda)^{*} \\omega=\\lambda^{m} \\omega \\text { for all } \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nObserve that $\\sigma(\\lambda)^{*} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}=\\bar{\\partial} \\circ \\sigma(\\lambda)^{*}$ on $\\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ since $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ is holomorphic, so that $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}:=\\bar{\\partial}: \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nIn this paper, with the appropriate regularity condition we consider only the subspace $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (see Definition 2.8). It follows that\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nfor all $q, 0 \\leq q \\leq n-1$. We can then define the cohomology group\n\n$$\nH_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}):=\\frac{\\operatorname{Ker} \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)}{\\operatorname{Im} \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q-1}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)}\n$$\n\nand we call it the $m$-th $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group. Let $h_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ denote the dimension of $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$. We define the index of the $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$-complex as follows (once $h_{m}^{q}<\\infty$ is established; see Theorem 4.22):\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{index}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\text {-complex }\\right):=\\sum_{q=0}^{n}(-1)^{q} h_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})\n$$\n\nwhich is metric independent.\nFor every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ the natural map $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}) \\rightarrow H^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ into the usual Dolbeault cohomology group is not expected to be injective in general; $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ is not going to be considered as an $m$-th component of $H^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$. Compare Proposition 6.6 and Remark 6.8.\n\nTo show that $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ is finite-dimensional, we define a (non $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant) Hermitian metric $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$ for any fixed $m \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$ where $a>\\frac{1}{2} m \\geq 0$ (see (3.21) and Remark 3.4) and develop a Hodge theory for the associated (Kodaira) Laplacian $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ (4.1). See (5.6) for a modified version $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}$ (resp. $\\left.\\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}\\right)$ of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}$ (resp. $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{\\pm}$); this modification is indispensable to our approach. As a result, we can express the index of the $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$-complex in (1.4) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{index}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\text {-complex }\\right) & =\\sum_{q \\text { even }} \\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}-\\sum_{q \\text { odd }} \\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{+}-\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{-} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c+}-\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c-}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(see Corollary 4.24, Lemma 5.11, and Theorem 5.12). For all of these we construct certain $L^{2}$-spaces called $m$-spaces, and show that these $m$-spaces are non-trivial (Remark $6.8 i$ )).\n\nRemark that the cohomology group (1.3) is metric-independent and meaningful for any integers $m$. But our approach starts with a fixed $m \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$ (see Remark 1.2 below for $m<0$ ) and constructs the metric $G_{a, m}$ with a parameter \" $a$ \" adapting to $m$. As $m$ varies and thus the metric $G_{a, m}$ might vary, there does not exist a fixed $L^{2}$-space (with respect to a fixed metric) that can simultaneously accommodate all these \" $m$-components\"; compare Remark $6.8 i i$ ). This is one of the features that distinguish the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action from our previous $S^{1}$-action [18] (whose $m$-th Fourier components can naturally embed into a fixed $L^{2}$-space and span (over $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ ) the whole space).\n\nWe can extend the above setting to the bundle case. For later use we remark that we can approximate the heat kernel of $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}$ by a more manageable quantity $P_{m, t}^{0}($ see $(1.12))$.\n\nWith respect to the locally free action $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\theta}\\right)$, we can talk about the period of a point. We say $\\frac{2 \\pi}{l}$ is the period of a point $x$ if $l=\\max \\left\\{l^{\\prime} \\in N: e^{i \\frac{2 \\pi}{l^{\\prime}}} \\circ x=x\\right\\}$. Let $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$ be the largest period.\n\nLet $L_{\\Sigma}$ be the holomorphic line bundle over $\\Sigma$, whose fibre at $q \\in \\Sigma$ consists of tangents to the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit through $q$ (see the lines above (3.1)). We take a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ invariant Hermitian (fibre) metric $\\|\\cdot\\|$ on $L_{\\Sigma}$ (see Step 1 in Section 3). Define the first Chern form $c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\|\\cdot\\|\\right)$ of $L_{\\Sigma}$ with respect to $\\|\\cdot\\|$. Note that $L_{\\Sigma}$ is a holomorphic subbundle of $T^{1,0} \\Sigma$ (although the metric $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is not the induced one). The $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant quotient bundle $T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}$ inherits a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant metric $g_{\\text {quot }}$ from the aforementioned metric $G_{a, m}$, which is isometric to $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (see (3.9) or (3.21), and Lemma 8.10). The $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Todd form $T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right)$ and similarly the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Chern character form $c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ for a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over $\\Sigma$ with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric $h_{E}$ can be defined. Finally, define $\\delta_{p \\mid m}=1$ if $p \\mid m$ and 0 if $p \\nmid m$.\n\nWe have the following index theorem (Theorem 1.1), which is a local index theorem in the sense similar to [6] that the index density can be formed and computed from certain heat kernel formulation on the complex manifold $\\Sigma$ (see the discussion below). Let $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ denote the singular stratum in $\\Sigma$, associated to $\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}:=\\cup_{j} G_{j}$, $\\tilde{g} \\neq 1$. See (8.44) and (8.9) for the definition of $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$. For the associated integrand $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x)$ below we refer the reader to (8.48) for the definition and (8.57) for an expression in terms of Todd genus form and Chern character form. Let $l(x)$ be as in\n\n(3.3). Let $d v_{\\Sigma \\beta, m}$ denote the volume form of $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ with respect to the metric induced from $G_{a, m}$. Let $|\\cdot|_{2 n}$ denote the $2 n$-form part of a differential form, where $2 n=$ $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\Sigma$. Denote the volume of $\\Sigma$ associated to $G_{a, m}$ by $d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ (see (3.22)). Define the following index density function $H R R_{m}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}, E\\right)$ of Hirzebruch-RiemannRoch type by\n\n$$\n:=\\quad \\frac{H R R_{m}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}, E\\right)}{\\frac{p \\delta_{p \\mid m}\\left[T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{q u o t}\\right) \\wedge c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) \\wedge e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}, \\||\\cdot|\\right)} \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{m}\\right]_{2 n}}{d v_{\\Sigma, m}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$ is the largest period as aforementioned. Here $d \\tilde{v}_{m}$ on $\\Sigma$ restricts to a normalized area form for $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbits with the integral equal to 1 (see (3.24) and (3.27)).\n\nMost often we implicitly assume $p=1$ unless specified otherwise. (If $p>1$ the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action is not effective [32, p.175], and by redefining the action the new $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action has $p=1$ (cf. [18, p.19]).)\n\nWe compute index $\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}\\right.$-complex) through the integral of the supertrace of $P_{m, t}^{0}$ $\\left(\\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x):=\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,+}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,-}(x, x)\\right)$, whose limit as $t \\rightarrow 0$ can be expressed in terms of $H R R_{m}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}, E\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x)$ as follows.\n\nTheorem 1.1. (proved in Subsection 8.3) With the notations above, suppose that $\\Sigma$ is an n-dimensional (open) complex manifold with a holomorphic, proper $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ action $\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)$. Assume that the $R^{+}$part $\\sigma(\\rho)$ is globally free, the $S^{1}$ part $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\theta}\\right)$ is locally free and the orbit space $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ is compact, and that the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action is effective (equivalently the largest period $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$ above is $2 \\pi$ ). Let $\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ be a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over $\\tilde{\\Sigma}$. Then for every $m \\in\\{0\\} \\cup \\mathbb{N}$\ni) it holds that in the space of generalized sections\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) \\\\\n= & H R R_{m}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}, E\\right)+\\sum_{\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}, \\tilde{g} \\neq 1} \\tilde{g}^{-m} \\overline{\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x)} l^{m}(x) \\delta_{\\Sigma \\beta}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nii) the following index is well defined and satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { index }\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{E} \\text {-complex }\\right)\\left(=\\sum_{q=0}^{n}(-1)^{q} h_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}(E)) \\text { as in (1.4)) }\\right. \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\Sigma} H R R_{m}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}, E\\right) d v_{\\Sigma, m}+\\sum_{\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}, \\tilde{g} \\neq 1} \\tilde{g}^{m} \\int_{\\Sigma \\tilde{g}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x) l^{m}(x) d v_{\\Sigma \\beta, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSee Example 8.25 for an illustration. Even though this example might be the most basic one, its associated index formula presents an algebraic identity that does not seem to be easily discovered at first hand; see (8.65), (8.64) and (8.62).\n\nRemark 1.2. Write $H_{m, \\sigma}^{q}$ for $H_{m}^{q}$ to indicate the dependence on the action $\\sigma$. Since $H_{-m, \\tilde{\\sigma}}^{q}=H_{m, \\sigma}^{q}$ where the action $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\lambda):=\\sigma\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ of cohomology groups (with regularity conditions in Definition 2.8 where if $w_{\\sigma}, w_{\\tilde{\\sigma}}$ denote the associated $w$-coordinates then $\\left.w_{\\tilde{\\sigma}}=w_{\\sigma}^{-1}\\right)$, a similar statement of Theorem 1.1 for $m<0$ holds true as well. Details are omitted.\n\nRemark that the RHS of (1.6) must be metric-independent, as the LHS is so. For the verification that the integral in (1.6) is independent of the choice of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metrics used to compute $T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}, c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}$, and $c_{1}$, see Proposition 8.26\n\nThere is a link between our result and a result of Kawasaki in [52] on Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula over complex orbifolds. Compared to Kawasaki's, we get a Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula through (1.6), i.e. an integral over a complex manifold (with one dimension higher though) and finitely many integrals over complex submanifolds corresponding to singular strata $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (see (1.7) below). Moreover, from our heat kernel approach on $\\Sigma$ lying over the compact complex orbifold $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ we also realize that those terms arising from the lower-dimensional strata in [52] correspond to the integrals over $\\Sigma^{\\sharp}$ in our situation (cf. (8.116)), via a Lefschetz type heat kernel asymptotics on certain local slices $V_{j}$ of $\\Sigma$ (see (8.35), (8.36)). Those strata-contribution of Kawasaki [52] are reconsidered by Duistermaat [32, Sections 14.4, 14.6] as integrations over \"fixed point orbifolds\" called by him, which can be mapped but not necessarily embedded, into the original orbifold. It seems to us that the integral expression (1.6) is conceptually simpler. See [67] and [71, p.92] for related results. For $m=0$, in comparison with the formula of [32, (14.3) on p.184] it is perhaps interesting to note that our regions of integration $\\Sigma^{\\sharp}$ (8.44) in (1.6) appear firsthand and intrinsic as they are natural subspaces of the space $\\Sigma$ itself, whereas those in [32] denoted by $\\hat{F}$ for the corresponding integrals are introduced in a somewhat ad hoc manner; see (8.116) for an integral comparison and Subsections 8.4, 8.5 for details. When $m \\neq 0$, the comparison is made indirectly. One needs to convert this $m$-index to a \" 0 -index with the extra line bundle $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m^{n}}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right.$ denotes the dual of the forementioned $\\left.L_{\\Sigma}\\right)$ and then compare; see Remark 8.42. In short our formula unifies the $\\left\\{m\\right.$-index $\\}_{m}$ into a single formula, whereas this interpretation is not quite the case with Duistermaat's formula (unless $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ is added). Remark that this comparison is in some way troubled by the convention adopted by Duistermaat himself (see the second paragraph of Subsection 8.4). We hope that some clarification (with corrections) of the interpretations in this and other literature is made here as is the case with the comparison.\n\nWe remark that after Kawasaki's work as mentioned above, some other results related to index theory on orbifolds were obtained. Among others, X. Ma studied the analytic torsion and the Quillen metric for an orbifold K\u00e4hler fibration in [60], [61].\n\nOn the way to proving Theorem 1.1, we obtain an asymptotic expansion for the diagonal of the transversal heat kernel $e^{-t \\stackrel{\\circ}{C}_{m}^{c}}$ (cf. (5.8)). Or we may regard it as another principal result of this paper, of which Theorem 1.1 may be viewed as an application. See Theorem 1.3 below, and Footnote ${ }^{1}$ (the paragraph after Remark 1.5) for a comparison with other approaches.\n\nLet $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p_{1}}, p=p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots<p_{k}$, be all possible periods of the locally free action $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\gamma}\\right)$. Define $\\Sigma_{p_{j}}:=\\left\\{x \\in \\Sigma\\right.$ : the period of $x$ is $\\left.\\frac{2 \\pi}{p_{j}}\\right\\}$ and\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}:=\\cup_{j=2}^{k} \\Sigma_{p_{j}}\n$$\n\nHere $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}, p=p_{1}$, is the largest period. Let $\\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ denote a certain distance between $x$ and $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (see (7.13) for the definition).\n\nThe following is proved in Sections 6 and 7 (in paragraphs prior to Remark 7.10). In iii) of the following theorem, for the meaning of \" $\\sim$ \" we refer to Remark 1.5 below, where the usual use of $C^{l}$-norm is modified to be \" $C_{B}^{l}$-norm\".\n\nTheorem 1.3. i) (Existence and uniqueness) The heat kernel $e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}$ for $\\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}$ exists and is unique.\nii) (Asymptotic expansion (I)) Let $x \\in \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$. For every $N_{0} \\geq N_{0}(n)$ there exist constants $C_{N_{0}}, \\delta=\\delta\\left(N_{0}\\right)>0$ (both independent of $x$ ) and functions $b_{s}$ (which are given by $b_{s}(z, \\zeta)$ of (6.84) at $z=\\zeta, s=n-1-j$ with $j=0, \\cdots, N_{0}$ ) such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(x, x)-p \\delta_{p \\mid m} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_{0}} t^{-(n-1)+j} b_{n-1-j}(z(x)) t^{m}(x)\\right| \\\\\n\\leq & C_{N_{0}} l^{m}(x)\\left(t^{-(n-1)+N_{0}+1}+t^{-(n-1)} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{p} \\delta\\left(e \\cdot \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)^{2}}{t}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor $0<t<\\delta$ and some constant $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0}>0$ (independent of $N_{0}$ and $x$ ). Here $l(x)$ is as in (3.3) and $N_{0}(n)$ is some explicit function in $n$; for instance one may take $N_{0}(n)$ $=n+1$.\niii) (Asymptotic expansion (II)) $e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(x, y)$ has the following asymptotic expansion:\n\n$$\ne^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(x, y) \\sim t^{-(n-1)} a_{n-1}(t, x, y)+t^{-(n-2)} a_{n-2}(t, x, y)+\\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere for $(x, y) \\in \\Sigma \\times \\Sigma$ with $x=(z, w), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)$ in local coordinates\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{s}(t, x, y)=l(y)^{m} \\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left\\{e^{-\\frac{j \\xi_{s}(z, \\zeta)}{4 t}} b_{s}(z, \\zeta)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\eta^{-m} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) \\xi^{-m}\\right\\} \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} y}^{*} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi), s=n-1, n-2, \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)$ is as in (6.25), $\\tilde{d}_{M}(z, \\zeta)$ and $b_{s}(z, \\zeta)$ as in (6.84), and to simplify notations we use $\\zeta, \\eta^{-m}$ and $\\vartheta$ to denote $\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right), \\eta^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)$ and $\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)$ respectively and $\\varphi_{j}, \\tau_{j}, \\sigma_{j}$ are as in (1.12).\n\nRemark 1.4. It can be shown that $a_{s}(t, x, y)$ has a nontrivial dependence on $t$ even for $x=y$ and essentially descends to $\\underline{a}_{s}(t, \\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ on the compact complex orbifold $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ via $\\pi: \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma / \\sigma$ (cf. Remark 6.20 and Theorem 2.3). Similarly $e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(x, y)$ on $\\Sigma$ descends to $e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(\\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ on $M$, which coincides with an appropriate heat kernel on $M$ (cf. Remark 6.20). It is worth noting that $e^{-t \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}}(\\pi(x), \\pi(x))$ on $M$ has an asymptotic expansion with $t$-dependent coefficients by (1.9). This \" $t$-dependence\" is unavoidable if one wants the asymptotic expansion to be valid uniformly and entirely on $M$ (rather than just piecewise valid with respect to the strata). See [18, Remarks 1.6 and 1.7] for geometrical interpretations in this regard. The intrinsic nature, in contrast to $a_{s}(t, x, y)$, of $b_{s}(z, \\zeta)$ is remarked after (7.9); see Remark 6.20 for $a_{s}(t, x, y)$ in this regard.\n\nRemark 1.5. For the meaning of the above \" $\\sim$ \" we refer to Remark 7.11 and [18, Definition 5.5] with their $C^{k}$-norm replaced by the $C_{B}^{k}$-norm (see (6.9)). This $C_{B}^{k}$-norm is perhaps a novel notion and is pervasively used in Section 6. There is an analogue of (1.8) for CR manifolds with $S^{1}$-action (cf. [18, (6.2) in p.92]). The appearance of the length function $l(y)$ in the asymptotic expansions shows a special feature of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. We can generalize (1.8) to $C_{B}^{k}$ estimates by reducing the power of $t$ by $\\frac{k}{2}$ on the right hand side (Remark 7.10). Moreover, for $x \\in \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ an estimate and proof similar to (1.8) holds as well; we omit the details here (cf. [18, Theorem 6.1]). For the corresponding results on CR manifolds with $S^{1}$-action see $[18,(1.17)$ in p.10].\n\nThe estimates in Theorem 1.3 are similar in expression to those in the CR case [18] in which the above length function $l(x)$ is not existing (or viewed as reducing to the constant 1). The fact that the dependence of $a_{i}(t, x, x)$ on $t$ is in general nontrivial is basically a reflection of the non-freeness of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. As such the asymptotic expansion (1.9), different from the classical-looking ones which have been studied in the recent literature and involve no such $t$-dependence (cf. [18, Section 7.1] and references therein) can, with better accuracy ${ }^{1}$, find its application to the desired index formula here. The formula (1.9) does not appear feasible from the viewpoint of $M$. This may be due to that we mainly work on the total space $\\Sigma$ rather than the quotient space $\\Sigma / \\sigma=M$.\n\nOur method and local index formula have an application to the following problems. Let us generalize $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action to $G$-action $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ on a complex manifold $M$, where $G$ is a connected complex reductive Lie group. Let $\\bar{G}$ be a projective compactification (compatible with the group action in the sense that the left action of $G$ on $G$ extends holomorphically to an action of $G$ on $\\bar{G}$ ) given in [76] or [73, VIII-8]. Let $H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{G}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ denote the space of all $G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms via the action $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ (see Notation 9.4).\nTheorem 1.6. (proof seated above Remark 9.15) Let $G$ be a connected complex reductive Lie group. Suppose that we have a holomorphic $G$-action $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ on a complex manifold $M$ (compact or noncompact) admitting a meromorphic extension $\\hat{\\sigma}_{M}^{G}$ : $\\bar{G} \\times M \\rightarrow->M$ (meromorphic map in the sense of Remmert). Here no local freeness of the $G$-action is assumed. Then there holds\n\n$$\nH^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{G}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $M$ is projective and $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ is algebraic, then $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ automatically extends meromorphically to $\\bar{G} \\times M \\rightarrow->M$ (see Remark 9.6 for K\u00e4hler cases). Theorem 1.6 generalizes a result of Carrel and Sommese [14, Corollary IV], which deals with $\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)^{d}$-action on compact K\u00e4hler manifolds using their $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant decomposition method.\n\nTheorem 1.6 can be further generalized in the following sense. Consider a (open) complex manifold $P$ with two holomorphic, proper, locally free $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-actions $\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}$. For simplicity, we assume $\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\left(\\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ action is globally free while $S^{1}\\left(\\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ action is locally free. Then $B:=P / \\sigma_{2}$ and $M:=P / \\sigma_{1}$ are two complex orbifolds (see Theorem 2.3). For basic material on complex orbifolds ${ }^{2}$, we refer to [28, pp 408-410], [4, pp 206-207] or [52]. Assume further that $\\sigma_{2}$ commutes with $\\sigma_{1}$, i.e. $\\sigma_{2}(\\lambda) \\circ \\sigma_{1}(\\zeta)$ $=\\sigma_{1}(\\zeta) \\circ \\sigma_{2}(\\lambda)$ on $P$ for $\\lambda, \\zeta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. It follows that $\\sigma_{2}$ preserves $\\sigma_{1}$-orbits and induces a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{M}$ on $P / \\sigma_{1}=: M$. We also assume that $\\sigma_{2}$ is nondegenerate in the sense that it does not act on $\\sigma_{1}$-orbits trivially (see the remarks above (10.1)).\nTheorem 1.7. (proof seated after Lemma 10.11) With notations and assumptions explained above, we suppose that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M \\rightarrow->$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Indeed, as $t \\rightarrow 0^{+}$our asymptotic expansion approaches the classical-looking one in a pointwise, non-uniform manner. This is thought to partially explain the somewhat strange discontinuity phenomenon incurred by the conventional expansion when used across the different strata (cf. [18, Section 7.1], [69, (4.7)]). Of course, no such discontinuity occurs if using (1.9).\n    ${ }^{2}$ For instance, in what follows $\\Omega_{M}^{p}$ for the orbifold $M$ is understood in the orbifold sense: a local section $\\omega$ of $\\Omega_{M}^{p}$ means a local section $\\hat{\\omega}$ of $\\Omega_{\\bar{D}}^{p}$ on some (smooth) orbifold chart $\\bar{U}$, which is required to be invariant under the associated local group.\n\nM. Recall $B:=P / \\sigma_{2}$ and $M:=P / \\sigma_{1}$. Assume that $B, M$ are compact. Then we have a natural linear isomorphism\n\n$$\nH^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\simeq H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nAssume further that $B$ is smooth and K\u00e4hler. Then we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} M}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} P}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H_{0, \\sigma_{2}}^{p}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right)\n$$\n\nand this can be computed through the local index formula (1.6) of Theorem 1.1 for $m=0$. A generalization of (1.10) to certain noncompact cases is possible. See the comments in the proof of this theorem; compare Theorem 1.6.\n\nLet $\\sigma_{M}\\left(=\\sigma_{M}^{G}\\right)$ be as in Theorem 1.6. By taking $P=\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times M$ as a trivial, principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle on $M$ and the obvious \"diagonal action\" on $P$ induced by $\\sigma_{M}$ on $M$ as $\\sigma_{2}$ (which is seen to be nondegenerate in the sense above). Theorem 1.7 soon brings us back to the situation of Theorem 1.6 for $G=\\mathbb{C}^{*}$.\n\nThe above work of having two $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-actions might be related to the work on a certain type of moduli spaces having two foliations, such as the one from physics and string theory, which is briefly explained in [11, (1.4) of Introduction, p. 320]. In our case, the following phenomenon seems to be of interest:\n\nCorollary 1.8. With notations and assumptions explained prior to Theorem 1.7, assume further that $\\sigma_{1}$ is also nondegenerate and thus induces a nontrivial holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{B}$ on $P / \\sigma_{2}=: B$. Suppose that both $B$ and $M$ are smooth, projective and both actions $\\sigma_{M}$ and $\\sigma_{B}$ are algebraic. Then we have natural linear isomorphisms\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) & \\simeq H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) \\\\\nH^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) & \\simeq H_{0, \\sigma_{B}}^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand hence the isomorphism by Theorem 1.6\n\n$$\nH^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\simeq H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, we have (1.11) for both $B$ and $M$ as the LHS while the right hand side can be computed through the local index formula (1.6) of Theorem 1.1 for $m=0$.\n\nRemark 1.9. For a general $G$ (connected complex reductive Lie group) a similar result as the first half of Corollary 1.8 holds (by method parallel to that of Theorem 1.6 generalizing $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ to $G$, see the last paragraph of the proof of Theorem 1.6). However we haven't had the local index formula in the second half of Corollary 1.8 for $G$ general.\n\nOur result Theorem 1.1 (via Theorem 1.3) may be placed in the context of index theorems of transversal type, which can be linked to an extension of Atiyah-Singer index theory to the class of transversally elliptic operators, cf. [67], [2], [36]. There are, however, differences between those approaches and that of ours. For instance, our base space $\\Sigma$ and the group $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ are non-compact; we aim at local index type results in the sense closely related to [6, Chap.4]; the notion of \"distribution-index\" as originally advocated by Atiyah [2] (see also [67] for further results and references), is not explicitly involved in the present work. It seems that none of those works uses the (transversal) heat kernel approach in the same way as we did here. For potential\n\nlinks with other areas of research, see the discussion later in this Introduction and the footnote there.\n\nIn the remaining part of this Introduction, let us first outline some ingredients involved in our proofs. Since our goal is to get a local index density whose integral is the above index, it is natural to use heat kernel method. Due to our setup, we are led to consider what we call \"transversally\" spin\" Dirac operator; since $\\Sigma$ may not be K\u00e4hler, we also need a modified version of this transversal Dirac operator (in order to catch a local index density by an asymptotic heat kernel for its Kodaira-type Laplacian).\n\nFor $\\Sigma$ being the total space of a holomorphic line bundle $L$ (with the zero section removed) over a compact complex manifold $M$, there is a one-one correspondence between elements in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ and sections in $\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ over $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (cf. Proposition 2.9). Motivated by this observation, we construct an approximate heat kernel on $\\Sigma$ by patching up local Dirichlet heat kernels $K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)$ on $M$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_{m, t}^{0} & :=\\sum_{j(\\text { finite })} H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m} \\\\\nH_{m, t}^{j}(x, y) & :=\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\eta^{-m} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\pi_{m}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the $m$-space $L_{m}^{2, *}(\\Sigma, E)\\left(L^{2}\\right.$ completion of $\\left.\\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma, E)\\right), x=(z, w), w=|w| e^{i \\phi}, y=(\\zeta, \\eta), \\eta=|\\eta| e^{i \\theta}, \\varphi_{j}$ being a smooth partition of unity for $\\Sigma$ with $\\varphi_{j}(x)=\\varphi_{j}(z, \\phi), \\tau_{j}, \\sigma_{j}$ some cutoff functions and $l(y)=h(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta}) \\eta \\bar{\\eta}$ (see (3.4) in Section 3 and Section 6 for details).\n\nOne of our main technical tasks is to evaluate $P_{m, t}^{0}$ along the diagonal $(x, x)$. However, this evaluation becomes nontrivial due to the projection operator $\\pi_{m}$. More precisely (see (6.26))\n\n$$\n\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}} H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ x\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ x}^{*} \\xi^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)\n$$\n\nHere we have denoted $\\sigma\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right)(x)$ by $\\xi^{-1} \\circ x$ (or $\\xi^{-1} x$ for short) and $d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)$ is a certain 2 -form in the action parameter $\\xi$ (see (6.25)).\n\nThe salient fact is that the value at the diagonal element $(x, x)$ in the LHS of (1.13) involves those at the off-diagonal element $\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ x\\right)$ in the RHS of (1.13). Let us give a little more explanation as follows.\n\nThe integral (1.13) over the angle variable part of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ gives rise to a diagonal term for small angular range (cf. (7.4)) and a nondiagonal term for large angular range (cf. discussions from (7.21) onwards). The latter provides a term expressed in exponential to the negative distance square over $t$ (see the last term in the RHS of (1.8)) when one tries to estimate the supertrace of the heat kernel asymptotic expansion. It ends up that this nondiagonal term has contribution obtained from lower dimensional strata; the detail involves \"Lefschetz trace\" roughly explained as follows. When one is evaluating the supertrace around a stratum point, say $P$, the local isotropy group $G_{j}$ (identifiable as local orbifold structure group) comes into play. The original transverse supertrace at $P$ becomes transformed to a nontransversal /ordinary supertrace twisted by $g \\in G_{j}$ (from which the above nondiagonal term arises). Interestingly, this (as $t \\rightarrow 0$ ) is soon recognized essentially as the local density (at $P$ ) of the Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch; the local version of LRR finds an application here (unclear to us whether any other applications of the local LRR exist elsewhere in the literature). See (8.35) for the above-mentioned twisting as\n\nwell as the paragraph below it. Let us note that this step is much inspired by a theorem of Berline-Getzler-Vergne [6, Theorem 6.11], whose proof is difficult and whose statement is remarkable in that the asymptotic expansion given there involves generalized functions (compare [21] which studies certain continuity issues within the parameter-dependent setting). In this regard, compare the paragraph seated above Subsection 8.4 about a flaw in our previous work [18], [19]. This analytical implication has an effect on the algebraic result of Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-RiemannRoch theorem for compact complex orbifolds $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (see the second paragraph after Remark 1.2).\n\nPrior to the above, a more basic technical task worth mentioning is the construction of the (non $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant, incomplete) Hermitian metric $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$ for our purposes. The troubling issues here are two-fold: the noncompactness of $\\Sigma$ as well as that of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$. It turns out that our metric $G_{a, m}$ is not $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant, yet by using it we manage to design and work out some geometric constructions on $\\Sigma$ and on $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ respectively in such a way that they are mutually \"compatible\" in an appropriate context (cf. Proposition 3.12 and Corollary 3.19). Although there are a fair amount of technicalities, let us content ourselves with pointing out that this compatibility just mentioned, plays a crucial role not only at a conceptual level but also leading us to technically fulfill analytical requirements in the long process (cf. Proposition 5.3 and Sections 6, 7). Fortunately, all of these is made possible via special features of our metric $G_{a, m}$; this we can't quite see conceptually beforehand. The question whether a different choice of metrics can lead to similar results is far from obvious to us, but there appears to be a certain set of conditions (not formulated in this paper) required for the metric to do the job. Remark that this aspect presents a major difference between points of departure in this paper and in [18] where the compactness of the manifold $X$ and that of the group $S^{1}$, make a sharp contrast to the effect that their metric is simply chosen to be $S^{1}$-invariant, which saves a lot of work there.\n\nIn recent decades there appeared increasingly active study of heat kernels in the transversal sense or even more generalized sense. See e.g. [69], [70] and [18, Section 7.1] for some comments with extensive references. To the best of our understanding, most treatments in the existent literature are given under the compactness (or completeness) assumption which is either imposed on the manifold or on the group or both. Our present work makes an attempt towards some noncompact issues. It is likely, although technically rather unclear at this stage, that the results here admit a generalization to complex Lie groups other than $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$. Remark also that the asymptotic expansion (in $t$ ) of trace integrals $\\int_{\\Sigma} T r e^{-i \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{C} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{C}}(x, x) d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ is not discussed here (cf. some treatment in [18, Section 7] for CR cases and [70] for foliations); some needed tools have been developed in [20] and for partial results in CR cases see [Ibid., Theorem 1.1]. We hope to come back to some of these in future publication.\n\nDue to the noncompactness some difficulties also occur in the treatment of the Hodge theory part; compare the introductory paragraph of Section 4. One difficulty involves the trouble that the seemingly natural and conventional Sobolev $s$-norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}$ (cf. (4.2)) is unsuitable. One novelty of Section 4 is introducing slightly complicated modifications denoted by $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}((4.3),(4.5)$ and 4.8$)$, whose motivations are hidden in Propositions 3.11 and 3.12. Compare the $C_{H}^{s}$ norm mentioned in Remark 1.5. With this modification the approach adopted in\n\nthe introductory paragraph of Section 4 can be developed and finally carried out. Classical results: Rellich compactness, elliptic estimates, elliptic regularity, etc., can find their analogues in this transversal setting, based on the modified norms. Among other things, the finite-dimensionality of $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ can be proved here. Remark that it is possible to prove the finite-dimensionality result independently by using Theorem 2.3, (10.30) and Remark 10.10 that may bring some study on $\\Sigma$ to the orbifold $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$. However, one purpose of this paper is that instead of working on $M$ directly one works on $\\Sigma$ itself so that if needed $M$ is then studied via \"dimension reduction\" or \"Kaluza-Klein reduction\", which in our view is a methodology in the same spirit as ours and was already used for certain purposes in physics. See more about it later in this Introduction.\n\nAnother feature here distinct from [18] is the following. Given the complex analytic equivalence $\\Sigma \\cong X_{1} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\cong X_{2} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$as mentioned previously, we cannot conclude the CR equivalence $X_{1} \\cong X_{2}$. For instance, take $\\Sigma=L \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}$ of a holomorphic line bundle $L$ on $M$, and the circle bundle $X \\subset L \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}$. Both $\\Sigma$ and $X$ have the same quotient $M=X / S^{1}=\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. While $X$ depends on the choice of a Hermitian metric on $L, \\Sigma$ does not. Thus, if we want to work on index theorems \"upstairs\" such as $\\Sigma$ or $X$, there is in general only non-canonical choice of $X$ such that $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\cong \\Sigma$. Since the local index theorem is usually meant to be computable from the associated heat kernel asymptotics and since these heat kernels are not immediately transferable from the CR case [18] to the complex case (and vice versa), the present paper provides the needed technical details precisely for the complex case.\n\nMoreover, $\\Sigma$ is akin to algebro-geometric objects. In this connection it seems possible and of interest to formulate an analogue of the index theorem discussed here within an algebraic setting. But then how this formulation of results can be proved in a purely algebraic manner remains to be seen.\n\nInspired by the potential algebraic interpretation above, one may be naturally led to questions along the following line of thought. Firstly as our index theorem may be viewed as a transversal Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem (HRR for short), one may ask for a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem (GRR for short) or family index theorem in the transversal sense similar to that as considered here. Secondly, the development of the so-called \"algebraic cobordism\" in the last decade (see the monograph [58] of M. Levine and F. Morel) encodes the classical GRR theorem, cf. [58, Subsection 4.2.4] for a precise explanation. In recent years an equivariant algebraic cobordism theory for schemes $X$ with an action by a linear algebraic group $G$ was constructed by J. Heller and J. Malag\u00f3r-L\u00f3pez [47] (see also [55] and [59]). In the case where the geometric quotient $X \\rightarrow X / G$ exists and is realized as a principal $G$-bundle, there exists an isomorphism between the ordinary algebraic cobordism $\\Omega_{*}(X / G)$ of $X / G$ and the equivariant algebraic cobordism $\\Omega_{*+\\operatorname{dim} G}^{G}(X)$ of $X$ (see [47, Proposition 27]). In this connection and in view of our Proposition 2.9 or Remark 10.9 (with $\\Sigma$ as $X$ and $M=\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ as $X / G$ ), the present transversal index theorem on $\\Sigma$ in its algebraic context might be linked to a version of \"equivariant GRR or HRR theorem\" which by analogy with [58, Subsection 4.2.4]\n\njust mentioned might be expected, or be encoded in the theory of the equivariant algebraic cobordism $\\Omega_{*}^{G}(\\Sigma)$ with $G=\\mathbb{C}^{*} .{ }^{3}$ We hope to turn to it in future publication.\n\nIn addition to Corollary 1.8 above, we remark that the framework set up in this paper echos certain classical constructions in physics, at least from a philosophical point of view. In the approach of the so-called Kaluza-Klein reduction (e.g. [5, Section 7.1], [40, p.399], [51, Section 4.1]), a gauge field (e.g. one in electromagnetic theory) on a space $M$ combined with a metric $g$ on $M$ can be thought of as a certain metric (cf. gravity) on the associated principal bundle $P$ over $M$, because the connection from this gauge field induces certain \"horizontal spaces $H$ \" in $P$ and hence, equipping $H$ essentially with the metric $g$ on $M$ (and also \"vertical part\" of $P$ with group invariant metric) leads to a natural metric on $P$; the process here is basically reversible from $P$ to $M$ on which a gauge field is then induced. A recent work of the physicist N. Nekrasov makes use of such K-K picture to set up for $M$ a two-dimensional torus a framework [66, (2.5)] similar to (1.2) of this paper. With this said the idea is turning to the study of objects (with appropriate symmetries) on $P$ rather than the direct study of those on $M$. Since the role played by orbifolds in string theory is increasingly indispensable (e.g. [5, Section 9.1], [40, Section 16.10], [51, Section 4.8]), it seems conceivable that certain geometric setup, adapted to orbifolds, similar to that of ours (arising from $\\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma / \\sigma=M$ here, in particular) may appear to be of relevance in the future. It is maybe worthwhile to mention that the above setup mostly uses compact Lie groups for the principal bundle $P$ whereas our group of action here is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$, and that our metric $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$ ( $\\Sigma$ thought of as a kind of \"orbifold principal bundle\" corresponding to $P$ above) is not $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant whereas the \"horizontal part\" of $\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant (cf. Lemma 8.10 i)). In this connection it seems a natural question to generalize Theorem 1.1 from the HRR to LRR (Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch) under the presence of \"symmetries\"; see the discussion below.\n\nLet us mention in passing that in the context of arithmetic schemes with a finite group action there has been some significant progress on Riemann-Roch type theorems, cf. [25]. It is initially of interest to study, for a finite Galois extension $N / K$ of number fields with $G=\\operatorname{Gal}(N / K)$, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{N}$ as a $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$-module via its class $\\left[\\mathcal{O}_{N}\\right]$ formed in an appropriate Grothendick group associated with the group ring $\\mathbb{Z}[G]$ combined with the study of the associated Euler characteristic [24]. A vast generalization from this initial interest to schemes, for such $G$-equivariant Euler characteristics (via Riemann-Roch or LRR type theorems as just mentioned) to yield applications to some number theory problems, can be found in, for example, [26]. Note that in these works the group $G$ is a finite group and the subscheme fixed by the action of $g \\in G$ can be nonempty for some $g \\neq$ identity.\n\nAs mentioned above it appears natural to ask for a Lefschetz type index theorem when a certain automorphism $\\gamma$ of $\\Sigma$ is given, including $\\gamma=$ Identity of the present paper as a special case. In our opinion the idea of this paper may be extended\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ In other related equivariant settings, approaches to Riemann-Roch using localization techniques algebraically or analytically have been pursued in works [12], [34], [35], [6] and [43]. For Riemann-Roch in (higher) equivariant K-theory, see the recent work [56]; see also [33] for RiemannRoch in equivariant Chow groups. These works focus on schemes with algebraic group action using algebraic methods, and the results there are neither valued in certain cohomology groups nor meant for local index theorems as considered in the context here.\n\nto such a situation, for which one may wish to generalize Theorem 1.3 to the $\\gamma$ twisted heat kernel asymptotics in the transversal setting (compare (8.35) for a nontransversal, ordinary situation). The details and the appropriate formulation are left to the interested reader.\n\nA natural problem, closely related to that of CR manifolds with $S^{1}$-action already treated in [46], is about the existence of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic embeddings of $\\Sigma$ when $c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\|\\cdot\\|\\right)$ (see Section 3 for $L_{\\Sigma}$ ) is negative (which corresponds to the strong pseudoconvexity in the CR case [18, p.46]). Note that in the CR version of the HRR theorem as stated in [18, p.16] the term $-d \\omega_{0}$ is positive when $X$ is strongly pseudoconvex (due to the convention of the Reeb vector field $T$ given in [18, Subsection 2.2]). Moreover, for the weakly pseudoconvex situation certain Morse-type inequalities and vanishing theorems are expected to hold in this $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ version along the line similar to [49, Theorem 2.1] and [18, Proposition 1.21]. As far as orbifold line bundles are concerned (whose local sections consist of those of certain genuine line bundles $L$, that are invariant under the action of local orbifold groups on $L$ ), it is of interest to ask effectivity problems in an orbifold setting, analogous to those works in complex algebraic geometry including some by Siu and Demailly (cf. [74], [75], [30]). For the case of orbifold cyclic singularities, working directly on $\\Sigma$ may seem a natural approach in a similar spirit to that of the present paper. We leave these study to future publications.\n\nThe paper is organized briefly as follows. In Section 2 we discuss some basic material for complex manifolds with holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. Among others we show Theorem 2.3 that the quotient is a complex orbifold under the condition that the action is proper, the the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$part is globally free and the $S^{1}$-part is locally free. In Section 3 the (non $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant) Hermitian metric $G_{a, m}$ is carefully constructed and its properties are examined. In Sections 4 and 5 we develop the Hodge theory associated to the relevant (transversal) Laplacian or modified Laplacian (necessary for the non-K\u00e4hler case) and prove a McKean-Singer type formula (see Theorem 5.12) for the relevant index. An (transversal) approximate heat kernel is constructed in Section 6 and an asymptotic expansion is discussed in Section 7 in which we give the proof of Theorem 1.3. In Section 8 we give the proof of Theorem 1.1. Theorem 1.6 is proved in the end of Section 9 while Theorem 1.7 and Corollary 1.8 are proved in the end of Section 10 .\n\nAcknowledgements. J.-H.

Then we have\n\n$$\n\\digamma=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\zeta}=w \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}\n$$\n\nwith $w \\neq 0$.\nIn this paper, we consider only the case of locally free action so that $\\digamma(q) \\neq 0$ for all $q \\in \\Sigma$. Here we say that the action $\\sigma$ is locally free if for any given point $q$ $\\in \\Sigma, \\sigma(\\lambda) \\circ q=q$ with $\\lambda$ near 1 implies $\\lambda=1$.\n\nProposition 2.1. (Distinguished local coordinates) With the notation above, suppose $\\left\\{z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, w\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\tilde{z}_{1}, \\tilde{z}_{2}, . ., \\tilde{z}_{n-1}, \\tilde{w}\\right\\}$ are two systems of holomorphic coordinates near $q$ with $w \\neq 0, \\tilde{w} \\neq 0$ satisfying (2.2) (we sometimes assume $w(q)$ $=1, \\tilde{w}(q)=1$ for use later). Then on the overlap they are related as follows:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{w}=w \\varphi\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right), \\tilde{z}_{j}=\\mu_{j}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)(1 \\leq j \\leq n-1)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ (vanishing nowhere) and $\\mu_{j}$ are holomorphic functions. The $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ acts by\n\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda)\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, w\\right)=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, \\lambda w\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ near 1 .\nProof. From $w \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}=\\digamma=\\tilde{w} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nw \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{w}}{\\partial w}=\\tilde{w}, w \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{z}_{j}}{\\partial w}=0\n$$\n\nby the chain rule. The second equation of (2.5) implies the second formula of (2.3) since $w \\neq 0$. Differentiating the first equation of (2.5) in $w$ leads to $\\partial^{2} \\tilde{w} / \\partial w^{2}=0$. It follows that $\\tilde{w}=w \\varphi\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)+g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)$. Substituting this into the first equation of (2.5), we get $g=0$. We have shown the first formula of (2.3). The formula (2.4) follows from the fact that $w \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}=\\digamma$.\n\nThe distinguished local holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, w\\right)$ of Proposition 2.1 are often adopted throughout the paper without further mention.\n\nFor our purpose, the reader may keep in mind the following typical examples.\nExample 2.2. i) Let $X$ be a CR manifold with locally free, transversal $S^{1}$-action $e^{i \\theta}: X \\rightarrow X$ (denoted by $e^{i \\theta} \\circ x$ for $x \\in X$ ) preserving the CR structure $T^{1,0} X$ (see [18]). Define $T(x) \\in T_{x} X$ to be the tangent to the curve $e^{i \\theta} \\circ x \\subset X$ at $\\theta$ $=0$. Endow $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$with the almost complex structure $J$ defined by $J=J_{X}$ on $T^{1,0} X \\oplus T^{0,1} X$ and $J T=-r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}, J\\left(r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right)=T$. It is straightforward to check that\n\n$J$ is integrable and hence $\\Sigma:=X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$is a complex manifold. Define a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\rho e^{i \\theta}: \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ by $\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\circ(x, r)=\\left(e^{i \\theta} \\circ x, \\rho r\\right)$. We verify that this $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action preserves the complex structure on $X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Identify $X$ with $X \\times\\{1\\} \\subset X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. The CR structure $J_{X}$ on $X$ is the one induced from the complex structure $J$ on $\\Sigma$.\nii) Another natural class of examples arise from the total space $\\hat{L}$ of a holomorphic line bundle $L$ over a compact (without boundary) complex manifold $M$. An obvious $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma$ on $\\hat{L}$ is the nonzero fibre multiplication. One simply takes $\\Sigma$ $=\\hat{L} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}$.\n\nWith the local description of Proposition 2.1, we are going to prove (see Theorem 2.3 below) that $\\Sigma$ is the union of local holomorphic patches $\\left(D_{j},(z, w)\\right)$ satisfying (2.3) and (2.4) so that\n\n$$\nD_{j} \\ni(z, w)=(z, \\phi, r) \\in U_{j} \\times\\left(-\\delta_{j}, \\delta_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\left(\\Sigma=\\bigcup_{j=1}^{N} D_{j}, N \\leq \\infty\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $w=r e^{i \\phi}, U_{j}$ is an open domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n-1}, \\delta_{j}$ is a small positive number and $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$denotes the set of positive real numbers. Moreover, the holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right): \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ is described as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)(z, w) & =(z, \\rho e^{i \\theta} w) \\text { or } \\\\\n\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)(z, \\phi, r) & =(z, \\theta+\\phi, \\rho r), \\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor those $(z, w) \\in D_{j}$ such that $\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)(z, w) \\in D_{j}$ for all $\\theta$ with $|\\theta+\\phi|<\\delta_{j}$, and\nthe $S^{1}$-part $\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{i \\theta}\\right)$ of the action is locally free.\nNote that the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$part $\\sigma(\\rho)$ of the action is globally free if (2.7) and (2.6) hold.\nWe call the action $\\sigma$ proper if the map $\\sigma: \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ in (2.1) is proper, i.e. $\\sigma^{-1}(K)$ is compact as long as $K \\subset \\Sigma$ is compact.\n\nTheorem 2.3. Suppose that $\\Sigma$ is a complex manifold with a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right)$. Assume that the action $\\sigma$ is proper, the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$part $\\sigma(\\rho)$ is globally free and the $S^{1}$-part $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\theta}\\right)$ is locally free. Then (2.6), (2.7) and (2.8) hold. In this case $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ is a complex orbifold and a normal complex space. Suppose further that $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ is compact. Then $N$ in (2.6) can be finite.\nRemark 2.4. The normality of $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ here will be useful in the proof of Theorem 1.7 given in Section 9. The use of some other results proved in later sections may simplify part of the proof below; see Remark 2.5.\nProof. (of Theorem 2.3) Given any $\\bar{x} \\in \\Sigma$, by (2.4) there exists a neighborhood $\\bar{D}_{j}^{\\varepsilon}$ $\\subset \\Sigma$ of $\\bar{x}$ and a local holomorphic patch (trivialization) $\\psi_{j}^{-1}: \\bar{D}_{j}^{\\varepsilon} \\rightarrow U_{j} \\times\\left(-\\delta_{j}\\right.$, $\\left.\\delta_{j}\\right) \\times(1-\\varepsilon, 1+\\varepsilon)$ (since we will need to often use $\\psi_{j}^{*}$ in later sections, we choose to write $\\psi_{j}^{-1}$ here) where $U_{j}$ is an open domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ and $\\delta_{j}, \\varepsilon$ are small positive numbers, such that for all $x, \\tilde{x} \\in \\bar{D}_{j}^{\\varepsilon}$ with $\\psi_{j}^{-1}(x)=(z, \\phi, r), \\psi_{j}^{-1}(\\tilde{x})=(z, \\tilde{\\phi}, \\tilde{r})$, we have $x=\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\tilde{x}$ for some complex number $\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\left(-\\delta_{j}<\\theta+\\tilde{\\phi}<\\delta_{j}\\right)$ and\n\n$$\n(z, \\phi, r)=(z, \\theta+\\tilde{\\phi}, \\rho \\tilde{r})\n$$\n\nFurthermore, since the action is proper, we claim that we can find $\\bar{D}_{j}^{\\varepsilon}$ so that for all $x, \\tilde{x} \\in \\bar{D}_{j}^{\\varepsilon}$ with $\\psi_{j}^{-1}(x)=(z, \\phi, r), \\psi_{j}^{-1}(\\tilde{x})=(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{\\phi}, \\tilde{r})$,\n(2.10)\nif $x=\\sigma(\\rho) \\tilde{x}$ for $\\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$(and $U_{j}, \\delta_{j}$ sufficiently small), then $z=\\tilde{z}$ and $\\phi=\\tilde{\\phi}$.\n\nProof of (2.10): This essentially follows from the facts that $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$is a manifold by the properness and the global freeness of the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$-action, and that any sufficiently small slice in $\\Sigma$ transversal to the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$-orbits gives rise to a coordinate chart of $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. We omit the details.\n\nLet us denote $\\hat{D}_{j}^{e}$ by $\\hat{D}_{j}$ for simplicity. Denote the set $\\left\\{\\sigma(\\rho) x \\in \\Sigma: x \\in \\hat{D}_{j}\\right\\}$ by $\\sigma(\\rho) \\hat{D}_{j}$. Define $D_{j}$ to be the union $\\cup_{\\rho \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}}(\\sigma(\\rho) \\hat{D}_{j})$. Extend $\\psi_{j}^{-1}$ to the map\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}: D_{j} \\rightarrow U_{j} \\times\\left(-\\delta_{j}, \\delta_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}, \\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}(\\sigma(\\rho) x):=(z, \\phi, \\rho r)\n$$\n\nfor $x \\in \\hat{D}_{j}$ with $\\psi_{j}^{-1}(x)=(z, \\phi, r)$. We claim that $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}$ is well defined and a holomorphic diffeomorphism. Suppose $\\sigma(\\tilde{\\rho}) x=\\sigma(\\tilde{\\rho}) \\tilde{x}$ for $x, \\tilde{x} \\in \\hat{D}_{j}$ with $\\psi_{j}^{-1}(x)$ $=(z, \\phi, r), \\psi_{j}^{-1}(\\tilde{x})=(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{\\phi}, \\tilde{r})$. Then $x=\\sigma\\left(\\tilde{\\rho}^{-1} \\tilde{\\rho}\\right) \\tilde{x}$. By (2.10) we have $z=\\tilde{z}$ and $\\phi=\\tilde{\\phi}$. By the line above (2.9) that says $x=\\sigma\\left(\\rho e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\tilde{x}$ for some $\\rho e^{i \\theta}$ it follows from $\\phi=\\tilde{\\phi}$ and (2.9) that $\\theta=0$. Further $\\sigma\\left(\\rho^{-1} e^{-i \\theta} \\tilde{\\rho}^{-1} \\tilde{\\rho}\\right) \\tilde{x}=\\tilde{x}$ with $\\theta=0$ gives $\\tilde{\\rho}^{-1} \\tilde{\\rho}$ $=\\rho$ since the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$part of the action $\\sigma$ is globally free. Now we have\n\n$$\nr \\stackrel{(2.9)}{=} \\rho \\tilde{r}=\\tilde{\\rho}^{-1} \\tilde{\\rho} \\tilde{r}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\tilde{\\rho} r=\\tilde{\\rho} \\tilde{r}$. Together with $\\phi=\\tilde{\\phi}(\\theta=0$ in (2.9)) we obtain $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}(\\sigma(\\tilde{\\rho}) x)$ $=\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}(\\sigma(\\tilde{\\rho}) \\tilde{x})$ by the definition (2.11) of $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}$, giving the well-definedness of $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}$. Next it is not hard to see that $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}$ is injective and surjective. To show that $\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}$ is a holomorphic diffeomorphism, observe that $\\left.\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}\\right|_{\\sigma(\\rho) \\hat{D}_{j}}=\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\rho) \\circ \\psi_{j}^{-1} \\circ \\sigma\\left(\\rho^{-1}\\right)$ where $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\rho)$ acts on $U_{j} \\times\\left(-\\delta_{j}, \\delta_{j}\\right) \\times\\left(1-\\varepsilon_{j}, 1+\\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ by multiplying the third component by $\\rho$. Since $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\rho), \\psi_{j}$ and $\\sigma\\left(\\rho^{-1}\\right)$ are all holomorphic diffeomorphisms, we conclude that $\\left.\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}\\right|_{\\sigma(\\rho) \\hat{D}_{j}}$ hence that $\\left.\\tilde{\\psi}_{j}^{-1}\\right|_{D_{j}}$ is a holomorphic diffeomorphism. We have shown that $\\left\\{D_{j}\\right\\}_{j}$ form local holomorphic charts. The assertions (2.6), (2.7) and (2.8) follow.\n\nTo show that $M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma=\\left(\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right) / S^{1}$ has a natural orbifold structure, first note that $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}=: \\tilde{M}$ is a manifold (as mentioned earlier in this proof) with a locally free action of a compact Lie group $S^{1}$. The topological orbifold structure of $\\tilde{M} / S^{1}$ then follows from an argument in [32, p.173]. To see that $M$ is a complex orbifold (note that the invariance slice in [32, p.173] is not necessarily a complex analytic one), let $p \\in \\Sigma$ and $G$ be the finite isotropy subgroup of $S^{1}\\left(\\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ at $p$. Write $g q$ for $\\sigma(g) q$. For $p_{1}$ near $p$ and $g \\in G$ (so $g p_{1}$ near $g p=p$ ), $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}=g p_{1}$ are given in a coordinate chart $U \\times(-\\delta, \\delta) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$of $p=(z, 0,1)$ by $\\left(z_{i}, \\delta_{i}, r_{i}\\right), i=$ 1,2 , for some $z_{i} \\sim z, \\delta_{i} \\sim 0$ and $r_{i} \\sim 1$. In fact $r_{i}=1$ by Lemma $7.6 i$ ) (the proof of this particular part does not use the orbifold structure of $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ ). Identifying $U$ with $U \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}, g$ is going to induce a holomorphic diffeomorphism $\\tau(g)$ on $U$ (possibly after shrinking $U$ and $\\delta$ ) by the composition (compare Remark 2.5 below)\n\n$$\np_{1}=\\left(z_{1}, 0,1\\right) \\rightarrow g p_{1}=\\left(z_{2}, \\delta_{2}, r_{2}\\right)=\\left(z_{2}, \\delta_{2}, 1\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}\n$$\n\nwhere the second map arises from a (local) projection $\\pi_{U}:(z, \\theta, r) \\rightarrow(z, 0,1)$. We can now rewrite the action of $\\tau(g)$ at $p_{1}$ by\n\n$$\n\\tau(g)\\left(p_{1}\\right)=s_{-\\delta_{2}}\\left(g p_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $s_{-\\delta_{2}}=e^{-i \\delta_{2}} \\in S^{1}$ depends on $p_{1}$. Note that $\\tau(g): U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ is holomorphic since $\\sigma(g)$ and $\\pi_{U}$ are so. To directly prove that $\\tau(g)$ is a diffeomorphism, one may try to control $d \\tau(g)$ at $p$; the control is not obvious (however, see Remark 2.5).\n\nInstead, we are going to prove the group action property $\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right)=\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime}\\right) \\circ \\tau(g)$ (and $\\tau(1)=1$ ). From this it trivially follows that $\\tau\\left(g^{-1}\\right)$ is the inverse to $\\tau(g)$. Set $x_{\\delta_{j}}$ $=\\left(z_{j}, \\delta_{j}, 1\\right) j=1,2$. Set $g^{\\prime} \\circ\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)=\\left(z_{2}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{2}^{\\prime}, 1\\right)$ so\n\n$$\n\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)=\\left(z_{2}^{\\prime}, 0,1\\right)=\\left(s_{-\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}} g^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)\n$$\n\nBecause $g x_{\\delta_{1}}=g \\circ\\left(s_{\\delta_{1}} p_{1}\\right)=s_{\\delta_{1}} \\circ\\left(g p_{1}\\right)$ and (2.12) we have $g x_{\\delta_{1}}=\\left(z_{2}, \\delta_{1}+\\delta_{2}\\right.$, 1) and similarly $g^{\\prime} x_{\\delta_{2}}=\\left(z_{2}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{2}^{\\prime}+\\delta_{2}, 1\\right)$. This gives that $\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right) p_{1}=g^{\\prime}\\left(z_{2}, \\delta_{2}, 1\\right)=$ $\\left(z_{2}^{\\prime}, \\delta_{2}^{\\prime}+\\delta_{2}, 1\\right)$, and then $\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right) p_{1}=\\left(z_{2}^{\\prime}, 0,1\\right)$, giving $\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right) p_{1}=s_{-\\left(\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}+\\delta_{2}\\right)}\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right) p_{1}$. Further\n\n$$\ns_{-\\left(\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}+\\delta_{2}\\right)}\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right) p_{1}=s_{-\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}}\\left(g^{\\prime} \\circ\\left(s_{-\\delta_{2}}\\left(g p_{1}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\stackrel{(2.13)}{=}\\left(s_{-\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}} g^{\\prime}\\right) \\circ\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)\n$$\n\nInserting $\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)=\\tau(g) p_{1}$ into (2.14) one has $\\left(s_{-\\delta_{2}^{\\prime}} g^{\\prime}\\right) \\circ\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)=\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime}\\right) \\circ \\tau(g) p_{1}$. By (2.15) we have proved $\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime} g\\right)=\\tau\\left(g^{\\prime}\\right) \\circ \\tau(g)$ and $\\tau(G)$ is a group $(\\tau(1)=1$ is trivial). Consider $\\tilde{U}:=\\cup_{g \\in G} \\tau(g) U$ where every $\\tau(g) U(\\ni p)$ is a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n-1} ; \\tilde{U}$ is thus a domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$. Then $(\\tilde{U}, \\tau(G))$ gives a complex orbifold chart (possibly after shrinking $U$ hence $\\tilde{U}$ ) on $M$. We omit the discussion about the transitions between different charts (see Remark 2.5).\n\nAs such, $M$ is known to be a normal complex (analytic) space ([68, Section IV] or [15, Theorem 4, p. 97]). Alternatively, by a result of [48] on the normality of the quotient of a complex manifold by the proper holomorphic action of a complex Lie group, one can also conclude the normality of $M$. The last assertion about compactness is obvious.\n\nRemark 2.5. For later use it is shown in Proposition 8.4 iii) that (2.12) above can be simplified: $\\pi_{U} \\circ \\sigma(g)=\\sigma(g)$ on $U=U \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\subset \\Sigma$ for $g \\in G(\\sigma$ denotes the original $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $\\Sigma$ ), i.e. $\\delta_{2} \\equiv 0$ in (2.12). Upon examination the proof of this result (including those in previous sections on which the proof is based) uses no complex orbifold structure (of $M$ ) discussed here. One can also use it to check the remaining conditions (as recorded in, for instance, [32, p.172]) needed for $M$ to be a complex orbifold. Moreover $\\tau$ in the above proof can be shown to be an (group) isomorphism (see Corollary 8.6).\n\nTheorem 2.3 has an application to the CR case (via $i$ ) of Example 2.2):\nCorollary 2.6. In the notation of $i$ ) of Example 2.2, the quotient space $X / S^{1}$ of the $C R$ manifold $X$ by the locally free $S^{1}$-action is a complex orbifold.\nProof. Let $\\Sigma=X \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$by $i$ ) of Example 2.2. The assertion follows from the corresponding one for $\\Sigma$ with the induced $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action.\n\nRemark 2.7. It is now not difficult to prove the assertion that all the compact CR manifolds with transversal, locally free, CR $S^{1}$-action as considered in [18], can be regarded as \"circle bundles\" of orbifold holomorphic line bundles on certain compact complex orbifolds. We omit the details here.\n\nLet $\\Sigma$ be a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$ with a locally free holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma(\\lambda), \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. For any $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we define the $m$-th Fourier component $\\hat{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}$ of $\\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ by\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma):=\\left\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma): \\sigma(\\lambda)^{*} \\omega=\\lambda^{m} \\omega \\text { for all } \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nRemark that we are actually interested in the subspace $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (see Definition 2.8).\n\nTo describe $\\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, recalling local holomorphic coordinates $z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, w$ in Proposition 2.1 and using (2.11)\n\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda)\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, w\\right)=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}, \\lambda w\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}_{\\delta}$ with small $\\delta>0$ (see (3.6) for the definition of $\\mathbb{C}_{\\delta}$ ), we write an element $\\omega \\in \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\omega=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}+g_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q-1}} \\wedge d \\bar{w}\n$$\n\nwhere $z=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)$ and $I_{q}$ denotes the multi-index $\\left(i_{1}, . ., i_{q}\\right), 1 \\leq i_{1}<i_{2}$ $<\\cdot .<i_{q} \\leq n$. We are going to simplify the expression (2.17); the result is given in (2.22) below.\n\nThe condition $\\rho(\\lambda)^{*} \\omega=\\lambda^{m} \\omega$ in $(z, w)$ reads\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w, \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{w}) & =\\lambda^{m} f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) \\\\\ng_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w, \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{w}) \\bar{\\lambda} & =\\lambda^{m} g_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating the first equation of (2.18) in $\\bar{\\lambda}$ gives $f_{I_{q}, \\bar{w}}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w, \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{w}) \\bar{w}=0$ (henceforth $f_{I_{q}, \\bar{w}}=\\partial f_{I_{q}} / \\partial \\bar{w}$ etc.) so that $f_{I_{q}, \\bar{w}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w})=0, f_{I_{q}}=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w)$. Similarly, differentiating it in $\\lambda$ gives $f_{I_{q}, w}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w) w=m \\lambda^{m-1} f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w)$. This is solved (by setting $\\lambda=1$ ) to be $f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w)=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, 1) w^{m}+h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z})$ for some $h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z})$. It follows from the first equation of (2.18) (with $w=1$ ) that $h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) \\equiv$ 0 . Hence\n\n$$\nf_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w)=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, 1) w^{m}\n$$\n\nDifferentiating the second equation of (2.18) in $\\bar{\\lambda}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g_{I_{q-1}}}{\\partial \\bar{w}}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w, \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{w}) \\bar{w} \\bar{\\lambda}+g_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w, \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{w})=0\n$$\n\nSetting $\\lambda=1$, we then solve (2.20): $g_{I_{q-1}}=\\bar{w}^{-1} C_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, w)$ for some function $C_{I_{q-1}}=: C$. Substituting this into (2.18) gives $C(z, \\bar{z}, \\lambda w)=\\lambda^{m} C(z, \\bar{z}, w)$. In this formula, taking $w=1$ and rewriting $\\lambda$ as $w$, we get $C(z, \\bar{z}, w)=C(z, \\bar{z}, 1) w^{m}$ and conclude that\n\n$$\ng_{I_{q-1}}=C_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}, 1) \\bar{w}^{-1} w^{m}\n$$\n\nFrom (2.17), (2.19) and (2.21), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\omega=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}+C_{I_{q-1}}(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} \\bar{w}^{-1} d \\bar{z}^{I_{q-1}} \\wedge d \\bar{w}\n$$\n\nIt is straightforward to deduce the transformation law for $f_{I_{q}}$ and $C_{I_{q-1}}$ of (2.22) under the change of holomorphic coordinates (2.3).

(Regularity condition) For $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ let $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ denote the space of elements $\\omega$ which satisfy\n$i) \\omega \\in \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, ii) $\\omega=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}$ in (one hence all) local coordinate(s).\n\nIt is easily seen that $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(U) \\neq\\{0\\}$ if the closure $\\bar{U}$ of some $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant open subset $U \\subset \\Sigma$ fully lies in the principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-stratum $\\Sigma_{p_{1}}$ of $\\Sigma$ (see (1.7)). If $\\bar{U}$ intersects the lower-dimensional strata of $\\Sigma$, the situation is somewhat delicate (see the case $i i$ ) stated after (6.82)), and we resort to Proposition 6.6 for the related issues.\n\nBy analogy with (2.23) with $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ in place of $\\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, one can define $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ as given in (1.3). A motivation is seen in Proposition 2.9 below; see Section 4 (cf. the discussion from (4.31) onwards) for more.\n\nIn the case where $\\Sigma=\\hat{L} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}=: \\hat{L}^{\\prime}$ (see $i i$ ) of Example 2.2), we wonder if or when $\\hat{H}_{m}^{q}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)$ is finite-dimensional. It is easily seen that in (2.22), $C_{I_{q-1}}=$ 0 for $m=0,1$ provided that $g_{I_{q-1}}$ in (2.17) can be continuously extended to $w=$ 0 . Similarly, for $m \\geq 2$ we still get $C_{I_{q-1}}=0$ if we require that the extension of $g_{I_{q-1}}$ is $C^{m-1}$ in $\\bar{w}$ at $w=0$. Namely, under certain regularity assumption along \" $w=0$ \" we have $C_{I_{q-1}}=0$ and by $(2.22)$\n\n$$\n\\omega=f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}, m \\geq 0\n$$\n\nSimilarly for $m<0,(2.24)$ of Definition 2.8 can be regarded as a regularity condition at \" $w=\\infty$ \". In general $\\hat{H}_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ in (2.23) is not expected to be linearly isomorphic to $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$.\n\nAs a matter of fact, $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ is necessarily finite-dimensional (see Theorem 4.22).\n\nRemark that the elements of $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\bar{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ have the following transformation law. In two systems of holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)$ and $(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{w})$, we have\n\n$$\n\\tilde{w}=w \\varphi\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right), \\tilde{z}_{j}=\\mu_{j}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right), 1 \\leq j \\leq n-1\n$$\n\n(see (2.3)). The condition $s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}=\\tilde{s}(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{\\bar{z}}) \\tilde{w}^{m}$ for $s, \\tilde{s}$ being $(0, q)$-forms in $z, \\tilde{z}$ respectively, implies\n\n$$\ns(z, \\bar{z})=\\tilde{s}\\left(\\mu_{1}(z), . ., \\mu_{n-1}(z), \\overline{\\mu_{1}(z)}, . ., \\overline{\\mu_{n-1}(z)}\\right)(\\varphi(z))^{m}\n$$\n\nThese will help to verify that certain transversally spin ${ }^{\\mathrm{e}}$ Dirac operators (cf. Lemma 5.1 and Definition 5.2) are globally defined.\n\nLet us look into the aforementioned case $\\Sigma=\\hat{L} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}=: \\hat{L}^{\\prime}$ more closely. Let $L^{*}$ denote the dual holomorphic line bundle of $L$. Let $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ denote the space of $\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$-valued $(0, q)$ - forms on $M$. It is straightforward to verify the following (see also Remark 10.9).\nProposition 2.9. The map $\\psi_{q, m}$ from $\\phi=\\eta \\otimes\\left(e^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m} \\in \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ to $\\omega \\in$ $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right)$ (see Definition 2.8) given locally by\n\n$$\n\\omega(p, w e)=\\eta(p) w^{m}\n$$\n\nis globally defined and a vector space isomorphism. Moreover $\\psi_{q, m}$ commutes with the respective $\\bar{\\partial}$ operators, and thus $H_{m}^{q}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\simeq H_{\\bar{\\partial}}^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$.\n\nProposition 2.9 can be generalized for those $\\Sigma$ other than $\\hat{L}^{\\prime}$; see Proposition 3.11. It will be used in Sections 5 and 9; see (5.3) and Remark 10.9.\n\nOur next task is to define the adjoint operators of\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial}_{\\hat{L}^{\\prime}, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right) \\quad\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}=\\hat{L} \\backslash\\{0 \\text {-section }\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial}_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}: \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\n$$\n\nand to compare (via Proposition 2.9) the two adjoint operators so defined. For this purpose, we need first of all to endow a metric on $\\dot{L}^{\\prime}$ and a fibre metric on $L$ (and hence on $L^{*}$ ).

For $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq 0$ the normalized metric $G_{a, m}$ (3.21) is uniformly equivalent to $G_{a}$ (3.9) in the sense that there exists a constant $C_{m}>0$ such that $C_{m}^{-1} G_{a, m} \\leq G_{a} \\leq C_{m} G_{a, m}$. As a consequence we have $L^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=L^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a}\\right)$.\n\nProof. At a point $p_{0}$ we can simultaneously \"diagonalize\" $G_{a}$ and $G_{a, m}$ in view of (3.14). Then $\\left(C_{m}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1} G_{a, m} \\leq G_{a} \\leq C_{m}^{\\prime \\prime} G_{a, m}$ where $C_{m}^{\\prime}:=\\max \\left\\{1, \\lambda_{m}^{-1}\\right\\}$ and $C_{m}^{\\prime \\prime}:=$ $\\max \\left\\{1, \\lambda_{m}\\right\\}$. So $C_{m}:=C_{m}^{\\prime} C_{m}^{\\prime \\prime}$ is a constant required in the lemma.\n\nThe following fact seems to be of independent interest although it is not strictly needed for our purpose. It serves as a piece of evidence for the fact that some geometric constructions (to be made later) on $\\Sigma$ and on $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ respectively are mutually \"compatible\" in an appropriate context (cf. Proposition 3.12 and Corollary 3.19). It is mainly this compatibility that allows us to carry out our transversal heat kernel method for the proof of the asserted results in this paper.\n\nProposition 3.6. Let $p_{0} \\in \\Sigma$. Each $w$-slice in $\\Sigma$, described by $\\lambda \\circ p_{0}=\\sigma(\\lambda) p_{0}, \\lambda$ $\\in C_{\\bar{x}_{j}}$ in a local patch $D_{j}$, is totally geodesic with respect to $G_{a}$ or $G_{a, m}$. In other words, the Christoffel symbols have the following vanishing property:\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{A B}^{C}=0 \\text { for } A, B \\text { tangent and } C \\text { normal to } w \\text {-slices. }\n$$\n\nProof. Let $g_{A B}$ denote the component of $G_{a}$ (resp. $G_{a, m}$ ) with respect to the directions $A, B$. In local holomorphic coordinates $z=\\left(z_{1}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)$ and $w, A, B$ can be $\\partial / \\partial w$, or $\\partial / \\partial \\bar{w}$ and $C$ can be $\\partial / \\partial z_{j}$ or $\\partial / \\partial \\bar{z}_{j}$. By the formula of\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{A B}^{C}=\\frac{1}{2} g^{C D}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{A D}}{\\partial x_{B}}+\\frac{\\partial g_{B D}}{\\partial x_{A}}-\\frac{\\partial g_{A B}}{\\partial x_{D}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwe can choose $w$ coordinate such that $h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=1, d h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=0$ at $p_{0}$ where $(z, w)\\left(p_{0}\\right)=\\left(z_{0}, w_{0}\\right)((3.13))$. The $w$-slice is described by $z=z_{0}$ in a local patch $D_{j}((2.6))$. For $C=\\partial / \\partial z_{j}$ or $\\partial / \\partial \\bar{z}_{j}$ and $D=\\partial / \\partial w$ or $\\partial / \\partial \\bar{w}$ one sees $g^{C D}=0$ at $z_{0}$ by (3.14), so $D$ in (3.29) can only be left in the $z$-direction. Since we take $A, B$ to be $\\partial / \\partial w$ or $\\partial / \\partial \\bar{w}, \\partial g_{A D} / \\partial x_{B}$ and $\\partial g_{B D} / \\partial x_{A}$ can only involve $d h$ which vanishes at $z=z_{0}$ (cf. (3.11), (3.12)). Similarly $\\partial g_{A B} / \\partial x_{D}\\left(z_{0}\\right)$ can only contain the term $\\partial\\left(\\varphi_{1} \\circ l\\right) / \\partial x_{D}=\\left(\\partial h / \\partial x_{D}\\right) \\varphi_{1}^{\\prime} w \\bar{w}$ (in (3.9)) which vanishes at $z=z_{0}$ since $d h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=0$. Altogether, in view of (3.29) we have shown (3.28).\n\nThe following definition of the formal adjoint is more or less standard.\nNotation 3.7. Denote by $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma}, \\vartheta_{U_{j}}$ the formal adjoint of $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma}: \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)$, $\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}}\\left(=\\bar{\\partial}_{z}\\right.$ in $\\left.z\\right): \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$ (see (2.6) for the notation $U_{j}$ ) with respect to $G_{a}, \\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (see (3.9)) respectively (cf. [53, p.152], [17, p.62]). Namely $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma} u$ $\\in \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ for $u \\in \\Omega^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)$ is defined to satisfy $\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(u, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma} v\\right)_{L^{2}}$ for any smooth $(0, q)$-form $v$ of compact support, where the $L^{2}$-inner product is with respect to $G_{a}$. Similarly $\\vartheta_{U_{j}}$ is defined with $\\Sigma$ (resp. $G_{a}$ ) replaced by $U_{j}$ (resp. $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ ).\n\nFor the $m$-space $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}$ the corresponding notion of formal adjoint is less straightforward in that the conventional use of compact support test functions $\\phi$ is no longer available ( $\\phi$ always involves $w^{m}$ along the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$-orbits). One way out is to insert cut-off functions into test functions, but for later use we find it most convenient if we simply allow the support to be noncompact. The $L^{2}$-inner product $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_{L^{2}}$ below is with respect to $G_{a, m}$. We define an operator $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow$ $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ by $\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(u, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} v\\right)_{L^{2}}$ for all $v \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, and $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ $\\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ by $\\left(\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} s, t\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(s, \\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m} t\\right)_{L^{2}}$ for $s=s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}\\left(D_{j}\\right), t$ $=t(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ with $t(z, \\bar{z})$ being of compact support in $U_{j}$. For their existence we will deduce a (local) formula for $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}$ in Proposition 3.12 and that for $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ in Definition 3.13 and Proposition 3.14. We can now make the following definition.\n\nDefinition 3.8. We call the above $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ (resp. $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}$ ) the formal adjoint of $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$ (resp. $\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m}$ ). (In the next section we need to extend their domains of definition from the smooth elements to the $L^{2}$-elements. See lines below Notation 4.1.)\n\nRemark that $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}=\\pi_{m} \\circ \\vartheta_{\\Sigma}$ on $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. See Proposition 6.6 for the orthogonal projection $\\pi_{m}$ and for its integral representation. A key point here is that this formal adjoint $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ turns out to be a differential operator if one uses the metric $G_{a, m}$ (see Lemma 3.15, Remark 3.16 and Proposition 3.18). See also Corollary 3.19\n\nbelow for the difference between the two Laplacians formed by the two operators $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma}$ with their respective adjoints (the $\\bar{L}^{\\prime}$ there is meant $\\Sigma$ here).\n\nIn the remaining of this section, we will show that modulo certain zeroth order terms $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ equals $\\left.\\vartheta_{\\Sigma}\\right|_{\\Omega_{m}^{0,5^{*} *}(\\Sigma)}$. See Proposition 3.18. During the process, we find that our metric $G_{s, m}$ satisfies another important property (see Proposition 3.12), which is essential for an application in Proposition 5.3.\n\nNote that $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} s=\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{s} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}$ where we express $s=s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m} \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ locally. Recall the line bundle $L_{\\Sigma}$ in the beginning of this section. From (3.5) we learn that $e_{w}:=\\partial / \\partial w$ is a $\\tilde{\\sigma}$-invariant section of $L_{\\Sigma}$ over $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$ (in fact, as a local section it is only local- $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ invariant). Let $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$ denote the dual holomorphic line bundle of $L_{\\Sigma}$ and $e_{w}^{*}$ the local section of $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$, dual to $e_{w}$.\n\nNotation 3.9. Denote by $\\Omega_{0}^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ the space of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant elements $\\varpi$ in $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$.\n\nIn a local patch $D_{j}$, write $\\varpi=s\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ where $s \\in \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$. We have the operator $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}: \\Omega_{0}^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{0}^{0, q+1}\\left(\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ given by $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}\\left(s\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ $=\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{s} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right)\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$.\n\nWe may identify, for $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$, say, $p_{1}=1$ and thus $\\delta_{j}=\\pi$ in (2.6) (cf. remarks after Definition 2.8) in\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{0}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j},\\left(\\left.L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\simeq \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}\\right)=: \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{j}^{-1}: D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma \\rightarrow U_{j} \\times C_{\\delta_{j}}$ is a local trivialization (see (3.6) for the definition of $C_{\\delta_{j}}$ and (2.11) for $\\psi_{j}$ ). Let $\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}$ denote the $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator acting on the RHS of $(3.30)$.\n\nDefinition 3.10. Let $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (resp. $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ ) denote the space of elements $u \\in \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (resp. $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ ), having the form $w^{m} v(z, \\bar{z})$ in local holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)$. Note that $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, but they are not equal in general unless the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $\\Sigma$ is globally free. For later use we define the space $\\bar{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ consisting of elements $u \\in \\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, having the form $w^{m} v(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w})$ in local holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)$, with bounded $C_{B}^{*}$-norms for each integer $s \\geq$ 0 (see (6.7) for the definition of $C_{B}^{*}$-norm). We have $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\bar{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nLet $\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m}$ denote the $\\bar{\\partial}$ operator acting on $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$. With the notation above, we generalize Proposition 2.9 as follows. Compare Remark 10.10.\n\nProposition 3.11. Recall the line bundle $L_{\\Sigma}$ defined in the lines above (3.1), and also Notation 3.9. The map $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}: \\Omega_{0}^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}\\left(s\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)=s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}\n$$\n\nin any local patch $D_{j}$ (not necessarily in $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ ) with holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)$, where $s \\in \\Omega_{0, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$, is globally defined and a vector space isomorphism. Moreover we have $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\circ \\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}=\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q+1, m} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma,\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}$. For $(z, w) \\in U_{j} \\times C_{\\delta_{j}}$ we have $\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m} \\circ \\Psi_{q, m}=\\Psi_{q+1, m} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}$ on $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$, where $\\Psi_{q, m}$ : $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\Psi_{q, m}\\left(s(z, \\bar{z})\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)=s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}\n$$\n\nis a vector space isomorphism.\n\nProof. We focus on $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}$; the assertion for $\\Psi_{q, m}$ in (3.32) can be proved similarly (compare Proposition 2.9). Observe that $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}$ is a linear isomorphism as long as it is well defined. Since the transformation law of $e_{w}^{*}$ is easily verified to be the same as that of $w$, one sees that $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}$ is well defined (with image in $\\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ ). To see that the image of $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}$ is actually contained in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, we restrict ourselves to the principal stratum $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and then extend to $\\Sigma$ by continuity. That is, the image of $\\tilde{\\Psi}_{q, m}$ lies in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ (which is the same as $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ in this case) using (3.30) and (3.32) so it must be in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ since it is already in $\\Omega^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nWe are ready to formulate the first main result (Proposition 3.12) of this section.\nThe $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric $\\left\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\right\\rangle$ on $L_{\\Sigma}$ (see Step 1 at the beginning of this section) induces a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric on $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$, still denoted by the same notation if no confusion will occur. For $s=s(z, \\bar{z}) \\in \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$, by abuse of notation, we denote\n\n$$\n\\vartheta_{z, m} s:=\\left.\\frac{\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}\\left(s\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)\\right|_{U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)}{\\left.\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)\\right|_{U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}\n$$\n\nwith respect to the metrics $\\left.\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right|_{U_{j}}$ (cf. (3.9)) and $\\left\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\right\\rangle$, where $e_{w}^{*}$ is dual to $e_{w}=\\partial / \\partial w$ as above and $\\psi_{j}$ is as in (3.30). According to a standard formula (see $[53,(3.142)$ on p.160]) one has $\\vartheta_{z, m} s=\\vartheta_{z} s+$ (zeroth order terms in $s$ ), where we recall (Definition 3.8) that $\\vartheta_{z}$ is the formal adjoint of $\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}}: \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$ (with respect to the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ ) in coordinates $z=\\left(z_{1}, . ., z_{n-1}\\right)$. By choosing $w$ coordinate such that $h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=1, d h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=0$ at a point $p_{0}=\\left(z_{0}, w_{0}\\right)$ (cf. (3.13)), the above implies\n\n$$\n\\vartheta_{z, m} s=\\vartheta_{z} s \\text { at } p_{0}\n$$\n\nThe formula (3.34) will be applied to (3.45) later on.\nRemark that $\\vartheta_{z, m}$ is not invariantly defined while $\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}$ is (cf. Definition 3.8).\nIt is worth mentioning that the special structure of our metric $G_{a, m}$ will yield that the two operators $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} \\circ \\Psi_{q+1, m}$ and $\\Psi_{q, m} \\circ \\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}$ are still comparable. More precisely, we have the following crucial fact. See Proposition 5.3 for an application.\n\nProposition 3.12. (The first main result of this section) Assume $m \\geq 0$. Under the notations explained above, we have $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}\\left(s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}\\right)=\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}$ and hence $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}=\\Psi_{q, m} \\circ \\vartheta_{U_{j}, m} \\circ \\Psi_{q+1, m}^{-1}$.\nProof. Let $t \\in \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right), s \\in \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q+1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$. Write $t=t(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}, s=s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}$ where $t(z, \\bar{z}) \\in \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j}\\right), s(z, \\bar{z}) \\in \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$. Here $U_{j}$ may be identified with $U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}(\\subset \\Sigma)$ via $\\psi_{j}$. Take $t(z, \\bar{z})$ as a test function/form so it is of compact support in $U_{j}$. Write $G$ for $G_{a, m}$ and $H$ for the metric on $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ induced by $\\|\\cdot\\|$ on $L_{\\Sigma}$ (cf. Step 1 given earlier in this section). We compute, by using $<\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m},\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}>_{H}=\\left(h^{-1}\\right)^{m}($ see (3.4)), $l(q)=h w \\bar{w},(3.5)$ and (3.22),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{D_{j}}<\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m} t, s>_{G} d v_{\\Sigma, m}=\\int_{D_{j}}<\\bar{\\partial}_{z} t(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}, s(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}>_{G} d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\\\\n& =\\int_{D_{j}}<\\bar{\\partial}_{z} t(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}, s(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}>_{G \\otimes H} h^{m}|w|^{2 m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo proceed further, note first that all the integrands in (3.35) is invariantly defined. To integrate the above over $D_{j}$, by Fubini's theorem we may first integrate over (part of) every $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit then over the directions orthogonal to the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbits. Note that the metric on the orthogonal/horizontal direction is given by $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (see (3.14)). With the natural projection $D_{j}=U_{j} \\times C_{\\delta_{j}} \\rightarrow U_{j}, U_{j}$ equipped with the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ can be regarded as a parameter space for horizontal directions. For the above reasoning, note however that $\\left.G_{a, m}\\right|_{T U_{j}} \\neq \\pi^{*} g_{M} \\|_{T U_{j}}\\left(U_{j} \\cong U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right.$ $\\subset \\Sigma$ ) and that $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ is precisely the metric we use on $T U_{j}$; see the line after (3.33) above.\n\nIt turns out (see the last equality in (3.39) below and remarks after it) that (3.35) equals (where $\\left\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot>\\right.$ below means $\\left.<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\otimes H}\\right):$\n\n$$\n\\int_{U_{j}}<\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}\\left(t(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right), s(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}>d v(z) \\int_{C_{\\delta_{j}}} l(q)^{m} d v_{f, m}\n$$\n\nSince the preceding expressions of the integrands are again invariantly defined, for any given $z_{0}$ in $U_{j}$ we choose $(z, w)$ with $h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=1$ and $d h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=0$ (cf. (3.13)), so that (see (3.20))\n\n$$\n\\int_{C_{\\delta_{j}}} l(q)^{m} d v_{f, m}=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{+}}|w|^{2 m} d v_{m}(|w|) \\int_{-\\delta_{j}}^{\\delta_{j}} d v(\\phi)=\\frac{\\delta_{j}}{\\pi}\n$$\n\nIt is crucial that the integration (3.37) results in a constant independent of $z$ coordinates, so that for (3.36) we can now apply $\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}^{*}$ effortlessly:\n\n$$\n(3.38)=\\int_{U_{j}}<t(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}, \\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}\\left(s(z, \\bar{z})\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)>d v(z) \\frac{\\delta_{j}}{\\pi}\n$$\n\nLet us continue with (3.38) and bring it back via (3.37) and (3.33) to the following (for the second equality recalling $l=h w \\bar{w}$ ):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { RHS of (3.38) } \\\\\n& =\\int_{U_{j}}<t(z, \\bar{z}), \\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})>_{\\pi^{*} g_{M}} h^{-m} d v(z) \\int_{C_{\\delta_{j}}} l(q)^{m} d v_{f, m} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{D_{j}=U_{j} \\times C_{\\delta_{j}}}{=} \\int_{D_{j}}<t(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m},\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}>_{\\pi^{*} g_{M}} d v(z) \\wedge d v_{f, m} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(3.21)}{=} \\int_{D_{j}}<t(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m},\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}>_{G} d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}=\\left.\\Psi_{q, m}\\left(\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}\\left(s\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(e_{w}^{*}\\right)\\right|_{U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right)$ by (3.33) and (3.31) (with $\\psi_{j}^{*}$ often omitted) is invariantly defined since $\\Psi_{q, m}$ and $\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}$ are. So the above $\\left\\langle\\cdots>_{\\pi^{*} g_{M}}=\\langle\\cdots\\rangle_{G}\\right.$ holds as one checks that they coincide under a choice of special coordinates (at any given point, cf. (3.13), (3.14)).\n\nIn summary the LHS of (3.35) equals the RHS of (3.39): it follows the first part: $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} s=\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} s(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}$, also the second part by (3.33) and the definition of $\\Psi_{q, m}$.\n\nDefinition 3.13. We define a differential operator $\\tilde{\\vartheta}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ by $\\left.\\left(\\tilde{\\vartheta}_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right)\\right|_{D_{j}}:=\\left.\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} u\\right|_{D_{j}}=\\left(\\vartheta_{z, m} u_{j}(z, \\bar{z})\\right) w^{m}$ where $\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}}=u_{j}(z, \\bar{z}) w^{m}$. According to Proposition 3.12 that $\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}$ is a differential operator uniquely determined by $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}, \\tilde{\\vartheta}_{\\Sigma, m}$ is well-defined.\n\nIn globalizing Proposition 3.12 the cut-off functions inevitably depend on the $\\theta$-variable. Let us be specific about this point below. Let $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_{L^{2}}$ denote the inner product with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}$.\n\nProposition 3.14. For $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma), v \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ it holds that $\\left(\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}}=$ $\\left(u, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}\\right)_{L^{2}}$. As a consequence $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}=\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ (Definition 3.8).\nProof.

The validity of the lemma relies on the specific metric $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$. We do not see such compatibility result for general metric ( $\\Sigma$ being of one dimension higher than the $z$-space).\nProof. (of Lemma 3.15) At a point $p_{0} \\in \\Sigma$, we find coordinates $(z, w)$ such that $z\\left(p_{0}\\right)=z_{0}=\\left(z_{1}^{0}, . ., z_{n-1}^{0}\\right), w\\left(p_{0}\\right)=w_{0}, h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=\\left\\|\\frac{g}{g_{n}}\\right\\|_{\\left(z_{0}, w_{0}\\right)} \\|^{2}=1$ and $d h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)$ $=0((3.13))$.

Despite this, (3.55) with an exact property in the complex two-dimensional case (3.56), seems a natural question that a reader may be led to inquire (see also Remarks 3.16 and 3.20); we decide to include the details here. For the proof below the first main result Proposition 3.12 will be needed (see proof of Proposition 3.18).

The formal adjoints $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\tilde{\\psi}=\\left.\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} \\tilde{\\psi}\\right|_{D_{j}}$ in $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$. So (3.54) follows from (3.40) of Lemma 3.15 and Proposition 3.12.\n\nTo streamline our ongoing presentation, let us indicate an application of the above results to $\\bar{\\partial}$-Laplacians. Back to the case $\\Sigma=\\bar{L} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}=: \\bar{L}^{\\prime}$, in view of Proposition 2.9 we can convert $\\bar{\\partial}_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}: \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, q+1}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ to $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{L}^{\\prime}, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(\\bar{L}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}\\left(\\bar{L}^{\\prime}\\right)$ given by $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\bar{L}^{\\prime}, m}\\left(\\eta w^{m}\\right)=\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{M} \\eta\\right) w^{m}$.

This type of relation between the \"upstair Laplacian $\\square_{\\bar{L}^{\\prime}}$ \" and the \"downstair Laplacian $\\square_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}$ \" is also seen in the work [18, Proposition 5.1] in the context of CR manifolds $X$ with $S^{1}$-action, where no \"first order corrections\" (such as the one in (3.55)) is needed, due to the use of an $S^{1}$-invariant metric on $X$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 4.

We are going to study a Hodge theory for the Laplacian $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ associated to $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$ acting on $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. For this purpose, certain a priori estimates such as elliptic estimates are useful.

(Recall that any element in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ is square-integrable if $a>\\frac{m}{2}$; see Remark 3.4.)\n\nIt is convenient to define $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}\\right)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}\\right)\\right)$ to be the space of all $\\omega$ $\\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ with $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega \\in L_{0, q+1, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega \\in L_{0, q-1, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)$ in the distribution sense given as follows: $\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega, \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(\\omega, \\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}$ (resp. $\\left.\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega, \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(\\omega, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}\\right)$ for all $\\varphi \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\varphi \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q-1}(\\Sigma)$ ) (note that $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$, the formal adjoint of $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$, as in Definition 3.8 acting on smooth elements is a differential operator via Proposition 3.12). In case $\\omega$ is smooth the distributional $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega$ (resp. $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega$ ) coincides with the ordinary $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega$ (resp. $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega$ ) by Proposition 3.14. Here both $\\left(\\omega, \\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}$ and $\\left(\\omega, \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}$ are finite in view of Remark 3.4. The distribution sense above uses test functions necessarily of noncompact support; this is one of key features in our study. Write\n\n$$\n\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}:=\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}+\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\circ \\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\text { on } \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right) \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ consists of elements $\\omega \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}\\right) \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a}\\right)$ such that $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q+1)}\\right), \\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} \\omega \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q-1)}\\right)$ (cf. [17, Definition 4.2.2 ] with their Hilbert space adjoint replaced by the formal adjoint $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$ ). An alternative definition of $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ may be that $u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ if $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a}\\right)$ in the distribution sense as above, i.e. $\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u, \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(u, \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\varphi\\right)_{L^{2}}$ for all $\\varphi \\in$ $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. In this way, see Remark 4.7 for disadvantages.\n\nLet $H_{0, q}^{s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ denote the usual Sobolev space of order $s$ for $(0, q)$-forms on $\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ with $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}$ its Sobolev norm. Let\n\n$$\nH_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right):=H_{0, q}^{s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\cap L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is the completion of $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ under $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}$ (here $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q} \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$, cf. Remark 3.4).\n\nHowever the norm (4.2) is not going to be adopted here. Instead we have the following alternative approach, which we view as a novelty of this section:\n\nDefinition 4.2. With the notation above, by (3.32) $u \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ may be thought of as the form $u=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} u$ with $\\varphi_{j} u=\\varphi_{j} v_{j}$ for some $\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$-valued $v_{j}=v_{j}(z, \\bar{z})$, or $v_{j}(z)$ for short, $\\in L_{0, q}^{2}\\left(U_{j}, \\psi_{j}^{*} G_{a, m} \\otimes h^{-m}\\right)$ (see (3.4) for $L_{\\Sigma}$ and $h$, and (3.32) for this interpretation) with $\\operatorname{supp} \\varphi_{j} v_{j} \\subset U_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)\\left(\\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right)$where $\\varepsilon_{j}$ $=\\varepsilon$ for all $j$ (note that $\\varphi_{j}=\\varphi_{j}(z, \\theta)$ where $w=|w| e^{i \\theta}$ or $w_{j}=\\left|w_{j}\\right| e^{i \\theta_{j}}$ to indicate the dependence on $j$ ). This interpretation explains why the metric in $L_{0, q}^{2}$ above and in $i i$ ) below involves \" $h^{-m}$ \". For most of the time we shall write $u=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} u$ where $\\varphi_{j} u$ is simply $w^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}, v_{j} \\in L_{0, q}^{2}\\left(U_{j}, \\psi_{j}^{*} G_{a, m} \\otimes h^{-m}\\right)$ (in this way $v_{j}$ not $\\left.\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right.$-valued). The two ways are used interchangeably. We define\n\n$$\nu \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\nif and only if the following $i$ ), $i i$ ) and $i i i$ ) hold\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { i) } u \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\\\\n& \\text { ii) } \\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot) \\in H_{0, q}^{s}\\left(U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}, \\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M} \\otimes h^{-m}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $j$ and $\\theta_{j} \\in\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)$, where the metric $\\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M}$ is part of $\\psi_{j}^{*} G_{a, m}$ (see (3.21)), and\n\n$$\n\\text { iii) }||u||_{s}^{\\prime}<\\infty\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$-norm is given by\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime}:=\\left(\\sum_{j} \\int_{-\\varepsilon_{j}=-\\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon_{j}=\\varepsilon}\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}^{2} \\frac{d \\theta_{j}}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nHere $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$ denotes the usual Sobolev norm for $H_{0, q}^{s}\\left(U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}, \\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M} \\otimes\\right.$ $\\left.h^{-m}\\right)$ using local coordinates $\\left(z_{j}, w_{j}\\right)(=(z, w)$ with \" $j$ \" often omitted) on $D_{j}$ for taking derivatives. We also write, if $v$ is of support in $U \\subset U_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\|v\\|_{s, U \\subset U_{j}}:=\\|v\\|_{s, U_{j}}\n$$\n\ni.e. the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U \\subset U_{j}}$ uses the $U_{j}$-coordinates. It is not hard to see that $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is a Hilbert space with the inner product $<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{H^{\\prime s}}$ such that $\\left.\\left\\langle u, u\\right\\rangle_{H^{\\prime s}}=\\left(\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right)$\n\nRemark 4.3. From an intrinsic point of view, one may want to use covariant derivatives for $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$ rather than ordinary derivatives in local coordinates. But since there are $\\theta_{j}$-coordinates, the notion \"family of $\\theta_{j}$-parametrized sections\" has no intrinsic meaning; that is, such a family of sections change as soon as the coordinates change. Even though $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$ can be defined using covariant derivatives, there is no canonical choice of the family of sections in (4.3). We choose to work with ordinary derivatives in local coordinates for the $s$-norms.\n\nRemark 4.4. It is a fact that $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 0}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ and $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ are the same space with different, yet equivalent norm if $a>\\frac{m}{2}(\\geq 0)$ (via Remark 3.4). The same can be said on $U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ with different metrics $\\psi_{j}^{*} G_{a, m} \\otimes h^{-m}$ and $\\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M} \\otimes h^{-m}$ used in the statement of Definition 4.2. It is slightly tedious yet straightforward to check these statements; we omit the details. See applications in, for instance, the proofs of Lemma 4.17 and Proposition 4.21.\n\nThe notation $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ with superscript \"prime\" distinguishes itself from the usual Sobolev norm. Different choice of coverings $\\left\\{D_{j}\\right\\}_{j}$ and $\\varphi_{j}$ gives equivalent norms. Note the similarity and distinction between this norm and the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm to be defined in (6.7).\n\nThe particular setting above is going to be crucial for us to work through a number of technicalities and obtain a Hodge theory as just mentioned.\n\nWe may write $\\left.\\varphi_{k} u\\right|_{D_{k} \\cap D_{j}}=\\varphi_{k} w_{j}^{m} v_{j}$ where $w_{j}\\left(=\\left|w_{j}\\right| e^{i \\theta_{j}}\\right)$ denotes the $w$-coordinate in $D_{j}$. It is natural to define another $s$-norm by (see Remarks after (4.5))\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}:=\\left(\\sum_{k, j} \\int_{-\\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon}\\left\\|\\varphi_{k}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s, U_{s}}^{2} \\frac{d \\theta_{j}}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{1 / 2} ; \\theta_{j} \\text { rewritten as } \\theta\n$$\n\nHere, on $D_{k} \\cap D_{j}$ we write the same notation $\\varphi_{k}$ expressed in terms of coordinates on $D_{j}$. As $\\varphi_{k} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\Sigma)$ we view $\\varphi_{k} v_{j}$ as a function on $D_{j}$. With this understanding the subscript \" $j$ \" of $\\theta_{j}$ in (4.5) may be dropped if no confusion occurs.\n\nLemma 4.5. With the notation above, we have the equivalence between $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$-norm (4.3) and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$-norm (4.5).\n\nProof. One direction is clear: $\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime} \\leq\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}$ by restriction to $k=j$ in the sum (4.5). For the other direction, suppose in $D_{k} \\cap D_{j}, w_{k}=w_{j} l_{j k}$ for some holomorphic function $l_{j k}$ on $D_{j} \\cap D_{k}$ in terms of $z_{j}$ or $z_{k}$ by (2.3). Then $w_{k}^{m} v_{k}=w_{j}^{m} v_{j}=u$ restricted on $D_{k} \\cap D_{j}$ give that $v_{k} l_{j k}^{m}=v_{j}$, from which we compute (viewing \" $\\theta$ \" $\\left(=\\theta_{j}, \\theta_{k}\\right)$ as a parameter; seeing also (4.4))\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\varphi_{k} v_{j}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}} & =\\left\\|\\varphi_{k} v_{k} l_{j k}^{m}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j} \\cap U_{k} \\subset U_{j}} \\leq C_{1}\\left\\|\\varphi_{k} v_{k} l_{j k}^{m}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j} \\cap U_{k} \\subset U_{k}} \\\\\n& \\leq C_{1} \\max \\left|l_{j k}^{m}\\right|\\left\\|\\varphi_{k} v_{k}\\right\\|_{s, U_{k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{1}$, arising from the coordinate change from $U_{j}$ to $U_{k}$, depends on $j, k, m, s$ and not on $\\theta\\left(=\\theta_{j}, \\theta_{k}\\right)$. It follows from integrating the square of (4.6) with respect to $\\theta$ that $\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq(\\#$ of $j)^{1 / 2} \\cdot C\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$.\n\nRemark 4.6. Concerning the Sobolev norms $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}$ in (4.2) and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ in (4.3), although it is possible to study the relation between them especially when \" $a$ \" in $G_{a, m}$ is sufficiently large (depending on $m$ and $s$ ), we are not going to pursue this relation in the present paper.\n\nWe are going to compare local $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime}$-norm (to be defined below) with global $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}$-norm. From Propositions 3.11 and 3.12 it follows\n\n$$\n\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}=\\Psi_{q, m} \\circ \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)} \\circ \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1}\n$$\n\nHere we recall the isomorphism $\\Psi_{q, m}: \\Omega^{0, q}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m, l o n}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ in (3.32) and define $\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}:=\\vartheta_{D_{j}, m} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m}+\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m} \\circ \\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}$ and $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}:=\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}$ $+\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m} \\circ \\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}$ similarly as in (4.1) for $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$.\n\nRemark 4.7. By the definition via test functions one sees that $i$ ) if $u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ then $\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ and $\\left.\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u\\right)\\right|_{D_{j}}=\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)$. The same is true of $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}, \\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}$ in place of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}, \\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)} \\cdot i i)$ It is easily seen that if $u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\right)$\n\n(resp. $\\left.\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}, \\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}\\right)$ and a cut-off function $\\chi \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ then $\\chi u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ (resp. $\\left.\\bar{\\partial}_{D_{j}, m}, \\vartheta_{D_{j}, m}\\right)$ where the $w$-variable in $\\chi$ is regarded as \"parameter\" without being acted on by these operators. The localization property ii) is not easily checked for the alternative choice of definition for $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ (see lines below (4.1)). Such a localization $i i$ ) is crucial for the proof of Proposition 4.15 below. Compare Remark 4.26 for rejustification of this localization.\n\nDefine the local $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime}$-norm by\n\n$$\n\\|\\omega\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime}:=\\left\\|v_{j}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}} \\text { for } \\omega=w_{j}^{m} v_{j} \\in \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$ is the usual Sobolev $s$-norm on $U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ with respect to the metric $\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right)$ together with the fibre metric $h^{-m}$ on $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ in (3.4). Observe that no partition of unity is used for this local norm.\n\nIt is crucial to notice that $\\Psi_{q, m}, \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1}$ preserve respective Sobolev $s$-spaces. In fact, for $\\omega \\in \\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\|\\omega\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime}=\\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} \\omega\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}\n$$\n\nby (3.32) and (4.8).\nSuppose that $A$ and $B$ are functions on a set $S$. We use the notation $A \\lesssim B$ to mean that there is some constant $C>0$ such that $A(u) \\leq C B(u)$ for all $u \\in S$. For instance, $\\|\\cdot\\|_{1} \\lesssim\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}$ means that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{1} \\leq C\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}$.\nLemma 4.8. (Localization of $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$-norm) With the notation above, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\lesssim\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}\n$$\n\non $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. That is $\\|u\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\leq C\\|u\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}$ for some $C>0$ and every $u \\in$ $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\nProof. Write $\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}}=w_{j}^{m} v_{j}$. From the definition it follows that ( $\\theta$ as a parameter as above)\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime}=\\left\\|v_{j}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}} \\leq \\sum_{k:|\\{k\\}|<\\infty}\\left\\|\\varphi_{k}(\\cdot, \\theta) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}\n$$\n\nIntegrating the square of (4.11) over $\\theta \\in(-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)$ (cf. comments after (4.5)), we obtain (4.10) by (4.5).\n\nLet $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_{L^{2}}$ denote the $L^{2}$-inner product for $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. For the notion of formally self-adjointness to be used below, compare [53, p.321]. We need the following.\nLemma 4.9. $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ is formally self-adjoint for $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq 0$, i.e. for $u, v \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (being of noncompact support along the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$-direction) it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(u, \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} v\\right)_{L^{2}}\n$$\n\nFor $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$\n\n$$\n\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u, u\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\\left\\|\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}}^{2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nHere $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\bullet$ is the differential operator action. As a consequence $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u$ coincides with the action in the distribution sense.\n\nProof. This immediately follows from Proposition 3.14 and the definition of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$.\n\nWe adopt Definition 4.2 above (using $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ ) throughout this section. The usual Hodge theory holds true when the underlying manifold is compact. In our case $\\Sigma$ is noncompact, so special care should be taken. It turns out that with the special metric $G_{a, m}$, we can still build up a Hodge-type theory for $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$.\n\nIn the following we always assume that $m \\geq 0$ and \" $a$ \" is large, say, $a>\\frac{m}{2}(\\geq 0)$.\nProposition 4.10. (Rellich-type compactness) With the notation above, the inclusion map $\\iota: H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+1}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right), s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, is compact.\nProof. Recall that a partition of unity $\\varphi_{j}$ (of noncompact support, with $j$ in a finite index set $J$, on $\\Sigma$ satisfying the item $i$ ) after Notation 6.1 of Section 6) is taken. Suppose that $f_{k} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+1}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is a bounded sequence where $f_{k}=w^{m}\\left(v_{k}\\right)_{j}$ in $D_{j}$. We compute\n\n$$\n\\|\\left(v_{k}\\right)_{j}\\|_{s+1, U_{j}} \\stackrel{(4.8)}{=}\\left\\|f_{k}\\right\\|_{s+1, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\stackrel{(4.10)}{\\lesssim}\\left\\|f_{k}\\right\\|_{s+1}^{\\prime \\prime} \\stackrel{\\text { Lemma } 4.5}{\\lesssim}\\left\\|f_{k}\\right\\|_{s+1}^{\\prime} \\leq C\n$$\n\nConditions on $\\varphi_{j}$ give that $\\hat{U}_{j}:=\\overline{\\cup_{\\theta, \\operatorname{supp}} \\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right)} \\subset U_{j}$ is a compact subset. Let $\\chi_{j}$ be a cutoff function with supp $\\chi_{j} \\subset U_{j}$ and $\\chi_{j}=1$ on $\\hat{U}_{j}$. So by (4.14) $\\left\\|\\chi_{j}\\left(v_{k}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s+1, U_{j}}$ is bounded for all $k$. It follows from the usual Rellich's compactness lemma that there exists a subsequence $\\{\\mathrm{k}\\} \\subset\\{k\\}$ such that $\\chi_{j}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$-norm. Since $\\left\\|\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s, \\hat{U}_{j}} \\leq\\left\\|\\chi_{j}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}$, more precisely $\\left\\|\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}-\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}^{\\prime}}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s, \\hat{U}_{j}} \\leq\\left\\|\\chi_{j}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}-\\chi_{j}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}^{\\prime}}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}},\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}$ is Cauchy in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, \\hat{U}_{j}}$-norm. By similar arguments with $\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right)\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}} \\lesssim\\left\\|\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}\\right\\|_{s, \\hat{U}_{j}}$ (using the definition of $\\hat{U}_{j}$ above with the constant independent of $\\left.\\theta_{j}\\right) \\varphi_{j}\\left(v_{\\mathrm{k}}\\right)_{j}$ is Cauchy in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s, U_{j}}$-norm uniformly in $\\theta_{j}$ and hence by (4.3) a subsequence of $f_{\\mathrm{k}}$ is Cauchy in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ due to $j$ $\\in$ a finite index set.\n\nCorollary 4.11. (Interpolation inequality) With the notation above and $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, we have the following interpolation inequality: given $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists $C_{\\varepsilon}>0$ such that for all $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ we have $\\|u\\|_{s+1}^{\\prime} \\leq \\varepsilon\\|u\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime}+C_{\\varepsilon}\\|u\\|_{0}^{\\prime}$.\nProof. By Lemma 4.10, both inclusions in $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+1}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset$ $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 0}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$ are compact. The result follows from a general result in functional analysis [3, Theorem 3.77, p.99].\n\nWe have elliptic estimates for $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ as shown in the following theorem. Note that $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for $a>\\frac{m}{2}$ (see Remark 3.4).\nTheorem 4.12. (Transversally elliptic estimate) Fix $m \\geq 0$ and $a>\\frac{m}{2}$.

It is easily seen that the similar statements and proofs work for $u$ $\\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ in place of $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. See the proof of Proposition 4.21 for use of it.\n\nProof. (of Theorem 4.12) Recall that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ denotes the Sobolev $s$-norm on the whole space $\\Sigma$ given by (4.3). For $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ and writing $\\varphi_{j} u=w_{j}^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\|u\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime} \\stackrel{(4.3)}{=}\\left(\\sum_{j} \\int_{-\\varepsilon_{j}}^{\\varepsilon_{j}}\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s+2, U_{j}}^{2} \\frac{d \\theta_{j}}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nFrom $\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}=\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)$ it follows that ( $\\theta_{j}$ viewed as a parameter)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s+2, U_{j}}=\\left\\|\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}\\right\\|_{s+2, U_{j}} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}\\right)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}+\\left\\|\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}\\right\\|_{0, U_{j}} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}\\right)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}}+\\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}}\\left\\|_{s+1, U_{j}}+\\right\\| \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\left\\|_{D_{j}}\\right\\|_{0, U_{j}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality follows from classical elliptic estimates of $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}$ for smooth sections with compact support in $U_{j}$. For the RHS of (4.17), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}\\right)\\right\\|_{s, U_{j}} \\quad \\lesssim\\left\\|\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)} u \\mid D_{j}\\right\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\left\\|\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u\\right\\|_{s, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\text { Lem. } 4.8}{\\lesssim}\\left\\|\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u\\right\\|_{s}^{\\prime \\prime} \\stackrel{\\text { Lem. } 4.5}{\\lesssim}\\left\\|\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u\\right\\|_{s}^{\\prime}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand similarly, for $l=s+1$ or 0\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}}\\left\\|_{l, U_{j}} \\quad=\\quad\\right\\| v_{j}\\left\\|_{l, U_{j}}=\\right\\| u\\left\\|_{D_{j}}\\right\\|_{l, D_{j}}^{\\prime} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{\\text { Lem. } 4.8}{\\lesssim} \\quad\\|u\\|_{l}^{\\prime \\prime} \\stackrel{\\text { Lem. } 4.5}{\\lesssim}\\|u\\|_{l}^{\\prime} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (4.18) and (4.19) into (4.17) and making use of the interpolation inequality (Corollary 4.11), we obtain (4.15) via (4.16).\n\nFor the second statement $i i$ ), the argument is similar to the classical one. Since we are in the transversal setting and using the modified norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$, we give details for the sake of clarity. Suppose otherwise. That is, for each large integer $k$ there exists $u_{k} \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\cap\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ such that $\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime}=1$ (by dividing $u_{k}$ by $\\left.\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime} \\geq k\\left\\|\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{k}\\right\\|_{s}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nIt follows from (4.20) that $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{k} \\rightarrow 0$ in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. By using the basic weak convergence result with (4.15) there exists a subsequence (still denoted by) $u_{k}$ which weakly converges to $u_{\\infty}$ in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime}$ and by Lemma 4.10 (the Rellichtype compactness), strongly converges in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ norm. It follows that $u_{\\infty} \\in$ $H_{0, q, m}^{r s+2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ so that $<u_{k}, u_{\\infty}>_{L^{2}}=0$ as $u_{k} \\perp \\operatorname{ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ by assumption. Taking $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ in $<u_{k}, u_{\\infty}>=0$ implies $u_{\\infty}=0$. On the other hand, by (4.15) we have\n\n$$\n1=\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{s+2}^{\\prime} \\leq C_{s}\\left(\\left\\|\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{k}\\right\\|_{s}^{\\prime}+\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nTaking $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ in (4.21) and observing that $\\left\\|u_{k}\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime} \\rightarrow\\left\\|u_{\\infty}\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime}=0$ and $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{k} \\rightarrow$ 0 in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ on the RHS of (4.21) by (4.20), we obtain $1 \\leq 0$, a contradiction.\n\nThe following lemma will soon be used.\nLemma 4.14. (Transversal G\u00e5rding's inequality) Fix $m \\geq 0$ and a $>\\frac{m}{2}$. There exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $u \\in \\Omega_{m: q}^{r_{i}(\\Sigma)} \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\|u\\|_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2} \\leq C\\left[\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u, u\\right)_{L^{2}}+\\left(\\|u\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe term $\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u, u\\right)_{L^{2}}$ can be replaced by $\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\\left\\|\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}}^{2}$.\nProof. Write $u=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} u=\\sum_{j} w_{j}^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}$. To bound $\\|u\\|_{1}^{\\prime}$ we look at $\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\theta) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{1, U_{j}}^{2}$. By the classical G\u00e5rding's inequality e.g. [78, p.348] we have ( $\\theta$ viewed as a parameter ranging over a compact interval),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (4.23)\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\theta) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{1, U_{j}}^{2}=\\left\\|\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}} \\|_{1, U_{j}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left(\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right), \\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1}\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)_{L^{2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)}+\\left\\|\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}} \\|_{0, U_{j}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}\\left(\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)}^{2}+\\left\\|\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}\\left(\\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)\\left\\|_{L^{2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)}^{2}+\\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}}\\right\\|_{0, U_{j}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)}^{2}+\\left\\|\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}\\right)\\left\\|_{L^{2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)}^{2}+\\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}}\\right\\|_{0, U_{j}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Sigma)}^{2}+\\left\\|\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Sigma)}^{2}+\\left(\\|u\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we have used $\\left\\|\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right\\|_{D_{j}} \\|_{0, U_{j}}^{2} \\lesssim\\left(\\|u\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ by Lemmas 4.8 and 4.5. Summing over $j$ (finitely many) and integrating over $\\theta$ in (4.23) we obtain (4.22) in view of (4.13).\n\nProposition 4.15. (Transversally elliptic regularity) Fix $m \\geq 0$ and $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq$ 0. Take $u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right) \\subset H_{0, q, m}^{s_{0}}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Suppose $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in$ $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$. Then $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\nProof. To simply the notation we use $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}(\\Sigma)$ (resp. $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(D_{j}\\right), H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$ ) to denote $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (resp. $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(D_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right), H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{\\mathrm{s}} L_{\\Sigma}^{\\mathrm{s}}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$. First we note that the statement\n\n$$\nu \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+1}(\\Sigma) \\text { and } \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}(\\Sigma) \\text { then } u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+2}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nimplies \" $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}(\\Sigma)$ then $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+2}(\\Sigma)$ \" as claimed in the proposition. This can be easily shown by induction on $s$ : for $s=0 \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ and $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 0}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ gives $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 1}(\\Sigma)$ by G\u00e5rding's inequality for $H^{\\prime 1}$-norms (4.22) with the usual regularization process using the partition of unity as in (4.23) and Remark 4.7 for localization (see for instance [41, p.381]). So by (4.24) we get $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 0+2}(\\Sigma)$. For $s=1$ we can make use of the $s=0$ case to get $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 2}(\\Sigma)$ and then apply (4.24) for $s=1$ to conclude $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 1+2}(\\Sigma)$. The similar reasoning works for $s=2,3, \\cdots$.\n\nIn the following argument we will prove (4.24). First the assumption in (4.24) and Lemmas 4.8, 4.5 imply $\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s+1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ and $\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left.u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(D_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ with Remark 4.7. This yields, since $\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1}$ induces equivalent Sobolev norms (4.9),\n\n$\\left.\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right), \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$ by (4.7). Let $\\chi_{j}$ be the cutoff function used in the proof of Proposition 4.10. Observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(4.25) \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\chi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} & =\\chi_{j} \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in+\\left[\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}, \\chi_{j}\\right]\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\\\\n{\\left[\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}, \\chi_{j}\\right]\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} } & \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsince $\\left[\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}, \\chi_{j}\\right]$ only takes one derivative and $\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+1}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$ as noted above. From (4.25) and the assumption $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$, it follows that $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\chi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$. Then the usual local elliptic regularity for $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{(q)}$ (see for instance [41, pp.379-382]) gives $\\chi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j} \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+2}\\left(U_{j}\\right)$. Writing $\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}=v_{j}$ we compute, for any $-\\varepsilon_{j}<\\theta_{j}<\\varepsilon_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\left(\\cdot, \\theta_{j}\\right) v_{j}(\\cdot)\\right\\|_{s+2, U_{j}}^{2} \\lesssim\\left\\|v_{j}\\right\\|_{s+2, \\hat{U}_{j}}^{2} \\lesssim\\left\\|\\chi_{j} v_{j}\\right\\|_{s+2, U_{j}}^{2}<\\infty\n$$\n\nwhere the constants are independent of $\\theta_{j}$, and $\\hat{U}_{j}$ is defined after (4.14). It follows from (4.26) that (4.3) is finite and $i i$ ) holds in Definition 4.2 for $s$ replaced by $s+2$. We have shown $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s+2}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nWe have the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.16. $\\bigcap_{s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}} H_{0, q, m}^{s s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$.\nProof. It suffices to show that the LHS of the formula is contained in the RHS. Suppose $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. By (4.19) $\\left.\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}$ is in $H^{s}$ over $U_{j}$. So if $u$ is in the LHS of the formula, we obtain that over $U_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}$ is in $H^{s}$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$. By the usual Sobolev lemma $\\left.\\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u\\right|_{D_{j}}$ must be smooth in $U_{j}$. It follows that $u=$ $\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} \\Psi_{q, m}^{-1} u \\mid D_{j}$ is smooth and belongs to $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nLemma 4.17. For $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq 0$, we have $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)=H_{0, q, m}^{s 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\nProof. For the inclusion put $v=\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u \\in F_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\left(=H_{0, q, m}^{s 0}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right.$ by Remark 4.4). By Proposition 4.15 for $s=0$, we have $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{s 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. The reverse inclusion can be checked via (4.7) and Definition 4.2.\n\nLemma 4.18. Let $\\mu$ be an eigenvalue of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$. Then $i)$ The eigenspace $\\mathcal{E}_{m, \\mu}^{q}(\\Sigma):=$ $\\left\\{\\omega \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right): \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\omega=\\mu \\omega\\right\\}$ is finite-dimensional with $\\mathcal{E}_{m, \\mu}^{q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. ii) In particular $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}=\\left\\{v \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\mid \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} v=0\\right\\}$ and is finite-dimensional.\n\nProof. The finite-dimensionality of each eigenspace follows by a similar reasoning as in the classical case by the elliptic estimate (Theorem 4.12) and the Rellichcompactness (Proposition 4.10). The smoothness of eigenfunctions is from Proposition 4.15 and Corollary 4.16.\n\nWe are now in a position to carry out a Hodge theory (in a transversal sense) by strategically following the classical approach (nontransversal one) using the above tools formulated in terms of the (modified) Sobolev $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$-norm. However we avoid using the Lax-Milgram theorem in the proof of Lemma 4.19; see Remark 4.20. To define Green's operator we start by proving the following:\n\nLemma 4.19. Suppose $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq 0$. Denote by $\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ the orthogonal complement of $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ in $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. i) For $f \\in\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ there exists a unique solution $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\cap\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ satisfying $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u=f$. ii) If $f \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\cap\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ then $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\cap\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$.\n\nProof. $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ is a closed subspace of $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ by Lemma 4.18 ii). On the other hand $\\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\left(=\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)\\right)\\right)$ is perpendicular to $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ using the definition of $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ and Lemma 4.18 ii). Moreover we claim that\n(4.27) $\\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ is a closed subspace of $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\left(i . e \\cdot \\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}=\\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$.\n\nAssume $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{j}=f_{j} \\rightarrow f$ in $L^{2}$ with $u_{j} \\in\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$. We then have a Cauchy sequence $\\left\\{u_{j}\\right\\}$ in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}^{\\prime}$ by Theorem 4.12 ii), Remark 4.13 and Lemma 4.17. So $u_{j} \\rightarrow u_{\\infty}$ in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{2}^{\\prime}$-norm, and in turn $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{j} \\rightarrow \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{\\infty}$ in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{0}^{\\prime}$-norm. Since $H^{\\prime 0}$ and $L^{2}$ are essentially the same by Remark 4.4, we obtain $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{\\infty}=f$, proving $f \\in \\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ as claimed in (4.27).\n\nWe are going to show the following (orthogonal) decomposition:\n\n$$\nL_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\oplus \\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\n$$\n\nSuppose not. Then there exists $f \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ such that $f$ is perpendicular to $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ and $\\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$. From $f \\in\\left(\\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ one sees that $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} f=0$ in the distribution sense since $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)$. Passing to localization $\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)} f\\left\\|_{D_{j}}\\right.$ $=0$ in the distribution sense. By the standard regularity result using (4.7) $\\left.f\\right|_{D_{j}}$ is smooth (cf. [41, the lemma in p.379]). So $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} f=0$ strongly, giving $f \\in \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$. From that $f$ is perpendicular to $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ by assumption, it follows $f=0$. We have shown (4.28). The assertion $i$ ) follows easily from (4.28) and Lemma 4.17. The assertion $i i$ ) follows from Proposition 4.15 and Corollary 4.16.\n\nRemark 4.20. In [41, pp.94-95] the solution $u$ in $i$ ) of the above lemma is essentially obtained by the Lax-Milgram theorem (see [78, p. 205 Lemma 23.1]) with an intermediate operator $T$.\n\nBy Lemma 4.19 we can now define a linear operator $G_{m}^{(q)}: L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)=H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ ) such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nG_{m}^{(q)}(f) & =u\\left(=\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{-1} f \\quad \\text { for } f \\in \\operatorname{Im} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\left(\\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)\\right. \\text { and } \\\\\n& =0 \\quad \\text { for } f \\in \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe have the following results about $G_{m}^{(q)}$ and $\\operatorname{Spec} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\subset[0, \\infty)$, the spectrum of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$.\n\nProposition 4.21. i) $G_{m}^{(q)}$ is a compact, self-adjoint, bounded linear operator on $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. ii) Spec $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} \\subset[0, \\infty)$ consists only of discrete eigenvalues. iii) We have the orthogonal decomposition $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)=\\hat{\\oplus}_{\\mu} \\mathcal{E}_{m, \\mu}^{q}(\\Sigma)$, with $\\mathcal{E}_{m, \\mu}^{q}(\\Sigma)$ given in Lemma 4.18.\n\nProof. The boundedness of $i$ ) follows from Theorem 4.12 ii) and the density of $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ in $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (Notation 4.1). We are going to show that $G_{m}^{(q)}$ is selfadjoint on the space of smooth elements. For $f, g \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ write $f=H f+$ $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{f}$ ( $H$ being the $L^{2}$-projection onto $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ ) where $u_{f}=G_{m}^{(q)}(f-H f)$. Similarly $g=H g+\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{g}, u_{g}=G_{m}^{(q)}(g-H g)$. Using $u_{f}, u_{g} \\in\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(G_{m}^{(q)}(f), g\\right)_{L^{2}} & =\\left(u_{f}, H g+\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{g}\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(u_{f}, \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{g}\\right)_{L^{2}} \\\\\n\\left(f, G_{m}^{(q)}(g)\\right)_{L^{2}} & =\\left(H f+\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{f}, u_{g}\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u_{f}, u_{g}\\right)_{L^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 4.18 ii) and Lemma 4.19 ii) we learn that $u_{f}, u_{g} \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$. It follows from (4.12) $\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right.$ being formally self-adjoint) that the right-hand sides in (4.30) coincide, giving $\\left(G_{m}^{(q)}(f), g\\right)_{L^{2}}=\\left(f, G_{m}^{(q)}(g)\\right)_{L^{2}}$. As the space of smooth elements is dense in $L^{2}$ and $G_{m}^{(q)}$ is bounded linear, $G_{m}^{(q)}$ is self-adjoint on $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Combining Theorem 4.12 ii) and Proposition 4.10 yields the compactness of $G_{m}^{(q)}$. To prove $i i$ ) we apply a general theorem [57, p.10] on a compact, self-adjoint, bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space to conclude that $\\operatorname{Spec} G_{m}^{(q)}$ hence $\\operatorname{Spec} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ consists only of discrete eigenvalues. The assertion iii) is now obvious.\n\nDefine the $m$-th Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group or $m$-th $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$-cohomology group as follows:\n\n$$\nH_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}):=\\frac{\\operatorname{Ker} \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q+1}(\\Sigma)}{\\operatorname{Im} \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, q-1}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)}\n$$\n\nDenote $\\left.\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}\\right|_{\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)}$ by $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$.

Moreover, we have $\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}=\\mathcal{E}_{m, 0}^{q}(\\Sigma) \\cong H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$. As a consequence $\\operatorname{dim} H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})<\\infty$ by Proposition 4.21.\n\nNote that for the case of $m<0$ we refer to Remark 1.2.\nDenote $\\Omega_{m}^{0,+}(\\Sigma)=\\oplus_{\\text {even } q} \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ and $\\Omega_{m}^{0,-}(\\Sigma)=\\oplus_{\\text {odd } q} \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$; similar notations are adopted for $L_{m}^{2,+}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ and $L_{m}^{2,-}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ out of $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\n\nLet\n\n$$\nD_{m}^{+}:=\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}+\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}: \\Omega_{m}^{0,+}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0,-}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nwith extension $D_{m}^{+}: \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(D_{m}^{+}\\right)\\left(\\subset L_{m}^{2,+}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow L_{m}^{2,-}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (by acting in the sense of distribution). Define the formal adjoint $\\mathfrak{D}_{m}^{+}$of $D_{m}^{+}$in the way similar to $\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}$. By similar arguments as in the classical theory we have\n\nLemma 4.23.

It is possible to study the Hilbert space adjoint $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q) *}$ [17, pp.63-64] including its domain $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)^{*}}\\right) \\subset L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{*}\\right.$ and $\\left.\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{*}\\right)\\right)$. One may show that $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ is (Hilbert space) self-adjoint, densely defined on a Hilbert space. In an abstract Hilbert space setting there are some basic material, for example, [62, Theorem C.2.1], [72, Theorem 13.30, p.348] and [29, Lemma 8.4.1] on the spectral analysis of a general self-adjoint operator, which might provide an alternative approach to Theorem 4.22. We leave the detail to the interested reader.\n\nRemark 4.26. In connection with Remark 4.7 for localization, suppose $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} u=f$ in the distribution sense (see the 5 th line below (4.1)) where $u, f \\in L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Then one sees via definition that $f \\perp \\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ so that $f=\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)} v$ for some $v \\in$ $H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\cap\\left(\\operatorname{Ker} \\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}\\right)^{\\perp}$ using (4.28). It follows that $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}(v-u)=0$ in the distribution sense, which implies $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}(v-u)=0$ strongly (see lines below (4.28)), giving $u \\in H_{0, q, m}^{\\prime 2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ by Lemma 4.17. So the localization $\\chi u \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\square_{D_{j}, m}^{(q)}\\right)$ remains true. Remark that a localization result of similar nature is claimed in [41, p.380]; however, the detail is given only for their first-order operator $P$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 5. Transversally spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operators \n\nTo compute $\\sum_{q=0}^{n}(-1)^{q} h_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ we are reduced to computing $\\operatorname{index}\\left(D_{m}^{+}\\right)$by Corollary 4.24. To do it effectively we want to modify $D_{m}^{+}$so that the associated modified Laplacian has a manageable heat kernel. This modification becomes indispensable for us in dealing with the non-K\u00e4hler case. It will follow that index $\\left(D_{m}^{+}\\right)$ equals the index of a modified operator, to be denoted by $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$. In fact the new operator $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$ will be taken to be an $m$-th spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator in the transversal sense closely related to the one described in [62] (yet in a different context).\n\nThe construction of $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$ is first done locally; this local part is standard as in the classical sense. However, due to our transversal setting here some extra work will be needed to patch up those local constructions and form a global operator $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$ on $\\Sigma$. Then it turns out by computation that the chosen metrical structure in Section 3 makes it possible to compare the operator $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$ constructed here with a natural $s p i n^{c}$ Dirac operator $D_{M_{0}, m}^{c+}$ at least on the principal stratum $M_{0}$ of the orbifold $M$\n\n$=\\Sigma / \\sigma$; see Proposition 5.3, also Remarks 6.20, 10.9, 10.10 for issues of descent to the entire $M$. This part of computation is perhaps less geometrically illuminating than the preceding local-to-global construction.\n\nLet us now start by choosing a local orthonormal frame $\\left\\{e_{2 j-1}, e_{2 j}\\right\\}_{1 \\leq j \\leq n}$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}$ (see (3.21) in Section 3) such that\n\n$$\nZ_{j}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(e_{2 j-1}-i e_{2 j}\\right) ; Z_{j}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(e_{2 j-1}+i e_{2 j}\\right) \\quad 1 \\leq j \\leq n\n$$\n\nform a local unitary frame of $T^{1,0}(\\Sigma)$ and $T^{0,1}(\\Sigma)$ respectively. As is well known, one has the \"Clifford multiplication\" (or action) $c\\left(e_{k}\\right)$ on $\\Lambda\\left(T^{* 0,1} \\Sigma\\right):=\\oplus_{q=0}^{n} T^{* 0, q} \\Sigma$ and \"Clifford connection\" $\\nabla_{e_{k}}^{C l}$ acting on $\\Omega^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ (see [62, Chapter 1]). These are given only in the transversal parts (see (5.1)) and not in the standard Clifford setting. The spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator $D^{c}$ on $\\Sigma$ is defined by $D^{c}=1 / \\sqrt{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{2 n} c\\left(e_{k}\\right) \\nabla_{e_{k}}^{C l}$ : $\\Omega^{0, *}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ and is formally self-adjoint. Denote by $D^{c \\pm}$the restriction $\\left.D^{c}\\right|_{\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)}$. We have\n\n$$\nD^{c \\pm}=\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma}+\\vartheta_{\\Sigma}+A^{c \\pm}: \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, \\mp}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nwhere $A^{c \\pm}: \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, \\mp}(\\Sigma)$ is a self-adjoint zeroth order operator and $A^{c \\pm}=$ $\\frac{1}{4}^{c}\\left(T_{a s}\\right)([62,(1.4 .17)])$.\n\nThe elements of the form (2.25) are not going to be preserved under the action of ${ }^{c}\\left(T_{a s}\\right)$ (cf. [62, (1.2.48) for $\\left.T_{a s}\\right]$ ). We would like to replace $A^{c \\pm}$by another zeroth order operator which can preserve $\\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$. This is done as follows.\n\nLet us first treat the globally free case $\\Sigma=\\hat{L} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}=: \\hat{L}^{\\prime}$ (see Example 2.2 ii) for $\\hat{L}$ ), and consider the standard spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator on $M$ with $\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$-value: $D_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}^{c}=\\bar{\\partial}_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}+\\vartheta_{M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}+A_{M, m}^{c}$ where $A_{M, m}^{c}$ maps $\\Omega^{0, \\pm}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ into $\\Omega^{0, \\mp}\\left(M,\\left(L^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ and is self-adjoint (on $\\Omega^{0, *}=\\Omega^{0,+} \\oplus \\Omega^{0,-}$ ). Here we adopt the metric $g_{M}$ for $M$ (cf. (3.9)); $\\vartheta_{M}, \\vartheta_{M, m}$ are as in Notation 3.7 and Definition 3.8. Proposition 2.9 yields a corresponding map on $\\hat{L}^{\\prime}$\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}:=\\psi_{\\mp, m} \\circ A_{M, m}^{c} \\circ \\psi_{\\pm, m}^{-1}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\mp}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy abuse of notation, write\n\n$$\nC_{M, m}\\left(h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}\\right):=\\frac{A_{M, m}^{c}\\left(h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}} \\otimes\\left(e^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)}{\\left(e^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}}\n$$\n\nNote that this depends on the choice of the local section $e^{*}$ of $L^{*}$. In $(z, w), \\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$ acts on $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}\\left(\\hat{L}^{\\prime}\\right)$ by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}\\left(w^{m} h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}\\right)=w^{m} C_{M, m}\\left(h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that (5.4) here is invariantly defined by (5.3). The key observation that makes our construction of global transversal operators well defined, is based on the following:\n\nLemma 5.1. For general $\\Sigma$ as before, the above (5.4) works unchangeably if $M$ is replaced by $U_{j}$ and $z, w$ are distinguished local holomorphic coordinates in (2.6). Thus if now define $\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\mp}(\\Sigma)$ by using (5.4), $\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$ is independent of the choice of local holomorphic coordinates and is self-adjoint on $\\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)\\left(=\\right.$ $\\left.\\Omega_{m}^{0,+} \\oplus \\Omega_{m}^{0,-}\\right)$.\n\nProof. We note that the local transformation law (2.3) of Proposition 2.1, together with (2.27), is similar to that of the case $\\Sigma=\\hat{L}^{\\prime}$ in local expressions. Hence the first assertion of the lemma \"almost\" follows from the remark after (5.4). The point is that it is not quite automatic that the image of $\\hat{A}_{m}^{c}$ so defined is contained in the $m$-space under consideration (the image lies in $\\Omega^{0, \\mp}(\\Sigma)$ nevertheless), due to the local freeness of $\\sigma$ (see case $i i$ ) after (6.82) in Section 6). But one can bypass this issue by first considering it on the principal stratum $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (similar to (5.3) for $\\hat{L}^{\\prime}$ ) then the assertion holds across $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ by argument of continuity (since $\\hat{A}_{m}^{c}$ is global on $\\Sigma$ as just mentioned). Compare the proof of Proposition 3.11. For the self-adjointness of $\\hat{A}_{m}^{c}$, the treatment is similar to and simpler than Proposition 3.12 because $\\hat{A}_{m}^{c}$ is of zeroth order.\n\nDefinition 5.2. (transversally spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator) Define $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}$ (as a \"transversally\" spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator) by, with $\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$ in Lemma 5.1\n\n$$\n\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}:=\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}=\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}+\\vartheta_{\\Sigma, m}+\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\mp}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\n$\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$ is not directly linked to $A^{c}$ of (5.2); the \"tilde\" in $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}$ is used to match that of $\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{\\vartheta}_{m}^{c}$ denote the formal adjoint of $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}$ (cf. Notation 3.7). The self-adjointness $\\tilde{\\vartheta}_{m}^{c}=\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}$ follows from Lemma $5.1\\left(\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}\\right.$ is self-adjoint). Let $D_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\pm}:=\\bar{\\partial}_{U_{j}, m}+\\vartheta_{U_{j}, m}+$ $A_{U_{j}, m}^{c}: \\Omega^{0,+}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0,-}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ be the spin ${ }^{c}$ Dirac operator on $U_{j}$ with bundle $\\left.\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}$ (see (2.11) for $\\left.\\psi_{j}\\right)$. Here the metric on $U_{j}$ is $\\left.\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right|_{T\\left(U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)}$ rather than $\\left.G_{a, m}\\right|_{T\\left(U_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)}$, and the metric on $L_{\\Sigma}$ is $<\\cdot, \\cdot>$ (lines above (3.3)). We define the following spin ${ }^{c}$ Laplacians of Kodaira type by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { i) } \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c} & :=\\tilde{\\vartheta}_{m}^{c} \\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}=\\left(\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c}\\right)^{2}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma) \\\\\n\\text { ii) } \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm} & :=\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\mp} \\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}: \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\\\\n\\text { iii) } \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\pm} & :=D_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\mp} D_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\pm}: \\Omega^{0, \\pm}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Omega^{0, \\pm}\\left(U_{j},\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*} L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemark that the notation $\\square_{m}$ (or $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}$ ) is reserved for $\\bar{\\partial}_{m} \\vartheta_{m}+\\vartheta_{m} \\bar{\\partial}_{m}$ (4.1).\nOur first main result Proposition 3.12 in Section 3 yields the following\nProposition 5.3. Restricted to $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$, we have $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}=\\Psi_{\\mp, m} \\circ D_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\pm} \\circ \\Psi_{\\pm, m}^{-1}$ (see (3.32) for the definition of $\\Psi_{\\mp, m}$ ) and $\\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}=\\Psi_{\\mp, m} \\circ \\square_{U_{j}, m}^{c \\pm} \\circ \\Psi_{\\pm, m}^{-1}$.\n\nProof. Restricted to $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$, the assertions readily follow from Propositions 3.11, 3.12 and Lemma 5.1.\n\nThe above result is crucial for us to construct an approximation of transversal heat kernel (cf. (6.5)).\n\nIn the remaining of this section, we shall focus on the geometry of $\\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c}$ (spectral aspects) and culminate in a McKean-Singer type formula (cf. Proposition 5.10 and Theorem 5.12).\n\nWe now extend $\\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}: \\operatorname{Dom} \\tilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}\\left(\\subset L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (by acting in the sense of distribution). Here $L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is as given in the line above (4.32).\n\nLemma 5.4. $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v}$ satisfies the transversally elliptic estimate as in the statements of Theorem 4.12 ( $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v}$ in place of $\\square_{\\Sigma, m}^{(q)}$ there).\n\nProof. The transversal ellipticity of $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v}$ follows from the ellipticity of $\\square_{U_{j}, m}^{v \\pm}$ via arguments similar to those in the proof of Theorem 4.12.\n\nDenote by $H_{m}^{\\prime s,+}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (resp. $H_{m}^{\\prime s,-}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ ) the even (resp. odd) part of Sobolev spaces $H_{0,*, m}^{\\prime s}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. In the same vein as Lemmas 4.17 and 4.9, we have Dom $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v \\pm}=H_{m}^{Q, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v \\pm}$ are positive, formally self-adjoint.\n\nProposition 5.5. For $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v \\pm}$, the corresponding statements in Proposition 4.21 and Lemma 4.18 hold true. Moreover, with obvious modifications of notation Spec $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v+} \\cap$ $(0, \\infty)=$ Spec $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v-} \\cap(0, \\infty)$, and $\\operatorname{dim} \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{m, \\mu}^{+}(\\Sigma)=\\operatorname{dim} \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{m, \\mu}^{-}(\\Sigma)$ for each $0 \\neq \\mu \\in$ $\\operatorname{Spec} \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v+}$.\n\nRemark 5.6. As an analogue of holomorphic tangents in the CR case via Example 2.2, we make the following definition. Let $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$ denote the (orbifold) bundle of all $(0, q)$-forms on $M$. Let $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ be the pullback bundle over $\\Sigma$, where $\\pi: \\Sigma$ $\\rightarrow M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ is the natural projection. Since the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma$ is locally free, one sees that $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ embeds naturally as a subbundle of the bundle $\\Lambda^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ of all $(0, q)$-forms on $\\Sigma$. Consider the $L^{2}$-completion of smooth sections of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ with compact support over $\\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}, a>\\frac{m}{\\rho} \\geq 0$, denoted by $L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ or $L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for short. Consider $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ to be the direct sum of $L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for all $q$ (see Notation 4.1 for the definition of $\\left.L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)$. By the definition of $\\Omega_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ (cf. Definition $2.8 i i$ )) we have that $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (see Lemma 5.7). As an alternative choice of metric on $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ it is natural to use the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (see Notation 3.1). It turns out that $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ on $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is the same as $G_{a, m} \\mid \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ (cf. Lemma 8.10 i)). Let\n\n$$\n\\pi_{m}: L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\ndenote the orthogonal projection onto the $m$-space $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ or $L_{m}^{2, *}(\\Sigma)$ for short with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}$ or $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$. See Proposition 6.6 below for more about $\\pi_{m}$.\n\nLemma 5.7. With the notation above, we have $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\nProof. First we claim that $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma) \\subset L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Write $u \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ as $u=$ $\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} u$ with $\\varphi_{j} u=w^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}(z, \\bar{z})$ for $C^{\\infty}$-smooth $(0, q)$-forms $v_{j}$ on $U_{j}$ (see the beginning of Section 4 for the notation). Let $\\chi_{k}(|w|)$ be a cut-off function which equals 1 for $|w| \\leq k$ and 0 for $|w|>k+1$. It is not difficult to see that $\\chi_{k}(|w|) w^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}(z, \\bar{z})$ (which is smooth and of compact support) tends to $w^{m} \\varphi_{j} v_{j}(z, \\bar{z})=\\varphi_{j} u$ in $L^{2}$ in view of Remark 3.4. So $\\varphi_{j} u$ (hence $u$ ) $\\in L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ by definition. We have shown the claim. It follows that $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$, the $L^{2}$-closure of $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$, should also be included in $L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\n\nFor $\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v \\pm}$ let $\\check{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}: L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\subset L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ denote the orthogonal projections. Denote the distribution kernels of $\\check{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}$ by $\\check{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(x, y)\\left(\\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma, T^{* 0, \\pm} \\Sigma \\boxtimes\\left(T^{* 0, \\pm} \\Sigma\\right)^{*}\\right)\\right.$.\n\nProposition 5.8. Define the heat kernels of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v-}$ to be\n\n$$\ne^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}}(x, y):=\\tilde{P}_{m, 0}^{ \\pm}(x, y)+\\sum_{\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}, \\nu>0} e^{-\\nu t} \\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(x, y)\n$$\n\nThen for a fixed $t>0 e^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}}$ is a bounded linear operator on $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$, which maps $\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ into $\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\subset L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Moreover, $e^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}}$ in (5.8) are (Hilbert space) self-adjoint and the kernel functions are infinitely smooth. They satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right)\\left(e^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}} u\\right)=0, \\forall t>0 \\\\\n& e^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v+}} u \\rightarrow \\pi_{m}^{ \\pm} u \\text { in } L^{2} \\text { as } t \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\forall u \\in \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\pi_{m}^{ \\pm}: L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is the orthogonal projection.\nRemark 5.9. Although the uniqueness part can be done here, it is postponed until Theorem $6.18 i$ ) for the sake of convenience.\n\nProof. (of Proposition 5.8) We need to show that the kernel functions $e^{-t \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, y)$ are infinitely smooth. The other statements are immediate (cf. the last paragraph of this proof with references, via the first half of Proposition 5.5 above). First we prove that the eigenvalues $0<\\nu_{1} \\leq \\nu_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\nu_{n} \\leq \\ldots$ of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}$ (counting multiplicity) satisfy the growth rate as follows:\n\n$$\n\\nu_{n} \\geq C n^{\\delta} \\text { for a constant } C>0 \\text { and an exponent } \\delta>0\n$$\n\nif $n>n_{0}$ is large (see Lemmas 1.6.3 and 1.6.5 in [38]). The proof in [38] for elliptic operators on a compact manifold needs to be modified as shown below.\n\nLet $\\left\\{\\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}\\right\\}$denote a complete orthonormal basis for $L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ such that $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}=\\nu_{j} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}$by Proposition 5.5 above. For $f \\in \\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ we observe the following estimate:\n\n$$\n|f(x)| \\leq C l(x)^{m / 2}\\|f\\|_{C_{D}^{n}}\n$$\n\n(see (6.7) for the definition of the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{D}^{n}}$ and (3.4) for $l(x)$ ). We have the following (recalling the notation $\\lesssim$ meaning \"the inequality $\\leq$ holds modulo some multiplicative constant\"), where for the first inequality we are applying the usual Sobolev embedding (after choosing $k$ such that $k \\cdot 2>\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right) / 2=n-1$ ) together with using (4.9), Lemmas 4.8 and 4.5,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\|f\\|_{C_{D}^{n}} \\quad \\underset{\\text { Lemma } 5.4}{\\lesssim} \\quad\\|f\\|_{2 k}^{\\prime} \\underset{\\text { Lemma } 5.4}{\\lesssim} \\| \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm} f\\left\\|_{2 k-2}^{\\prime}+\\right\\| f \\|_{0}^{\\prime} \\\\\n& \\underset{\\text { ( } 5.4}{\\text { Lemma } 5.4} \\quad\\left\\|\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right)^{k} f\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime}+\\left\\|\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right)^{k-1} f\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime}+\\ldots+\\|f\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nin the Sobolev $s$-norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{\\prime}$ on $\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Remark that the bundle $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ implicitly involved in (5.12), (4.9) does not really matter with the preceding estimate.\n\nThe interpolation inequality (Corollary 4.11) brings (5.12) to\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{C_{D}^{n}} \\lesssim\\left\\|\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right)^{k} f\\right\\|_{0}^{\\prime}+\\|f\\|_{0}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nTaking $f=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}$in (5.13) and (5.11) gives (recalling that $\\left\\{\\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}\\right\\}$is orthonormal w.r.t. the $L^{2}$-norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{0}$ which is equivalent to $\\|\\cdot\\|_{0}^{t}$ by Remark 4.4)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\leq C_{1} l(x)^{m / 2}\\left(\\left\\|\\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j} \\nu_{j}^{k} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}\\right\\|_{0}+\\left\\|\\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}\\right\\|_{0}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq C_{1} l(x)^{m / 2}\\left(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left|c_{j} \\nu_{j}^{k}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}+\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left|c_{j}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq C_{1} l(x)^{m / 2}\\left(\\left|\\nu_{n}\\right|^{k}+1\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left|c_{j}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLetting $c_{j}=\\bar{\\omega}_{j}^{ \\pm}(x)$ in (5.14), squaring, cancelling off $\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left|c_{j}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}$ on both sides and integrating over $\\Sigma$, we get\n\n$$\nn \\leq C_{1}^{2}\\left(\\left|\\nu_{n}\\right|^{k}+1\\right)^{2} \\int_{\\Sigma} l(x)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n$$\n\nBy observing that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma} l(x)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\stackrel{(3.22)}{=} \\int_{M \\backslash M_{\\text {sing }}} d v_{M} \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} l\\right)^{m} \\tau_{x}^{*}\\left(d v_{f, m}\\right) \\stackrel{(3.27)}{=} \\operatorname{Vol}(M) \\cdot 1\n$$\n\nis finite, where $M_{\\text {sing }}$ denotes the set of singular orbifold points in $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (of measure zero), we reach (5.10) with $\\delta=\\frac{1}{2 k}$ from (5.15).\n\nTo show that the kernel functions $e^{-\\imath \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, y)$ are infinitely smooth from the growth rate of $\\nu_{n}$ in (5.10), we imitate the arguments in [38, pp.53-55] by using the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$ in place of the supreme $s$-norm in [38]. It is seen that the $C_{B}^{*}$-norms are suitable here, since the functions in our $m$-space are of the special form (6.4) of Section 6. Note that corresponding to [38, b) of Lemma 1.6.3, p.51] one can show similarly that $\\left\\|\\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{*}} \\lesssim 1+\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|^{l(s)}$ from (5.10) and (5.12) (generalized from $C_{B}^{0}$ to $C_{B}^{l}$ ), and that (5.8) is the analogous expression in [38, Lemma 1.6.5, p.55]. These observations (together with the form of expressions (3.31), (3.30); see also (6.4) which reduces the study (transversal case) to that on $z$-spaces (elliptic case)) yield the desired smoothness of (5.8) as in [38]. The convergence of $e^{-\\imath \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}} u$ is treated similarly. We leave the details to the reader.\n\nFor the remaining properties of $e^{-\\imath \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}}$ claimed in the proposition, we observe that for $u \\in \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}+\\hat{\\psi}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right)\\left(e^{-\\nu t} \\hat{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm} u\\right)=-\\nu e^{-\\nu t} \\hat{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm} u+e^{-\\nu t} \\nu \\hat{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm} u=0\n$$\n\nThe first equation in (5.9) follows since one sees that taking differentiation in $t$ or $x$ commutes with the infinite sum of kernel functions of projectors (for a fixed $t>0$ ). For the second formula of (5.9) writing $u=\\sum_{j} a_{j} \\omega_{j}^{ \\pm}$we have\n\n$$\ne^{-\\imath \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}} u-\\pi_{m} u=\\sum_{\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}}\\left(e^{-\\nu t}-1\\right) \\hat{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm} u=\\sum_{\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}}\\left(e^{-\\nu t}-1\\right) a_{\\nu} \\omega_{\\nu}^{ \\pm}\n$$\n\nNote that $e^{-\\nu t}-1$ in (5.16) is bounded by 1 since $\\nu \\geq 0 . \\sum_{\\nu} a_{\\nu}^{2}$ is bounded, so for a large $N: \\sum_{\\nu \\geq N} a_{\\nu}^{2}$ is small. For a finite sum $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\sum_{\\nu<N}\\left(e^{-\\nu t}-1\\right) a_{\\nu} \\omega_{\\nu}^{ \\pm}=$ $\\sum_{\\nu<N} \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0}\\left(e^{-\\nu t}-1\\right) a_{\\nu} \\omega_{\\nu}^{ \\pm}=0$. Altogether $e^{-\\imath \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{v \\pm}} u-\\pi_{m} u \\rightarrow 0$ in $L^{2}$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nOne sees that $\\left\\|e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} u\\right\\|_{L^{2}} \\leq\\left(\\sum_{\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} e^{-\\nu t}\\right)\\|u\\|_{L^{2}}$, so $e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}$ is bounded by (5.10). The self-adjointness of $e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}$ follows from that each $\\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}$is self-adjoint and the infinite sum of $\\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm *}$ converges to $\\left(e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}\\right)^{*}$.\n\nFor $\\nu \\in \\operatorname{Spec} \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}$, let $\\left\\{f_{1}^{\\nu}, \\ldots, f_{d_{v}^{\\pm}}^{\\nu}\\right\\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\tilde{\\mathcal{C}}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(\\Sigma)$. Define the trace of $\\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(x, x)$ by $\\operatorname{Tr} \\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(x, x):=\\sum_{j=1}^{d_{v}^{\\pm}}\\left|f_{j}^{v}(x)\\right|^{2} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\Sigma)$ which equals $\\sum_{j=1}^{d^{ \\pm}}<\\tilde{P}_{m, \\nu}^{ \\pm}(x, x) e_{j}(x) \\mid e_{j}(x)>_{G_{a, m}}$ where $\\left\\{e_{j}(x)\\right\\}_{j=1, \\ldots, d^{ \\pm}}$is any orthonormal basis of $T_{x}^{* 0, \\pm} \\Sigma$. From Propositions $5.8,5.5$ and Lemma 4.23 (for $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}$ and $\\tilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}$ ) it follows\nProposition 5.10. (Formula of McKean-Singer type for index $\\left(\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}\\right)$ ) For each $t>0$ we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{index}\\left(\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}\\right)=\\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v+}}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\tilde{C}_{m}^{v-}}(x, x)\\right] d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n$$\n\nRecall $D_{m}^{+}$of (4.32). To compare index $\\left(D_{m}^{+}\\right)$with index $\\left(\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}\\right)$, we have the following homotopy invariance. Here our Hodge theory in Section 4 provides a useful tool in the proof below.\nLemma 5.11. (Homotopy invariance) index $\\left(D_{m}^{+}\\right)=\\operatorname{index}\\left(\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}\\right)$.\nProof. Despite that our operators are of \"transversal\" type in the sense as constructed in this subsection, the arguments are essentially classical in spirit. The key point is to make sure that the noncompactness of $\\Sigma$ endowed with our various geometric data does no essential harm to those arguments that are valid for compact manifolds. We sketch the idea of the proof; for more details and references, the reader is referred to the proof of [18, Theorem 4.7] in a similar vein.\n\nFrom (4.32) and (5.5), we have $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}=D_{m}^{+}+\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$ where $\\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}: \\Omega_{m}^{0,+}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0,-}(\\Sigma)$ is a bounded linear operator of zeroth order. A homotopy between $L_{0}=D_{m}^{+}$and $L_{1}$ $=\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}$ can be realized by $L_{t}:=D_{m}^{+}+t \\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}=\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}+\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{c}+t \\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}: \\Omega_{m}^{0,+}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\Omega_{m}^{0,-}(\\Sigma)$ for $t \\in[0,1]$. Extending $L_{t}$ to $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(L_{t}\\right) \\subset L_{0,+, m}^{2}:=\\oplus_{q: \\text { even }} L_{0, q, m}^{2}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$, one can show that $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(L_{t}\\right)=H_{0,+, m}^{\\prime 1}:=L_{0,+, m}^{2} \\cap H_{0,+}^{\\prime 1}$ where $H_{0,+}^{\\prime 1}:=\\oplus_{q: \\text { even }} H_{0, q}^{\\prime 1}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (cf. (4.3) for the notation).\n\nNow consider $\\mathcal{H}_{0}:=H_{0,+, m}^{\\prime 1} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}^{*}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{1}:=L_{0,-, m}^{2} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}$. Let $A_{t}: \\mathcal{H}_{0}$ $\\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}_{1}$ be the bounded linear map defined by $A_{t}(u, v)=\\left(L_{t} u+v, P_{\\text {Ker } L_{0}} u\\right) \\in \\mathcal{H}_{1}$ for $(u, v) \\in \\mathcal{H}_{0}$, where $P_{\\text {Ker } L_{0}}$ denotes the orthogonal projection onto $\\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}$. We claim the following fact:\n\n$$\n\\exists r_{0}>0 \\text { such that } A_{t} \\text { is invertible for every } 0 \\leq t \\leq r_{0}\n$$\n\nFor $t=0$, the fact that $A_{0}$ is invertible follows from the Hodge theory for $L_{0}=D_{m}^{+}$ (cf. Theorem 4.22). For $t \\neq 0$, write $A_{t}=A_{0}+R_{t}$ so that $\\left\\|R_{t} u\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_{t}} \\leq C t\\|u\\|_{\\mathcal{H}_{0}}$. We can then construct the inverse of $A_{t}$ by the Neuman series for small $t$, proving (5.17).\n\nWe claim another fact: (In the remaining of the proof, we use \"ind\" as abbreviation of \"index\".)\n\n$$\n\\exists r>0 \\text { such that ind } L_{t}=\\text { ind } L_{0} \\text { for every } 0 \\leq t \\leq r\n$$\n\nFor $0 \\leq t \\leq r_{0}$ in (5.17) we define $B_{t}: \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t}^{*} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}^{*}$ by $B_{t}(a, b):=\\left(P_{\\text {Ker } L_{t}} u, v\\right) \\in \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t} \\oplus \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}^{*}$ where $(u, v)=A_{t}^{-1}(a, b)$. It is\n\nnot hard to see that $B_{t}$ is injective. It follows that $\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t}^{*}+\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0} \\leq$ $\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t}+\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}^{*}$. Hence ind $L_{0}:=\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}-\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{0}^{*} \\leq \\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t}$ $-\\operatorname{dim} \\operatorname{Ker} L_{t}^{*}=$ ind $L_{t}$. By a similar argument, we have ind $L_{0}^{*} \\leq$ ind $L_{t}^{*}$ for small t. Observe that ind $L_{t}^{*}=-$ ind $L_{t}$. So we also have ind $L_{0} \\geq$ ind $L_{t}$. We have shown (5.18).\n\nWe shall now show that (ind $\\left.\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c+}=\\right)$ ind $L_{1}=$ ind $L_{0}\\left(=\\right.$ ind $\\left.D_{m}^{+}\\right)$by the continuity method. Let $\\Lambda=\\left\\{t \\in[0,1]: \\operatorname{ind} L_{t}=\\right.$ ind $\\left.L_{0}\\right\\}$. Clearly $0 \\in \\Lambda$, so $\\Lambda$ is not empty. Suppose $t_{0} \\in \\Lambda$. By reasoning similar to the proof of (5.17) and (5.18) (replacing $L_{0}, A_{0}$ by $L_{t_{0}}, A_{t_{0}}$, respectively), we can show ind $L_{t}=$ ind $L_{t_{0}}$ for $t \\in$ $\\left(t_{0}-\\varepsilon, t_{0}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ with some $\\varepsilon>0$. This implies that $\\Lambda$ is open. On the other hand, we apply the same reasoning as in (5.18) to a limit point $t_{\\infty}$ of $\\Lambda$ and show that ind $L_{t_{\\infty}}=$ ind $L_{t_{n}}=$ ind $L_{0}$ where $t_{n} \\in \\Lambda$ is close enough to $t_{\\infty}$. So $t_{\\infty} \\in \\Lambda$. We have shown that $\\Lambda$ is closed. Therefore $\\Lambda=[0,1]$.\n\nFrom Lemma 5.11, Corollary 4.24 and Proposition 5.10, there follows a formula of McKean-Singer type:\n\nTheorem 5.12. (Formula of McKean-Singer type for index( $\\left.\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\text {-complex }\\right)$ ) For $m \\geq 0$ and $a>\\frac{m}{2}$ we have for each $t>0$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{q=0}^{n}(-1)^{q} \\operatorname{dim} H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=\\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\tilde{\\tilde{C}}_{m}^{c+}}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\tilde{\\tilde{C}}_{m}^{c-}}(x, x)\\right] d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n$$\n\nRemark 5.13. (Bundle case): Let $E$ be a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over $\\Sigma$, endowed with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric. We can extend $D_{m}^{ \\pm}, \\tilde{A}_{m}^{c}$, $\\tilde{D}_{m}^{c \\pm}$ and hence $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}}_{m}^{c \\pm}$ to $E$-valued $m$-spaces $\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma, E)$ in a standard manner. By similar arguments in deducing (5.19), we also have a McKean-Singer type formula for index $\\left(\\tilde{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{E}\\right.$-complex). That is, with $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})$ replaced by $H_{m}^{q}(\\Sigma, E)$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{C}}_{m}^{c \\pm}$ in the RHS replaced by their counterparts for $E$, the resulting two sides are equal.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 6. Approximation of the transversal heat kernel $e^{-t \\tilde{\\tilde{C}}_{m}^{c \\pm}}$ \n\nIn this section we are going to construct an (transversal) approximate heat kernel by patching up local heat kernels and taking its adjoint. We then carry out successive approximation to get a global (unique, transversal) heat kernel. Our main results are Theorems $6.13,6.18$ and 6.19 while the most technical lemma is Proposition 6.6 which brings the orthogonal projection $\\pi_{m}$ as already seen in (5.7) to an integral representation.\n\nThe motivations for the whole setting are implicit in Propositions 3.12 and 5.3. Let us remark that the two cases stated between (6.82) and (6.83) yield some complication of the heat kernel evaluation as mentioned in the Introduction.\n\nTo start with, let us choose suitable charts on $\\Sigma$ as follows. For $\\Sigma$ satisfying (2.6), (2.7) and (2.8), with any point $q \\in \\Sigma$ write $\\bar{q} \\in \\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$, the $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$orbit of $q$. Choose a distance function on $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$(say, obtained from a Riemannian metric on $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$which is a smooth manifold as mentioned in the proof of Theorem 2.3). Given small $\\varepsilon>0$, we have a coordinate neighborhood $V \\times(-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon) \\subset \\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$where $V \\subset$ $\\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ is a bounded domain. Remark that we may always choose $\\varepsilon=\\pi$ if the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ action on $\\Sigma$ is globally free. Due to the compactness of $\\Sigma / \\mathbb{R}^{+}$, we can find finitely\n\nmany $V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right), V_{j} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ so that (cf.

So we have $\\sum \\varphi_{j}=1$ on $\\Sigma$ in view of (6.1). Note that supp $\\varphi_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$ must be noncompact while if $\\varphi_{j}$ is regarded as functions on $V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)$, $\\operatorname{supp} \\varphi_{j}$ is compact.\n\nLet $(z, \\phi) \\in V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)$ denote the coordinates for $\\bar{q} \\in V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)$. Put\n\n$$\nA_{j}=\\left\\{z \\in V_{j}: \\text { there is a } \\phi \\in\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\text { such that } \\varphi_{j}(z, \\phi) \\neq 0\\right\\} \\subset \\subset V_{j}\n$$\n\nii) $\\tau_{j}(z) \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$ with $\\tau_{j} \\equiv 1$ on some neighborhood of $A_{j}$ (and $\\equiv 0$ outside $\\left.V_{j}\\right)$.\niii) $\\sigma_{j} \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}\\left(\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{4}, \\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{4}\\right)\\right)$ with\n\n$$\n\\int_{-\\varepsilon_{j}}^{\\varepsilon_{j}} \\sigma_{j}(\\phi) \\frac{d v_{S^{1}}(\\phi)}{2 \\pi}=\\int_{-\\varepsilon_{j} / 4}^{\\varepsilon_{j} / 4} \\sigma_{j}(\\phi) \\frac{d v_{S^{1}}(\\phi)}{2 \\pi}=1\n$$\n\nIt is possible to adapt the seemingly unusable formulas in [18, (5.39) on p.81] to the present situation. Let us first set up the following. For a (regular) domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$, we have the Dirichlet heat kernel for $\\square_{\\Omega, m}^{c}$ (see (5.6) iii), cf. (6.30), (6.31)), denoted by $K_{t}^{\\Omega}(z, \\zeta)$ for $z, \\zeta \\in \\Omega$. See the preceding section for the definition of such spin ${ }^{c}$ Laplacians (cf. (5.6)), and [16] or [18] for the Dirichlet heat kernel construction (under suitable regularity conditions on $\\partial V_{j}$ ). We set\n\n$$\nK_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)=K_{t}^{\\Omega}(z, \\zeta) \\text { with } \\Omega=V_{j}\n$$\n\nNote that we have identified $V_{j} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ with $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\subset V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ as embedded in $\\Sigma$ with the induced metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\mid v_{j}$.\n\nRemark that we should have considered the adjoint heat kernel in (6.3); but the operator here is self-adjoint the associated kernel functions are the same: $\\left(K_{t}^{j}\\right)^{*}(z, \\zeta)$ $=K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)$ (acting to the left on an element in $\\zeta$; compare (7.61)).\n\nFor $u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ we have (see Notation 6.1 for $W_{j}$ )\n\n$$\n\\pi_{m} u \\mid W_{j}(\\zeta, \\eta)=\\eta^{m} v_{j}(\\zeta) ; \\text { subscript \" } j \\text { \" omitted in }(\\zeta, \\eta)\n$$\n\nfor some $v_{j}(\\zeta) \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$. This $L^{2}$ property of $v_{j}$ can be checked using (3.26). It is easily verified, with the metric $G_{a, m}$, that $L_{m}^{2, q}(\\Sigma)$ is orthogonal to $L_{m^{\\prime}}^{2, q}(\\Sigma)$ if $m \\neq m^{\\prime}$. But these spaces $\\left\\{L_{m}^{2, q}(\\Sigma)\\right\\}_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ do not constitute a complete decomposition of $L^{2, q}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nLet $\\Psi_{S, m}$ (resp. $\\Psi_{*, m}$ ) denote $\\Psi_{q, m}$ in (3.32) for $q$ even/odd (resp. for all $q$ ) to identify bundle-valued elements on $V_{j}$ with $m$-space elements on $W_{j}$ (probably with an extra bundle $E ; U_{j}, \\psi_{j}^{-1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ in (3.32) taken to be $V_{j}, W_{j}$ in Notation 6.1).\n\nWe schematically define the operator $H_{m, t}^{j}$ to be, with cut-off functions omitted, $\\Psi_{*, m} \\circ K_{t}^{j} \\circ \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1}$ (see (3.32) and (6.3)) and its adjoint to be $\\Psi_{*, m} \\circ K_{t}^{j *} \\circ \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1}$ where\n\n$K_{t}^{j *}$ is the usual heat kernel adjoint (see Remark 6.2 below). More precisely one has the expression in terms of local coordinates (with the induced trivializations on bundles) and of those cut-off functions after Notation 6.1\n\n$$\nH_{m, t}^{j}(x, y) \\stackrel{(6.3)}{:}=\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\eta^{-m} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m}\n$$\n\nwhere $x=(z, w), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)\\left(z, \\zeta \\in V_{j}, w, \\eta \\in\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right.$with the subscript \" $j$ \" omitted in these coordinates), $\\eta=|\\eta| e^{i \\vartheta}$. This slightly tedious expression (6.5) is basically motivated (modulo the cutoff functions) by Propositions 5.3 and 3.12 (see also $[18,(5.38)$ and (5.39) in p.81] and Remark 6.11 below for the differences) with a seemingly extra factor $l(y)^{m}$ in the end. This factor $l(y)^{m}$ plays a role similar to $\\sigma_{j}$ (cf. (6.2)) due to its normalization/unity property (see (3.27), (3.16)). We note that the metric $G_{a, m}$ is used for $H_{m, t}^{j}$ while the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ is used for $K_{t}^{j}$, but they coincide on $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ (see Remark 5.6). See also Lemma 7.13 for the $L^{2}$-isometry property of $\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}$ that partly justifies the reason for why the expression (6.5) is formed in this way (cf. [18, top lines on p.74]). See more in Remark 6.2\n\nRemark 6.2. Regarding the adjoint of $H_{m, t}^{j}$ as given before (6.5), it is shown in Lemma 7.13 that the above $\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}$ preserve $L^{2}$-norms (up to a multiplicative constant), giving isomorphisms between respective Hilbert spaces. So the adjoint of $H_{m, t}^{j}$ in the usual sense and the one as defined above coincide. The kernel function $\\left(\\Psi_{*, m} \\circ K_{t}^{j} \\circ \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1}\\right)(x, y)$ on $W_{j} \\times W_{j}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{\\varepsilon_{j}} w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\eta^{-m} l(y)^{m}$ because for $u(y)=\\eta^{m} v(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta}), \\frac{\\pi}{\\varepsilon_{j}} \\int_{W_{j}} w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\eta^{-m} l(y)^{m} u(y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)$ equals\n\n$$\nw^{m} \\int_{V_{j}} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) v(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta}) \\pi^{*} d v_{M}(\\zeta)\n$$\n\n(see the proof of Lemma 7.13), and this is seen to be $\\left(\\Psi K_{t}^{j} \\Psi^{-1}(u)\\right)(x)$ (via definitions). This motivates (6.5). Denote by $L_{m, l o c}^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (or $L_{m, l o c}^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for short) the space of $L^{2}$-completion of $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, q}\\left(W_{j}\\right)$ (see Definition 3.10). Similarly denote by $L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (or $L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for short) the space of $L^{2}$ completion of square-integrable smooth sections of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ over $W_{j}$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}$ (cf. Remark.5.6). In the similar spirit as in Lemma 5.7, we have $L_{m, l o c}^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\subset L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Now if $\\tilde{u} \\in\\left(L_{m, l o c}^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}$ ( $\\subset$ $\\left.L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)$ then the similar argument as above implies that $\\Psi K_{t}^{j} \\Psi^{-1}(\\tilde{u})=0$. Hence $\\Psi_{*, m} \\circ K_{t}^{j} \\circ \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1}$ extends to $L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ with image in $L_{m, l o c}^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ $\\subset L^{2, q}\\left(W_{j}, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\n\nWe are going to form an approximate heat kernel:\n\n$$\nP_{m, t}^{0}:=\\sum_{j(\\text { finite })} P_{m, t}^{0, j} \\quad \\text { where } P_{m, t}^{0, j}:=H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{m, t}^{j}$ is the operator associated with the kernel function $H_{m, t}^{j}(x, y)$ of (6.5).\nTo formulate our next result, the following setup is needed. For any integer $s \\geq$ 0 , we define the $C_{R}^{s}$-norm of an element $\\omega$ in $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, s}(\\Sigma)$ or $\\Omega_{m, l o c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ (see Definition 3.10) as follows.\n\nFix an integer $m \\geq 0$ and a partition of unity $\\varphi_{j}$ (see $i$ ) below Notation 6.1). Writing $\\omega(x)=\\Sigma_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) \\omega(x)=\\Sigma_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} h_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}, w, \\bar{w}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}$ where $z \\in V_{j}$ and $w$\n\n$\\in\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$are local coordinates of $x$, for an integer $s \\geq 0$ we define ( $w=$ $\\left.\\left.\\left|w\\right| e^{i \\phi}\\right)\\right.$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\omega \\|_{C_{B}^{s}}:=\\sum_{j} \\sum_{k=0}^{s} \\sup _{w}\\right\\| \\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\phi) h_{I_{k}}(\\cdot, \\bar{\\cdot}, w, \\bar{w}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}} \\|_{C^{k}\\left(V_{j}\\right)} \\text { for } \\omega \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nwhich means the supremum over $x$ in the domain, of all partial derivatives in $z \\in V_{j}$ up to order $s$. Compare the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{s}^{*}$-norm given in (4.3). Similarly for an element of the form (cf. Proposition 6.9 or (6.27))\n\n$$\nK(x, y)=\\sum_{j} w^{m} k^{j}(x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}\n$$\n\nwhere $x=(z, w), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)$, assuming $k^{j}(x, y)$ are $C^{\\infty}$-smooth we define the $C_{B}^{s}$ norm of $K$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\|K(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\|_{C_{B}^{s}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)}:=\\sum_{j} \\sup _{w, \\eta}\\left\\|k^{j}((\\cdot, w),(\\cdot, \\eta))\\right\\|_{C^{s}\\left(V_{j} \\times V_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhich means the supremum over all $x, y$ in the domain, of all partial derivatives of $k^{j}$ in $z, \\zeta \\in V_{j}$ up to order $s$. Note that the $C_{B}^{s}$-norm (6.9) depends on the choice of the expression (6.8) with \" $m$ \", but we do not put on such dependence whenever no confusion occurs.\n\nLemma 6.3. With the notation above, $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0+} P_{m, t}^{0}(u)=\\pi_{m} u$ (pointwise) for every $u \\in \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Moreover, for every integer $s \\geq 0$ it holds that $P_{m, t}^{0}(u) \\rightarrow \\pi_{m} u$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$ in the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{s}}$ (hence in $L^{2}$ ) for $u \\in$ $\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. In particular $P_{m, t}^{0}(u) \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nRemark 6.4. For $u_{t}, u_{0} \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ assume $u_{t} \\rightarrow u_{0}$ in $C_{B}^{0}$. Then it is easy to see that $u_{t} \\rightarrow u_{0}$ pointwise on $\\Sigma$ and in $L^{2, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ (in view of Remark 3.4). In particular, if $u \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ with $\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{0}}=0$ then $u=0$.\n\nRemark 6.5. The presence of the projection in Lemma 6.3 (rather than the identity operator in the usual case) reflects the transversal feature of $P_{m, t}^{0}$.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 6.3) For $u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right), \\pi_{m} u \\in L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ and by (6.4) $\\left.\\pi_{m} u\\right|_{W_{j}}=\\eta^{m} v_{j}(\\zeta)$ for some $v_{j}(\\zeta) \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$, we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0+}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)\\right)(x) \\stackrel{(6.4)+(6.5)}{=} \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0+} \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left\\{\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\eta^{-m} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m} \\eta^{m} v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right\\} d v_{\\tilde{V}_{j}}(\\zeta) d v_{f, m}(\\eta) \\\\\n& =\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0+} \\int_{V_{j}}\\left\\{\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right\\} d v_{V_{j}}(\\zeta) \\int_{C_{\\varepsilon_{j}}} l(y)^{m} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) d v_{f, m}(\\eta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (6.2) and hence\n\n$$\n\\int_{C_{\\varepsilon_{j}}} l(y)^{m} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) d v_{f, m}(\\eta)=1\n$$\n\n(cf. (3.26) with $\\tau_{p_{0}}^{*}$ dropped as remarked after (3.27)), the above simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0+} \\int_{V_{j}}\\left\\{\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right\\} d v_{V_{j}}(\\zeta)\n$$\n\nthen, since $K_{t}^{j} \\rightarrow I$ in the distribution sense as $t \\rightarrow 0$ (cf. [6, Definition 2.15 (4) on p.75 ]) it further simplifies to $\\varphi_{j}(x) \\tau_{j}(z)\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)(z, w)$ by (6.4). From this, (6.6), $\\tau_{j}(z)=1$ on $\\operatorname{supp} \\varphi_{j}$ and $\\Sigma_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x)=1$, the first assertion of the lemma follows. It also follows from the expression in the last paragraph of $[6$, p.85] that $P_{m, t}^{0}(u)=$ $\\sum_{j} H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right) \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$.\n\nBy the argument similar to (6.10)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{m, t}^{0}(u)(z, w)-\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)(z, w) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{j} w^{m} \\varphi_{j}(x)\\left[\\int_{V_{j}} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) v_{j}(\\zeta) d v_{V_{j}}(\\zeta)-\\tau_{j}(z) v_{j}(z)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence for some constant $C(s)>0$, as $t \\rightarrow 0$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|P_{m, t}^{0}(u)-\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)\\right\\|_{C_{D}^{s}} \\leq C(s) \\sum_{(j, k) \\in I}\\left\\|K_{t}^{j}\\left(\\tau_{j} v_{j}\\right)-\\tau_{j} v_{j}\\right\\|_{C^{*}\\left(V_{j}\\right)} \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nby directly applying [6, Theorem 2.20(2)]. This proves the second assertion (convergence in $L^{2}$ by Remark 6.4)..\n\nThe first task is aimed to express the kernel function $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ (see the RHS of (6.6)) in a more manageable form. This is given in Proposition 6.9 below.\n\nTo start with, suppose that $(z, w)$ denotes local coordinates around $x \\in \\Sigma$. Let $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ x$ denote the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit of $x$. We define $\\tau_{x}: \\eta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\rightarrow \\eta \\circ x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ x$.\n\nRecall the definition of $L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (resp. $L_{m}^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right), \\pi_{m}$ ) in Remark 5.6. We first express $\\pi_{m}(u)(x)$ in the following proposition:\n\nProposition 6.6. For the orthogonal projection (recall that $a>\\frac{\\eta}{2} \\geq 0$ )\n\n$$\n\\pi_{m}: L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\equiv L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\nit holds that for $u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\pi_{m}(u)(x)=l(x)^{m} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} u(\\xi \\circ x)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{x}$ is defined precedingly. Moreover if $u$ is smooth, $\\pi_{m}(u)$ remains smooth. Here $\\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*}:\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{\\xi \\circ x} \\rightarrow\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{x}$ denotes the pullback of forms.\n\nRemark 6.7. i) Note that since $u$ is $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$-valued and the action $\\sigma$ leaves $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ invariant, we can trivialize $\\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} u(\\xi \\circ x)$ and view it as coefficient function(s) with respect to a basis of global sections ( $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant) of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ along the orbit $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ x$. We then write $\\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} u(\\xi \\circ x)$ as $u(\\xi \\circ x)$ by abuse of notation in the proof below. See Footnote ${ }^{6}$ (seated above (6.13)) for further details.\nii) The action $\\sigma$ preserves the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ endowed on $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$. There is another metric $\\left.G_{a, m}\\right|_{\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}}$ on $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ induced from $G_{a, m}$ when $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is viewed as a subbundle of $\\Lambda^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ (see Remark 5.6). We have that $\\pi^{*} g_{M}=\\left.G_{a, m}\\right|_{\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}}$ (cf. Lemma 8.10 i)) and thus $\\sigma$ preserves the metric $\\left.G_{a, m}\\right|_{\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}}$ too.\n\nRemark 6.8. i) $L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is not trivial: Using a local bump function/section (cf. Remark 6.7) $u$ with value $u(\\xi \\circ x)$ close to $\\xi^{m}$ and support near $x=(z, w=1)$ in coordinates such that $\\pi_{m}(u)(x)>0$ as $l(x)$ and the measure $\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)$ are positive, yields the desired result.\n\nii) There exists a fixed $u$ contained in $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a}\\right)$ for any $a>0$ and $a>\\frac{m}{2} \\geq 0$ such that $\\pi_{m}(u)=0$ in $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a}\\right)$ (which by Lemma 3.5 equals $\\left.L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)\\right)$ : Let $u$ be a local function/section supported near $w=1 / 2$ in a chart $(z, w)$, depending only on $z, r=|w|$ such that for $m=0$ the integral (6.12) of $u(z, r)$ over $r$ equals 0 with respect to $G_{a}$ for any $a>0$; this is made possible because of (3.18) where the parameter \" $a$ \" has the impact on $G_{a}$ only outside a neighborhood of $\\{w=1 / 2\\}$. Since the angular integral of $u$ is seen to vanish for $m>0$ (cf. (6.12) and (7.24)), altogether we obtain the claim.\n\nProof. (of Proposition 6.6) Recall that $l(x)$ is defined in (3.3). Locally $l(x)$ $=h(z(x), \\bar{z}(x)) w(x) \\bar{w}(x)$ or $h w \\bar{w}$ in short for $x \\in\\left(W_{j},(z, w)\\right)$. The orthogonal projection $\\pi_{m}$ is characterized by the following conditions:\ni) $\\pi_{m}$ is a bounded linear operator on $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$,\nii) $\\pi_{m}(u) \\in L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$ for $u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$,\niii) $\\pi_{m} \\circ \\pi_{m}=\\pi_{m}$\niv) $\\pi_{m}^{*}=\\pi_{m}$, i.e., $\\pi_{m}$ is self-adjoint.\nv) $\\pi_{m}(u)=u$ for $u \\in L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\n\nNow we claim that $\\pi_{m}(u)$ defined by (6.12) satisfies the above conditions. For $x \\in \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (see (1.7) for the definition of $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ ), in local coordinates $(z, w)$ for $x$ and $(z, \\eta)$ for $\\xi \\circ x$ where $\\eta=\\xi w$ (see Footnote ${ }^{5}$ ), we write (see Footnote ${ }^{6}$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\pi_{m}(u)(x) \\stackrel{l=h w \\bar{w}}{=} h^{m}|w|^{2 m} \\int_{\\eta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} u(z, \\eta)(\\bar{\\eta})^{m}(\\bar{w})^{-m}\\left(\\tau_{(z, 1)}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\eta) \\\\\n& |w|^{2 m}(\\bar{w})^{-m}=w^{m} \\quad w^{m} h^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) \\int_{\\eta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} u(z, \\eta)(\\bar{\\eta})^{m}\\left(\\tau_{(z, 1)}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\eta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy Remark $6.7 i$ ) the norm of the coefficient (vector-valued) function $u(z, \\eta)$ or $u(y)$ below should include the norms of $(0, q)$-forms; these norms of forms are nevertheless nonzero constants along $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ x$ by the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance of the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (by Remark $6.7 \\mathrm{ii})$ ). For simplicity we drop these constant norms henceforth (they can be uniformly bounded as $M=$ the space of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbits is compact).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ Strictly speaking, the validity of $\\eta=\\xi w$ and $z(\\xi \\circ x)=z$ requires the smallness of the angledifference between $x$ and $\\xi \\circ x$ (see (2.7) and cases $i$ ), ii) after (6.82)). But since $x \\notin \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$, we can assume that $\\delta_{j}=\\pi$ in (2.6) for suitable holomorphic coordinates $(z, w)$ at $x$. Hence $\\eta=\\xi w$ and $z(\\xi \\circ x)=z$ are valid for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ by (2.7).\n    ${ }^{6}$ In view of Remark $6.7 \\mathrm{ii}$ ): for $x \\in \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$, choose a local basis $\\eta^{I_{q}}$ for $(0, q)$-forms near $\\pi(x)$ in $M$, set $\\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{q}}:=\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{q}}$ and compute $\\sigma(\\xi)^{*} \\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{q}}=\\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{q}}$ since $\\pi \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)=\\pi$ on $\\Sigma$, i.e. $\\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{q}}$ is invariant under the action $\\sigma$. Write a global section $u$ of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ along $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ x$ as $u=u_{I_{q}} \\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{q}}$ (summing over $I_{q}$ and $q$ ).

By the compactness of $M$ we have that for $j^{\\prime}$ in a finite index set $W_{j^{\\prime}}, V_{j^{\\prime}}$ (see Notation 6.1) can be formed to satisfy $\\cup_{j^{\\prime}} \\pi\\left(V_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)\\left(=\\pi\\left(W_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)\\right) \\supset M \\backslash \\bar{N}_{j}$ with $\\pi\\left(V_{j^{\\prime}}\\right) \\subset M \\backslash M_{\\text {sing }}$.\n\nAssume from now on that the support of $u$ is contained in $\\left(\\Sigma \\backslash N_{j} \\subset\\right) \\tilde{W}_{j}:=$ $\\cup_{j^{\\prime}} W_{j^{\\prime}}\\left(\\subset \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ with $\\tilde{V}_{j}:=\\cup_{j^{\\prime}} V_{j^{\\prime}}$, meaning that $u=0$ a.e. on a neighborhood of $\\Sigma \\backslash \\tilde{W}_{j}$. We will come back to the general case later. Then (via Footnote ${ }^{5}$ as just mentioned)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\tilde{W}_{j}}\\left|\\pi_{m}(u)(x)\\right|^{2} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x) \\stackrel{(6.15)+(3.22)}{\\leq} \\int_{z \\in \\tilde{V}_{j}}\\left\\{\\int_{w \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} h^{m}|w|^{2 m} \\tau_{(z, 1)}^{*} d v_{f, m}(w)\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\left.\\int_{\\eta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}|u(z, \\eta)|^{2}\\left(\\tau_{(z, 1)}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\eta)\\right\\} d v(z) \\stackrel{(6.16)}{\\leq} \\int_{\\tilde{W}_{j}}|u(y)|^{2} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $y=(z, \\eta) \\in \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and the last term equals $\\int_{\\Sigma}|u|^{2} d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ by the support condition, implies that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\pi_{m}(u)\\right\\|_{L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)} \\leq\\|u\\|_{L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)}\n$$\n\nsince (6.17) holds for every $j, \\cup_{j} \\tilde{W}_{j}=\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ is of measure 0 .

Hence $\\pi_{m}^{*}=\\pi_{m}$ proving condition $i v)$.\n\nTo show $v$ ), since supp $u \\subset \\tilde{W}_{j} \\subset \\Sigma \\backslash N_{l}$ for $l \\gg j$ by assumption, we have that $u(\\xi \\circ x)=\\xi^{m} u(x)$ a.e. if $u$ is further assumed to be in $L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$; see the Footnote ${ }^{6}$ above for explanation of $u(\\xi \\circ x)$.

(3.27)) are used for the second (resp. third) equality. Condition $v$ ) follows.\n\nFor the general case let us first prove the following:\n(6.22) For the sake of clarity let us denote by $\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}(u)$ the RHS of (6.12).\n\nLet $u_{j} \\rightarrow u$ in $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Then $\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}\\left(u_{j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\tilde{\\pi}_{m}(u)$ in $L^{2}$.\nProof of (6.22): The $L^{2}$-difference $\\left\\|\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}\\left(u_{j}\\right)-\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}(u)\\right\\|_{L^{2}}^{2}$ is bounded by\n\n$$\nI_{j}:=\\int_{\\Sigma} l(x)^{2 m}\\left\\{\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\mid u_{j}(\\xi \\circ x)-u(\\xi \\circ x)\\left\\|\\xi\\left|{ }^{m}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)\\right.\\right\\}^{2} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x)\\right.\n$$\n\nApplying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the integral over $\\xi$ gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_{j} \\leq \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left\\{l(x)^{m} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\mid u_{j}(\\xi \\circ x)-u(\\xi \\circ x)\\right\\}^{2}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi) \\\\\n& \\cdot \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} l(x)^{m}|\\xi|^{2 m}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)\\} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nObserve that $l(x)^{m}|\\xi|^{2 m}=l(\\xi \\circ x)^{m}$ by (7.20) and hence $\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} l(x)^{m}|\\xi|^{2 m}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)$ $=1$ by (3.27). It is possible to simplify (6.23) further: Substituting this into (6.23) and making a change of variables $y=\\xi \\circ x$ over $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (to ensure bijectivity), we can write the RHS of (6.23) as ( $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ being of measure 0 )\n\n$$\n\\int_{y \\in \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}}\\left\\{\\left|u_{j}(y)-u(y)\\right|^{2} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} l\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)^{m}\\left(\\tau_{y}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right)\\right\\} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n$$\n\nbecause $\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x)$ in (6.23) equals $\\left(\\tilde{\\sigma}^{*}\\left[\\left(\\tau_{y}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\\right]\\right)(\\xi, x)$ (where $\\tilde{\\sigma}:(\\xi, x) \\rightarrow\\left(\\xi^{-1}, y=\\xi \\circ x\\right)$ ) as proved in Lemma 7.6 iii). Again $\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} l\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ\\right.$ $y)^{m}\\left(\\tau_{y}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right)=1$ for any $y$ by (3.27) reduces (6.24) to $\\int_{\\Sigma}\\left|u_{j}(y)-u(y)\\right|^{2} d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ which tends to zero as $j \\rightarrow \\infty$ by assumption. We have shown (6.22).\n\nWe can now finish the proof for the general $\\tilde{u}$. Let $\\bar{\\chi}_{j}$ be cut-off functions with support in $M \\backslash M_{\\text {sing }}$ (cf. [13, p.37]), which are $\\equiv 1$ on $\\pi\\left(\\tilde{W}_{j}\\right)\\left(=\\pi\\left(\\tilde{V}_{j}\\right)\\right) \\supset M \\backslash \\tilde{N}_{j}$ and $\\bar{\\chi}_{j} \\rightarrow 1$ on $M \\backslash M_{\\text {sing }}$ via $\\cap_{j} \\tilde{N}_{j}=M_{\\text {sing }}$ as already assumed. Write $\\chi_{j}=\\pi^{*} \\bar{\\chi}_{j}$ and consider $\\chi_{j} \\tilde{u}$. Then one has the following: $a) \\chi_{j} \\tilde{u} \\rightarrow \\tilde{u}$ in $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right) ; b$ ) if $\\tilde{u} \\in$ $L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$, since $\\chi_{j}$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant by construction $\\chi_{j} \\tilde{u}(\\xi \\circ x)=\\xi^{m}\\left(\\chi_{j} \\tilde{u}\\right)(x)$, i.e. $\\chi_{j} \\tilde{u} \\in L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Using $a$ ), $b$ ) and applying (6.22) with the previously proved special case $u \\equiv \\chi_{j} \\tilde{u}$ one checks that $\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}$ easily satisfies the above conditions $i$ ) to $v$ ) as the original orthogonal projection $\\pi_{m}$ does, giving that $\\tilde{\\pi}_{m}=\\pi_{m}$ as desired.\n\nFor the last statement of the lemma, the continuity property of $\\pi_{m}$ in $C_{B}^{*}$-norm (see (6.7)) is postponed to Lemma 6.14.\n\nDefine $d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)$, a 2 -form in $\\xi$ for $(\\xi, y) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\Sigma$ (i.e., it is of the form $f(y, \\bar{y}, \\xi, \\bar{\\xi}) d \\xi \\wedge$ $d \\bar{\\xi})$ by\n\n$$\nd \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi):=l\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\wedge d v_{f, m}(y) / d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n$$\n\nwhere $d v_{\\Sigma, m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)$ denotes the pullback on $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\Sigma$ of $d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ (see (3.22)) by the map $(\\xi, y) \\rightarrow \\xi^{-1} \\circ y$. Notice that $d v_{\\Sigma, m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)$ in (6.25) contains a 2 -form in $\\xi$ wedging a \"horizontal\" $2 n-2$ form in $y$, and one sees that it is this 2 -form that survives in the RHS of (6.25).\n\nTo express $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ as mentioned earlier, via Proposition 6.6 above we view $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ and $H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}$ as linear transformations from $\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{y}$ to $\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{x}$, where $\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}:\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{y} \\rightarrow\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}$ denotes the pullback of forms.\n\nProposition 6.9. Let the notation $\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}$ be as above.\ni) The kernel function for $P_{m, t}^{0, j} \\equiv H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}$ is given by\n$(6.26)$\n$\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)=\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}\\right)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi), \\forall(x, y) \\in \\Sigma \\times \\Sigma$.\nii) $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ is of the form, with $x=(z, w), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)$ as in (6.5),\n\n$$\n\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)=w^{m} p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}\n$$\n\nfor some smooth and $C_{B}^{*}$-bounded ( $t$-dependent) linear transformation $p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y)$ from $\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{y}$ to $\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)_{x}$ (see (6.9) for the definition of $C_{B}^{*}$-norm).\niii) $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ is $L^{2}$ in two variables $(x, y) \\in \\Sigma \\times \\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m} \\times G_{a, m}$. Compare Lemma 6.12 and its proof for similar consequences.\n\nProof. Compute $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right) u$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& {\\left[\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right) u\\right](x)=H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(\\pi_{m}(u)\\right)(x)} \\\\\n= & \\int_{p \\in \\Sigma} H_{m, t}^{j}(x, p) \\pi_{m}(u)(p) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(p) \\\\\n= & \\int_{p \\in \\Sigma} H_{m, t}^{j}(x, p) \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\sigma(\\xi)_{p}^{*} u(\\xi \\circ p)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m}\\left(\\tau_{p}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi) l(p)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe now make a change of variables: $(p, \\xi) \\rightarrow(y, \\xi)$ by $y=\\xi \\circ p$ (on $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ ). After a careful examination, (6.28) equals ( $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ being of measure zero)\n\n$$\n\\int_{y \\in \\Sigma} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} H_{m, t}^{j}(x, p) \\circ\\left(\\sigma(\\xi)_{p}^{*} u(y)\\right)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m} d v_{f, m}(y) l\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)^{m} \\wedge d v_{\\Sigma, m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)\\}\n$$\n\nBy rearranging terms, the above becomes (by (6.25)) (noting that $p=\\xi^{-1} \\circ y$ and $\\left.H_{m, t}^{j}(x, p) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{p}^{*} \\text { acts on } u(y)\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\int_{y \\in \\Sigma}\\left[\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}\\right)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)\\right] u(y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n$$\n\nNow (6.26) follows from the integrand $[\\ldots]$ in (6.29).\nThe proof of (6.27) will be postponed to Section 7 after studying the properties of $d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)$. See the paragraph prior to Remark 7.9 (containing (7.40) through (7.49)). The assertion iii) follows from the $C_{B}^{*}$-bound ( $C_{B}^{0}$ enough) and Remark 3.4 .\n\nNext we want to compute $\\left(\\partial_{t} P_{m, t}^{0}\\right) u+P_{m, t}^{0} \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\pi_{m} u$ (see (5.6) for $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}$, (6.6) for $\\left.P_{m, t}^{0}\\right)$.

Write $\\left.\\pi_{m} u\\right|_{W_{j}}(\\zeta, \\eta)=\\eta^{m} v_{j}(\\zeta)$ (see (6.4); we drop subscripts \" $j$ \" on the coordinates). Recalling that $\\bigcirc_{m, y}^{c \\pm}$ acts on $y(=(\\zeta, \\eta))$ while $\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}$ acts on $\\zeta$ via Proposition 5.3, we compute $\\left(P_{m, t}^{0}\\right.$ is the sum of $\\left.H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right.$ over $\\left.j(6.5)\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\partial_{t} H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)+H_{m, t}^{j} \\bigcirc_{m, y}^{c \\pm}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right) \\\\\n= & \\int_{W_{j}}\\left\\{\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} \\partial_{t} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) v_{j}(\\zeta) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\left(\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm} v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right\\} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y) \\\\\n= & \\int_{V_{j}} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m}\\left\\{\\partial_{t} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) v_{j}(\\zeta)+K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\left(\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm} v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right)\\right\\} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) d v(\\zeta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nin which we have used $\\int_{C_{s_{j}}} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m} d v_{f, m}(\\eta)=1$ by (6.11).

It follows that $\\varphi_{j}(x) S_{j}(t, x, \\zeta)=0$ if $(z(x), \\zeta)$ is in some small neighborhood of $(z, z)$ (due to $[\\tau, \\square]=0$ there). The idea is that the singular part of $\\varphi_{j} S_{j}$ originally caused by $K_{t}^{j}$ along the diagonal $\\left(\\sim \\frac{1}{t^{n-1}}\\right)$ is now dismissed.\n\nNote that $S_{j}(t, x, \\zeta)$ in (6.35) is a differential operator acting on $v_{j}(\\zeta)$. We can convert it into a kernel function via an integration by parts as follows: by\n\n(6.36), the self-adjointness of $\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}$ with $\\tau_{j}(\\zeta)$ being of compact support, and $\\int_{C_{z_{j}}} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m} d v_{f, m}(\\eta)=1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { LHS of }(6.35)=\\int_{V_{j}} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\left|\\tau_{j}(\\zeta), \\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}\\right|\\left(v_{j}(\\zeta)\\right) d v(\\zeta) \\\\\n& =\\int_{V_{j}} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m}\\left\\{\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}\\left(K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right)-\\left(\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm} K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\right) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right\\} v_{j}(\\zeta) d v(\\zeta) \\\\\n& =\\int_{V_{j}} \\varphi_{j}(x) \\hat{S}_{j}(t, x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{-m} v_{j}(\\zeta) d v(\\zeta) \\\\\n& =\\int_{W_{j}} \\varphi_{j}(x) \\hat{S}_{j}(t, x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{-m} \\eta^{-m}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)(y) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere (the $\\left[\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}, \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right]$ below as a first order differential operator acts on the $\\zeta$-variable of $\\left.K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\hat{S}_{j}(t, x, y):=w^{m}\\left[\\square_{\\zeta, m}^{c \\pm}, \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)\\right]\\left(K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)\\right) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}\n$$\n\nTherefore using an analogous argument of $[18,(5.47)]$ for (6.37) (it is essential that the Gaussian factor $\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\partial_{t}^{2} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta)}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\right)$ encoded in $K_{t}^{j}$, see (6.84), absorbs the singular part $\\frac{1}{t^{\\varepsilon-1}}$ if $(z, \\zeta)$ is off the diagonal where $[\\tau, \\square]=0$ as mentioned above), we conclude that for every $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, there exist $\\varepsilon>0, C_{s}>0$ independent of $t$ such that (noting that $\\bar{\\eta}^{-m} \\eta^{-m} l(y)^{m}=h^{m}(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta})$ by (6.43) below)\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}(x) \\hat{S}_{j}(t, x, y) h^{m}(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta}) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta)\\right\\|_{C_{R}^{s}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)} \\leq C_{s} e^{-\\frac{s}{\\tau}} \\text { for } t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\n$$\n\nFrom (6.34) and (6.37) it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\partial_{t} P_{m, t}^{0}\\right) u+P_{m, t}^{0}\\left(\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right) u=\\hat{R}_{t}\\left(\\pi_{m} u\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{t}(x, y):=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) \\hat{S}_{j}(t, x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{-m} \\eta^{-m} \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) l(y)^{m}\n$$\n\nSo (6.32) holds for $R_{t}:=\\hat{R}_{t} \\circ \\pi_{m}$ in view of (6.40) and (an analogue of (6.26))\n\n$$\nR(t, x, y)\\left(=R_{t}(x, y)\\right)=\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(\\hat{R}_{t}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}\\right)(\\bar{\\xi})^{m} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)\n$$\n\nNow that\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\eta}^{-m} \\eta^{-m} l(y)^{m}=h^{m}(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta})\n$$\n\nfrom (6.41) is bounded in $\\zeta \\in M=\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ by Lemma $7.6 i v$ ), which is compact, $\\bar{\\eta}^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}$ (from (6.38) and (6.42)) is also bounded for $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ (using (2.7) for $\\rho=|\\xi|$ ) and $\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)=1$ by Corollary 7.7, we conclude (6.33) for $s=0$ by (6.39) via (6.41), (6.42). For $s>0$ note the definition of $C_{R}^{s}$-norms that concern mainly the $z$ or $\\zeta$-variables (i.e. the horizontal ones). Observe that\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\eta}^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}=\\chi(y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi(y) & =\\frac{\\bar{\\eta}^{m}\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ y\\right)}{\\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)}|\\xi|^{-m} \\bar{\\xi}^{m}\\left(\\xi=|\\xi| e^{i \\gamma}\\right) \\\\\n& =e^{i m \\theta\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ y\\right)} e^{-i m \\gamma} e^{-i m \\theta(y)}\\left(\\eta(y)=|\\eta(y)| e^{-i \\theta(y)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $C_{B}^{s}$-norms involve no $\\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)$ (see (6.7)), for the $C_{B}^{s}$-norms of $R(t, x, y)$ it suffices to prove, with (6.39), the smoothness of $h^{m}$ and $\\chi(y)$ by using the compactness of their $\\zeta$-domains. We discuss this smoothness issue as follows. For the smoothness of $\\theta\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ y\\right)$ (in $\\chi(y)$ ) see a similar claim on $C_{B}^{s}$-norm in (6.27) (as it involves the similar expression $\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ y\\right)$ by (6.26)), whose proof is placed after (7.35). In this proof $\\theta\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ y\\right)$ actually lies in (7.45), whose smoothness is proved in the last paragraph after (7.49) involving the smoothness of $\\alpha_{k}$. The point is that the \"large\" angle action (see Case ii) after (6.82)) due to the local freeness of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action makes the treatment less direct and leads to the consideration of $\\alpha_{k}$. Lastly, to deal with $C_{B}^{s}$-norms for $y$ in $d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)$, simply notice the expression (7.23), (7.24) with $x$ replaced by $y$, which can be simplified further by the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance of $d v_{M}$ (Lemma 7.6 ii)) . Our proof is now completed.\n\nRemark 6.11. The difference between the $S_{j}$ of (6.36) and the corresponding term in the same notation $S_{j}$ in $[18,(5.46)$ and p.84] arises from that between $H_{m, t}^{j}(x, y)$ of (6.5) and $H_{j}(t, x, y)$ of $[18,(5.38)]$. This difference is partly due to the fact in Lemma 7.13 that holds only at the Hilbert space level, while some similar identifications in the proof of [18, Proposition 5.1, p.73] hold at the pointwise level. That these identifications, adapted to their own contexts, are only similar in nature leads to the different results. Compare Remark 3.20 for different effects caused by the metrics here and [18]. Note that the $S_{j}(t, x, w)$ of [18, p.84] is actually a (first-order) differential operator, so the presentation in [18, p.84], especially the derivation of $[18,(5.47)]$, need be fixed in a similar way as the part from $S_{j}$ of (6.36) to $\\bar{S}_{j}$ of (6.38).\n\nIf one tries to directly show that $P_{m, t}^{0}$ is an approximate heat kernel one may encounter a difficulty which we refer to [18, the paragraph after (1.81), p.36] for a similar situation and explanation. Suffice it to say that it becomes easier to show that its adjoint $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ is an approximate heat kernel. To express $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ in terms of $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ we need the following lemma that $H_{m, t}^{j}$ (hence $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ ) is a bounded linear operator on $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$, defined through the kernel function $H_{m, t}^{j}(x, y)$ (see (6.5)).\n\nLemma 6.12. The kernel function $H_{m, t}^{j}(x, y)$ as in (6.5) defines a bounded linear operator on $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. In fact $H_{m, t}^{j}(x, y)$ is $L^{2}$ in two variables $(x, y)$ $\\in \\Sigma \\times \\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m} \\times G_{a, m}$. The kernel function $H_{m, t}^{j *}(x, y)$ defined by $H_{m, t}^{j *}(x, y):=\\overline{H_{m, t}^{j}(y, x)}$ represents the Hilbert space adjoint operator $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ (A superscript \" $t$ \" meant as transpose may be placed on $\\overline{H_{m, t}^{j}(y, x)}$, but we omit it.)\n\nProof. A \"local version\" of this (with cut-off functions in (6.5) removed) is seen in Remark 6.2. Now in (6.5) observe that $\\eta^{-m} l(y)^{m}=h(\\zeta, \\bar{\\zeta})^{m} \\bar{\\eta}^{m}$. From this and Remark 3.4 the assertion on the $L^{2}$-condition follows. This yields the first and third assertions (see [57, Theorem 2, p.13 ]).\n\nUsing Lemma 6.12 we have now\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{m, t}^{0 *}=\\sum_{j}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)^{*}=\\sum_{j} \\pi_{m}^{*} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{j} \\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}: L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is worth noting that while the action of $P_{m, t}^{0}$ may not preserve the space $\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ (cf. Lemma 6.3), the image of $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ on $\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ is nonetheless seated in $\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ because of $\\pi_{m}$. By taking the adjoints $P_{m, t}^{0 *}, R_{t}^{*}$ of $P_{m, t}^{0}, R_{t}$ respectively, we are going to prove the following. Denote by $\\Omega_{c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\subset$ $\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ the set of those elements (smooth sections of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ ) of compact support in $\\Sigma$. Note that $\\Omega_{c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$ is dense in $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ (see Remark 5.6).\n\nTheorem 6.13. In the preceding notation, we have\ni)\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0^{+}} P_{m, t}^{0 *} u=\\pi_{m} u \\text { in }\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}} \\quad \\text { for } u \\in \\Omega_{c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)\n$$\n\nii)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial P_{m, t}^{0 *}}{\\partial t} u+\\widehat{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm} P_{m, t}^{0 *} u=R_{t}^{*} u \\text { for } u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right) \\cap \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\\\\n& \\text { (not necessarily in } \\Omega_{c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)) \\text {. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\niii) The distribution kernel $R^{*}(t, x, y)$ of $R_{t}^{*}$ is given by $\\overline{R(t, y, x)}$ (cf. (6.33)); it satisfies a similar estimate as $R_{t}$ in Lemma 6.10.\n\nAlthough $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0^{+}} P_{m, t}^{0} u=\\pi_{m} u$ in $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$ for $u \\in \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ holds by Lemma 6.3, it is a bit surprising that the corresponding statement for $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ is not obviously true as it might appear to be at first sight, unless $u$ is further restricted. This difference is essentially due to the noncompactness of $\\Sigma$. Compared to the compact CR case [18, Theorem 5.13, p.84] the following proof is less trivial in that certain elements \" $\\alpha_{l} \\in S^{1}$ \" related to the local orbifold group will be introduced (and also used in some later parts of the paper).\n\nFor the proof of Theorem 6.13 we start by proving the following lemma. Writing $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma):=\\oplus_{q} \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, q}(\\Sigma)$ (see Definition 3.10) we want the boundedness of $\\pi_{m}$ : $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ with respect to $C_{B}^{*}$-norm. In the CR case [18] these $C_{B}^{*}$-norms were neither needed nor were they pursued because the compactness of the total space there simplifies the picture. The technicalities here lie in the local freeness of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action.\nLemma 6.14. With the notation above, $\\left\\|\\pi_{m}(u)\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{*}} \\leq C_{1}\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$ for every $u \\in$ $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma), s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$.\nProof. Write $u(x)=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) u(x)=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} v_{j}(x)$ where $(z, w)$ are local coordinates (with $j$-dependence suppressed), $v_{j}$ is a $(0, q)$-form and $\\varphi_{j}$ is as in item i) after Notation 6.1. Substituting it into (6.12), we obtain (omitting \" $\\circ$ \" in $\\xi \\circ x$ )\n\n$$\n\\pi_{m}(u)(x)=l(x)^{m} \\sum_{j} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*}\\left(\\varphi_{j}(\\xi x) w(\\xi x)^{m} v_{j}(\\xi x)\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} \\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}(\\xi)\n$$\n\nWe first want to extract $w(x)^{m}$ out of $w(\\xi x)^{m}$ in (6.48). Given a local chart $W_{j}:=$ $V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$as in Notation 6.1 and suppose $x \\in W_{j}$, there exist at most\n\nfinitely many $\\alpha_{l}$ 's $\\in S^{1}\\left(\\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ dependent on $x$ such that $\\alpha_{l} x \\in W_{j}$ with $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{l} x\\right)=$ 0 (recall $w=r e^{i \\phi}$ ) because if $\\alpha_{l}$ is such an element then any $\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime} \\in S^{1}$ near $\\alpha_{l}$ will give $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime} x\\right) \\neq 0$ by small angle action (see Case $i$ ) after (6.82)). Let $\\alpha_{0}=e^{-i \\phi(x)}$ so that $w\\left(\\alpha_{0} x\\right)=\\alpha_{0} w(x)(=r(x))$. Denote $J_{l}:=\\left\\{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}:-\\varepsilon_{j}<\\arg \\left(\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1}\\right)<\\right.$ $\\left.\\varepsilon_{j}\\right\\}$. It follows that for $\\xi \\in J_{l},-\\varepsilon_{j}<\\phi(\\xi x)=\\arg \\left(\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1}\\right)+\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{l} x\\right)=\\arg \\left(\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1}\\right)<\\varepsilon_{j}$ hence that $w(\\xi x)=\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1} w\\left(\\alpha_{l} x\\right)$ since $\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1}$ is of small angle (Case $i$ ) after (6.82)). Using $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{l} x\\right)=\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{0} x\\right)=0$ together with Lemma $7.6 i$ ) gives $w\\left(\\alpha_{l} x\\right)=w\\left(\\alpha_{0} x\\right)=$ $\\alpha_{0} w(x)$. In sum, for $\\xi \\in J_{l}$ we have\n\n$$\nw(\\xi x)=\\xi \\alpha_{l}^{-1} \\alpha_{0} w(x)\n$$\n\nextracting $w(x)$ from $w(\\xi x)$, as mentioned earlier. Remark that $\\alpha_{l}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}$ is independent of $x$ and $\\left\\{\\alpha_{l}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}\\right\\}_{l}$ forms a group (see Proposition 8.7), but we need not use this fact here.\n\nWrite $z_{l}=z(\\xi x)$ for $\\xi \\in J_{l}$. Note that $z_{l}$ is independent of $\\xi$ in $J_{l}$ (similarly implied by the small angle condition as above). For any fixed $j$ in (6.48), by the cut-off $\\varphi_{j}$ we can now reduce the integral in (6.48) to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{l} \\int_{\\xi \\in J_{l}} \\xi^{m} \\alpha_{l}^{-m} \\alpha_{0}^{m} w(x)^{m} \\varphi_{j}\\left(z_{l}, \\phi(\\xi x)\\right) \\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} v_{j}\\left(z_{l}, w(\\xi x)\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} \\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{l} \\alpha_{l}^{-m} \\alpha_{0}^{m} w(x)^{m} \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{l}\\right)_{x}^{*} \\int_{\\xi \\in J_{l}} \\varphi_{j}\\left(z_{l}, \\phi(\\xi x)\\right) v_{j}\\left(z_{l}, w(\\xi x)\\right)|\\xi|^{2 m} \\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nObserve that\n\n$$\nl(x)^{m} \\int_{\\xi \\in J_{l}}|\\xi|^{2 m} \\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}(\\xi) \\stackrel{(7.20)}{=} \\int_{\\xi \\in J_{l}} l(\\xi x)^{m} \\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}(\\xi) \\stackrel{(3.37)}{=} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{\\pi}\n$$\n\nThe fact that $\\alpha_{l}$ smoothly depends on $x$ is proved in remarks after (7.49). This leads, via $u=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j} w^{m} v_{j}$ and the definition of $C_{B}^{*}$-norm, to (noting that $\\left|\\alpha_{l}\\right|=1$, $w=|w| e^{i \\phi}$ and $\\varphi_{j}$ is bounded)\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\pi_{m}(u)\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{*}} \\leq C_{0} \\sum_{l} \\sum_{j} \\sum_{k=0}^{s} \\sup _{w}\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\phi) v_{j}(\\cdot, w)\\right\\|_{C^{k}\\left(V_{j}\\right)}=C_{0} \\cdot(\\# \\text { of } l)\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}\n$$\n\nUsing the above lemma we continue with the proof of Theorem 6.13.\nProof. (of Theorem 6.13) Let us first prove that $P_{m, t}^{0 *} u=\\pi_{m}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j *} u\\right)$ converges in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$-norm as $t \\rightarrow 0$. The kernel function of $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ reads as (see (6.5) with $x=(z, w), w=|w| e^{i \\phi}, y=(\\zeta, \\eta), \\eta=|\\eta| e^{i \\vartheta}$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_{m, t}^{j *}(x, y) & =\\overline{w^{-m}(x) \\tau_{j}(z(x)) \\sigma_{j}(\\phi(x)) l(x)^{m}} K_{t}^{j *}(z(x), \\zeta) \\overline{\\varphi_{j}(y) \\eta^{m}(y)} \\\\\n& =w^{m} \\tau_{j}(z) \\sigma_{j}(\\phi) h^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) K_{t}^{j *}(z, \\zeta) \\varphi_{j}(y) \\overline{\\eta^{m}(y)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor given $t$ it is easy to verify that $H_{m, t}^{j *} u \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l m}^{0 *}(\\Sigma)$. The convergence of $H_{m, t}^{j *} u$ in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$-norm as $t \\rightarrow 0$ follows simply because $K_{t}^{j *}=K_{t}^{j}$ involved in the above expression of $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ has the property that $K_{t}^{j}(u) \\rightarrow u$ in $C^{*}$-norm (with respect to $z)$ uniformly in \"parameter\" $\\eta$ since $u$ is assumed to be of compact support (see the bottom paragraph for the variable change to absorb the singular part $\\frac{1}{C^{*}}$ (of $\\left.K_{t}^{j}\\right)$ in $\\left[6\\right.$, p.85]). This together with Lemma 6.14 yields $P_{m, t}^{0 *} u \\rightarrow$ (say) $P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u \\in$\n\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}$-norm as $t \\rightarrow 0$. To prove that $P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u=\\pi_{m}(u)$ consider for $v \\in \\Omega_{c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(P_{m, t}^{0 *} u-\\pi_{m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}} & =\\left(P_{m, t}^{0 *} u-P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u+P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u-\\pi_{m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}} \\\\\n& =\\left(P_{m, t}^{0 *} u-P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}}+\\left(P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u-\\pi_{m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}} \\\\\n& \\rightarrow 0+\\left(P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u-\\pi_{m} u, v\\right)_{L^{2}} \\text { as } t \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\left(P_{m, t}^{0 *}-\\pi_{m}\\right) u, v\\right)_{L^{2}} & =\\left(u,\\left(P_{m, t}^{0}-\\pi_{m}^{*} v\\right)_{L^{2}}\\right. \\\\\n& =\\left(u,\\left(P_{m, t}^{0}-\\pi_{m}\\right) v\\right)_{L^{2}} \\rightarrow 0 \\text { as } t \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby Lemma 6.3. It follows from (6.54) and (6.55) that the limit $P_{m, 0}^{0 *} u=\\pi_{m} u$. We have shown (6.46).\n\nTo show (6.47) we take the adjoint of (6.32) in Lemma 6.10 to get\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} P_{m, t}^{0 *}+\\left[P_{m, t}^{0}\\left(\\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)\\right]^{*}=R_{t}^{*} \\text { on } \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(\\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm}\\right.$ is formally self-adjoint on $\\left.\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\supset P_{m, t}^{0 *}\\left(\\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}(\\Sigma)\\right)\\right)$; see Lemma 4.9)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\left[P_{m, t}^{0}\\left(\\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)\\right]^{*} } & =\\pi_{m}^{*} \\circ\\left(\\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm}\\right)^{*} \\circ P_{m, t}^{0 *} \\\\\n& =\\pi_{m} \\circ \\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\circ P_{m, t}^{0 *}=\\tilde{\\bigcirc}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\circ P_{m, t}^{0 *}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ngiving (6.47). The last claim of the theorem for $R^{*}(t, x, y)$ follows from a similar estimate for $R(t, x, y)$ of (6.33), so that $R^{*}(t, x, y)$ is in $L^{2}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)$ and represents the kernel function of the adjoint operator $R_{t}^{*}$ (compare Lemma 6.12).\n\nBefore solving our heat equation let us show that $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ is a bounded linear operator on $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ in the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}$-norm uniformly for $t$ near 0 . Recall the notation $\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ in Definition 3.10. For $u \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ recall the definition of $\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}$ in (6.7).\n\nProposition 6.15. Given $\\delta>0$ and $s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$, there exists a constant $C_{s}$ independent of $\\delta$ and $t$ (but may depend on $s$ ) such that (see (6.7) for $\\left.\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|P_{m, t}^{0 *}(u)\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{c}} \\leq C_{s}\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}\n$$\n\nfor $0 \\leq t \\leq \\delta$ and $u \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma) \\subset L^{2, *}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$.\nProof. By (6.6) $P_{m, t}^{0 *}=\\sum_{j} \\pi_{m}^{*} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}=\\sum_{j} \\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}$. We claim that $H_{m, t}^{j *}$ satisfies the following estimate: there exist $\\delta_{0}>0$ and $C_{s}^{\\prime}>0$ (independent of $\\delta_{0}$ and $t$ ) such that for $0<t<\\delta_{0}$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|H_{m, t}^{j *} u\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{c}} \\leq C_{s}^{\\prime}\\|u\\|_{C_{B}^{c}}\n$$\n\nfor $u \\in \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l o c}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$. Writing $x=(z, w)(w=|w| e^{i \\phi}), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)$ in local coordinates and $u(y)=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(y) u(y)=\\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(y) \\eta^{m} v_{j}(y)$, we have by (6.53)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(H_{m, t}^{j *} u\\right)(x)=\\int_{\\Sigma} H_{m, t}^{j *}(x, y) u(y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y) \\\\\n= & w^{m} h^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) \\sum_{j} \\tau_{j}(z) \\sigma_{j}(\\phi) \\int_{\\Sigma} K_{t}^{j *}(z, \\zeta) \\varphi_{j}(y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m} \\eta^{m} v_{j}(y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nObserve that for each $t>0 \\operatorname{Im} H_{m, t}^{j *}\\left|_{\\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, t \\omega}^{0, *}}(\\Sigma)\\right| \\subset \\tilde{\\Omega}_{m, l \\omega}^{0, *}(\\Sigma)$ (Definition 3.10). To estimate (uniformly in $t$ ) the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm of the RHS of (6.58) is reduced to estimating the usual $C^{*}$-norm in $z$ and the supremum norm in $w$ of\n\n$$\nh^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) \\tau_{j}(z) \\sigma_{j}(\\phi) \\int_{\\Sigma}|\\eta|^{2 m} K_{t}^{j *}(z, \\zeta) \\varphi_{j}(y) v_{j}(y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\n$$\n\nThe following inequality follows from [6, Theorem 2.20 or 2.29] (cf. comments below (6.53) in the proof of Theorem 6.13): there exists $\\delta_{0}>0$ and $C_{s}^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ (independent of $\\delta_{0}$ and $t$ ) such that for $0<t<\\delta_{0}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|\\int K_{t}^{j *}(z, \\zeta) \\overline{\\varphi_{j}(\\zeta, \\eta) v_{j}(\\zeta, \\eta)} d v(\\zeta)\\right\\|_{C^{*}(z)} \\\\\n\\leq & C_{s}^{\\prime \\prime} \\mid \\overline{\\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\eta) v_{j}(\\cdot, \\eta)}\\left\\|_{C^{*}(\\zeta)} \\leq C_{s}^{\\prime \\prime} \\sup _{\\eta}\\right\\| \\varphi_{j}(\\cdot, \\eta) v_{j}(\\cdot, \\eta) \\|_{C^{*}(\\zeta)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nObserve that $|\\eta|^{2 m}$ in the integrand of (6.59) is independent of $z$ and its integral with respect to the fibre measure $d v_{f, m}(y)$ is bounded. This together with (6.60) gives\n\n$$\n\\sup _{w}\\| \\text { the term (6.59) }\\|_{C^{*}(z)} \\leq(\\text { constant }) \\cdot\\|u\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}}\n$$\n\nNow (6.57) follows. This together with Lemma 6.14 implies (6.56).\n\nOne way to solve our heat equation, based on Theorem 6.13 and Proposition 6.15, resorts to the method of successive approximation (cf. [6], [18]). The convolution of two operators $A, B$ is defined through its distribution kernel as usual:\n\n$$\n(A \\sharp B)_{t}(x, y):=\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Sigma} A(t-s, x, p) B(s, p, y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(p) d s\n$$\n\nThe method of successive approximation results in a solution to our heat equation; see Proposition 6.17 below. But since $\\Sigma$ is noncompact, to have convergence requires a special class of operators. Fortunately the operators $P_{m}^{0 *}$ and $R^{*}$ belong to this class $\\left(P_{m}^{0 *}, R^{*}\\right.$ denote the operators with distribution kernels $P_{m, t}^{0 *}(x, y), R_{t}^{*}(x, y)$ respectively). The point is basically that although $\\Sigma$ is noncompact, we have only one direction which is noncompact, and the integration along this noncompact direction can be controlled by the choice of our metric $G_{a, m}$ (see Remark 3.4). Another ingredient to be used here is (6.49) in the proof of Lemma 6.14 above; see the proof of Lemma 6.16 below. These features give more complexities than the previous work [18, Proposition 5.14].\n\nLemma 6.16. The kernel functions associated to $R_{t}^{*}, \\cdots,\\left(R^{* k}\\right)_{t}\\left(=\\left(R^{*} \\sharp R^{*} \\cdots\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t}, k$ copies) and $P_{m, t}^{0 *},\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t},\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*} \\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t}, \\cdots$ are of the form (6.8). Moreover, given $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there are $1>\\delta_{0}, \\delta_{1}>0$ and $C_{s}>0$ (independent of $\\delta_{0}, \\delta_{1}$ and $t$ ) such that for all $t \\in\\left(0, \\delta_{0}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|R_{t}^{*}\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{1}}{\\tau}}, \\cdots,\\left\\|\\left(R^{* k}\\right)_{t}\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}} \\leq \\frac{1}{2^{k}} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{1}}{\\tau}} \\\\\n\\left\\|P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*}\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}} \\leq \\frac{C_{s}}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{1}}{\\tau}}, \\cdots,\\left\\|P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{* k}\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}} \\leq \\frac{C_{s}}{2^{k}} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{1}}{\\tau}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHere $\\left\\|R_{t}^{*}\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}}$ means $\\left\\|R_{t}^{*}(x, y)\\right\\|_{C_{\\tilde{\\Omega}}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)}$ (as given in (6.9)), etc.\n\nProof. By (6.12) we easily obtain\n\n$$\n\\left(\\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}\\right)(x, y)=l(x)^{m} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}(\\xi x, y) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi)\n$$\n\nand by (6.53) we have $\\left(w=|w| e^{i \\phi}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (6.65) \\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}(\\xi x, y) \\\\\n& \\quad=\\sigma(\\xi)_{x}^{*} \\circ w^{m}(\\xi x) h^{m}(z(\\xi x), \\bar{z}(\\xi x)) \\tau_{j}(z(\\xi x)) \\sigma_{j}(\\phi(\\xi x)) K_{t}^{j *}(z(\\xi x), \\zeta) \\varphi_{j}(y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNext we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& w^{m}(\\xi x) h^{m}(z(\\xi x), \\bar{z}(\\xi x)) \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(6.49)}{=} h^{m}(z(\\xi x), \\bar{z}(\\xi x))\\left(\\xi \\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}\\right)^{m} w^{m}(x) \\text { for } \\xi \\in J_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (6.66) into (6.65) we see that $\\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}(x, y)$ is of the form (6.8) (containing factors $w^{m}(x)$ and $\\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)$ ) after the parameter $\\xi$ is integrated out in (6.64). Hence $P_{m, t}^{0 *}(x, y)=\\sum_{j}\\left(\\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}\\right)(x, y)$ is of the form (6.8). Alternatively we can take the adjoint of $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)=\\sum_{j} w^{m} p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}$ (see (7.49) for the explicit form of $p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y))$ to obtain $P_{m, t}^{0 *}(x, y)=\\sum_{j} w(x)^{m} p_{m, t}^{0, j *}(x, y) \\overline{\\eta(y)}^{m}$ where we have, via (7.49) using $K_{t}^{j *}=K_{t}^{j},\\left(\\alpha_{k} \\alpha_{0}^{-1}\\right)=\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}$ and $z_{k}=z\\left(\\alpha_{k} x\\right)$\n\n$$\np_{m, t}^{0, j *}(x, y)=h^{m}(z(x), \\bar{z}(x)) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Lambda}\\left(\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}\\right)^{m} \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\right)_{x}^{*}\\left\\{\\tau_{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right) K_{t}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, \\zeta(y)\\right)\\right\\} \\varphi_{j}(y)\n$$\n\nFor $R_{t}^{*}=\\pi_{m} \\circ \\hat{R}_{t}^{*}$ we can also get its kernel function through a direct computation using the formulas for $\\pi_{m}(6.12)$ and $\\hat{R}_{t}(6.41)$ in a way parallel to (6.64) and (6.67) (with $\\xi$ integrated out using (3.27) and (6.2)). Putting $R_{t}^{*}(x, y)=$ $\\sum_{j} w^{m} r_{t}^{j *}(x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}$ we have\n\n$$\nr_{t}^{j *}(x, y)=h^{m}(z(x), \\bar{z}(x)) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Lambda}\\left(\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}\\right)^{m} \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\right)_{x}^{*}\\left(\\left[\\square_{z_{k}, m}^{c \\pm}, \\tau_{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\right] K_{t}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, \\zeta(y)\\right)\\right) \\varphi_{j}(y)\n$$\n\nBy $\\left\\|R(t, x, y)\\right\\|_{\\left(C_{R}^{*}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)\\right.} \\leq C_{s} e^{-\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{t}}$ for $t>0$ (6.33) and Theorem 6.13 iii) we conclude\n\n$$\n\\left\\|R_{t}^{*}\\right\\|_{C_{R}^{*}} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\tau_{1}}{t}}\n$$\n\nin (6.62).\nNext we compute the convolution\n\n$$\n\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t}(x, y)=\\sum_{j, j^{\\prime}}\\left(P_{m}^{0, j *} \\sharp R^{j^{\\prime} *}\\right)_{t}(x, y)=\\sum_{j, j^{\\prime}} w^{m}(x)\\left(p_{m}^{0, j *} \\sharp r^{j^{\\prime} *}\\right)_{t}(x, y) \\bar{\\eta}^{\\prime m}(y)\n$$\n\nwhere, with $y=\\left(\\zeta^{\\prime}, \\eta^{\\prime}\\right), q=\\left(\\beta^{\\prime}, \\gamma^{\\prime}\\right)$ in the $j^{\\prime}$-chart and $q=(\\beta, \\gamma)$ in the $j$-chart\n\n$$\n\\left(p_{m}^{0, j *} \\sharp r^{j^{\\prime} *}\\right)_{t}(x, y):=\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Sigma} p_{m, t-s}^{0, j *}(x, q) \\bar{\\gamma}(q)^{m} \\gamma^{\\prime}(q)^{m} r_{s}^{j^{\\prime} *}(q, y) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(q) d s\n$$\n\nThe integrand $p_{m, t-s}^{0, j *}(x, q) \\bar{\\gamma}(q)^{m} \\gamma^{\\prime}(q)^{m} r_{s}^{j^{\\prime} *}(q, y)$ in (6.71) has the following explicit expression: (denoting by $\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime}$ the corresponding $\\alpha_{k}$ in the $j^{\\prime}$-chart where $\\beta_{l}^{\\prime}:=$\n\n$\\beta^{\\prime}\\left(\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime} q\\right)\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { (6.72) } h^{m}(z(x), \\bar{z}(x)) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Lambda}\\left(\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}\\right)^{m} \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\right)_{x}^{*}\\left\\{\\tau_{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right) K_{l-s}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, \\beta(q)\\right)\\right\\} \\varphi_{j}(q) \\bar{\\gamma}(q)^{m} \\\\\n& \\cdot \\gamma^{\\prime}(q)^{m} h^{\\prime m}\\left(\\beta^{\\prime}(q), \\bar{\\beta}^{\\prime}(q)\\right) \\sum_{l=0}^{\\Lambda^{\\prime}}\\left(\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime-1} \\alpha_{0}^{\\prime}\\right)^{m} \\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime}\\right)_{q}^{*}\\left(\\left\\|\\square_{\\beta_{l}^{\\prime}, m}^{c \\pm}, \\tau_{j^{\\prime}}\\left(\\beta_{l}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\| K_{s}^{j^{\\prime}}\\left(\\beta_{l}^{\\prime}, \\zeta^{\\prime}(y)\\right)\\right\\} \\varphi_{j^{\\prime}}(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo bound $\\left\\|P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*}\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}$ by $e^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha}}$ note first that for the singular term $\\frac{1}{(t-s)^{n-1}}$ along the diagonal of $K_{l-s}^{j}$ in (6.72) we can get rid of it using the change of variable on $t-s$ as in the proof of Theorem 6.13 above. This and $\\left\\|r_{s}^{j^{\\prime *}}\\right\\|_{C^{t}} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} e^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\alpha}}$ (6.69) (note that $e^{-c / s} \\leq e^{-c / t}$ for $0<s \\leq t$ ) give that $K_{l-s}^{j}$ hence $p_{m, t-s}^{0, j *}$ and $r_{s}^{j^{\\prime} *}$ in (6.71) are jointly controlled by the factor $e^{-c / t}$ after integrating out \" $q$ \", i.e. the $z$-part $\\beta(q)$ of $q$. Using this one sees that, as $\\gamma^{\\prime}$ and $\\gamma$ differ by a bounded holomorphic transition function and $|\\gamma(q)|^{2 m}$ is integrable by Remark 3.4, the convolution (6.72) in (6.71) is integrable since $\\left|\\alpha_{k}\\right|=\\left|\\alpha_{l}^{\\prime}\\right|=1$ and $h^{m}, h^{\\prime m}$ are bounded. Altogether the first inequality in (6.63) for the $C_{B}^{0}$-norm follows. For the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm, $s>0$, we note that the derivatives of (6.72) in $z(x)$ and $\\zeta(y)$ do not change the above basic structure. So we also have (6.63) for the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm. From the structure of $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ and $R_{t}^{*}$ we see without difficulty that the similar conclusions hold with all the other convolutions mentioned in the lemma.\n\nWe can now adapt [18, Proposition 5.14] here and reach the following result of similar nature, with the difference that we are adopting $C_{B}^{*}$-norms here.\n\nProposition 6.17. i) (Existence) Given $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists $\\varepsilon>0$ such that for every fixed $t \\in(0, \\varepsilon)$ the kernel function $\\Lambda_{t}(x, y)$ given by\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{t}(x, y):=P_{m, t}^{0 *}(x, y)-\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t}(x, y)+\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{*} \\sharp R^{*}\\right)_{t}(x, y)-\\cdots\n$$\n\nexists, and converges in $C_{B}^{*}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)$ (including its $t$-derivatives up to any given order). ii) Let $\\left(R^{* k}\\right)_{t}$ be as in Lemma 6.16, $k \\geq 0$. Suppose $u \\in L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. Then $\\left(P_{m}^{0 *} \\sharp R^{* k}\\right)_{t} u \\in L_{m}^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$. In particular the image of $\\Lambda_{t}$ lies in the $m$-space. Moreover for $u \\in \\Omega_{c}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\Lambda_{t}}{\\partial t} u+\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm} \\Lambda_{t} u & =0 \\\\\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\Lambda_{t} u & =\\pi_{m} u \\text { in }\\|\\cdot\\|_{C_{B}^{*}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\niii) (Approximation) Given $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists $\\varepsilon_{0}>0$ independent of $t$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\Lambda_{t}(\\cdot, \\cdot)-P_{m, t}^{0 *}(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{*}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)} \\leq e^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{t}} \\text { for all } t \\in\\left(0, \\varepsilon_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. It follows from (6.63) that the sequence (6.73) converges in the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm and (6.75) holds. By the definition of the $C_{B}^{*}$-norm associated with a fixed $m$ (6.9), the function $\\Lambda_{t}(x, y)$ of (6.73) exists on $\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma$.\n\nFor $i i$ ) we observe that the image of the convolution lies in the image of its first operator. In our case the first operator is $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ so the image is in the $m$-space. To verify (6.74) takes slightly more work. Let $q_{t}^{k}$ denote the $(k+1)$-th term in (6.73).\n\nA direct computation shows that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial q_{t}^{k}}{\\partial t}(x, y)+\\widetilde{C}_{m, x}^{v \\pm} q_{t}^{k}(x, y)=\\left(R^{* k}\\right)_{t}(x, y)+\\left(R^{*(k+1)}\\right)_{t}(x, y)\n$$\n\n(cf. $[6,(2)$ of Lemma 2.22]). Noting that $\\Lambda_{t}$ is the alternating sum of these $q_{t}^{k}$, one interchanges the order of the action of $\\partial_{t}+\\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}$ on $\\Lambda_{t}$ with the summation in view of (6.63) and similar estimates on their $t$-derivatives. The first equation of (6.74) follows from telescoping with (6.76) (cf. [6, Theorem 2.23]). The second equality of (6.74) follows from (6.46) (cf. (6.56)) and (6.62).\n\nWe are now back to discuss the properties of $P_{m, t}^{0, \\pm}$. Recall that $e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, y)$ is the heat kernel that we obtain in Proposition 5.8. Similarly let $\\Lambda_{t}^{ \\pm}$denote $\\Lambda_{t}$ acting on the even/odd elements. Suppose $B_{t}^{ \\pm}, t>0$, is any bounded linear operator on $L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right)$ such that $i$ ) for $\\psi \\in \\Omega^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) \\cap L^{2, \\pm}\\left(\\Sigma, \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, G_{a, m}\\right), B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi \\in$ $\\Omega_{m}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma) ;$ ii) $B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi$ satisfies the heat equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\partial_{t}+\\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}\\right) B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi & =0 \\quad \\text { (differentiability in } t \\text { is assumed) } \\\\\nB_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi & \\rightarrow \\pi_{m} \\psi \\text { in } L^{2} \\text { as } t \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\niii) $B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi \\rightarrow B_{t_{0}}^{ \\pm} \\psi$ in $L^{2}$ as $t \\rightarrow t_{0}$ for any fixed $t_{0}>0$. The uniqueness part is the following.\n\nTheorem 6.18. i) (Uniqueness) It holds that\n\n$$\nB_{t}^{ \\pm}=e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}, \\text { in particular }\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{t}^{ \\pm}(x, y)=e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, y)\n$$\n\nand as a consequence $\\Lambda_{t}^{ \\pm}$are self-adjoint (Proposition 5.8).\nii) (Approximation) For every $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exist $\\varepsilon_{0}>0$ and $\\varepsilon>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(\\cdot, \\cdot)-P_{m, t}^{0, \\pm}(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\right\\|_{C_{B}^{s}(\\Sigma \\times \\Sigma)} \\leq e^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{t}} \\text { for all } t \\in(0, \\varepsilon)\n$$\n\nAs a consequence $e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, y)$ and $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)$ are the same in the sense of asymptotic expansion (as defined in [18, Definition 5.5] with $C^{l}$-norms replaced by $C_{B}^{l}$-norms). Along the diagonal it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left|e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}(x, x)-P_{m, t}^{0, \\pm}(x, x)\\right|=O\\left(l(x)^{m} e^{-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{t}}\\right)\n$$\n\n( $l(x)$ being unbounded on $\\Sigma$ ).\nProof. The idea of the proof can now follow that in [6]. We compute for $\\psi, \\varphi \\in$ $\\Omega_{v}^{0, \\pm}(\\Sigma), \\partial_{\\tau}<B_{t-\\tau}^{ \\pm} \\psi, e^{-\\tau \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} \\varphi>=0(0<\\tau<t)$ by using heat equations (6.77) and (5.9). By the initial condition in (6.77) and (5.9), and the images of $e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}}$ and $B_{t}^{ \\pm}$belonging to the $m$-space (Proposition 5.8 and the property $i$ ) of $B_{t}^{ \\pm}$), we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =\\int_{0}^{t} \\partial_{\\tau}<B_{t-\\tau}^{ \\pm} \\psi, e^{-\\tau \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} \\varphi>d \\tau=< \\pi_{m}^{ \\pm} \\psi, e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} \\varphi>-<B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi, \\pi_{m} \\varphi> \\\\\n& =<\\psi, e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} \\varphi>-<B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi, \\varphi>=<e^{-t \\widetilde{C}_{m}^{v \\pm}} \\psi, \\varphi>-<B_{t}^{ \\pm} \\psi, \\varphi>\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere the property iii) of $B_{t}^{ \\pm}$has been used for the second equality above. So (6.78) hence (6.79) follows. From (6.75), (6.79) and $e^{-t \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{0} \\dot{\\alpha}}$ being self-adjoint (cf. Proposition 5.8), (6.80) follows.\n\nAs for the factor $l(x)^{m}$ in (6.81) we first observe that $P_{m, t}^{0 *}=\\sum_{j} \\pi_{m} \\circ H_{m, t}^{j *}$ contains the factor $l(x)^{m}$ in view of (6.64). Therefore $P_{m, t}^{0 *}(x, x)$, hence $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$, contains the factor $l(x)^{m}$ so do $\\Lambda_{t}^{ \\pm}(x, x)$ and $e^{-t \\hat{\\omega}_{m}^{0} \\dot{\\alpha}}(x, x)$ in view of (6.73) (the convolution led by $P_{m, t}^{0 *}$ always has the factor $l(x)^{m}$ ) and (6.79). This together with (6.80) gives (6.81).\n\nIn the remaining of this section, we shall treat $P_{m, t}^{0}$ more closely as will be needed in the next section via (6.79) above. The main result is Theorem 6.19 below. Writing $\\xi^{-1} y$ for $\\xi^{-1} \\circ y$, we have ${ }^{7}$ (see (6.5) with $x=(z, w), y=(\\zeta, \\eta)$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nH_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} y\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} \\circ y}^{*}=\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} K_{t}^{j}\\left(z, \\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\eta^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right) \\\\\n\\tau_{j}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) l\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)^{m} \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} y}^{*}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nDue to $\\xi^{-1} y$ in the arguments above, we note the following two cases (cf. (2.6), $(2.7))$ :\n\nCase $i$ ) : If $\\xi$ is close to 1 such that $\\xi^{-1} y$ is still in the same chart as $y$ (where $\\zeta(y)=\\zeta$ ), then $\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)=\\zeta, \\eta^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)=\\bar{\\xi}^{-m} \\eta^{m}$ and $\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)=\\vartheta(y)-\\gamma$ where we write $\\xi=|\\xi| e^{\\imath \\gamma}$\n\nCase $i i$ ) : For $\\xi$ general, $\\xi^{-1} y$ and $y$ do not necessarily lie in the same chart. Even if $\\xi^{-1} y$ and $y$ lie in the same chart, unlike case $i$ ) the $\\zeta$-values of $\\xi^{-1} y$ and $y$ may not be the same. Indeed $\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right) \\neq \\zeta(y)$ for $y$ near the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-strata $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ of $\\Sigma$. See (7.14) for the detail. This fact will be rather crucial for us in the subsequent sections.\n\nRemark that if the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma$ on $\\Sigma$ is globally free then only Case $i$ ) will occur (and in this case it is valid to take all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ rather than $\\xi \\sim 1$ ).\n\nSubstituting (6.82) into the RHS of (6.26) gives, recalling $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)=\\sum_{j}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ\\right.$ $\\left.\\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)=\\varphi_{j}(x) \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left\\{w^{m} K_{t}^{j}\\left(z, \\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\eta^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\tau_{j}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) l\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)^{m} \\bar{\\xi}^{m}\\right\\} \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} y}^{*} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is well known that the (ordinary, local) heat kernel $K_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta)$ has the asymptotic expansion (see for instance $[18,(5.19)$ on p.76])\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{t}^{j}(z, \\zeta) & =e^{-\\frac{d \\bar{\\xi}_{j}(z, \\zeta)}{4 t}} K^{j}(t, z, \\zeta) \\\\\nK^{j}(t, z, \\zeta) & \\sim t^{-n+1} b_{n-1}(z, \\zeta)+t^{-n+2} b_{n-2}(z, \\zeta)+\\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $t \\rightarrow 0^{+}$for $z, \\zeta$ in $V_{j}$, where $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ denotes the distance function associated with the metric $\\pi^{\\star} g_{M} \\mid V_{j}$ (cf.

Note that $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ may depend on the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ The $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit $\\left\\{\\xi^{-1} y\\right\\}_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}$ of $y$ could be delicate (Cases $i$ ), ii) below (6.82)); nevertheless the local expressions in (6.82) involving $\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)$ (which is meaningless if $\\xi^{-1} y$ lies outside the chart of $\\zeta$ ) makes good sense due to cutoff functions there. The same is true in many places throughout this paper without explicit mention.\n\nchoice of charts $V_{j}$ a priori. Recalling that $V_{j}$ is endowed with the metric induced by $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$, we can assume $V_{j}$ (as a Riemannian manifold) to be convex for every $j$ (possibly after shrinking). Then it is seen that $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ here can be independent of the choice of charts. Note that $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ is not necessarily the same as the distance function $d_{M}$ on the complex orbifold $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ since two distinct points in $V_{j}$ may project to the same point in $M$. Compare remarks after (7.9).\n\nVia (6.84) we then get an asymptotic expansion of (6.83) for $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, y)$ hence for $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)$ without difficulty (the fact that $l\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)^{m} \\dot{\\xi}^{m}=l(y)^{m} \\xi^{-m}$ by (7.20) has been used here).\n\nTheorem 6.19. (Asymptotic expansion) With the notation above, we have that $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)$ is of the form (6.8) and, via (6.80)\n(6.85) $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, y), e^{-t \\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}}(x, y) \\sim t^{-(n-1)} a_{n-1}(t, x, y)+t^{-(n-2)} a_{n-2}(t, x, y)+\\cdots$\n(for the meaning of the above \" $\\sim$ \" we refer to [18, Definition 5.5, p.75] with $C^{l}$ norms replaced by $C_{B}^{l}$-norms) where for $s=n-1, n-2, \\cdots$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{s}(t, x, y)=l(y)^{m} \\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m} & \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left\\{e^{-\\frac{\\tilde{d}_{M}^{2}(x, \\xi)}{2 t}} b_{s}(z, \\zeta)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\eta^{-m} \\tau_{j}(\\zeta) \\sigma_{j}(\\vartheta) \\xi^{-m}\\right\\} d \\mu_{y, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere to simplify notations, we use $\\zeta, \\eta^{-m}$ and $\\vartheta$ to denote $\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right), \\eta^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)$ and $\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)$ respectively.\n\nRemark 6.20. Even for $x=y, a_{s}(t, x, x)$ still depends on $t$. See [18, Remark 1.6] for details. Further $a_{s}(t, x, y)$ are not uniquely determined; indeed they depend on the various data in, e.g. (6.5), (6.1) and (6.2). In contrast $b_{s}(z, \\zeta)$ in (6.86) is intrinsic (cf. remarks after (7.9)). Note that $P_{m, t}^{0}$ may not preserve the $m$-space. However if we consider $\\tilde{P}_{m, t}^{0}(x, y):=\\left(\\pi_{m} \\circ P_{m, t}^{0}\\right)(x, y)$ it is not difficult to see that the associated $\\tilde{a}_{s}(t, x, y)$ (resp. $\\left.\\tilde{P}_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)\\right)$ descends to $\\underline{\\tilde{a}}_{s}(t, \\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ (resp. $\\left.\\tilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{m, t}^{0}(\\pi(x), \\pi(y))\\right)$ on the compact complex orbifold $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (as one can show $\\left.\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha, \\beta}^{*} \\tilde{a}_{s}(t, \\cdot, \\cdot)\\right)(x, y)=\\right.$ $\\left.\\alpha^{m}(\\bar{\\beta})^{m} \\tilde{a}_{s}(t, x, y)\\right.$ where $\\left.\\sigma_{\\alpha, \\beta}(x, y):=(\\alpha x, \\beta y)\\right.$ and similar formulas for $\\tilde{P}_{m, t}^{0}(x, y)$ ). It can be shown that both $\\underline{\\tilde{a}}_{s}(t, \\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{m, t}^{0}(\\pi(x), \\pi(y))$ are associated with $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{c \\pm}$, as the extension of $\\square_{V_{j}, m}^{c \\pm}$ to $M$ in (5.6) (acting on sections of the $m$-th power of orbifold line bundle $L_{\\Sigma}^{+} / \\sigma$, cf.

We are not going to elaborate on the question whether it would still be possible to obtain the existence of a local index density of Theorem 1.1 if the metric $G_{a, m}$ used here did not possess this unity-property.\n\nSubstituting (7.6) and (7.7) into (7.4), we obtain\n(7.8) Part I of $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x)=\\varphi_{j}(x) l^{m}(x) K_{t}^{j}(z, z)\\left(\\tau_{j}(z)=1\\right.$ on $\\left.\\operatorname{supp} \\varphi_{j}\\right)$.\n\nRecall the asymptotic expansion of the (ordinary, local) heat kernel $K_{t}^{j}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)$ (see (6.84) or $[18,(5.19)$ on p.76]):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{t}^{j}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right) & =e^{-\\frac{d_{M}^{2}\\left|z, z^{\\prime}\\right|}{4 t}} K^{j}\\left(t, z, z^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\nK^{j}\\left(t, z, z^{\\prime}\\right) & \\sim t^{-n+1} b_{n-1}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)+t^{-n+2} b_{n-2}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)+\\ldots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $t \\rightarrow 0^{+}$for $z, z^{\\prime}$ in $V_{j}$, where $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ denotes the distance function associated with the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\|_{V_{j}}$ (cf.

The reader is warned that $\\tilde{d}_{M}$ is in general not the distance function on $M$ (unless the globally free case).\n\nFurther, the coefficients $b_{s}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)(s=n-1, n-2, \\cdots)$ in (7.9) depend only on $(x, y)$ (with $z(x)=z, z(y)=z^{\\prime}$ ) and are independent of the choice of charts $D_{j} \\ni x, y$. For, it is well known ([6, Chapter 2]) that the coefficients depend only on the local geometry; since the local geometry we use consists of $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ and the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant metric on $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$ (see (6.3), (5.6) and Step 1 of Section 3), these can be regarded as local geometry data on the orbifold $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (with $\\pi: \\Sigma \\rightarrow M$ ) thus intrinsic in nature.\n\nFor every compact set $K \\subset V_{j}$, there is a constant $C_{K}>1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_{K}}\\left|z-z^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq \\tilde{d}_{M}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq C_{K}\\left|z-z^{\\prime}\\right|\n$$\n\nSet $b_{s}(z):=b_{s}(z, z), s \\leq n-1$. Note that $b_{s}(z)$ (dependent on $z=z(x))$ are independent of $j$ as just mentioned.

First recall that $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p_{j}}, p=p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots<p_{k}$, denote all possible periods of the locally free action $\\left.\\sigma\\right|_{S^{1}}$. Define $\\Sigma_{p_{j}}:=\\left\\{x \\in \\Sigma\\right.$ : the period of $x$ is $\\left.\\frac{2 \\pi}{p_{j}}\\right\\}$ and recall $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}:=\\cup_{j=2}^{k} \\Sigma_{p_{j}}$ (cf. (1.7)). Let $d(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ denote the distance function on $\\Sigma$ with respect to the metric $G_{a, m}$.\n\nRecall that we have the case $i i$ ) stated after (6.82). We are going to be more precise about it in (7.14) below. Let us start with\n\nDefinition 7.1. (cf. Remark 7.2 for geometrical aspects) $S:=\\left\\{l e^{-i \\tilde{\\gamma}}: 0<\\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{2} \\leq\\right.$ $\\left.\\tilde{\\gamma} \\leq \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{2}, l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right\\}$\n\n$$\n\\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right):=\\inf \\{d(s \\circ x, x): s \\in S\\} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nWe claim the existence of a constant $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0}>0$ satisfying the following. Let $x \\in$ $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and $x=(z, w) \\in \\hat{W}_{j}($ see $(7.2))$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Suppose } e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ x & =(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{w}) \\in \\hat{W}_{j} \\text { for some } \\gamma \\in\\left[\\varepsilon_{j}, \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j}\\right] \\\\\n\\text { Then }|\\tilde{z}-z| & \\geq \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} \\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe Case $i i$ ) after (6.82) has mentioned that the above $z, \\tilde{z}$ could be different. Here (7.14) confirms a positive lower bound for $|\\tilde{z}-z|$ (see $[18,(6.5)]$ for a statement similar to (7.14)).\n\nProof. (of (7.14)) First it can be verified that there is an $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0}>0$ independent of $w$ such that $|\\tilde{z}-z| \\geq \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} d((\\tilde{z}, w),(z, w))$. For this verification, we content ourselves with referring to (3.21) and (3.14) where $G_{a, m}$ is seen to be uniformly bounded along the $w$-direction. For instance, choosing the curve $((1-t) z+t \\tilde{z}, w)$ with estimation of its length implies this inequality. With $\\hat{w}$ in (7.14) writing $\\xi_{1}=w / \\hat{w}=\\left|\\xi_{1}\\right| e^{i \\phi}$ with $-\\varepsilon_{j} / 2<\\phi<\\varepsilon_{j} / 2$ (by the $\\hat{W}_{j}$-condition), we note that $\\xi_{1} \\circ(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{w})=\\left(\\hat{z}, \\xi_{1} \\hat{w}\\right)$ $=(\\tilde{z}, w) \\in W_{j} \\supset \\hat{W}_{j}$ (see cases $i$ ) and $i i$ ) after (6.82)). Then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (7.15)|\\tilde{z}-z| \\geq \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} d((\\hat{z}, w),(z, w))=\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} d\\left(\\xi_{1} \\circ(\\hat{z}, \\tilde{w}),(z, w)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} d\\left(\\left(\\xi_{1} e^{-i \\gamma}\\right) \\circ x, x\\right) \\geq \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0} \\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)(\\text { using }(7.13),(7.14))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo see $\\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)>0$, since $S$ in Definition 7.1 is clearly disjoint from the isotropy group at $x$, i.e. $x \\notin S \\circ x$ and further, the orbit $S \\circ x$ is closed (cf. (2.6), (2.7)), by the definition of $\\hat{d}$ in (7.13) the desired strict positivity follows.\n\nRemark 7.2. One expects that the function $\\hat{d}\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ is comparable to the genuine distance function $d\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$. See [18, Theorem 6.7] in the CR context.\n\nTo proceed further, we need the following fact:\nLemma 7.3. It holds that (see (3.3) for $l(x)$ )\n\n$$\nl\\left(e^{i \\gamma} \\circ x\\right)=l(x) \\text { provided that } e^{i \\gamma} \\circ x\\left(e^{i \\gamma} \\in S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right) \\text { and } x \\text { lie in }\n$$\n\nthe same chart $W_{j}$ with coordinates $(z, w)$ (cf. Notation 6.1).\nProof. Let $D_{0}=W_{j}, D_{1}, \\ldots, D_{L}, D_{L+1}$ be a sequence of patches with coordinates $\\left(z_{k}, w_{k}\\right)$ on each $D_{k}$, and $x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{L}, x_{L+1}$ be a sequence of points. Assume the\n\nfollowing: $D_{L+1} \\equiv D_{0},\\left(z_{0}, w_{0}\\right) \\equiv\\left(z_{L+1}, w_{L+1}\\right) \\equiv(z, w)$ and $x_{0}:=x \\in D_{0}, x_{k} \\in$ $D_{k} \\cap D_{k-1}, 1 \\leq k \\leq L, x_{L+1} \\in D_{0} \\cap D_{L}$ such that\n\n$$\nx_{k+1}=e^{i \\gamma_{k}} \\circ x_{k}, 0 \\leq k \\leq L\n$$\n\nWe further assume: for every $0 \\leq k \\leq L$, if $\\theta \\in\\left[0, \\gamma_{k}\\right]$ then $e^{i \\theta} \\circ x_{k} \\in D_{k}$. This gives\n\n$$\nw_{k}\\left(e^{i \\theta} \\circ x_{k}\\right)=e^{i \\theta} w_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nby (2.7). Since $l(q)=h(z(q), \\bar{z}(q)) w(q) \\bar{w}(q)$ in (3.3), (3.4) is independent of the choice of coordinates, from (7.17) and the fact that $h$ is invariant under rotation (by $\\gamma_{k}$ ) by using (7.18) and (3.4), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nl\\left(x_{k+1}\\right) & =h\\left(z_{k}\\left(x_{k+1}\\right), \\bar{z}_{k}\\left(x_{k+1}\\right)\\right) w_{k}\\left(x_{k+1}\\right) \\bar{w}_{k}\\left(x_{k+1}\\right) \\\\\n& =h\\left(z_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right), \\bar{z}_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right)\\right) w_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right) \\bar{w}_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right) \\\\\n& =l\\left(x_{k}\\right), 0 \\leq k \\leq L\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nClearly (7.16) follows from (7.19).\n\nRemark 7.4. The above proof actually shows that (7.16) holds unconditionally. As an important application, one sees that the metric $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$ (in Section 3) is $S^{1}$-invariant via (3.8), (3.9), (3.7) and Lemma 7.6 iv).\n\nCorollary 7.5. It holds that for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ and for all $x \\in \\Sigma$,\n\n$$\nl^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ x\\right)=|\\xi|^{-2 m} l^{m}(x)\n$$\n\nProof. By Lemma 7.3 and writing $\\xi=|\\xi| e^{i \\gamma}$, we see that (via Remark 7.4)\n\n$$\nl\\left(\\xi^{-1} \\circ x\\right)=l\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} \\circ\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ x\\right)\\right)=|\\xi|^{-2} l\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ x\\right)=|\\xi|^{-2} l(x)\n$$\n\nand hence the lemma.\n\nIn the remaining part of this section, we will omit \" $\\circ$ \" in the notation of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ action.\n\nLet us now continue with Part II of (7.3). Recall $H_{m, t}^{j}$ in (6.5) (with the footnote as in (6.82)):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}=\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m}(x) K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x} \\\\\n& \\quad w^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right) l^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\tau_{j}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo integrate (7.21) over $I=\\left[\\varepsilon_{j}, \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j}\\right]$ for Part II, we shall now divide $I=J \\cup J^{\\prime}$ where $J$ is the subset of those $\\gamma \\in\\left[\\varepsilon_{j}, \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j}\\right]$ such that $e^{-i \\gamma} x \\in \\tilde{W}_{j}$ (Notation 6.1) and $J^{\\prime}$ is the complement of $J$ in $\\left[\\varepsilon_{j}, \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j}\\right]$. If we denote by $(\\tilde{z}, \\tilde{w})$ the coordinates of $e^{-i \\gamma} x$ with $\\gamma \\in J$, then $\\tilde{z} \\neq z$ by (7.14) (noting that $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$ is the period of $x$ ). We suppress the dependence of $J$ on $x$ since $x$ is fixed throughout.\n\nFrom (6.26) of Proposition 6.9 and the notation there, it follows that with $\\xi=$ $|\\xi| e^{i \\gamma}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Part II of }\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x) \\\\\n& :=\\int_{\\varepsilon_{j}}^{\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\pi}-\\varepsilon_{j}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{+}}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\int_{J}+\\int_{J^{\\prime}}\\right) \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{+}}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\int_{J} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{+}}\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the integral over $J^{\\prime}$ vanishes since in $H_{m, t}^{j}$ (6.5) the term $\\tau_{j}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)$ $=0$ for $e^{-i \\gamma} x \\notin \\dot{W}_{j}$ where $\\gamma \\in J^{\\prime}$ (see (6.5) and items ii), iii) after Notation 6.1).\n\nNext for the integral over $J$ in the RHS of (7.22) we need some preparations, which go from (7.23) until Corollary 7.7.\n\nRecall from (6.25) and remarks below it that $d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)$ equals $\\left(\\tau_{x}: \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\rightarrow \\Sigma\\right.$ defined by $\\tau_{x}(\\lambda)=\\lambda \\circ x$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)=\\frac{l^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right) d v_{\\Sigma, m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\wedge d v_{f, m}(x)}{d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x)} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(7.20)(3.22)}{=} \\frac{1}{2} l^{m}(x)\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\frac{d v_{M}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)}{d v_{M}(z(x))}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote also (cf. (3.23) and $i$ ) of Lemma 7.6):\n\n$$\n\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right)=d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1}|w|\\right) \\wedge d v(-\\gamma) / 2 \\pi, \\xi=|\\xi| e^{i \\gamma}\n$$\n\nand the invariantly defined integral:\n\n$$\n\\int_{|\\xi| \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}} l^{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} x\\right) d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} x\\right)=1\n$$\n\n(cf. (3.26) where we chose $h\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right)=1$ and the notation $d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} x\\right)$ is for $\\left.d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1}|w|\\right)\\right)$. By our choice of the holomorphic coordinate $w$, we have (see (2.7) for $\\left.\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right):$\n\n$$\n|w|^{-m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)|\\xi|^{-m}=\\frac{1}{|w|^{m}\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} x\\right)}, e^{-i \\gamma}=\\xi^{-1}|\\xi| \\in S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\n$$\n\nFor one more preparation, a technical lemma is in order. Items iii), iv) below have been used in $(6.24),(6.43)$ respectively.\n\nLemma 7.6. It holds that\ni) $\\frac{|w(x)|}{|w\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} x\\right)|}=1$ for $e^{-i \\gamma} \\in S^{1}$ such that $e^{-i \\gamma} x \\in W_{j}$ of Notation 6.1.\nii) $\\frac{d v_{M}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)}{d v_{M}(z(x))}=1$ for $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ such that $\\xi^{-1} x \\in W_{j}$.\niii) In the product space $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\Sigma$, under the transformation $\\tilde{\\sigma}:(\\xi, x) \\rightarrow\\left(\\xi^{-1}, y\\right.$ $=\\xi \\circ x)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left(\\tau_{x}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x)=\\left\\{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{*}\\left[\\left(\\tau_{y}^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\\right]\\right\\}(\\xi, x)\n$$\n\niv) For $h$ of (3.4) and notations there, $h\\left(z^{\\prime}, \\overline{z^{\\prime}}\\right)=h(z, \\bar{z})$ if $\\left\\{p, e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ p\\right\\} \\subset D_{j}$ and $z^{\\prime}=z\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} \\circ p\\right)$. Moreover the global 2-form $\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log h$ on $\\Sigma\\left(=\\partial_{z} \\bar{\\partial}_{z} \\log h\\right.$, see (3.7)) is $S^{1}$-invariant.\n\nProof. For $i$ ), if $\\gamma$ is small this is automatic.(cf. Case $i$ ) after (6.82)). In general, by (7.20) and for $\\xi^{-1} x \\in W_{j}$ with $|\\arg \\xi|$ small\n\n$$\nl\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)=h\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right), \\bar{z}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)|w|^{2}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\n$$\n\n(cf. (3.4)) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{|w|(x)}{|w|\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} x\\right)}=\\frac{h^{1 / 2}\\left(z\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} x\\right), \\bar{z}\\left(e^{-i \\gamma} x\\right)\\right)}{h^{1 / 2}(z(x), \\bar{z}(x))}\n$$\n\nResorting to the fact that $h$ is invariant under local rotations as remarked in the proof of Lemma 7.3, in a similar way we use the local rotations step by step as in (7.19). This, together with (7.29), leads to the first equality.\n\nFor the second equality, since $d v_{M}=$ the volume form on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\subset \\Sigma$ induced by $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ (cf. (3.22)) which is trivially $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant (see the beginning of step 2 in Section 3), the conclusion follows.\n\nFor iii), first observe that (recalling $\\sigma: \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ defined by $\\sigma(\\lambda, p):=\\lambda \\circ p$ )\n\n$$\nL H S \\text { of }(7.27)=\\left(\\sigma^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi, x) \\wedge d v_{\\Sigma, m}(x)\n$$\n\n$$\nR H S \\text { of }(7.27)=\\left\\{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{*}\\left[\\left(\\sigma^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}, y\\right) \\wedge d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\\right]\\right\\}(\\xi, x)\n$$\n\nIt then follows from (3.22) that\n\n$$\nR H S \\text { of }(7.30)=\\left(\\sigma^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi, x) \\wedge \\pi^{*} d v_{M}(x) \\wedge d v_{f, m}(x)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR H S \\text { of (7.31) } & =\\left\\{\\tilde{\\sigma}^{*}\\left[\\left(\\sigma^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)\\left(\\xi^{-1}, y\\right)\\right] \\wedge \\tilde{\\sigma}^{*}\\left(d v_{\\Sigma, m}(y)\\right)\\right\\}(\\xi, x) \\\\\n& =d v_{f, m}(x) \\wedge\\left(\\sigma^{*} \\pi^{*} d v_{M}\\right)(\\xi, x) \\wedge\\left(\\sigma^{*} d v_{f, m}\\right)(\\xi, x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nComparing (7.32) with (7.33) and noting that $\\left(\\sigma^{*} \\pi^{*} d v_{M}\\right)(\\xi, x)=\\pi^{*} d v_{M}(x)$ since $\\pi^{*} d v_{M}$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant (alternatively, computing it using $(z, w)$ coordinates is recommended), we conclude that $R H S$ of (7.32) equals $R H S$ of (7.33). Hence (7.27) follows from (7.30) and (7.31).\n\nFor $i v$ ) the first assertion follows from $i$ ) of this lemma, (3.4) and (7.16). It is clear that $e^{\\pm i c}$ preserves the global form $\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\log h$ for $|\\varepsilon|<<1$ so does $e^{i c q}$ for any $q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, giving the second assertion.\n\nCorollary 7.7. It holds that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)=1\n$$\n\nProof. (7.34) follows from (7.23), ii) of Lemma 7.6, (7.24) and (7.25).\n\nWe can now estimate Part II of $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x)$ as follows.\nProposition 7.8. For any $N_{0} \\geq n+1$ there exists $\\delta=\\delta\\left(N_{0}\\right)>0$ and $C_{N_{0}}>0$ such that for $0<t<\\delta$ it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\text { Part II of }\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x)\\right| \\leq C_{N_{0}} l^{m}(x) t^{-(n-1)} e^{-\\frac{\\xi_{0}^{\\prime} d\\left(x, \\Sigma_{s i n g}\\right)^{2}}{t}}\n$$\n\nfor $x \\in\\left(\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right) \\cap \\dot{W}_{j}$, where $C_{N_{0}}$ and $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{0}^{\\prime}$ are independent of $x$.\n\nProof. In view of (7.22) we need to estimate a certain integral of $\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\right.$ $\\left.\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)$. First we deal with $H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right)$. Let both $x$ and $\\xi^{-1} x$ be in $\\left(\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right) \\cap \\hat{W}_{j}$ as required by the reduction of (7.35) to the $J$-part integral in (7.22). By Lemma $7.6 i$ ) and (7.20) we obtain the modulus of the RHS of $H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right)$ (6.5) for terms except $K_{t}^{j}$ and cutoff functions: (noting that $(\\zeta, \\eta)=(z, w)$ as $\\xi^{-1} x$ lies in $\\hat{W}_{j}$ by assumption)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|w^{m}(x)\\right|\\left|w\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)^{-m}\\right| l\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)^{m} \\\\\n= & \\left|w^{m}(x)\\right||\\xi|^{m}\\left|w(x)^{-m}\\right||\\xi|^{-2 m} l(x)^{m}=l(x)^{m}|\\xi|^{-m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (6.5) and (7.36) we can then estimate the integrand (7.21) of (7.22): noting that $\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}$ leaves $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ invariant (with respect to the basis $\\tilde{\\eta}^{I_{\\eta}}$ in Footnote ${ }^{6} \\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}$ is the identity matrix)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|\\left(H_{m, t}^{j}\\left(x, \\xi^{-1} x\\right) \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)\\right| \\\\\n\\leq & C_{1} l(x)^{m}\\left|K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)\\right| d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{1}$ is a constant independent of $x$ and $\\xi$. Now from the asymptotic expansion (7.9) of $K_{t}^{j}$ it follows that for $N_{0}>n=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} V_{j}+1$ (cf. [6, Theorem 2.23, p.81]) there exists $\\delta=\\delta\\left(N_{0}\\right)>0$ and $C_{N_{0}}^{\\prime}>0$ such that for $0<t<\\delta$ and $x, \\xi^{-1} x \\in$ $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }} \\cap \\hat{W}_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)\\right| \\leq C_{N_{0}}^{\\prime} e^{-\\frac{d_{M}^{2}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)}{4 t}} t^{-(n-1)}\n$$\n\nwhere we have written $z=z(x), z^{\\prime}=z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)$ and $C_{N_{0}}^{\\prime}$ is independent of $x$ and $\\xi$ (such that $\\xi^{-1} x \\in \\hat{W}_{j}$ ). By (7.10) and (7.14) we obtain\n\n$$\ne^{-\\frac{d_{M}^{2}\\left(z, z^{\\prime}\\right)}{4 t}} \\leq e^{-\\frac{\\rho_{0}^{2} d\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)^{2}}{t}}\n$$\n\nwith $\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{0}^{\\prime}=\\bar{\\varepsilon}_{0}^{2} / C_{K^{\\prime}}^{2}$. Using (7.22), (7.35) follows from (7.37), (7.38), (7.39) and (7.34) with $C_{N_{0}}=C_{1} C_{N_{0}}^{\\prime}$.\n\nHaving just worked out (7.3), we can now prove Theorem 1.3 stated in the Introduction. Before going on, we pause to give a proof of (6.27) as an interlude since we have now learned many properties about $d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)$. The following proof uses $\\alpha_{k}$ constructed in the proof of Lemma 6.14 in an essential way, but the reader may skip this proof and come back to it in due course.\n\nProof. (of (6.27) in Proposition 6.9) Substituting (7.23) (with $x$ replaced by $y$ ) into (6.26) and using (7.24), (6.82) one is able to obtain $p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y)$ in (6.27) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y) \\stackrel{(7.20)}{=} \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left\\{\\varphi_{j}(x) K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), \\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\frac{\\bar{\\eta}^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)}{\\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)} \\bar{\\xi}^{m} h^{m}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right), \\bar{\\zeta}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\tau_{j}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\vartheta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\left.l^{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} y\\right)\\right\\}\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} y} d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1}|\\eta(y)|\\right) \\wedge \\frac{d v(-\\gamma)}{2 \\pi} \\frac{d v_{M}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right)}{d v_{M}(\\zeta(y))}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor the above noting that one replaces $l^{m}(x)$ in (7.23) by\n\n$$\nl^{m}(y)=h^{m}\\left(\\zeta\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right), \\bar{\\zeta}\\left(\\xi^{-1} y\\right)\\right) \\eta^{m}(y) \\bar{\\eta}^{m}(y)\n$$\n\nusing Lemma $7.6 i v$ ).

Namely (7.46) and (7.47) are part of the coordinates of $\\xi^{-1} y$.\n\nWe are ready to substitute (7.46), $|\\xi|^{-m} \\tilde{\\xi}^{m}=e^{-i m \\gamma}$, (7.45) and (7.47) into (7.42), giving (via the cut-off functions reducing it to a summation over smaller regions of integration)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y) & =\\varphi_{j}(x) h^{m}(\\zeta(y), \\bar{\\zeta}(y)) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Lambda}\\left\\{K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), \\zeta_{k}\\right) \\tau_{j}\\left(\\zeta_{k}\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{k} \\alpha_{0}^{-1}\\right)^{m}\\right\\} \\\\\n{ }^{\\circ}\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{*}\\right)_{\\alpha_{k} y} & \\cdot \\int_{\\gamma=\\gamma_{k}+\\bar{\\epsilon}_{j}}^{\\gamma=\\gamma_{k}-\\bar{\\epsilon}_{j}} \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{k}-\\gamma\\right) \\frac{d v(-\\gamma)}{2 \\pi} \\int_{|\\xi| \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}} l^{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} y\\right) d v_{m}\\left(|\\xi|^{-1} y\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{*}\\right)_{\\alpha_{k} y}$ is from the fact that $\\left(\\sigma_{\\xi}^{*}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} y}$ is the map $\\xi^{-1} y \\rightarrow y$ that pulls back a section at $y$ to one at $\\xi^{-1} y$ so that the resulting section over $\\left\\{\\xi^{-1} y\\right\\}_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}}$ behaves as a \"constant section\" (in a piecewise sense due to the large angle action). By $\\bar{\\gamma}=\\gamma_{k}-\\gamma$, the angular integral above gives $\\int_{-\\bar{\\epsilon}_{j}}^{\\gamma_{j}} \\sigma_{j}(\\bar{\\gamma}) \\frac{d v(\\bar{\\gamma})}{2 \\pi}=1$ by (6.2), while by (7.25) the last integral in (7.48) equals $1^{9}$. Thus (7.48) is reduced to (7.49)\n\n$$\np_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y)=\\varphi_{j}(x) h^{m}(\\zeta(y), \\bar{\\zeta}(y)) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Lambda}\\left\\{K_{t}^{j}\\left(z(x), \\zeta_{k}\\right) \\tau_{j}\\left(\\zeta_{k}\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{k} \\alpha_{0}^{-1}\\right)^{m}\\right\\} \\circ\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{*}\\right)_{\\alpha_{k} y}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\zeta_{k}$ and $\\alpha_{k}$ in (7.49) depend on $y$ and that for the $x$-part $p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y)$ is independent of $|w|(x)$. Moreover, differentiating $\\vartheta(\\alpha y)$ in $\\alpha \\in S^{1}\\left(\\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ is not zero by the locally freeness. From this it follows that $\\alpha_{k}$ defined by $\\vartheta\\left(\\alpha_{k} y\\right)=0$ is smooth in $y$ by the implicit function theorem. Therefore $\\zeta_{k}=\\zeta\\left(\\alpha_{k} y\\right)$ is also smooth in $y$. Clearly $\\alpha_{k}$ does not depend on the variable $|\\eta|$ (the radial part of $y$ ), neither does $\\zeta_{k}$ since by (7.46) $\\zeta_{k}(\\lambda y)=\\zeta\\left(\\alpha_{k}(\\lambda y) \\lambda y\\right)=\\zeta\\left(\\alpha_{k}(y) \\lambda y\\right)=\\zeta\\left(\\alpha_{k}(y) y\\right)=\\zeta_{k}(y)$ for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$is the only noncompact direction, it follows from the above independence that $\\zeta_{k}$ and $\\alpha_{k}$ are $C_{B}^{*}$-bounded. We conclude that $p_{m, t}^{0, j}$ is smooth in $x, y$ in view that $\\zeta_{k}$ and $\\alpha_{k}$ are smooth in $y$, and $C_{B}^{*}$-bounded since $\\zeta_{k}$ and $\\alpha_{k}$ are $C_{B}^{*}$-bounded (cf. (6.9)).\n\nRemark 7.9. In the above proof suppose that the action $\\sigma$ is globally free everywhere on the local chart $D_{j}$. Then $\\Lambda=0, \\zeta_{0}=\\zeta\\left(\\alpha_{0} y\\right)=\\zeta(y)$ and we have $p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, y)=\\varphi_{j}(x) h^{m}(\\zeta(y), \\bar{\\zeta}(y)) K_{t}^{j}(z(x), \\zeta(y)) \\tau_{j}(\\zeta(y))$ which depends only on $z(x)$ and $\\zeta(y)$ (except the cutoff function $\\varphi_{j}(x)$ ).\n\nProof. (of Theorem 1.3) The assertion $i$ ) of the theorem follows from Proposition 6.17 and $i$ ) of Theorem 6.18. To prove the formula (1.8) for $i i$ ) of the theorem, we reduce the estimate to that of $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ by (6.81). Let us estimate $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ which is essentially (7.3). First suppose the simplest situation $p\\left(=p_{1}\\right)=1$. By (7.35) and (7.11), (7.12) (using the meaning of \" $\\sim$ \") for every $N_{0} \\geq N_{0}(n)$ ([6, p.81]) there exist constants $C_{N_{0}}, \\delta=\\delta\\left(N_{0}\\right)>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)-\\sum_{j=0}^{N_{0}} t^{-(n-1)+j} b_{n-1-j}(z(x)) t^{m}(x)\\right| \\\\\n\\leq & C_{N_{0}} l^{m}(x)\\left(t^{-(n-1)+N_{0}+1}+t^{-(n-1)} e^{-\\frac{\\delta_{0} \\delta\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {ring }}\\right)^{2}}{t}}\\right), 0<t<\\delta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ It might seem that the computation here involves confusing sign issues. Let us note that the top-forms involved are positive (see also (7.24) and the change of variable (if any) switches $\\xi$ to $\\xi^{-1}$ (compare (7.48)) which remains orientation preserving. The overall plus-sign is thus obtained.\n\nfor some constant $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_{0}>0$ (independent of $N_{0}$ and $x$ ). Here we may take $N_{0}(n)$ to be $\\left[\\operatorname{dim}_{R}(\\Sigma / \\sigma) / 2+1\\right]+1\\left(=\\frac{2(n-1)}{2}+2\\right)=n+1$. We have proved (1.8) for $p=1$. We remark that (7.50) has an analogue for CR manifolds with $S^{1}$-action (cf. [18, (6.2) in p.92]).\n\nNow suppose $p>1$. Then, the angular sectors in $[0,2 \\pi]$ over which the integrals correspond to the two types (7.4) and (7.22) denoted as $a$ ) and $b$ ), have the extra $p-1$ pairs of sectors and are given respectively by\n\n$$\na^{\\prime}\\left[\\left[(s-1) \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j},(s-1) \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}+\\varepsilon_{j}\\right] \\text { and } b^{\\prime}\\right]\\left[(s-1) \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}+\\varepsilon_{j}, s \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}-\\varepsilon_{j}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $s=1, \\ldots, p(s=p+1$ identified with $s=1)$. (The sectors in (7.51) are obtained by successively shifting the first pair of sectors $s=1$ by a common amount $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$; the union of these pairs gives $[0,2 \\pi]$.)\n\nTo evaluate the two types (7.51) of integrals, a linear change of variable for the angular part $\\gamma$ brings the intervals of the integration on these sectors (7.51) back to those in (7.4) and (7.22) with the extra multiplicative factor $\\sum_{s=1}^{p} e^{\\frac{2 \\pi(s-1)}{p} m i}$. This number equals $p$ if $p \\mid m$ and 0 if $p \\nmid m$, which amounts to $p \\delta_{p \\mid m}$. This concludes (1.8) proving the assertion $i i$ ). The assertion $i i i$ ) of the theorem follows from Theorem 6.19 .\n\nRemark 7.10. To generalize the $C^{0}$ estimate here to the $C^{l}\\left(C_{B}^{l}\\right.$ more precisely) estimate presents no serious problem. We skip the details, and content ourselves with referring to [18, Corollary 6.3] for a closely related treatment.\n\nOne sees that the RHS of (7.50) (for general $p$ ) blows up as $t \\rightarrow 0$ and $x \\rightarrow \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ at various speeds (due to $t^{-(n-1)}$ in the second term). Let $b_{s}^{ \\pm}(z, \\zeta)$ be coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(z, \\zeta)( \\pm$ means acting on even/odd degree of elements as usual) (cf. (7.9)):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{t}^{j, \\pm}(z, \\zeta) & =e^{-\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta}_{2 s}^{2}(z, \\zeta)}{4 t}} K^{j, \\pm}(t, z, \\zeta) \\\\\nK^{j, \\pm}(t, z, \\zeta) & \\sim t^{-n+1} b_{n-1}^{ \\pm}(z, \\zeta)+t^{-n+2} b_{n-2}^{ \\pm}(z, \\zeta)+\\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemark 7.11. Note that the notion of the above asymptotic expansion (7.52) (see $[18,(5.19)$ on p.76]) is different from the one in [6, p.87] in which the meaning of $\\sim$ is given in such a way that it includes the Gaussian term $e^{-\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta}_{2 s}^{2}(z, \\zeta)}{4 t}}$; our above meaning of $\\sim$, excluding the Gaussian term, is basically equivalent to the one in Chavel's book $[16,(45)$ on p.154].\n\nLet $\\psi_{j}^{-1}: D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma \\rightarrow W_{j}=V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$denote a local trivialization (cf. the line below (3.30)).\nNotation 7.12. i) Let $\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}:=\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\otimes E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ and $\\mathcal{E}^{m}:=\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}\\right)\\right|_{V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}$ $=\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\otimes E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right|_{V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}$ be a complex vector bundle over $V_{j}$, where $\\pi: \\Sigma \\rightarrow M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ denotes the natural projection, $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$ denotes the (orbifold) bundle of all $(0, q)$-forms on $M, E$ denotes a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over $\\Sigma$, equipped with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric $h_{E}$ (constructed similarly as for $L_{\\Sigma}$ in Step 1 of Section 3), and $L_{\\Sigma}$ is defined before (3.1). Let $e^{E}$ denote a locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant section of $E$ over $D_{j} \\subset \\Sigma$ (meaning that it is invariant under $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$and small-angle action). Similarly let $\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}$ denote the even/odd part\n\n$\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}^{ \\pm} \\otimes E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ of $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$. Although $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is only an orbifold bundle, the \"pullback $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ \" having local sections of the form $f_{I_{q}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\bar{z}^{I_{q}}$ can be identified as a vector bundle. Recall that the metrics for $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ and $L_{\\Sigma}$ are $\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\left(=G_{a, m} \\mid \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right.$, see Lemma $8.10 i))$ and $<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{L_{\\Sigma}}$ (see lines above (3.3)) respectively.\nii) Let $\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}$ denote $\\Psi_{q, m}$ in (3.32) for $q$ even/odd that identify bundle elements with $m$-space elements (with an extra bundle $\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*} E\\right|_{V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}} ; U_{j}, \\psi_{j}^{-1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ there taken to be $V_{j}, W_{j}$ in Notation 6.1).

For the $m$-space bundle $\\Lambda_{m, l o e}^{0, *}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ whose sections are just $\\Omega_{m, l o e}^{0, *}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$ (Definition 3.10) we define the metric $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}$ (hence $\\left.<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}\\right)$ at $\\left.q=\\psi_{j}((z, w)) \\in D_{j}\\right\\}$ by\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{q}} \\otimes e^{E}\\right) w^{m}\\right\\|_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}^{2}:=\\left\\|\\eta^{I_{q}}\\right\\|_{g_{M}}^{2}\\left\\|e^{E}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}^{2}\\left|w\\right|^{2 m}\n$$\n\nWe define the $L^{2}$-inner product $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ (resp. $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}$ ) on sections of $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$ (resp. $\\left.\\Lambda_{m, l o e}^{0, *}\\left(D_{j}\\right)\\right)$ by integrating the fibrewise inner product $<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.<\\cdot, \\cdot>_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}\\right)$ over $V_{j}$ (resp. $W_{j}$ ).\nLemma 7.13. With the notation above, it holds that $\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}$ preserves $L^{2}$-inner product up to a constant, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\left(\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}(s), \\Psi_{ \\pm, m}(t)\\right)_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}=\\frac{\\varepsilon_{j}}{\\pi}(s, t)_{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\n$$\n\nfor sections $s, t$ of $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$.\nProof. We observe that $h(z, \\bar{z})^{-m}$ in (7.55) and $|w|^{2 m}$ in (7.56) are related in the following fibre integration: (writing $d v_{f, m}=l(q)^{-m} d \\hat{v}_{m}(q)(3.24)$; omitting the pullback $\\tau_{p_{0}}^{*}$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}}|w|^{2 m} d v_{f, m}= & \\int_{\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}}|w|^{2 m} l(q)^{-m} d \\hat{v}_{m}(q) \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(3.4)}{=} h(z, \\bar{z})^{-m} \\int_{\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}} d \\hat{v}_{m}(q) \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(3.25)}{=} h(z, \\bar{z})^{-m} \\frac{2 \\varepsilon_{j}}{2 \\pi}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn view of (7.56), (7.55) and $\\left\\|e^{E}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}^{2}$ being invariant under the action of $\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$, (7.57) follows easily from (7.58) and the relation of the measures as given in (3.15).\n\nTo proceed further, let us set up some more notation. In (7.49) the expression given by $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}\\left(z(x), z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right)$ \"composed\" with $\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*}$ can be interpreted as (see the line above $(6.5)$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left(\\Psi_{ \\pm, m} \\circ K_{t}^{j, \\pm} \\circ \\Psi_{ \\pm, m}^{-1}\\right) \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*} \\\\\n=\\Psi_{ \\pm, m} \\circ\\left(K_{t}^{j, \\pm} \\circ \\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}\\right) \\circ \\Psi_{ \\pm, m}^{-1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere we have written (see Notation 7.12 for $\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}$ )\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}:=\\Psi_{ \\pm, m}^{-1} \\circ \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*} \\circ \\Psi_{ \\pm, m}:\\left.\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}\\right|_{(z(x), 0,1)} \\rightarrow\\left.\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}\\right|_{\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right), 0,1\\right)}\n$$\n\nin order to be consistent with the notation used in [6] and Section 8. In later use of (7.60) (cf. lines below (8.23)) we take $\\xi=\\alpha_{k} \\in S^{1}$ such that $\\alpha_{k}^{-1} x \\in V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ for $x \\in V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ (compare (6.49) and (7.43) for a similar notation). For $e^{E} \\in$ $\\psi_{j}^{*} E$ in Notation $7.12 i$ ), $\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*}$ hence $\\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}$ sends it to $\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E} \\in\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*} E\\right|_{\\xi^{-1} x}$ where $\\sigma^{E}$ is a lifted action on the bundle $\\psi_{j}^{*} E$. Note that $\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E}$ may not be $e_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{E}$ for $\\xi^{-1} x \\in D_{j}$, especially when $x \\in \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and $\\xi$ gives a large angle action as in Case $i i$ ) after (6.82), but $\\left\\|\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}=\\left\\|e_{x}^{E}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}$ remains true. Writing $z=z(x), \\zeta=z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)$ and using \" $\\dagger$ \" to denote the adjoint (to distinguish it from the pullback notation), for $|\\xi|=1$ we have, by $\\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}=\\left(\\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}\\right)^{\\dagger}$ (see Lemma 7.14 below)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{t}^{j, \\pm}\\left(z(x), z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\circ \\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}} & =\\left(\\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}} \\circ K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(z, \\zeta)^{\\dagger}\\right)^{\\dagger} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}} \\circ K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(\\zeta, z)\\right)^{\\dagger}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(z, \\zeta)^{\\dagger}=\\left(K_{t}^{j, \\pm}\\right)^{\\dagger}(\\zeta, z)=K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(\\zeta, z)$ and the associated kernel function is always acting to the left on an element in $z$ by our convention: $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(\\zeta, z)$ : $\\left.\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}\\right|_{(z, 0,1)} \\rightarrow\\left.\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}\\right|_{(\\zeta, 0,1)}$ satisfies $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(z, \\zeta)^{\\dagger}=K_{t}^{j, \\pm}(\\zeta, z)$. (7.61) will be used in (8.21) and more importantly, in (8.35).\n\nIt is important to remark that for $x \\in \\Sigma_{p}\\left(=\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$ so that $z(x)=z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)$ in the above $K_{t}^{j, \\pm}$ for every $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}, \\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}$ is just the identity endomorphism (at $z(x))$; however for $x \\in \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ and $\\xi \\in G_{x}:=\\left\\{\\xi \\in S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}: \\sigma(\\xi) x=x\\right\\}$ the (finite) isotropy group at $x, \\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}$ may not be the identity. This feature is crucial to our supertrace evaluation later on.\n\nLemma 7.14. With the notation above, it holds that for $x \\in D_{j},|\\xi|=1$ and $\\xi^{-1} x \\in D_{j}, \\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}$ is an isometry on the bundle part; see also Corollary 8.5). It holds that\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\xi^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}=\\left(\\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m \\pm}}\\right)^{\\dagger}\n$$\n\nProof. Since the action may involve the large angle one, let us be specific about the proof. Observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{q}} \\otimes e^{E}\\right) w^{m}\\right)_{x} \\\\\n= & \\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{q}}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x} \\otimes \\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x} \\xi^{m} w^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby the $\\sigma$-invariance of the sections $\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{q}}$. Note that $\\left(\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}$ may not be $e_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{E}$ unless $\\sigma(\\xi)$ is a small-angle action. However it remains true that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\sigma^{E}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) \\circ e_{x}^{E}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}=\\left\\|e_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{E}\\right\\|_{h_{E}}\n$$\n\nby the $\\sigma^{E}$-invariance of the metric $h_{E}$ and the choice of local invariant section $e^{E}$. Also by the $\\sigma$-invariance of the metrics $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ for $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ and (7.64), we conclude from (7.63) that\n(7.65) $\\left\\|\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{\\xi}} \\otimes e^{E}\\right) w^{m}\\right)_{x}\\right\\|_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}=\\left\\|\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\eta^{I_{\\xi}} \\otimes e^{E}\\right) w^{m}\\right)_{\\xi^{-1} x}\\right\\|_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}|\\xi|^{m}$.\n\nHence for $|\\xi|=1$ we learn that $\\sigma(\\xi)_{\\xi^{-1} x}^{*}$ is an isometry with respect to the metric $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\Lambda_{m}^{0, *}}$.

LOCAL $m$-INDEX FORMULA \n\nIn this long section we want to get an explicit expression of the local index density, to which the first three subsections are devoted. The remaining two subsections compare our index formula with the one - which we view as a pure orbifold result, of Duistermaat.\n\nBefore proceeding to Subsection 8.1 let us discuss a number of auxiliary results, which may be regarded as background material for the subsequent subsections. First, we have the following \"supertrace\" integral equality by the McKean-Singer formula (Theorem 5.12) together with (6.81) of Theorem 6.18 using the approximate heat kernel $P_{m, t}^{0, \\pm}$(noting that the integral of $l(x)^{m} d v_{\\Sigma, m}$ over $\\Sigma$ is finite as in Remark 3.4):\n\nTheorem 8.1. For $m \\geq 0, a>\\frac{m}{2}$ (on which the metric $G_{a, m}$ depends), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\mathcal{C}_{m}^{0, *}}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} e^{-t \\mathcal{C}_{m}^{0, *}}(x, x)\\right] d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\\\\n= & \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,+}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,-}(x, x)\\right] d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, we are reduced to computing the supertrace of $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$, which is done in the first two subsections (cf. (8.29) and (8.56) below). We prove Theorem 1.1 in the third subsection.\n\nOur actual computation starts with (8.20). But before doing it we need some preparatory work. From Section 2 we learn that the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma$ on $\\Sigma$ gives rise to a complex orbifold structure on $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (see Theorem 2.3). Write $W_{j}=V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$for a chart of $\\Sigma$ (see Notation 6.1) where $V_{j}$ is chosen to be a complex orbifold chart of $\\Sigma / \\sigma$ (see the proof of Theorem 2.3). Moreover the finite group associated to the orbifold chart $V_{j}$ is a cyclic subgroup of $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$, denoted by $G_{j} ; W_{j}$ is suitably shrinked so that $G_{j}$ is the largest isotropy group at some point $x \\in W_{j}$, containing isotropy groups at any $y \\in W_{j}$ as subgroups, cf. Corollary 8.6. Let $g_{0} \\in G_{j}$ be a generator of order $N_{j}+1$\n\n$$\ng_{0}^{N_{j}+1}=1 \\text { and } g_{k}:=g_{0}^{k}, \\quad k \\geq 1 \\quad\\left(\\text { note } g_{1}=g_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nEach $g_{k}$ depends on $j$ but for the simplicity of notation we omit \" $j$ \" in the expression of the symbol $g_{k}$.

With notations in the proof of Lemma 7.3 suppose $x, x^{\\prime} \\in W_{j}$ with $w(x)=w\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$. Assume that $e^{i \\beta} \\circ x$ and $e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime}$ lie in $W_{j}$ for some $e^{i \\beta} \\in S^{1}$. Then $w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x\\right)=w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime}\\right)$\nProof. First assume that $x^{\\prime}$ is close to $x$. As in the proof of Lemma 7.3, we take a sequence of points $x_{l} \\in D_{l} \\cap D_{l-1}$ (resp. $x_{l}^{\\prime} \\in D_{l} \\cap D_{l-1}$ ), $l=0,1, \\cdots, L$ such that $x_{0}=x, \\cdots, x_{L+1}=e^{i \\beta} \\circ x \\in D_{0} \\cap D_{L}$ (resp. $x_{0}^{\\prime}=x^{\\prime}, \\cdots, x_{L+1}^{\\prime}=e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime} \\in D_{0} \\cap D_{L}$ ). Let $\\left(z_{l}, w_{l}\\right)$ denote the coordinates of the patch $D_{l}$ with $D_{0}=D_{L+1}=W_{j}$. Note that $w_{0}=w_{L+1}=w$. By (2.3) in Proposition 2.1 we have\n\n$$\nw_{l}\\left(x_{l}\\right)=w_{l-1}\\left(x_{l}\\right) f_{l}\\left(z_{l}\\left(x_{l}\\right)\\right), l=1, \\cdots, L+1\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{l}$ is holomorphic in $z_{l}$. From (7.17) and (7.18) (replacing $\\gamma_{l}$ by $\\beta_{l}$ ) it follows that $w_{l}\\left(x_{l+1}\\right)=w_{l}\\left(e^{i \\beta_{l}} x_{l}\\right)=e^{i \\beta_{l}} w_{l}\\left(x_{l}\\right)$. Together with (8.5) and $\\beta:=\\sum_{l=0}^{L} \\beta_{l}$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nw\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x\\right) & =w_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}\\right) \\\\\n& =e^{i \\beta} w(x) f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly we have\n\n$$\nw\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime}\\right)=e^{i \\beta} w\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy Lemma $7.6 i$ ) we have $\\left|w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x\\right)\\right|=|w(x)|$ (resp. $\\left|w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=\\left|w\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|$ ) and hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}\\right)\\right)\\right| & =1 \\\\\n\\left(\\text { resp. }\\left|f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right| & =1\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nin view of (8.6) (resp. (8.7)). The actions $e^{i \\beta_{l}}$ are holomorphic and hence, in terms of $x$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(e^{i \\beta_{0}} \\circ x\\right)\\right) f_{2}\\left(z_{2}\\left(e^{i\\left(\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{0}\\right)} \\circ x\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nis holomorphic in $x$. This together with (8.8) implies that $f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}\\right)\\right)$ is independent of $x$ so that it is the same as $f_{1}\\left(z_{1}\\left(x_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\cdots f_{L+1}\\left(z_{L+1}\\left(x_{L+1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$ (here $x \\sim x^{\\prime}$ so $\\beta_{l}, \\beta_{l}^{\\prime}$ can be chosen to be the same). In view of (8.6) and (8.7) we conclude that $w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x\\right)=w\\left(e^{i \\beta} \\circ x^{\\prime}\\right)$. For the general case where $x$ and $x^{\\prime}$ are not necessarily close, one connects $x$ and $x^{\\prime}$ by a path $\\alpha(t) \\subset W_{j}$ with the same $w(\\alpha(t))$ values. The proof follows by the usual continuity argument.\n\nFor the fixed point set $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\left(\\subset V_{j}\\right)$ of $\\gamma_{k}$ or $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}(k \\geq 1)$ in (8.3) we write\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{j, k}:=\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right), \\quad k \\geq 1\n$$\n\nfor the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit of $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ in $\\Sigma$. The local trivialization $\\psi_{j}$ is often omitted.\nRemark 8.3. i) We can choose the above chart $W_{j}\\left(=V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\right)$such that $a) \\cup_{k} \\Sigma_{j, k}$ from (8.9) is connected and $b) \\gamma_{k}$ acts on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ itself for all $k$ as in (8.3). ii) Note that the slice $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\subset \\Sigma$ depends on the choice of local coordinates of $\\Sigma$.\n\nDefine $V_{j}^{g_{k}}:=\\left\\{z^{\\prime} \\in V_{j} \\mid \\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)\\left(z^{\\prime}, 0,1\\right)=\\left(z^{\\prime}, 0,1\\right)\\right\\}$ and $\\Sigma^{g_{k}} \\subset \\Sigma$, the fixed point set of $\\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)$, so $V_{j}^{g_{k}}=\\Sigma^{g_{k}} \\cap V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$. Let $V_{j}^{F}:=\\cup_{k=1}^{N_{j}} V_{j}^{g_{k}}$. Note that for $1 \\leq k \\leq N_{j}$\n\n$$\nV_{j}^{g_{k}} \\neq V_{j}\n$$\n\nOtherwise $\\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)$ will fix all points in $V_{j}$ and hence one sees that $W_{j} \\subset \\Sigma^{g_{k}}$. Since $W_{j}$ is open in $\\Sigma$, it follows by holomorphicity that $g_{k}=\\{1\\}$, a contradiction to $1 \\leq k \\leq N_{j}$.\n\nWe have from (8.3) and Lemma $7.6 i$ ) that\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{k}^{-1} x=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)}\\right) x & x \\in\\left(V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}\\right) \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\\\\nx & x \\in V_{j}^{g_{k}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta_{k}$ is a real valued, continuous function (at least locally defined at a given $x)$. Based on Lemma 8.2 we have\n\nProposition 8.4. With the chart $W_{j}$ chosen in Remark 8.3 and the notations above, we have $i$ ) $e^{i \\eta_{k}}$ is a constant, independent of the choice of $x \\in\\left(V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}\\right) \\times$ $\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} ;$ ii) $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}=\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right)$ acting on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ itself is an isometry with respect to the metric induced from $G_{a, m} ;$ iii) $e^{i \\eta_{k}}=g_{k}^{-1}$. In particular $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}$ equals $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)$ on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$; namely $\\pi_{V_{j}}$ in the definition (8.3) of $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}$ can be dropped.\n\nProof. We will simply write $e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x$ for $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)}\\right) x$. For $x, x^{\\prime} \\in\\left(V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}\\right) \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$, $w(x)=w\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)=1$ which by Lemma 8.2 gives that $w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x\\right)=w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x^{\\prime}\\right)$ (for $x^{\\prime}$ close to $x$ so that $e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x^{\\prime}$ falls in $W_{j}$ and is close to $e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x$ ). By the definition of $\\eta_{k}$ $w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x\\right)=1=w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)} x^{\\prime}\\right)$ and we get $w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)} x^{\\prime}\\right)=w\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)} x^{\\prime}\\right)$. By Lemma 8.2 again, applying $e^{-i \\eta_{k}(x)}$ to the arguments of $w$ we conclude $w\\left(e^{i\\left(\\eta_{k}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)-\\eta_{k}(x)\\right)} x^{\\prime}\\right)=$ $w\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)$ which is 1 . In view of the action by a small angle (by the continuity of $\\eta_{k}$ and $x^{\\prime} \\sim x$ ) it follows that for $x^{\\prime}$ near $x, e^{i\\left(\\eta_{k}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)-\\eta_{k}(x)\\right)} x^{\\prime}=x^{\\prime}$ so that $e^{i \\eta_{k}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)}=$ $e^{i \\eta_{k}(x)}$ since $x^{\\prime} \\notin V_{j}^{F}$. Therefore $e^{i \\eta_{k}}$ is constant in each connected component of $\\left(V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}\\right) \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ by continuity. Now $V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}$ is connected since $V_{j}^{g_{k}}$ is of real codimension $\\geq 2$ in $V_{j}$ by the holomorphicity of $g_{k}$. We have shown $i$ ).\n\nFrom $i$ ) and (8.11) we have now that $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}=\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right)$ on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ (including $\\left.V_{j}^{g_{k}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)$ by continuity from $V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}$ to its closure $V_{j}$. That $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}$ is an isometry follows from the fact that the $\\sigma\\left(S^{1}\\right)$-action is an isometry (see Remark 7.4). We have shown $i i$ ).\n\nTo show iii), we fix an $x_{0}=\\left(z^{\\prime}, 0,1\\right)$ with $z^{\\prime} \\in V_{j}^{g_{k}}$. Then $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right) x_{0}=\\gamma_{k}^{-1} x_{0}$ by $i i$ ) and $\\gamma_{k}^{-1} x_{0}=\\left(\\pi_{V_{j}} \\circ \\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)\\right) x_{0}=\\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right) x_{0}=x_{0}$ since $\\pi_{V_{j}}$ is trivially the identity on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ from its definition. It follows that we can put\n\n$$\ne^{i \\eta_{k}}=h_{x_{0}} g_{k}^{-1}\n$$\n\nfor some $h_{x_{0}} \\in G_{j} \\subset S^{1}$. Next, we apply the action\n\n$$\n\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right) \\stackrel{i i}{=} \\gamma_{k}^{-1} \\stackrel{(8.3)}{=} \\pi_{V_{j}} \\circ \\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nto any $x$ near $x_{0}$. We have $\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\eta_{k}}\\right)(x)=\\sigma\\left(e^{i \\epsilon_{k}} g_{k}^{-1}\\right)(x)$ for a small angle $\\epsilon_{k}$ (depending on $x$ a priori) obtained by $\\pi_{V_{j}}$; compare (2.12) and the lines below it. From\n\nthe global freeness of the $\\sigma\\left(S^{1}\\right)$-action at $x \\in\\left(V_{j} \\backslash V_{j}^{F}\\right) \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ it follows that $e^{i \\eta_{k}}=e^{i \\epsilon_{k}} g_{k}^{-1}$ for such $x$. Comparing this with (8.12) gives\n\n$$\nh_{x_{0}}=e^{i \\epsilon_{k}}\n$$\n\nThe contradiction is arising: The number of $h_{x_{0}}$ is at most $\\left|G_{j}\\right|$, while by choosing $x$ sufficiently near $x_{0}$ and applying the continuity argument at $x_{0}$ as just mentioned one can make the angle $\\epsilon_{k}(x)$ arbitrarily small. This would violate (8.13) unless $\\epsilon_{k}$ $=0$ thus $h_{x_{0}}=1$, giving $e^{i \\eta_{k}}=g_{k}^{-1}$ by (8.12). The claim iii) of the proposition is now proved.\n\nThe following two corollaries are needed for later use.\nCorollary 8.5. $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}: V_{j} \\rightarrow V_{j}$ is also an isometry with respect to the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\mid V_{j}$.\nProof. Let $i: V_{j} \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ be the natural embedding. By Proposition 8.4 one has $\\gamma_{k}=$ $\\left.\\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)\\right|_{V_{j}}$, giving that $\\gamma_{k}^{*} i^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M}=i^{*} \\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M}=i^{*} \\pi^{*} g_{M}$ using $\\pi \\circ \\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)=\\pi$.\n\nCorollary 8.6. The map $\\tau: G_{j} \\rightarrow \\tau\\left(G_{j}\\right)$ used in Theorem 2.3 is a group isomorphism.\n\nProof. By Proposition 8.4 iii) and (8.4) we learn that $\\tau\\left(g_{k}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)$. If $\\tau\\left(g_{k}\\right)$ is the identity on $V_{j}$, this contradicts (8.10). So $\\operatorname{ker} \\tau=\\{1\\}$ hence $\\tau$ is a group isomorphism since in Theorem 2.3 we have shown that $\\tau$ is a group homomorphism.\n\nRecall (in the proof of Lemma 6.14) that $\\alpha_{k}(x) \\in S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ is chosen to satisfy the property that for $x \\in W_{j}, \\alpha_{k}(x) x\\left(=\\alpha_{k}(x) \\circ x\\right) \\in W_{j}$ and $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x) x\\right)=0$. For $k=0$ set\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{0}(x)=e^{-i \\phi(x)} \\text { for } x=(z, \\phi, r)\n$$\n\nClearly $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{0}(x) x\\right)=0$. We describe the properties of $\\alpha_{k}(x)$ below.\nProposition 8.7. (group property of $\\alpha_{k}$ in the proof of Lemma 6.14) With the chart $W_{j}$ chosen as in Remark 8.3 and the notation above, it holds that $\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)$ is independent of $x \\in W_{j}$ and\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x): k=0,1, \\cdot, \\Lambda\\right\\}=G_{j}\n$$\n\n(see (7.44) for $\\Lambda$ and (8.2) for $G_{j}$ ). So $\\Lambda=N_{j}$. Moreover we can arrange $1 \\leq k$ $\\leq N_{j}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)=g_{k}^{-1}\n$$\n\nIn particular, the set $\\left\\{\\alpha_{k}(x)\\right\\}_{k=0,1, \\cdots, \\Lambda}$ is independent of those $x \\in W_{j}$ with $\\phi(x)=0$ and this set forms a group equal to the local orbifold group $G_{j}$.\nProof. Let $x_{1}=(z, 0,1) \\in V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$. It follows from the definition of $\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ and Lemma $7.6 i$ ) that $\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) x_{1}=\\left(z_{k}, 0,1\\right) \\in V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$. Since $V_{j}$ is an orbifold chart, there is $g_{l}\\left(=g_{0}^{l}\\right) \\in G_{j}$ such that $\\tau\\left(g_{l}\\right) z=z_{k}$ (see the proof of Theorem 2.3). By Proposition 8.4 iii) (noting $\\gamma_{l}=\\tau\\left(g_{l}\\right)$, cf. (8.4)) $\\sigma\\left(g_{l}\\right) x_{1}=\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right) x_{1}$. So $g_{l}^{-1} \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)$ lies in the isotropy group of $x_{1}$, which is a subgroup of $G_{j}$. It follows that $\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\in G_{j}$. Denote the set $\\left\\{\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x): k=0,1, \\cdot, \\Lambda\\right\\}$ by $\\Gamma_{x}$. Observing $\\alpha_{0}\\left(x_{1}\\right)=1$ by (8.14), we have shown\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{x_{1}} \\subset G_{j}\n$$\n\nConversely by Proposition 8.4 iii) again any element of $G_{j}$ acts on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ itself via $\\sigma$, so from the definition of $\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)$, it follows that $G_{j} \\subset \\Gamma_{x_{1}}$. Together with (8.17) we conclude\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{x_{1}}=G_{j}\n$$\n\nFor $x=(z, \\phi, r) \\in W_{j}$ we compute ( $\\sigma$ omitted for simplicity of notation)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha_{0}(x) \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right) x & =e^{-i \\phi(x)} \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\left(r e^{i \\phi(x)} x_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =r \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right) x_{1}=\\left(z_{k}, 0, r\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nso $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{0}(x) \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right) x\\right)=0$. It follows that as sets $\\left\\{\\alpha_{0}(x) \\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right\\}_{k} \\subset\\left\\{\\alpha_{k}(x)\\right\\}_{k}$ from the definition of $\\alpha_{k}(x)$, so up to multiplication by $\\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)$ on both sets $\\left\\{\\alpha_{k}\\left(x_{1}\\right)\\right\\}_{k}=$ $\\Gamma_{x_{1}}\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\left(x_{1}\\right)=1\\right) \\subset\\left\\{\\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x) \\alpha_{k}(x)\\right\\}_{k}=\\Gamma_{x}$. Similarly one proves $\\phi\\left(\\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x) \\alpha_{k}(x) x_{1}\\right)$ $=0$, giving $\\Gamma_{x} \\subset \\Gamma_{x_{1}}$ so $\\Gamma_{x_{1}}=\\Gamma_{x}$. This, together with (8.18), gives (8.15). By the continuity of $\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)$ in $x$ and the discreteness of $G_{j}, \\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)$ for each $k$ must be independent of $x \\in W_{j}$.\n\nAn immediate corollary to Propositions 8.4 and 8.7 is the following lemma.\nLemma 8.8. It holds that for $1 \\leq k \\leq N_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)\\right)=\\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)=\\gamma_{k}^{-1} \\text { maps } V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\quad(\\subset \\Sigma) \\text { to itself. }\n$$\n\nWe can now compute the supertrace of the approximate heat kernel $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ in $(6.6)$\n\n$$\nP_{m, t}^{0}:=\\sum_{j(\\text { finite })} H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere by $(7.3),(7.59),(7.61)$ and the notation \" $\\mid$ \" (see the lines before and after $(7.61))$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m})(x, x)=\\varphi_{j}(x) w^{m}(x) \\int_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\Psi_{*, m}\\left\\{\\left(\\gamma_{\\xi}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} \\circ K_{t}^{j}(\\zeta, z)\\right)^{\\dagger} \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1}\\right. \\\\\n\\left.\\bar{w}^{m}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right) h^{m}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right), \\bar{z}\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\tau_{j}\\left(z\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\sigma_{j}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\xi^{-1} x\\right)\\right) \\bar{\\xi}^{m}\\right\\} d \\mu_{x, m}(\\xi)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nRemark 8.9. We equip $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ with the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$, cf. the first term of the RHS in (8.50) in local coordinates. Associated to the metric $h_{E}$ on $E$, we consider the Chern connection $\\nabla^{h_{E}}$ (see [62]) for later use. For the heat kernel $K_{t}^{j}$ below in (8.23) we use the metric $\\left.\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right|_{V_{j}}$ (see the note below (6.3)).\n\nNote that $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is not a Clifford module over $\\Sigma$ although $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is a Clifford module over $M$. Recall that in (7.49) (in Section 7) for $y=x,\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}}^{*}\\right)_{y}=\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x)\\right)_{x}^{*} \\cdot \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\alpha_{k}(x) x}^{m}$ $\\left(=\\mathcal{E}_{\\alpha_{k}(x) x}^{m}\\right) \\rightarrow \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{x}^{m}$ where $\\check{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}=\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\otimes E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ (Notation 7.12). Since $\\alpha_{k}(x) x$ $\\in V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}, \\check{\\mathcal{E}}_{\\alpha_{k}(x) x}^{m}=\\mathcal{E}_{\\alpha_{k}(x) x}^{m}$. For the integral in (8.21), using (6.27) and (7.49) we can write\n\n$$\n\\left(H_{m, t}^{j} \\circ \\pi_{m}\\right)(x, x)=p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, x)|w|^{2 m}\n$$\n\nwhere we recall: (8.3) for the definition of $\\gamma_{k},(7.60)$ for $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ with $\\xi^{-1}=g_{k}$ and $z_{k}=z\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x) x\\right)$,\n$p_{m, t}^{0, j}(x, x)=\\varphi_{j}(x) h^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) \\sum_{k=0}^{N_{j}} \\Psi_{*, m}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} \\circ K_{t}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, z\\right)\\right)^{\\dagger} \\Psi_{*, m}^{-1} \\tau_{j}\\left(z_{k}\\right)\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)\\right)^{m}$\n\nby a slightly tedious verification using (8.21), (7.49) and (8.19): For this verification we are contented with pointing out that in (8.19) $\\alpha_{0}^{-1}$ is involved and noting that $\\sigma_{\\alpha_{0}^{-1}}^{*}$ acts on $\\check{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}$ \"trivially\" ${ }^{10}$ so using $\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}}^{*}=\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{*}$ and $\\gamma_{k}=\\sigma_{g_{k}}=\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1} \\alpha_{0}}$ it follows from $\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{*}$ in (7.49), (7.61) the expression $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ in (8.23). With $z=z(x)$ and $z_{k}=z\\left(\\alpha_{k}(x) x\\right)$ we have an endomorphism\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}=\\gamma_{\\alpha_{k}^{-1}}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}: \\mathcal{E}_{\\left(z_{k}, 0,1\\right)}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{E}_{\\left(z, 0,1\\right)}^{m}\n$$\n\n(with $\\xi=\\alpha_{k}$ in (7.60)) of $\\mathcal{E}^{m}=\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\otimes E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right|_{V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}}$, induced by the pullback of $\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{k}\\right)=\\gamma_{k}^{-1}:(z, 0,1) \\rightarrow\\left(z_{k}, 0,1\\right)$ for $k=1, \\cdots, N_{j}$; note that a local equivariant section of $\\check{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}$ formed from those of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}, E$ and $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ has been used to lift $\\gamma_{k}$ to $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$. For $k=0$ we define $\\sigma\\left(\\alpha_{0}(x)\\right)=: \\gamma_{0}^{-1}$ at $x$ (see Footnote ${ }^{10}$ at general $x$ ) and then for $x=(z, 0,1)$ (thus $\\alpha_{0}(x)=1$ ) we have\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}: \\mathcal{E}_{\\left(z, 0,1\\right)}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{E}_{\\left(z, 0,1\\right)}^{m} \\text { is the identity }\n$$\n\n8.1. Part I of the local index formula ( $k=0$ in (8.23)). When $k=0$ thus $z_{0}=z$ and $\\gamma_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}=$ identity endomorphism (8.25), the $k=0$ term in (8.23) equals\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{j}(x) h^{m}(z, \\bar{z}) K_{t}^{j}(z, z) \\tau_{j}(z)\n$$\n\nand the corresponding supertrace (denoted as Part I of $\\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ ) of $P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ in (8.20), (8.22) reads (by noting that $\\tau_{j}(z)=1$ on $\\operatorname{supp} \\varphi_{j}$ and $\\left.h^{m}(z, \\bar{z})|w|^{2 m}=\\right.$ $\\left.l^{m}(x)\\right)$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Part I of } \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) \\\\\n& \\text { (8.22) } \\underset{\\sim}{=}(8.26) \\\\\n& \\sum_{j} \\varphi_{j}(x) l^{m}(x) \\operatorname{Str}\\left(K_{t}^{j}(z, z)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich gives the major contribution for the index of $\\partial_{\\Sigma, m}^{E}$-complex in Theorem 1.1 (see Theorem 8.11 below). With (8.27) we are almost ready to derive \"Part I\" of the local index density of Theorem 1.1 as stated in the Introduction. To fix the notation let $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on $\\Sigma$ with a connection $\\nabla$. Let $c h(\\nabla, E)$ and $T d(\\nabla, E)$ be the $\\nabla$-induced Chern character form and the Todd form respectively. For the Chern connection $\\nabla^{h_{E}}$ of $E$ (see Remark 8.9) we write $T d\\left(E, h_{E}\\right):=T d\\left(\\nabla^{h_{E}}, E\\right) ; c h\\left(E, h_{E}\\right):=c h\\left(\\nabla^{h_{E}}, E\\right)$. Recall that the metric $G_{a}$ or $G_{a, m}$ on $\\Sigma$ has the property that \"base\" $z$-slices and \"fibre\" $w$-slices are orthogonally splitting (see (3.14) for a precise discussion). We summarize the results as follows.\n\nLemma 8.10. With notations above and those in the Introduction, we have $i$ ) the quotient (Hermitian) metric $g_{\\text {quot }}$ on $T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}$ defined by the restriction of $G_{a, m}$ on the orthogonal complement of the tangent space to the \"fibre\" (the orbit of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action) is isometric to $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ and is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant; ii) for $E$ being $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ equivariant with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric $h_{E}, T d\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ and $c h\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ are $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant, denoted by $T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ and $c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)$ respectively.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ Note that $\\alpha_{0}(x)$ (cf. (8.14)) acts as a small-angle rotation $e^{-i \\phi(x)}$ whose action on any $y=(z, \\phi, r)$ keeps $z$-coordinates unchanged so that the (induced) action of $\\sigma_{\\alpha_{0}(x)}$ on the bundle $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ (as well as the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant $E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ ) is regarded as \"trivial\" under the natural trivialization using the pullback sections (see also Footnote ${ }^{6}$ associated with (6.13)).\n\nRecall that $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant Hermitian metric on $L_{\\Sigma}$ (Step 1 in Section 3), which induces $\\|\\cdot\\|^{*}$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{m}^{*}$ on $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$ and $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{m}$ respectively. As above we write the first Chern form $c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\|\\cdot\\|\\right)$.\n\nWe are going to establish \"Part I\" of our transversal local index density in Theorem 8.11 via the local adaptation of classical local index density arguments (non-transversal ones) with (8.27).\n\nTheorem 8.11. With notations and assumptions as in Theorem 1.1, we have\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Part} I \\text { of } \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n$$\n\n$$\n=p \\delta_{p \\mid m}\\left[T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) \\wedge c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) \\wedge e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\|\\cdot\\|\\right)} \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{m}\\right]_{2 n}(x)\n$$\n\n(in a pointwise, non-uniform manner) for $x \\in \\Sigma_{p}\\left(=\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$. Moreover\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma} \\operatorname{Part} I \\text { of } \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\\\\n& =p \\delta_{p \\mid m} \\int_{\\Sigma} T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) \\wedge c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) \\wedge e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\|\\cdot\\|\\right)} \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $N_{0}(n)$ be as in $i i$ ) of Theorem 1.3. We first claim that for every positive integer $N_{0} \\geq N_{0}(n)(=n+1)$, there exist $\\delta>0$ and $C_{N_{0}}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|\\operatorname{Part} \\mathrm{I} \\text { of }\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,+}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,-}(x, x)\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-p \\delta_{p \\mid m} l^{m}(x) \\sum_{j=0}^{N_{0}} t^{-(n-1)+j}\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{-}(z)\\right)\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq C_{N_{0}} l^{m}(x) t^{-(n-1)+N_{0}+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor any $t, 0<t<\\delta$ and any $x \\in \\Sigma_{p}\\left(=\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$. For $p=1$ the proof of (8.30) follows from (7.52) (with $\\zeta=z$ ) and (8.27). Since $l^{m}(x)$ in (8.30) blows up as $|w(x)| \\rightarrow \\infty$, no uniform convergence follows from (8.30). In fact the convergence cannot be uniform; this follows from an inspection of the factor $l^{m}(x)$ in (7.52) and (8.27) used for deriving (8.30). For $p>1$ there is an extra factor $p \\delta_{p \\mid m}$ as shown before (see (7.51) and the paragraph after it). Hence the claim. It is known by using rescaling techniques that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{j=0}^{N_{0}} t^{-(n-1)+j}\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{-}(z)\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{j=n-1}^{N_{0}} t^{-(n-1)+j}\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{n-1-j}^{-}(z)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas is from [6, Proposition 3.21 and Theorem 4.1 (1)] (about the vanishing of the supertrace for degrees strictly less than $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} M=2(n-1)$ ). Note that only the $t^{0}$-term $\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{-}(z)(j=n-1)$ in (8.31) would survive as $t \\rightarrow 0$. We obtain via (8.30) and (8.31)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Part} \\mathrm{I} \\text { of } \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i} \\varphi_{i}(x) p \\delta_{p \\mid m} l^{m}(x)\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{-}(z)\\right) d v_{V_{i}}(z) d v_{m}(|w|) d v(\\phi) / 2 \\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe RHS of (8.32) is seen to be related to the classical local index density. For, in view of the heat kernel $K_{t}^{i}(z, \\zeta)$ for $\\square_{\\mathbb{V}_{i, m}}^{\\zeta}$ (see (6.3) and (5.6)) the well-known local\n\nindex density computation (in connection with Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, cf. [6]) can be adapted and applied on $V_{i}$ (with the extra bundle $E$ ), and then, since the background metric $g_{M}$ on $V_{i}$ for $\\square_{V_{i}, m}^{\\mathrm{c}}$ (cf. Step 3 of Section 3 and Definition 3.8) has been identified with the above-mentioned metric $g_{\\text {quot }}$ on $T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}$ (Lemma 8.10), we arrive at the following equalities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{-}(z)\\right) d v_{V_{i}}(z) \\\\\n= & {\\left[\\left.T d\\left(T^{1,0} V_{i}, \\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right) c h\\left(\\psi_{i}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{m}\\right)\\right|_{V_{i}}, h_{E} \\otimes\\| \\cdot \\|_{m}^{s}\\right)\\right]_{2(n-1)}(z) } \\\\\n= & {\\left[\\left.T d\\left(T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) c h\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) c h\\left(\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{m},\\| \\cdot \\|_{m}^{s}\\right)\\right]_{2(n-1)}(z, w) } \\\\\n= & {\\left[\\left.T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\| \\| \\|}\\right)\\right]_{2(n-1)}(z, w) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{i}:(z, w) \\in V_{i} \\times C_{\\varepsilon_{i}} \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ is the local trivialization (see (3.6) and (2.11)) and $V_{i}$ may be identified with $V_{i} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\subset \\Sigma$. By (3.23) we write (8.32) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{i} \\varphi_{i}(x) p \\delta_{p \\mid m} l^{m}(x)\\left(\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{+}(z)-\\operatorname{Tr} b_{0}^{-}(z)\\right) d v_{V_{i}}(z) d v_{f, m} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(8.33)}{=} p \\delta_{p \\mid m}\\left[T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\| \\| \\|}\\right]_{2(n-1)}(z, w) \\wedge l^{m}(x) d v_{f, m}(\\text { also by } \\sum_{i} \\varphi_{i}(x)=1)\\right. \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(3.24)}{=} p \\delta_{p \\mid m}\\left[T d_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma / L_{\\Sigma}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) \\wedge c h_{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\left(E, h_{E}\\right) \\wedge e^{-m c_{1}\\left(L_{\\Sigma},\\| \\| \\|}\\right) \\wedge d \\bar{v}_{m}\\right]_{2 n}(x) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe claim (8.28) follows from (8.32) and (8.34). To exchange the limit $t \\rightarrow 0$ and the integral sign we note that $l^{m}(x)$ in the RHS of (8.30) is an $L^{1}$ function in view of Remark 3.4, implying the second claim (8.29).\n8.2. Part II of the local $m$-index formula ( $k \\geq 1$ in (8.23)) via Lefschetz type formulas. In contrast to the $k=0$ case, $\\gamma_{k}^{p m}$ is not necessarily the identity endomorphism if $k \\geq 1$ in (8.23). In view of local equivariant index theorems, the fixed points set $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ (in $V_{j}$, identified with $\\left.\\left(V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)^{\\gamma_{k}} \\subset V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)$ of $\\gamma_{k}$ and hence the singular stratum $\\Sigma_{j, k}$ (see (8.9)) (which may cover $\\left|\\Sigma_{j, k}\\right|$ - the support of $\\Sigma_{j, k}$, several times) are expected to play a role in the final index formula. See the remark below for the support $\\left|\\Sigma_{j, k}\\right|$ of $\\Sigma_{j, k}$.\n\nRemark 8.12. Let $O:=\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ S$ be the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit of a set $S$. We write $|O|$ for the \"support of $O$ \", that is, the set-theoretical image of the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $S$. This counts the points in the orbit only once.\n\nNotation 8.13. In the remaining of this section $\\sigma_{\\bullet}$ denotes the symbol map as in [6, Definition 3.4 and Proposition 3.6] and for $\\sigma_{\\bullet}$ (endomorphisms) see [6, Lemma 6.10 and the top two lines on p.193] which is basically the symbol of the Clifford algebra part of endomorphisms.\n\nTo proceed with (8.23), let us first write the asymptotic expansion of $\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{p m} \\circ\\right.$ $\\left.K_{t}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, z\\right)\\right)^{t}$ which appears in (8.23) and (8.24), as follows (without \" $\\mid$ \" below): as $t \\rightarrow 0$ (cf.

Notice that (8.35) holds true for an open domain $V_{j}$ although\n\n[6, Theorem 6.11] is applicable for a compact manifold. See [20] for some detailed explanation.\n\nIn the spirit of deducing Lefschetz fixed point theorem we compute the following limit via (8.35) (in the space of generalized sections, see [6, Theorem 6.16] for details by noting that $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ on $\\left(V_{j}, \\mathcal{E}^{m}\\right)$ is an isometry by Corollary 8.5 and Lemma 7.14)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Str}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} \\circ K_{t}^{j}\\left(z_{k}, z\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & c_{j, k} T_{V_{j}}\\left\\{\\operatorname{Str}_{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}\\left[\\sigma_{2 \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}}\\left(\\Phi_{\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} / 2}^{\\gamma_{k}}(z, z)\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n= & c_{j, k} T_{V_{j}}\\left\\{I_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right) S t r_{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} / S\\left[\\sigma_{2 \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}-\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right) \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\delta_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the Berezin integral denoted by $T_{V_{j}}\\left\\{I_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right) \\cdots\\right\\}$ gives a smooth function on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}[6$, p. 196 and p.54], $F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}$ denotes the restriction to $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ of the twisting curvature [6, p. 195 and p.120] $\\left(V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\right.$ endowed with the metric induced from $\\left.\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\mid V_{j}\\right), \\sigma_{\\bullet}$ is the symbol map (not to be confused with the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma$, see also (8.87)), $c_{j, k}$ $:=(4 \\pi)^{-\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} / 2}(-2 i)^{\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}}$ with $(4 \\pi)^{-\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} / 2}$ from (8.35) and $(-2 i)^{\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}}$ from the formula in [6, Proposition 3.21] and finally\n\n$$\nI_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right):=\\frac{\\hat{A}_{B G V}\\left(V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}\\right) \\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\n(see [6, Theorem 6.11] and Notation 8.15 below).

About these expressions, see related discussions prior to (and in the proof of) Proposition 8.33.\n\nNote also that following [6, the line above Theorem 6.16] we use the notation $T_{V_{j}}$ in (8.36) although it is applied to a delta-function like object supported on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. For the insertion of $\\delta_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ in (8.36) in the end, see [6, Theorem 6.11]. With the notation above, set\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}(z, \\bar{z}):=c_{j, k} T_{V_{j}}\\left\\{I_{j}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right) S t r_{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} / S\\left[\\sigma_{2 \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}-\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right) \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor $z \\in V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$.

Theorem 1.1 and (8.48). To this aim (see Proposition 8.23 below) first recall (8.2) for the definition of $g_{k}$ and $G_{j}$ $\\left(\\subset S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ and let\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}:=\\bigcup_{j(\\text { finite })} G_{j}\n$$\n\nNote that the finite index set $\\mathcal{G}$ may not be a group and $g_{k}$ in (8.2) depends on $j$.\nWe use $g_{k}$ or $g_{k}^{(j)}$ interchangeably below. For $\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}$ let $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ denote the set of points fixed by $\\tilde{g}$ (via $\\sigma$ ) in $\\Sigma$. By (8.9) for $\\Sigma_{j, k}$ we then have\n\n$$\n\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}=\\bigcup_{(j, k): g_{k}^{(j)}=\\tilde{g}}\\left|\\Sigma_{j, k}\\right|\n$$\n\nObserve that $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ is a (complex) submanifold of $\\Sigma$. The following basically follows from definitions.\n\nLemma 8.14. With the notation above, it holds that ( $\\mathcal{G}$ being a finite set)\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}=\\bigcup_{\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}, \\tilde{g} \\neq 1} \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}\n$$\n\nProof. Recall that $\\Sigma_{p_{j}}$ denotes the set of points having period $2 \\pi / p_{j}$ and that $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ is by definition the union of $\\Sigma_{p_{j}}, j \\geq 2$. If a point has the period less than $2 \\pi / p_{1}$, then its isotropy group $\\subset S^{1}$ is nontrivial so that it is a fixed point of some element $\\tilde{g}$ of $S^{1}$. Conversely, any point in $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ for $\\tilde{g} \\neq 1$ has a nontrivial isotropy group rendering its period less than $2 \\pi / p_{1}$.\n\nNotation 8.15. i) Let $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbb{R}}$ denote the real normal bundle of $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$, but for notational convenience we drop the subscript $\\mathbb{R}$. We equip it with the metric induced from $G_{a, m}$ or $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$; see Remark 8.17 for the equivalence in this case. ii) We follow the notation adopted by [6]: Let $R^{1}$ denote the curvature of $\\mathcal{N}$ and by $\\tilde{g}_{1}$ the naturally induced action of $\\tilde{g}$ on $\\mathcal{N}$.\n\nIn view of (8.37) we set ( $T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ and $L_{\\Sigma \\delta}$ below viewed as real tangent bundle and subbundle respectively with Lemma $8.10 i$ ) for the metric $g_{\\text {quot }}$ )\n\n$$\nI(\\tilde{g}):=\\frac{\\tilde{A}_{B G V}\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma \\delta}, g_{q u o t}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1}\\right) \\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\non $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$. Note that for $\\tilde{g}=g_{k}^{(j)}=g_{k}$ locally in $W_{j}$ as in (8.44)\n\n$$\n\\tilde{g}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}=\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}} \\text { on } V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\n$$\n\nby (8.19) for $\\sigma\\left(g_{k}\\right)=\\gamma_{k}$ on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$. We prefer the use of two separate notations $\\tilde{g}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ and $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ because the former is meant to be global and intrinsic while the latter is for the restriction of the former on $V_{j}$ (which depends on the trivialization $\\psi_{j}$ ). In view of (8.38) and (8.47) we define a complex-valued function $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\subset \\Sigma$ via \"projections\" $\\pi_{V_{j}}:\\left(z_{j}, w_{j}\\right) \\in W_{j} \\rightarrow\\left(z_{j}, 1\\right) \\in V_{j}\\left(T_{V_{j}}\\right.$ below as in (8.36)): for $q \\in \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\delta \\cap D_{j}}(q) \\\\\n:= & \\left.c_{j, k} T_{V_{j}}\\left\\{I(\\tilde{g}) S t r_{\\mathcal{E} / S}\\left[\\sigma_{2 n-\\left(l_{j, k}+2\\right)}\\left(\\tilde{g}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right) \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\right|_{\\pi_{V_{j}}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}(q)\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $l_{j, k}=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. In Lemma 8.19 below we show that (8.48) is independent of the choice of $D_{j}$ that contains $q$.\n\nIt follows (cf. (8.38) for $\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}$ ) that for $q \\in \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$\n\n$$\n\\left.\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\delta \\cap D_{j}}(q)=\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}\\left(z\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}(q)\\right), \\bar{z}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}(q)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere we think of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ as a global function and $\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}$ as its local expression.\nLemma 8.16. With the notation above $\\tilde{A}_{B G V}\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma \\delta}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right), R^{1}$ and $\\tilde{g}_{1}$ are locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant (meaning that it is invariant under the action of $\\rho e^{i \\phi}$ with $\\rho \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$and $|\\phi|$ small). Moreover $\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)$ in (8.46) are also locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant.\n\nProof. By (3.21) and (3.14) we write the metric $G_{a, m}$ in special local coordinates $(z, w)$ for (3.13) at $\\sigma(c) q_{0}=\\left(z_{0}, c w_{0}\\right)$ with $q_{0}=\\left(z_{0}, w_{0}\\right) \\in \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$ and $c=|c| e^{i \\varphi} \\in$ $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ for $|c| \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$arbitrary, $\\varphi$ sufficiently near 0 such that $\\sigma(c) q_{0}$ still lies in $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$, as follows (with the same coordinates (3.13) holds at $\\sigma(c) q_{0}$ when $c$ varies)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& G_{a, m} \\mid \\sigma(c) q_{0}=\\left(g_{M}\\right)_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta}}\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right) d z_{\\alpha} d \\bar{z}_{\\beta}+ \\\\\n& \\left(\\varphi_{1}\\left(|c|^{2} w_{0} \\bar{w}_{0}\\right)+\\varphi_{2}\\left(|c|^{2} w_{0} \\bar{w}_{0}\\right) 4 a^{2}|c|^{-4 a-2}\\left(w_{0} \\bar{w}_{0}\\right)^{-2 a-1}\\right) \\frac{d w d \\bar{w}}{\\lambda_{m}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is not difficult to see from (8.50) that the normal space $\\mathcal{N}_{\\sigma(c) q_{0}}$, which is perpendicular to $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ at $\\sigma(c) q_{0}$, consists of vectors depending only on $z$-coordinate as $c$ varies. It follows that $\\sigma(c)_{*}: \\mathcal{N}_{q_{0}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}_{\\sigma(c) q_{0}}$ is an isometry with respect to $\\pi^{*} g_{M}=$ $\\left(g_{M}\\right)_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta}}\\left(z_{0}, \\bar{z}_{0}\\right) d z_{\\alpha} d \\bar{z}_{\\beta}$ in $W_{j}=\\psi_{j}^{-1}\\left(D_{j}\\right)$, and hence the curvature $R^{1}$ of $\\mathcal{N}$ is locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant. For $\\tilde{A}_{B G V}$ on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ we observe that $g_{q u o t}$ is identified with the metric $\\left.\\pi^{*} g_{M}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\delta} \\cap D_{j}}$ on the $W_{j}$-chart (see Lemma $8.10 i$ )) so that $\\tilde{A}_{B G V}\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma \\delta}, g_{q u o t}\\right)$ is also locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant. That $\\tilde{g}_{1}$ is locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant follows from that the action of $\\tilde{g}$ commutes with the (local) $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. The last statement easily follows via the isometry $\\sigma(c)_{*}$ just mentioned.\n\nRemark 8.17. By (8.50) the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ and the metric $G_{a, m}$ coincide on the normal bundle $\\mathcal{N}$, cf. Remark 8.22.\n\nCorollary 8.18. With the notation above, $\\left.\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\tilde{s} \\cap D_{j}}\\left(=\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{I}(z, \\bar{z})\\right.$ by (8.49)) viewed as a function of $(z, w) \\in\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}\\right) \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$ is a function of $z$ (and $\\bar{z}$ ) only, $z \\in$ $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. In particular $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m} \\mid \\Sigma \\tilde{s} \\cap D_{j}$ is locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant.\n\nProof. From Lemma 8.16 $I(\\tilde{g})$ in (8.46) is independent of the local $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action. The curvature $F_{0}^{\\gamma_{m} ; \\bar{z}}$ (8.36) and the symbol $\\sigma_{2 n-\\left(l_{j, k}+2\\right)}\\left(\\tilde{g}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right)$ work on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ and so involve the $z$-coordinate(s) only. Altogether in view of (8.48) $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m} \\mid \\Sigma \\tilde{s} \\cap D_{j}$ is a function of $z$ in $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$.\n\nUsing Lemma 8.16 we prove\nLemma 8.19. For $q \\in \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j} \\cap D_{j^{\\prime}}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}\\left\\lvert\\, \\Sigma \\tilde{s} \\cap D_{j}(q)=\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}\\right.$ $\\left.\\left|\\Sigma \\tilde{s} \\cap D_{j^{\\prime}}(q)\\right.\\right.\n$$\n\nNamely $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ is a globally defined smooth function on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$.\nProof. Suppose that $g_{k}^{(j)}=g_{k^{\\prime}}^{\\left(j^{\\prime}\\right)}=\\tilde{g}$ thus $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}=V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}=\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap\\left(V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)$ (resp. $\\left.V_{j^{\\prime}}^{\\gamma_{k^{\\prime}}}=V_{j^{\\prime}}^{\\tilde{g}}=\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap\\left(V_{j^{\\prime}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)\\right)$. We leave the reader to check the equality of the constants $l_{j, k}=l_{j^{\\prime}, k^{\\prime}}, c_{j, k}=c_{j^{\\prime}, k^{\\prime}}$. To compare the two sides of (8.51) we notice that by (2.7) and Theorem 2.3 one finds $\\zeta_{j} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ with $\\zeta_{j}=\\left|\\zeta_{j}\\right| e^{i \\phi_{j}},\\left|\\phi_{j}\\right|<$ $\\varepsilon_{j}\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ with $\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}}=\\left|\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}}\\right| e^{i \\phi_{j^{\\prime}}},\\left|\\phi_{j^{\\prime}}\\right|<\\varepsilon_{j^{\\prime}}$ ) such that\n\n$$\n\\psi_{j} \\pi_{V_{j}}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}(q)\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\sigma\\left(\\zeta_{j}\\right)} q\\left(\\text { resp. } q \\xrightarrow{\\sigma\\left(\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}}\\right)} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}} \\pi_{V_{j^{\\prime}}}\\left(\\psi_{j^{\\prime}}^{-1}(q)\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nso that $\\sigma\\left(\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}} \\zeta_{j}\\right)$ sends $\\psi_{j} \\pi_{V_{j}}\\left(\\psi_{j}^{-1}(q)\\right)$ to $\\psi_{j^{\\prime}} \\pi_{V_{j^{\\prime}}}\\left(\\psi_{j^{\\prime}}^{-1}(q)\\right)$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ in both sides of (8.51) arise from the quantity $I(\\tilde{g}) \\operatorname{Str}_{\\mathcal{E} / \\bar{S}}\\left[\\sigma_{2 n-\\left(l_{j, k}+2\\right)}\\left(\\tilde{g}^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}}\\right) \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / \\bar{s}}\\right)\\right]$ on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ (see Notation $7.12 i$ ) for $\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}^{m}, \\mathcal{E}^{m}$ and (8.48) with no \"tilde\" on $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$ ), we see from (8.48) that the values in (8.51) differ by the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma\\left(\\zeta_{j^{\\prime}} \\zeta_{j}\\right)$ and then the local $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance (Corollary 8.18) gives the same value, proving (8.51).\n\nIn the above discussion we refer to the local $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$. In fact $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ is (globally) $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant: (This fact is not strictly needed until (8.116); see remarks after (8.116).)\n\nCorollary 8.20. For all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ and $q$, (hence) $\\sigma(\\lambda) q \\in \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ it holds that $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(\\sigma(\\lambda) q)$ $=\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(q)$. In particular, the function $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ takes the same value if both $q$ and $\\sigma(\\lambda) q$ lie in the same local chart $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$.\nProof. Since $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ is well defined on the whole $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ by Lemma 8.19 and is locally $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant by Corollary 8.18 , the global $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance follows from a composition of finite number of local $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-actions (cf. proof of Lemma 8.2).\n\nNote that $G_{a, m}$ is not $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant in general but it is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant after restricting to some subbundles such as the above-mentioned normal bundles (Remark 8.17). In $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ let $\\tilde{F}$ (resp. $\\tilde{F}_{j}$ ) denote a fixed point orbifold (resp. the $j$-chart part of $\\tilde{F})$; see (8.113) and the paragraph there for the precise meaning of $\\tilde{F}$. Let $d v_{\\tilde{F}_{j}}, d v_{\\tilde{F}}$ denote the (induced) volume forms on $\\tilde{F}_{j} \\subset M, \\tilde{F} \\subset M$ respectively with respect to the metric $g_{M}$ (Notation 3.1). Let $d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ be the pullback of $d v_{\\tilde{F}_{j}}$ by $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\rightarrow \\tilde{F}_{j}$\n\n(the $j$-part orbifold chart for some $\\tilde{g} \\in \\mathcal{G}$ in (8.43) under the restriction of $\\pi: \\Sigma$ $\\rightarrow \\Sigma / \\sigma$ to $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$. Let $d v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, m}$ denote the volume form of $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ with respect to the metric induced from $G_{a, m}$. With respect to the metrics $g_{M}$ and $G_{a, m}$, the relation between these volume forms is given by\n\nLemma 8.21. With the notation above and in Section 3, we have i)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, m} & =\\left.\\pi^{*} d v_{\\tilde{F}} \\wedge d v_{f, m}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}} \\\\\n& =d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}} \\wedge\\left.\\left(l^{-m} d \\tilde{v}_{m}\\right)\\right|_{\\left.\\Sigma_{\\Sigma_{j}, k}\\right|} \\quad\\left(\\widetilde{g}=g_{k}^{(j)} \\text { in }(8.44)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nii) for $m=0$, given $p_{0}=\\{z\\} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\} \\in W_{j}$, choose new coordinate $w=|w| e^{i \\phi}$ with $z$-coordinate fixed so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.d v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, 0}\\right|_{\\{z\\} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}} & =\\left.\\pi^{*} d v_{\\tilde{F}_{j}}(z) \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{0}\\right|_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}}(w) \\\\\n& =d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}(z) \\wedge d v_{0}(|w|) \\wedge \\frac{d v(\\phi)}{2 \\pi}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere note that $V_{j}$ is determined by the \"old\" coordinate $w(=1)$.\nProof. For $i$ ) the first equality of (8.52) follows from (3.22) (see also (8.50)). In view of (8.44), (8.9) the second equality of (8.52) follows from the definition of $d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ and (3.24). For $i i$ ) with the metric on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ induced from the metric $G_{a, m}(m=0)$ on $\\Sigma$, the volume form $\\left.d v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, 0}\\right|_{\\{z\\} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}}$along a local $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbit of $p_{0}$ reads as (8.53) by (3.22), (3.23) with the reasoning there for $m=0$ : given $p_{0}=\\{z\\} \\times\\{0\\} \\times$ $\\{1\\}$, choose new $w=|w| e^{i \\phi}$ such that $h(z, \\bar{z})=1, d h(z, \\bar{z})=0$ at $p_{0}$. Hence (8.53) holds.\n\nThe notation $d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ is the volume form on $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}$ with respect to the metric $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$; this metric is to be distinguished from the metric $G_{a, m}$. It is worthwhile noting the following.\n\nRemark 8.22. Let $d v_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ denote the volume form induced by $G_{a, m}$. Then $d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ may not equal $d v_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}$ in general in view of (3.11), (3.12) and (3.21). Compare Remark 8.17 .\n\nWith reference to (8.42), the integrand to be desired (cf. the paragraph after (8.42)) is now seen by the following.\n\nProposition 8.23. With the notation above, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\tilde{g}^{-m} \\int_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}} \\overline{\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x)} l^{m}(x) d v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, m} \\\\\n=\\sum_{(j, k): g_{k}^{(j)}=\\tilde{g}}\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)^{m} \\int_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}} \\varphi_{j}(z, \\phi) \\overline{\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}(z, \\bar{z})} \\\\\nd \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}(z) \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{m}(z, \\phi,|w|)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nProof. Observe that by (8.52) $l^{m}(x) d v_{\\Sigma \\bar{\\partial}, m}=d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}(z) \\wedge d \\tilde{v}_{m}$ on $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap D_{j}$. From this, $\\Sigma_{j} \\varphi_{j}=1$ and Corollary $8.18,(8.54)$ follows.\n\nRecall that the largest period is $\\frac{2 \\pi}{p}$ (see the paragraph after (1.5)). We can now prove the main result Theorem 1.1.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 8.3. The local index formula completed. \n\nProof. (of Theorem 1.1) To show $i$ ) of the theorem, observe that the formula (8.28) gives the $H R R_{m}$ term in the RHS of (1.5). To compute the singular part of $\\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ we sum up over $j$ the second term in the RHS of (8.40) in view of (8.20). This results in getting the term $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}}$ (the complex conjugate of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ in (8.48)) by noting that $\\alpha_{k} \\alpha_{0}^{-1}=\\alpha_{k}(x) \\alpha_{0}^{-1}(x)=g_{k}^{-1}$ by (8.16) and $\\tau_{j}=1$ on supp $\\varphi_{j}$. We have shown (1.5) for $\\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x)$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nTo show ii) for the index formula, from the McKean-Singer type formula (5.19) for $\\widetilde{\\square}_{m}^{v \\cdot x}$ (with $E$ added by Remark 5.13) together with Theorem 8.1, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{index}(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}^{E} \\text {-complex })=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma}\\left[\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,+}(x, x)-\\operatorname{Tr} P_{m, t}^{0,-}(x, x)\\right] d v_{\\Sigma, m}\n$$\n\nBy (8.41), (8.42) and (8.54), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR H S \\text { of (8.55) }= & \\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma} \\operatorname{Part} \\mathrm{I} \\text { of } \\operatorname{Str} P_{m, t}^{0}(x, x) d v_{\\Sigma, m} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{\\tilde{g} \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{G}}, \\tilde{g} \\neq 1} \\tilde{g}^{-m} \\int_{\\Sigma \\tilde{g}} \\overline{\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}(x)} l^{m}(x) d v_{\\Sigma \\tilde{g}, m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term in the RHS of (8.56) is reduced to the RHS of (8.29) by Theorem 8.11. The second term in the RHS of (8.56) is real-valued since the other terms in (8.56) are real-valued. Thus (1.6) follows from (8.55) and taking the complex conjugate of the second term in the RHS of (8.56).\n\nRemark 8.24. In comparison with [32, (14.3) and (14.4)] a sum over $\\tilde{g}$ or $k$ in our formula (8.56) is anticipated; see also Remark 8.41. A detailed comparison is made in the next subsection.\n\nIn these subsections devoted to the local $m$-index density, we have given an expression based on the language of [6], which are written in the setting of Riemannian geometry. For complex manifolds here, it is desirable to express $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m}$ in (8.48) in terms of Todd form $\\operatorname{Td}\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right)$, twisted Chern character form $c h\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{E}, E\\right)$ (it is the usual Chern character form twisted by $\\gamma_{k}^{E}$ in the sense of (8.77)) where $E$ is a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle and the (usual/untwisted) Chern character form $c h\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$. The expression that we will end up with is the following: for $(j, k)$ such that $g_{k}^{(j)}=\\tilde{g}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, m} \\mid \\Sigma \\tilde{g} \\cap D_{j} \\stackrel{(8.49)}{=} \\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}(z, \\bar{z})= \\\\\n& T_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}} \\frac{T d\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}}, g_{\\text {quot }}\\right) c h\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*} E \\mid V_{j}}, \\psi_{j}^{*} E \\mid V_{j}\\right) c h\\left(\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{V_{j}}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}\\left(1-\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{i}^{v} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{c}^{1}\\right)\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(see the paragraph before Notation 8.30 below for notations involving the superscript/subscript \" $c$ \" in $\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{i}^{v}$ and $R_{c}^{1}$ above). Some details for deducing (8.57) is given in Subsection 8.4 below. Formula (8.57) allows us to compare our result with [32, p.184, (14.4)] which corresponds to the $m=0$ case of (8.57).\n\nAn application of the $m$-index on some two-dimensional $\\Sigma$ yields algebraic identities that are perhaps interesting and nontrivial (see (8.65)).\nExample 8.25. Consider $\\tilde{M}=\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ also viewed as $S^{2}$, the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Let $l$ be an integer larger than or equal to 2 . Let $g=e^{\\mathbb{Z}_{l}} \\in G=\\mathbb{Z}_{l} \\subset S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ act on\n\n$S^{2}$ by a rotation of $\\frac{2 \\pi}{l}$ degree around the $z$-axis. So the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$ and the south pole $S=(0,0,-1)$ are the only fixed points of $g, g^{2}, \\cdots, g^{l-1}$. Let $K_{\\tilde{M}}$ denote the canonical line bundle over $\\tilde{M}$. The $G$-action on $\\tilde{M}$ induces an action on $K_{\\tilde{M}}$ by pulling back the forms. Observe that\n\n$$\n\\Sigma:=\\left(K_{\\tilde{M}} \\backslash\\{0 \\text {-section }\\}\\right) / G\n$$\n\nis a complex surface with a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action induced by the natural $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $K_{\\tilde{M}} \\backslash\\{0$ section $\\}$, which becomes a locally free action denoted as $\\sigma_{s}$ on $\\Sigma$ in the sense of Theorem 1.1. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\left(\\text { or } \\Sigma / \\sigma_{s}\\right) \\cong \\tilde{M} / G=\\mathbb{C P}^{1} / \\mathbb{Z}_{l}\n$$\n\nis a (1-dimensional) compact complex orbifold with the two orbifold points $N$ and $S$.\n\nTake $m=0$ in (1.6). We first compute index $\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m}$ for $m=0$. Using (10.30) with $P=\\Sigma, M=\\Sigma / \\sigma_{s}=\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ by Remark 10.10 we get $h_{m=0}^{0}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=h^{0}\\left(\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\right)$ $=1$ and $h_{m=0}^{1}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=h^{1}\\left(\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\Sigma / \\mathbb{C}^{*}}\\right)=h^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{C P}^{1} / \\mathbb{Z}_{l}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{C P}^{1} / \\mathbb{Z}_{l}}\\right)$. The fact that $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{C P}^{1} / \\mathbb{Z}_{l}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{C P}^{1} / \\mathbb{Z}_{l}}\\right)$ is easily seen to be a $\\mathbb{Z}_{l}$-invariant subspace of $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{C P}^{1}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{C P}^{1}}\\right)$ which equals 0 , gives the LHS of (1.6):\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{index}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m=0}\\right)=h_{m=0}^{0}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})-h_{m=0}^{1}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=1\n$$\n\nBy $h^{0}\\left(\\mathbb{C P}^{1}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)-h^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{C P}^{1}, \\mathcal{O}\\right)=1$ given by the similar index formula, it is seen that the first term on the RHS of (1.6) equals $1 / l$. For the remaining terms of (1.6) with $\\tilde{g}=g, g^{2}, \\cdots, g^{l-1} \\in G, \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}(\\subset \\Sigma)$ consists of two fibres of $\\Sigma$ at $N$ and $S$ each with area $\\frac{1}{l}$ with respect to the measure $d v_{0}(|w|) \\frac{d v(\\tilde{g})}{2 \\pi}$ (see (8.44) and (8.53)). It is not difficult to see that the contribution from $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ associated with $(N, g),\\left(N, g^{2}\\right), \\cdots$, $\\left(N, g^{l-1}\\right), \\tilde{g}=g^{k}, 1 \\leq k \\leq l-1$ in the RHS of (1.6) using (8.57) without $E$ gives, where $1-g^{-k}$ below is from the denominator of (8.57) and found to be $\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{1}^{c}=$ $g^{-k}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{1}{1-g^{-k}} & =\\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-i \\frac{\\sin \\frac{2 \\pi k}{l}}{2\\left(1-\\cos \\frac{2 \\pi k}{l}\\right)}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{l-1}{2 l}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nin view of $\\Sigma_{k=1}^{l-1} \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi k}{l} /\\left(1-\\cos \\frac{2 \\pi k}{l}\\right)=0$ since the complex conjugate of $\\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{1}{1-g^{-k}}$ equals itself $\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-k}=g^{-l+k}\\right)$. Similarly the contribution from $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ associated with $(S, g),\\left(S, g^{2}\\right), \\cdots,\\left(S, g^{l-1}\\right)$ also gives $\\frac{l-1}{2 l}$. Altogether we get $\\frac{1}{l}+\\frac{l-1}{2 l}+\\frac{l-1}{2 l}=1$ for the RHS of (1.6) and hence have verified (1.6) for $m=0$.\n\nWe turn now to $m>0$. Write $G=\\mathbb{Z}_{l}$. The situation is now equivalent to adding an orbifold line bundle $\\left(K_{\\tilde{M} / G}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$; this follows from Remark 10.10 using (10.30) with $P=\\Sigma, M=\\Sigma / \\sigma_{s}=\\tilde{M} / G$ and (10.29) and (8.58) with $L_{M}=\\Sigma \\times_{\\sigma_{s}} \\mathbb{C}=$ $K_{\\tilde{M}} / G=K_{\\tilde{M} / G}$ as a holomorphic orbifold line bundle over $M=\\tilde{M} / G$. Denote the holomorphic line bundle of degree $d$ over $\\tilde{M}=\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ by $\\mathcal{O}(d)$. By $K_{\\tilde{M}}=\\mathcal{O}(-2)$\n\n$$\nH^{1}\\left(\\tilde{M},\\left(K_{\\tilde{M}}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)=H^{0}(\\tilde{M}, \\mathcal{O}(-2 m-2))=0\n$$\n\nfor $m \\geq 0$. It follows from (10.30) (which holds for orbifolds via Remark 10.10) that $H_{m}^{1}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}) \\simeq H^{1}\\left(\\tilde{M} / G,\\left(K_{\\tilde{M} / G}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$, a $G$-invariant subspace of $H^{1}\\left(\\tilde{M},\\left(K_{\\tilde{M}}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ as\n\nin the $m=0$ case since $G$ is a finite group, vanishes via (8.60). Now we are going to compute the dimension of $H_{m}^{0}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}) \\simeq H^{0}\\left(\\tilde{M} / G,\\left(K_{\\tilde{M} / G}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\simeq G$-invariant elements of $H^{0}\\left(\\tilde{M},\\left(K_{\\tilde{M}}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$. Let $[z: w]$ denote the homogeneous coordinates of $\\tilde{M}=\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ with $G=\\mathbb{Z}_{l}$ action by $[z: w] \\rightarrow\\left[e^{2 \\pi i / l} z: w\\right]$. Write a holomorphic section of $T \\tilde{M}^{\\otimes m}=\\left(K_{\\tilde{M}}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ in $[z: 1]$ as $f(z)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)^{m}$ for a polynomial $f(z)$ of degree $\\leq$ $2 m$. Its $G$-invariance implies that\n\n$$\nf\\left(e^{2 \\pi i / l} z\\right)=e^{2 \\pi m i / l} f(z)\n$$\n\nWriting $f(z)=\\sum_{k=0}^{2 m} c_{k} z^{k}$ and $m \\equiv r \\bmod l$ for some $0 \\leq r<l$., we obtain by (8.61) that for $c_{k} \\neq 0, e^{2 \\pi i k / l}$ must be $e^{2 \\pi i r / l}$. Write\n(8.62) $\\kappa(l, m):=$ the number of nonnegative integers $n$ satisfying $r+l \\cdot n \\leq 2 m$.\n\nSo $h_{m}^{0}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=h^{0}\\left(\\tilde{M} / G,\\left(K_{\\tilde{M} / G}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ equals $\\kappa(l, m)$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\text { index } \\bar{\\partial}_{\\Sigma, m} \\equiv h_{m}^{0}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})-h_{m}^{1}(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O})=\\kappa(l, m)\n$$\n\nas the LHS of (1.6). For instance, if $l \\mid m$ then $r=0$ and $\\kappa(l, m)=\\frac{2 m}{l}+1$.\nWe now compute the RHS of (1.6) for $m \\geq 0$, the first term of which being the integral of $\\mathrm{HRR}_{m}$ equals $\\frac{2 m+1}{l}$ by similar arguments as in the $m=0$ case above. The contribution from $\\Sigma^{\\bar{g}}$ associated with $(N, g),\\left(N, g^{2}\\right), \\cdots,\\left(N, g^{l-1}\\right)$ (resp. $(S, g)$, $\\left.\\left(S, g^{2}\\right), \\cdots,\\left(S, g^{l-1}\\right)\\right)$ in the RHS of (1.6) using (8.57) without $E$ gives, where the numerator $g^{k m}$ below is from $\\bar{g}^{m}$ of (1.6),\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{g^{k m}}{1-g^{-k}}=: \\mu_{N}(l, m)\\left(\\text { resp. } \\mu_{S}(l, m)\\right), \\quad g=e^{\\frac{2 \\pi i}{l}}\n$$\n\nClearly $\\mu_{N}(l, m)=\\mu_{S}(l, m)$ denoted by $\\mu(l, m)$. To verify (1.6) for any integers $l \\geq 2, m \\geq 0$, is the same as to show the following identity\n\n$$\n\\kappa(l, m)=\\frac{2 m+1}{l}+2 \\mu(l, m)\n$$\n\nWrite $x_{k}=g^{k}$. So $\\frac{g^{k m}}{1-g^{-k}}$ in (8.64) equals $\\frac{x_{k}^{m+1}}{x_{k}-1}$. It follows from (8.64) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nl \\cdot \\mu(l, m) & =\\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{x_{k}^{m+1}}{x_{k}-1} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{x_{k}^{m+1}-1}{x_{k}-1}+\\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{1}{x_{k}-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term of the RHS in (8.66) equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1}\\left(x_{k}^{m}+x_{k}^{m-1}+\\cdots+x_{k}+1\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{a=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} x_{k}^{a}=\\sum_{a=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1}\\left(g^{a}\\right)^{k} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{0 \\leq a \\leq m, g^{a}=1} \\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} 1+\\sum_{0 \\leq a \\leq m, g^{a} \\neq 1} \\frac{g^{a}-\\left(g^{a}\\right)^{l}}{1-g^{a}}\\left(\\text { note that } g^{l}=1\\right) \\\\\n= & (l-1) \\cdot \\#\\left\\{a \\mid 0 \\leq a \\leq m, g^{a}=1\\right\\}+(-1) \\cdot \\#\\left\\{a \\mid 0 \\leq a \\leq m, g^{a} \\neq 1\\right\\} \\\\\n= & (l-1)(1+q)+(-1)(m-q)=-m+l-1+l \\cdot q\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ is the nonnegative integer such that $m=q \\cdot l+r, 0 \\leq r<l$. In the RHS of (8.66) the second term via (8.59) reads\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} \\frac{1}{x_{k}-1}=-\\frac{l-1}{2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.67) and (8.68) into (8.66) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu(l, m) & =\\frac{1}{l}\\left[\\left(-m+l-1+l \\cdot q\\right)-\\frac{l-1}{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{l}\\left(-m+\\frac{l-1}{2}+l \\cdot q\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (8.69) the RHS of (8.65) reads as\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 m+1}{l}+2 \\mu(l, m)=1+2 q\n$$\n\nFrom $r=m-q \\cdot l$ and $r+l \\cdot n \\leq 2 m$ it follows that $n \\leq 2 q+\\frac{r}{l}$ hence $n=0,1, \\cdots$, $2 q$. So $\\kappa(l, m)$-the number of the nonnegative integers $n$ satisfying $r+l \\cdot n \\leq 2 m$, is exactly $1+2 q$. By this and (8.70) we have proved (8.65).\n\nFinally let us indicate the following fact which is of topological nature.\nProposition 8.26. The first integral of (1.6) in Theorem 1.1 is independent of the choice of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant connections on $T^{1,0}(\\Sigma) / L_{\\Sigma}, E$ and $L_{\\Sigma}$ respectively, used for computing the associated Todd form and Chern character forms in (1.6). Furthermore the similar conclusion holds for those integrals over $\\Sigma^{2}$ of (1.6).\nProof. We follow the notation in the preceding proof. From [62, Appendix B.5] we see that the \"d-exact\" objects, resulting from the difference between the characteristic forms associated with different $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant connections, can be chosen to be \" $\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right.$-invariant forms)\". We are then reduced to checking the following vanishing on the noncompact space $\\Sigma$ (for the first integral of (1.6))\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma} d Q \\wedge d \\bar{v}_{m}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $Q$ is a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant $(2 n-3)$-form. That the integrand in (8.71) is $L^{1}$ integrable is easily checked (cf. Remark 3.4).\n\nSome preparations are in order. Take a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant distance function $\\rho\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)$, i.e. $\\rho\\left(\\sigma(\\lambda)(x), \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right)=\\rho\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right), \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$, which can be constructed from a distance function on $M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ using $g_{M}$ (thus degenerate along the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbits). Let\n\n$0 \\leq \\chi_{\\varepsilon} \\leq 1$ on $\\Sigma$ be a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant $C^{\\infty}$ cut-off function: $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}(x)=1$ if $\\rho\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right) \\geq$ $2 \\varepsilon, \\chi_{\\varepsilon}(x)=0$ if $\\rho\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right) \\leq \\varepsilon$ and $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}(\\sigma(\\lambda)(x))=\\chi_{\\varepsilon}(x),\\left|d \\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right|_{G_{\\sigma, m}}=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. For the last condition we use (3.21) for $G_{a, m}$ (see also (3.14)) with the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariance of $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}$. Since the action $\\sigma$ is globally free on $\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ ( $p=p_{1}=1$ by adjusting $\\sigma$ to $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\left(l e^{i \\theta}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(l e^{i \\theta / p}\\right)$ ) and $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\subset \\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$, it follows that $D_{\\varepsilon}:=\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) / \\sigma(\\subset$ $M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma)$ is a smooth manifold with the boundary $\\partial D_{\\varepsilon}$.\n\nBack to (8.71) which equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}} d Q \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m}=\\lim _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}} \\chi_{\\varepsilon} d Q \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m} \\\\\n= & \\lim _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}} d\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon} Q\\right) \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m}-\\lim _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}}\\left(d \\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) Q \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we compute $\\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}} d\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon} Q\\right) \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m}$ on the RHS of (8.72), which equals\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{D_{\\varepsilon}} d_{M}\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon} Q\\right) \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\text {-orbit }} d \\hat{v}_{m}\\left(\\text { by } \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\text {-invariance of } \\chi_{\\varepsilon} Q\\right) \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(3.27)}{=}\\left(\\int_{\\partial D_{\\varepsilon}} \\chi_{\\varepsilon} Q\\right) \\cdot 1=0\\left(\\chi_{\\varepsilon} \\mid{ }_{\\partial D_{\\varepsilon}}=0\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the last term in (8.72), using $N_{\\varepsilon}=\\left\\{x \\in \\Sigma: \\varepsilon \\leq \\rho\\left(x, \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}\\right) \\leq 2 \\varepsilon\\right\\} / \\sigma(\\subset$ $M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma)$ as a $C^{\\infty}$ manifold with boundary, we compute (recalling $\\left|d \\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right|=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ ):\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}}\\left(d \\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) Q \\wedge d \\hat{v}_{m}=\\int_{N_{\\varepsilon}}\\left(d \\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) Q \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\text {-orbit }} d \\hat{v}_{m}=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right) v o l\\left(N_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\cdot 1 \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nas $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$ since $v o l\\left(N_{\\varepsilon}\\right)=O\\left(\\varepsilon^{2}\\right)$ in view that the real codimensin of $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}$ (resp. $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }} / \\sigma)$ in $\\Sigma$ (resp. $\\Sigma / \\sigma=M$ ) is larger or equal to 2 . The assertion (8.71) follows from (8.72), (8.73) and (8.74). To get similar conclusion for those integrals on $\\Sigma^{\\bar{g}}$, we notice that $V^{\\bar{g}}=V^{H_{k+1}}$ by (8.109) in Lemma $8.37 i$ ). It follows (cf. Lemma 8.37) that $S^{1} / H_{k+1} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$acts on $\\Sigma^{\\bar{g}} \\backslash \\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}^{\\bar{g}}$ (globally) freely, where $\\Sigma_{\\text {sing }}^{\\bar{g}}$ consists of lower dimensional strata. The remaining arguments are then similar to those from (8.72) to (8.74).\n\nWe remark that in [18] the statement and proof of the off-diagonal estimate (ODE for short) [18, Theorem 5.10, p.78] are correct but unfortunately ODE is not properly applied to the \"supertrace\" computation - i.e. to the proof of [18, Theorem 6.4, cf. (6.21) on p.98]. So the resulting index formula as stated there (cf. [18, Theorem 1.10, Corollary 1.13, Theorem 1.28]) is not entirely correct (see [19] for an erratum to [18]) unless certain conditions are imposed on the underlying CR manifolds. The misuse of ODE occurs in [18, (6.21)] where the supertrace computation involves \"pullbacks\", for which our application of ODE is not quite valid because the pullback operation may produce nontrivial endomorphisms of the bundles under consideration. Nevertheless we refer to [23] for special situations to which the original index formulas of [18] as just mentioned do apply.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# 8.4.

The formula (8.57) allows us to compare our result with that of Duistermaat [32, p.184, (14.4)]. The\n\nmain result of this section is Proposition 8.33, which proves (8.57) claimed in the last subsection.\n\nOur main references for this and the next subsections are [6] and [32].

Let $X$ be a complex manifold which plays the role as our $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$. For simplicity we assume that $X$ is K\u00e4hler. Let $E$ be a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle over $X$ with trivial Clifford action. Consider the Clifford module $\\mathcal{E} \\equiv \\mathcal{E}_{X}:=\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X \\otimes E$ with the Clifford connection obtained by twisting the Levi-Civita connection with the canonical (Chern) connection of $E$. The endomorphisms of a complex vector bundle are meant to be $\\mathbb{C}$-linear.\n\nRecall that the canonical $\\hat{A}$-genus form $\\hat{A}(X)$ and the Todd genus form $T d(X)$ of the complex manifold $X$ are defined as follows: ( $R^{+}$denotes the curvature of $\\left.T^{1,0} X\\right.$ as in $[6$, p.152])\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\hat{A}(X):=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R^{+}\\right) / 2}{\\sinh \\left[\\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R^{+}\\right) / 2\\right]}\\right)=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} R^{+}\\right) / 2}{\\sinh \\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} R^{+}\\right) / 2\\right]}\\right) \\\\\nT d(X):=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R^{+}}{1-e^{-\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R^{+}}}\\right)=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} R^{+}}{e^{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi i} R^{+}}-1}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere the above convention involving $2 \\pi$-factors is different from that in [6, p.152], cf. (8.84). Let $\\gamma_{X}$ be a biholomorphic map and an isometry on $X$. Let $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$ $\\subset X$ denote the fixed point set of $\\gamma_{X}$. Then $\\gamma_{X}$ induces a complex (bundle) endomorphism $\\gamma_{X}^{\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X}$ acting on $\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X$ over $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$. For $E$ above, assume that $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E}}$ is a holomorphic bundle map of $E$ covering the action of $\\gamma_{X}$, preserving the Hermitian metric of $E$. Together we have a bundle map $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E}}=\\gamma_{X}^{\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X} \\otimes \\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E}}$ on $\\left.\\mathcal{E}\\right|_{X \\gamma_{X}}$. Note that $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E}}$ is compatible with the Clifford action and the Clifford connection. We have the following for use in Lemma 8.28.\n\nLemma 8.27. With the notation above, there is a canonical isomorphism $j$ : $\\operatorname{End}(E) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{X}\\right)$ over $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$, where $C(X)$ denotes the real Clifford algebra of $X$.\n\nProof. We can embed $\\operatorname{End}(E)$ into $\\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X \\otimes E\\right)=\\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{X}\\right)$ by extending the action on $\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X$ identically (note that the Clifford action on $E$ is trivial by default). We denote this canonical embedding by $j$. At each point $p$ of $X^{\\gamma_{X}}, C(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{C} \\cong \\operatorname{End}\\left(\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X\\right)$ at $p$ by [6, Proposition 3.19] and the center of $\\operatorname{End}\\left(\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X\\right)$ at $p$ is $\\mathbb{C}$. It follows that $\\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X\\right)$ at $p$ is $\\mathbb{C}$, so $\\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{X}\\right) \\cong \\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\Lambda^{0, *} T^{*} X\\right) \\otimes \\operatorname{End}(E)$ at $p$ is $\\operatorname{End}(E)$ at $p$. Therefore $j$ is surjective, hence an isomorphism.\n\nLet $K^{*}$ (resp. $K_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{*}$ ) denote the dual of the canonical line bundle of $X$ (resp. $\\left.X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right)$. Let $K_{N}^{*}$ denote the dual of the complex line bundle of the $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{S}} \\mathcal{N}, 0\\right)$ forms on (the complexification of) the real normal bundle $\\mathcal{N}$ of $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$ in $X$ (cf. [32, p.153]). Let $R^{K_{N}^{*}}$ (resp. $R^{K^{*}}, R^{K_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{*}}$ ) denote the curvature operator of $K_{N}^{*}$ (resp. $\\left.K^{*}, K_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{*}\\right)$. In view of Lemma 8.27 we define a twisting complex endomorphism $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}} \\in \\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{X}\\right)$ by $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}:=j\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E}}\\right)$. Let $F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}$ (resp. $F_{0}^{E}$ ) denote the restriction\n\nof the curvature $F^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}$ (resp. $F^{E}$ ) to the fixed point submanifold $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$ as in (8.36). We then define the $\\gamma$-twisted Chern character forms in the sense of [6, pp. 194-195] (In strict conformity with [6, pp.194-195] we will define $c h_{B G V}$ later; see (8.99).):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nc h\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}, \\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}\\right) & :=\\operatorname{Str}_{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}} \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\nc h\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{E}, E\\right) & :=\\operatorname{Str}_{E}\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{E} \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{E}\\right)\\right), \\text { both on } X^{\\gamma_{X}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSee [6, p.113] for the definition of the relative supertrace $\\operatorname{Str}_{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}$ in (8.77).\nLemma 8.28. With the notation above, we have, on $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) c h\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}, \\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}\\right)=T d\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) c h\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{E}, E\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{X^{\\gamma}}^{K_{X}}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. From [6, p.152] using the K\u00e4hler assumption on $X$ it follows that\n\n$$\nF^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}=\\frac{1}{2} T r_{T^{1,0} X}\\left(R^{+}\\right)+F^{E}\n$$\n\nwhere $R^{+}\\left(=\\left(R_{X}\\right)^{+}=R_{X}^{+}\\right)$denotes the curvature of the bundle $T^{1,0} X$ (here we have identified $\\operatorname{End}(E)$ with $\\left.\\operatorname{End}_{C(X)}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{X}\\right)\\right)$ through $j$ by Lemma 8.27). Observe that we have, over $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$\n\n$$\nT r_{T^{1,0} X}\\left(R^{+}\\right)=R^{K^{*}}=R^{K_{X^{\\gamma} X}^{*}}+R^{K_{X}^{*}}\n$$\n\nBy (8.79) and (8.80) restricted to $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\right)=\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{K_{X}^{\\gamma_{X}}}}{2}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{X^{\\gamma}}^{K_{X}^{*}}}{2}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{E}\\right)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, from comparing (8.76) with (8.75) and applying to $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$ it follows that\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right)=T d\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{+}}{2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nMultiplying (Wedging) (8.82) by (8.81) gives\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\right)=T d\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{X^{\\gamma}}^{K_{X}^{*}}}{2}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} F_{0}^{E}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere we have used $\\operatorname{Tr} R_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{+}=R^{K_{X^{\\gamma_{X}}}^{*}}$. Applying $\\gamma_{X}^{E}$ (resp. $\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}:=j\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{E}\\right)$ ) to the RHS (resp. LHS) of (8.83) and then taking the supertrace, we obtain (8.78) by [6, (3.10)] and the definition of the relative supertrace in [6, p.113].\n\nThe authors Berline, Getzler and Vergne in [6, p.152] define $\\hat{A}$-genus form and Todd genus form without the factor $\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i}$ in (8.75) and (8.76): (we put the subscript \"BGV\" below)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{A}_{B G V}(X) & :=\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(\\frac{R / 2}{\\sinh [R / 2]}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{R^{+} / 2}{\\sinh \\left[R^{+} / 2\\right]}\\right) \\\\\nT d_{B G V}(X) & :=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{R^{+}}{e^{R^{+}}-1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe following Corollary will be used in the proof of Proposition 8.33, for which we write the previous lemma with some signs opposite to the ones given in (8.77) and (8.78).\nCorollary 8.29. With the notation above, we have, on $X^{\\gamma_{X}}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\quad \\tilde{A}_{B G V}\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) S t r_{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}} \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E} / \\mathcal{S}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & T d_{B G V}\\left(X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right) S t r_{E}\\left(\\gamma_{X}^{E} \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{E}\\right)\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{-R^{K_{N}^{\\gamma}}}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe are now ready to return to our situation. Recall that $M:=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ is equipped with the Hermitian metric $g_{M}$. Henceforth we assume that $g_{M}$ is K\u00e4hler. Consider the above $X$ as $V_{j}$ where $V_{j}$ is equipped with $\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\mid V_{j}$ which we warn is not $G_{a, m} \\mid V_{j}$; see the line above (8.37) and Remark 8.22 for the warning. Identify the above $\\gamma_{X}$ with $\\gamma_{k}$ (see (8.47)) which is an isometry with respect to $\\pi^{*} g_{M} \\mid V_{j}$ by Corollary 8.5. Let the above $\\mathcal{E}$ be $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$ over $V_{j}$ with the metric given in Notation 7.12, on which we see that $\\gamma_{k}$ acts as an isometry denoted by $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ (see also (8.86) below. Set $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} V_{j}=n-1, \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}=: l_{j, k}$. Let $n_{j, k}:=n-1-l_{j, k} / 2$, half the real dimension of the real normal bundle $\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}$ to $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ (resp. $\\Sigma_{j, k}$ ) in $V_{j}$ (resp. $\\Sigma$ ). Let $\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}$ denote the complex-linear transformation of $\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}$ induced by $\\gamma_{k}$; see Notation 8.30 below. Let $v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}$ denote the standard section of $\\Lambda^{2 n_{j, k}} \\mathcal{N}_{j, k}^{*}$ of unit length over $\\Sigma_{j, k}([32,(12.8)])$. For notational simplicity we frequently identify $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ with $V_{j}$. We have (cf. Notation 7.12, (8.47))\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}=\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right)\\left\\|_{V_{j}}} \\otimes \\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{\\star}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ (resp. $\\left.\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}, \\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{\\star}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}\\right)$ is the complex endomorphism induced by the action of $\\gamma_{k}$ on $\\mathcal{E}^{m}$ (resp. $\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid V_{j}, \\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{\\star}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\mid V_{j}$ ). Note that $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ is induced by $\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}}^{*}, \\alpha_{k \\circ x}\\right.$ (7.60), which equals $\\left(\\sigma_{\\alpha_{k}}^{*}, \\alpha_{k}\\right)_{x}$ if $x \\in V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$.\nNotation 8.30. The superscript (resp. subscript) \" $c$ \" is not used by [6], but here we use it to indicate a complex endomorphism. Suppose that $(V, J)$ is a real vector space of even dimension with an almost complex structure $J$. Let $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{End}(V)$ be a $J$-preserving endomorphism on $V$. Then we use $\\varphi^{c}$ or $\\varphi_{c}$ to denote the corresponding complex endomorphism on a complex space of complex dimension $\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} V$.\n\nThe symbol of $\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}$ in (8.86) which will be used for (8.95) below is understood to be\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n_{j, k}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right)=\\sigma_{2 n_{j, k}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}\\right) \\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{\\star}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}\n$$\n\ncf. [6, top two lines on p.193]. Thus we need to compute the first term in the RHS of (8.87). See Lemma 8.31 below.\n\nTo proceed, note that $\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}$ on $\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}$ can be diagonalized with eigenvalues $e^{i 2 \\theta_{l}}$, where $\\theta_{l}$ is the unique angle such that $0<\\theta_{l}<\\pi$ for $1 \\leq l \\leq n_{j, k}[32$, (12.5) on p.150] since no eigenvalue here can be 1 . We define the square root of the determinant of $\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}$ as follows [32, the middle of p.154]:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2}:=\\prod_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} e^{i \\theta_{l}}\n$$\n\nLemma 8.31. With the notation above, we compute the symbol seated in (8.87):\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n_{j, k}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid V_{j}}\\right)=2^{-n_{j, k}} \\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}\\right)\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}\n$$\n\nover $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. See the last paragraph of the proof for $v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}$.\nRemark 8.32. The authors of [6] consider general Clifford modules $\\mathcal{E}$ rather than the specific $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$. As such, they did not go further with the explicit computation as done here. Moreover our $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is not a Clifford module from the point of view of $\\Sigma$ (although $\\mathcal{E}_{M}$ is so from that of $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ ); one may think of $\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}$ as a Clifford module of transversal type.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 8.31) Write $\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}$ as $\\mathcal{N}$ and decompose $\\mathcal{N}^{*} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}=\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1} \\oplus \\mathcal{N}^{* 1,0}$. Note that $\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\in U\\left(\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}\\right)$ (meaning the action on $\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}$ induced by $\\gamma_{k}$ on $\\mathcal{N}$ ), a unitary transformation on $\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}$, extends naturally to an endomorphism $\\gamma_{k}^{\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}}$ of the exterior algebra $\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}$. By [6, p.192, Lemma 6.10] (with our Lemma 8.27 without $E$ ), along $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ we identify $\\left.\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\mid v_{j}}\\right|_{\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}}\\left(=\\right.$ the preceding $\\left.\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{-1}\\right)^{*}\\right)$ with a section of $C\\left(\\mathcal{N}^{*}\\right) \\otimes \\mathbb{C}$ corresponding to $\\gamma_{k}^{\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}} \\in \\operatorname{End}\\left(\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}\\right)$ via the isomorphism $c: C\\left(\\mathcal{N}^{*}\\right) \\otimes \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{End}\\left(\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}\\right)$ ([6, Proposition 3.19] or [32, p.37]), i.e. $\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\mid v_{j}}=c^{-1}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}}\\right)$ on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. Let $e_{l}, J e_{l}, l=1, \\cdot, n_{j, k}$ be an orthonormal basis of $\\mathcal{N}^{*}$. We claim\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*} \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M} \\mid v_{j}}=\\exp _{\\mathbb{C}} \\sum_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} \\theta_{l}\\left(e_{l} \\cdot J e_{l}+i\\right) \\in C\\left(\\mathcal{N}^{*}\\right) \\otimes \\mathbb{C}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\exp _{\\mathbb{C}}$ means the exponential [32, (4.3)]. By [32, p.37] we see that\n\n$$\nc\\left(e_{l} \\cdot J e_{l}+i\\right)=2 i e_{e_{l}-i J e_{l}} \\circ \\iota_{e_{l}}\n$$\n\non the RHS of which $e_{\\bullet}$ (resp. $\\iota_{\\bullet}$ ) means the operators taking exterior (resp. interior) product with $\\bullet$. Note that $e_{l}-i J e_{l} \\in \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}$. By acting on $e_{k}-i J e_{k}$ it follows from (8.91) that\n\n$$\nc\\left(e_{l} \\cdot J e_{l}+i\\right)\\left(e_{k}-i J e_{k}\\right)=2 i \\delta_{l k}\\left(e_{k}-i J e_{k}\\right) \\text { and hence }\n$$\n\n$$\nc\\left(\\exp _{\\mathbb{C}} \\sum_{a=1}^{n_{j, k}} \\theta_{a}\\left(e_{a} \\cdot J e_{a}+i\\right)\\right)\\left(e_{l}-i J e_{l}\\right)=e^{2 \\theta_{l} i}\\left(e_{l}-i J e_{l}\\right)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, we can easily show that $\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{-1}\\right)^{*}$ on $\\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}$ is also diagonalized with eigenvalues $e^{i 2 \\theta_{l}}$ (when $\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}$ on $\\mathcal{N}$ is diagonalized with eigenvalues $e^{i 2 \\theta_{l}}$ by our assumption lying above Lemma 8.31). So, by (8.93) the RHS of (8.90) is $\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{-1}\\right)^{*}$. To show that it is $\\gamma_{k}^{\\Lambda \\mathcal{N}^{* 0,1}}$ one computes as in (8.92), (8.93) the action on two-forms, three-forms, etc. This can be done similarly using the action (8.91). The final result gives (8.90); we omit the details (see [?]).\n\nNow by using [32, (4.3) and Subsection 4.3] we obtain\n\n$$\n\\text { The RHS of }(8.90)=\\prod_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}}\\left(\\cos \\theta_{l}+\\sin \\theta_{l} e_{l} \\cdot J e_{l}\\right) e^{i \\theta_{l}}\n$$\n\nCombining (8.90) and (8.94) we can now compute the symbol of $\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid v_{j}}$ : (After converting $e_{l} \\cdot J e_{l}$ in (8.94) into $e_{l} \\wedge J e_{l}$ and keeping the top $2 n_{j, k}$-form,)\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n_{j, k}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid v_{j}}\\right)=\\prod_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} e^{i \\theta_{l}} \\sin \\theta_{l}\\left(\\wedge_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}}\\left(e_{l} \\wedge J e_{l}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom (8.88), [32, the third formula on p.154] ${ }^{11}$ and $\\wedge_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}}\\left(e_{l} \\wedge J e_{l}\\right)=: v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}$ it is straightforward to see that\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{2 n_{j, k}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\mathcal{E}_{M}\\right) \\mid v_{j}}\\right)=\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} 2^{-n_{j, k}} \\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}\\right) v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}\n$$\n\nWe have proved (8.89).\nRewrite $\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}$ of (8.38) as $\\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j}=T_{V_{j}} F_{j, k}$ where in view of (8.47) for $\\tilde{g}$,\n\n$$\nF_{j, k}:=c_{j, k} I(\\tilde{g}) \\operatorname{Str}_{\\mathcal{E}=/ S}\\left[\\sigma_{2 n-\\left(l_{j, k}+2\\right)}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right) \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m} / S}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nWe are going to express $F_{j, k}$ in terms of the Todd and Chern character forms, where we recall (cf. (8.46))\n\n$$\nI(\\tilde{g})=\\frac{\\dot{A}_{B G V}\\left(T \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma \\tilde{g}}, g_{q u o t}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1}\\right) \\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\nUsing Lemma 8.31 we now come to the main result of this section and prove (8.57) above. Recall the notation $T_{V_{j}}$ in (8.38) but for the sake of clarity we will write $T_{V_{j}} \\mid{ }_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ instead of $T_{V_{j}}$ to denote the Berezin integral of the bundle $\\left.T V_{j}\\right|_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ (see also the line after (8.106)) and to get a function on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. This notation $T_{V_{j}} \\mid V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ is not to be confused with $T_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ below.\n\nProposition 8.33. With the notation above and $g_{M}$ being K\u00e4hler, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{F}_{k, m}^{j} \\equiv T_{V_{j}} \\mid V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}} F_{j, k}= \\\\\n& T_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}} \\frac{T d\\left(T^{1,0} \\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} / L_{\\Sigma \\tilde{g}}, g_{q u o t}\\right) c h\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*} E \\mid v_{j}}, \\psi_{j}^{*} E \\mid v_{j}\\right) c h\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m} \\mid v_{j}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}\\left(1-\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{1}^{c} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{i}{2 \\pi} R_{c}^{1}\\right)\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{g}_{1}^{c}$ (resp. $R_{c}^{1}$ ) denotes the complex-linear transformation (resp. complex endomorphism valued curvature form) corresponding to the real transformation $\\tilde{g}_{1}$ on $\\mathcal{N} \\mid V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}$ (resp. real endomorphism valued curvature form $R^{1}$ ). Compare the remark below.\n\nRemark 8.34. For the above $R_{c}^{1}$ note that $R^{1}$ is complex linear ( $J$-linear) with respect to the complex structure $J$ by our K\u00e4hler assumption on $V_{j}$ in this subsection. Similarly $\\tilde{g}_{1}^{c}$ can be viewed as an $n_{j, k} \\times n_{j, k}$ complex matrix, $n_{j, k}=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{N}$.\nProof. (of Proposition 8.33) By (8.87), (8.89) of Lemma 8.31 and noting that $\\tilde{g}_{1}=$ $\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}$ along $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ since $\\sigma(\\tilde{g})=\\gamma_{k}$ on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ by (8.47) or (8.19), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{2 n-\\left(l_{j, k}+2\\right)}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\mathcal{E}^{m}}\\right)}{\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1}\\right)}=2^{-n_{j, k}}\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}} \\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\mid v_{j}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting (8.98) into (8.95) with $I(\\tilde{g})$ in (8.96) and making use of (8.85) with $X=V_{j}$, we get, by setting (compare (8.77) and (8.84) for the subscripts \" $B G V$ \" below; the difference between them involves multiplicative factors $\\frac{i}{2 \\pi}$ )\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Str}_{E^{\\prime}}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{E^{\\prime}} \\exp \\left(-F_{0}^{E^{\\prime}}\\right)\\right)=: c h_{B G V}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{E^{\\prime}}, E^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ To avoid possible confusion, we record this formula as follows (in the notation of [32]):\n\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{det}\\left(1-\\gamma_{N}\\right)^{-1 / 2}=\\left(2^{l} \\prod_{j=n-l+1}^{n} \\sin \\theta_{j}\\right)^{-1}\n    $$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{j, k}= & c_{j, k} \\frac{2^{-n_{j, k}}\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{c, k}}}{\\operatorname{det}^{1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)} \\\\\n& \\cdot T d_{B G V}\\left(V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\right) c h_{B G V}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{E^{\\prime}}, E^{\\prime}\\right) \\exp \\left(\\frac{-R^{K_{N}^{\\prime}}}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $E^{\\prime}=\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right|_{V_{j}}$. Here $n_{j, k}=n-1-l_{j, k} / 2$ as before. The main computation of this proposition is the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{det}^{-1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right) i^{-n_{j, k}}\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} R^{K_{N}^{\\prime}}} \\\\\n= & \\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(1-\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{1}^{c} \\exp \\left(R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)\\right)\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBefore we proceed, a warning is in order. With the square root $\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2}$ chosen by (8.88), special care should be taken when using the usual rules for further computation or else an unwanted minus sign for (8.101) may occur in the end ${ }^{12}$. To show (8.101) we may assume that both $\\left(\\tilde{g}^{-1}\\right)_{1}^{c}$ and $R_{c}^{1}$ are simultaniously diagonalized with respective eigenvalues $e^{-2 i \\theta_{l}}$ (this being consistent with the lines above (8.88) as $\\tilde{g}=g_{k}, \\gamma_{k}$ here) and $R_{c, l}^{1}$ (which are two-forms) for $1 \\leq l \\leq n_{j, k}$ (cf. [32, second paragraph on p.167]). Note that $R^{K_{N}^{\\prime}}=\\operatorname{Tr} R_{c}^{1}=\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} R_{c, l}^{1}$. Observe that the $l$ th real $2 \\times 2$ matrix block of $\\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)$ corresponding to $\\exp \\left(-R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)$ reads as (noting that $R_{c, l}^{1}$ is purely imaginary)\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cos i R_{c, l}^{1} & \\sin i R_{c, l}^{1} \\\\\n-\\sin i R_{c, l}^{1} & \\cos i R_{c, l}^{1}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing [32, p.154] or Footnote ${ }^{11}$ in the proof of Lemma 8.31, and (8.102) it is not difficult to show that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}^{-1 / 2}\\left(1-\\tilde{g}_{1} \\exp \\left(-R^{1}\\right)\\right)=\\prod_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} \\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\left(\\theta_{l}+\\frac{1}{2} i R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)}\n$$\n\nand that by $(8.88)$\n\n$$\n\\left(\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\gamma_{k}\\right)_{1}^{c}\\right)^{1 / 2} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} R^{K_{N}^{\\prime}}}=\\prod_{l=1}^{n_{j, k}} e^{i\\left(\\theta_{l}+\\frac{1}{2} i R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThus by (8.103) and (8.104) to show (8.101) is reduced to verifying\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\left(\\theta_{l}+\\frac{1}{2} i R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)} i^{-1} e^{i\\left(\\theta_{l}+\\frac{1}{2} i R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)}=\\frac{1}{1-e^{-2 i\\left(\\theta_{l}+\\frac{1}{2} i R_{c, l}^{1}\\right)}}\n$$\n\nfor each $l$. Now (8.105) holds true by a direct computation, proving (8.101).\nSubstituting (8.101) into (8.100) and noting that $c_{j, k}=(2 \\pi i)^{-l_{j, k} / 2} 2^{n_{j, k}}(-i)^{n_{j, k}}$, $(-i)^{n_{j, k}}=i^{-n_{j, k}}$, we reduce (8.100) to\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nF_{j, k}=(2 \\pi i)^{-l_{j, k} / 2} \\\\\n\\underbrace{T d_{B G V}\\left(V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}\\right) c h_{B G V}\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{E_{j}^{\\prime}}\\right) E_{v_{k}}^{E_{j}^{\\prime}} \\otimes \\gamma_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}^{\\prime}}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{c}\\right)^{\\otimes m} \\otimes \\gamma_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}^{\\prime}}}_{{ }^{c}}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{c}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\left[V_{j}\\right] v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}} \\cdot \\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(E \\otimes\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{c}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\left[V_{j}\\right] v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ For the related computations, see [32, p.156]. However, the treatment there does not quite lead to the conclusion here because the sign issue as warned above was not dealt with in sufficient details and the opposite sign seems to occur there. It is desirable to carry out the computation of our own to ensure the ultimately correct sign.\n\nby (8.86). We now see from (8.106) that taking $\\left.T_{V_{j}}\\right|_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ of $F_{j, k}$ is the same as taking $T_{V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}}$ of $F_{j, k} / v o l_{\\mathcal{N}_{j, k}}$. The factor $(2 \\pi i)^{-l_{j, k} / 2}\\left(l_{j, k}=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}} X^{\\gamma_{X}}\\right)$ is absorbed when one changes the curvature form by a multiple $\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i}$ so that the above subscripts \" $B G V$ \" drop out. Also note that $g_{\\text {quot }}$ is identified with $\\pi^{*} g_{M}$ restricted to $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. Altogether, with the multiplicative property of the $\\gamma$-twisted Chern character forms (this property can be checked by the trace formula for tensor product [32, (11.2) on p.133] and by using simultaneous diagonalization [32, p.167]), we conclude (8.97). Here note that $c h\\left(\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}} \\mid V_{j},\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{V_{j}}\\right)=c h\\left(\\left.\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{V_{j}}\\right)$ on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ because it is not difficult to see via definitions that $\\gamma_{k}^{\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}} \\mid V_{j}$ on $V_{j}^{\\gamma_{k}}$ is the identity action.\n\nRemark 8.35. Duistermaat's formula [32, (11.17) on p.144] in the statement of his Theorem 11.1 seems not to be consistent with the usual form of the index theorem due to his possibly wrong sign for $R^{L}$ involved in the Chern character term $c h(L)$ (after the replacement $R^{L} \\rightarrow R^{L} / 2 \\pi i$, cf. [32, p.145]). Similar confusion occurs also for the sign of $\\frac{1}{2} R^{K^{*}}$ in the same formula because the term $-\\frac{1}{2} R^{K^{*}}$ is needed for\n$\\left(\\operatorname{det} \\frac{1-e^{-R}}{R}\\right)^{-1 / 2} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{1}{2} R^{K^{*}}}=\\operatorname{det} \\varepsilon \\frac{R}{e^{R}-1}\\left(=\\operatorname{det} \\frac{R_{c}}{e^{R_{c}}-1}\\right.$ in our notation above $\\left.)\\right)$\nto give the usual Todd class term after the replacement $R \\rightarrow \\frac{R}{2 \\pi i}$ (at least for the K\u00e4hler case).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 8.5. Comparison with Duistermaat's orbifold version of the index theo- \n\nrem, Part II: integrals over fixed point orbifolds. In comparison with [32, Theorem 14.1 on p.184] we take $M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$, a compact complex orbifold by Theorem 2.3. For simplicity we assume no extra $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over $\\Sigma$ i.e. no extra complex orbifold vector bundle $L$ over $M$ in [32, Theorem 14.1 on p.184]. To see what $\\tilde{F}$ in the notation of [32, pp. 184, 180] is, we take $\\gamma_{V}=I d$ in [32, p.180]. Recalling the chart $W_{j}=V_{j} \\times\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$of $\\Sigma$ (see the paragraph preceding (8.2)), the local orbifold structure group $H=G_{j}$, a finite cyclic subgroup of $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ acts on the orbifold chart $V_{j}=: V$ through (8.3) for which recall that $\\pi_{V_{j}}$ plays no role as shown in Proposition 8.4 iii), i.e. $\\gamma_{k}^{-1}=$ $\\sigma\\left(g_{k}^{-1}\\right)$ on $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ for any $g_{k} \\in H=G_{j}$. Let $g_{0} \\in H$ be a generator of order $N+1=N_{j}+1$ thus $g_{0}^{N+1}=1$.\n\nTake an element $\\tilde{g} \\in H, \\tilde{g} \\neq 1$. Consider $V^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{\\tilde{g}\\} \\subset \\tilde{V}$ in [32, p.180] with the action $(v, \\tilde{g}) \\rightarrow(\\sigma(a) v, \\tilde{g})$ for $a \\in H$ (note that the action of $H$ preserves $V$ ) arising from the original action in [32, p.180] (since $H$ is abelian and $\\gamma_{V}=I d$ in our case). Piece together these (local) $\\left(V^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{\\tilde{g}\\}\\right) / H \\cong V^{\\tilde{g}} / H$ (here the subscript $j$ omitted already) to form a \"fixed point\" orbifold $\\tilde{F}$ as in [32, p.180] with the embedding $\\tilde{F}$ $\\subset M$ in our case. We assume that $\\tilde{F}$ is the only connected component (otherwise just take a connected component of it). We need an explicit description of the orbit type stratification for $(V, H)$ [32, p.174]. Let $H^{\\prime} \\subset H$ be a subgroup of $H$. Let $V^{H^{\\prime}}$ $\\subset V$ denote the set of points fixed by $H^{\\prime}$. For a point $v \\in V$ let $H_{v}$ denote the isotropy subgroup at $v$.\n\nLemma 8.36. With the notation above (and $V_{j}$ possibly shrinked), there are unique subgroups $H_{l}$ of $H, l=0,1, \\cdots, K$, with the properties $i$ ) $H_{0}:=\\{1\\} \\subset H_{1} \\subset \\cdots$ $\\subset H_{K-1} \\subset H_{K}:=H$; ii) for $v \\in V^{H_{l}} \\backslash V^{H_{l+1}} H_{v}=H_{l}\\left(V^{H_{K+1}}:=\\emptyset\\right)$.\n\nProof. By the orbit type stratification [32, pp. 174-175] two points $x, y \\in V$ belong to the same orbit type if $H_{x}=H_{y}$ since $H$ is Abelian. Let $S_{l}$ be the set of points having the same isotropy subgroup which we denote by $H_{l}$. Then the stratification structure in [32] gives, possibly after shrinking $V$, the orbit type stratification (OTS for short)\n\n$$\nV=\\bar{S}_{0} \\supset \\bar{S}_{1} \\supset \\cdots \\supset \\bar{S}_{K}=\\left\\{x \\in V: H_{x}=H\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor some sequence $\\bar{S}_{l}=S_{l} \\cup S_{l+1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup S_{K}, l=0,1, \\cdots, K . i)$ follows. For $i i$ ) observe that\n\n$$\nV^{H_{l}}=\\bar{S}_{l}\n$$\n\nso $V^{H_{l}} \\backslash V^{H_{l+1}}=S_{l}$. From this and the definition of $S_{l}$, the statement $i i$ ) follows.\n\nLet $H_{i}, H_{0} \\subset H_{1} \\subset H_{2} \\subset \\cdots \\subset H$, be the sequence of (finitely many) isotropy subgroups of $H$ as in the OTS given in the proof of Lemma 8.36, and $V^{H_{i}} \\subset V$ the set of points fixed by $H_{i}$ so $V^{H_{l}} \\supset V^{H_{2}} \\supset \\cdots \\supset V^{H}$. Let $<\\tilde{g}>\\subset H$ denote the subgroup generated by $\\tilde{g}$, and $H_{V^{\\tilde{g}}} \\subset H$ the subgroup of $H$ consisting of elements which act on $V^{\\tilde{g}}\\left(=V^{<\\tilde{g}>}\\right)$ as the identity.\n\nLemma 8.37.

For some $k,<\\tilde{g}>\\subset H_{k+1}$ and $<\\tilde{g}>\\not \\subset H_{k}$. We now claim $V^{\\tilde{g}}=V^{H_{k+1}}$. That $V^{\\tilde{g}} \\supset V^{H_{k+1}}$ is obvious. If $v \\in V^{\\tilde{g}} \\backslash V^{H_{k+1}}$ then by (8.107) and (8.108) $v \\in V^{H_{i^{\\prime}}} \\backslash V^{H_{i^{\\prime}+1}}$ for some $i^{\\prime} \\leq k$, and one has the isotropy subgroup $H_{v}=H_{i^{\\prime}} \\subset$ $H_{k}$ by Lemma 8.36 ii). Clearly $<\\tilde{g}>\\subset H_{v}$ hence $<\\tilde{g}>\\subset H_{k}$ contradicts the choice of $k$. Thus $V^{\\tilde{g}} \\backslash V^{H_{k+1}}=\\emptyset$ namely $V^{\\tilde{g}} \\subset V^{H_{k+1}}$. We have shown (8.109). ii) follows from (8.109) and Lemma 8.36 ii). iii) follows from $i$ ) and $i i$ ).\n\nFor generic $v \\in V^{\\tilde{g}}$ we have $H_{v}=H_{k+1}$ by Lemma 8.37 ii), which is the largest subgroup that acts trivially on $V^{\\tilde{g}}=V^{H_{k+1}}$ (by (8.109)) by Lemma 8.37 iii). It follows that the multiplicity $m(\\tilde{F})$ of $\\tilde{F}[32$, p. 175 with $S=\\tilde{F}]$ reads as ( $j$ below denotes our chart index)\n\n$$\nm(\\tilde{F})=\\# H_{V^{\\tilde{g}}}=\\# H_{v}=\\# H_{k+1}=: \\frac{N_{j}+1}{h_{j}}\n$$\n\n$\\# H_{k+1} \\mid N_{j}+1$ so $h_{j}=h_{j}\\left(H_{k+1}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (originally dependent on $\\tilde{g}$ ). Note that according to $\\left[32\\right.$, p.175] $m(\\tilde{F})$ is independent of local data $\\left(h_{j}, N_{j}\\right)^{13}$. Let\n\n$$\n\\tilde{F}_{j}:=\\tilde{F} \\cap\\left[\\left(\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap W_{j}\\right) / \\sigma\\right] \\subset M\n$$\n\nwhich equals $\\Sigma_{j, l} / \\sigma=V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} / H$, cf. (8.9) for $\\Sigma_{j, l}$ with $\\tilde{g}=g_{0}^{l}$ and $H$ stands for the local orbifold structure group $G_{j}$. So we can express the integral in $[32,(14.3)$ on p.184] via (8.110) and (8.109) as follows (cf. [32, (14.1) on p.175]) provided that the integrand $(\\cdot)$ below has certain \"descent property\":\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\tilde{F}_{j}}(\\cdot)=\\frac{1}{h_{j}} \\int_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}(\\cdot) \\text { and equals } \\frac{1}{h_{j}\\left(H_{k+1}\\right)} \\int_{V_{j}^{\\mu_{k+1}}}(\\cdot)\n$$\n\nRecall (cf. (8.44)) that $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ denotes the set of points fixed by $\\tilde{g} \\in S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ on $\\Sigma$. Let $\\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}:=\\left|\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)\\right|,|\\cdots|$ meaning the support (without multiplicity), cf. Remark 8.12. Remark that $\\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}$ is not necessarily $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}} \\cap W_{j}$ since the \"angle part\" of $W_{j}$ is restricted to $\\left(-\\varepsilon_{j}, \\varepsilon_{j}\\right)$. The following technical lemma is crucial:\nLemma 8.38. With the notation above and $\\tilde{g} \\in G_{j}(\\widetilde{g}=1$ allowed), it holds that $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\left(0, \\frac{2 \\pi}{N_{j}+1}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+}$is diffeomorphic to $\\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\backslash\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right) \\subset \\Sigma$.\n\nProof. Write $\\tilde{g}=g_{0}^{l}$ for some $l$ between 0 and $N_{j}, g_{0}=e^{2 \\pi i /\\left(N_{j}+1\\right)}$. Observe that $\\sigma\\left(g_{0}\\right)$ leaves $V_{j} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ set-invariant by Lemma 8.8 and hence leaves $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times$ $\\{1\\}$ set-invariant. Define the map $\\Psi:[0,2 \\pi) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\times\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left|\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\right.\\right.$ $\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}) \\mid$ by\n\n$$\n\\Psi(\\phi, r,\\{p\\} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\})=\\left(r e^{i \\phi}\\right) \\circ(\\{p\\} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}) \\in \\Sigma\n$$\n\nWe claim that $\\Psi$ maps $\\left(0, \\frac{2 \\pi}{N_{j}+1}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\times\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)$ into $\\left|\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\right.\\right.$ $\\{1\\}) \\mid \\backslash\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)$ and is an embedding. To show this, suppose that there are $\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2} \\in\\left(0, \\frac{2 \\pi}{N_{j}+1}\\right)$ and two points $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}$ such that $e^{i \\phi_{1}} x_{1}=e^{i \\phi_{2}} x_{2}$. So $e^{i\\left(\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}\\right)} x_{1}=x_{2}$ and hence $\\pi\\left(x_{1}\\right)=\\pi\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\in M=\\Sigma / \\sigma$ where $\\pi: \\Sigma \\rightarrow M$ is the natural projection. That $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ represent the same orbifold point implies that $h x_{1}=x_{2}$ for some $h \\in H=G_{j}$ (via Theorem 2.3). It follows that $e^{i\\left(\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{1}\\right)} h x_{1}$ $=x_{1}$ so $e^{i\\left(\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{1}\\right)} h \\in G_{j}$. Hence we write $e^{i\\left(\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{1}\\right)}=g_{0}^{l^{\\prime}} \\in G_{j}$. But this yields a contradiction since $0 \\leq\\left|\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}\\right|<\\frac{2 \\pi}{N_{j}+1}=\\arg g_{0}$, unless $\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}=0$ which gives $x_{1}=x_{2}$. This implies the embedding part of the claim. Using $\\phi_{2}=0$ the similar argument yields the into part of the claim. Moreover $\\Psi$ is indeed a diffeomorphism\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ In our context this independence can be seen as follows. Denote $H_{v}$ by $H_{v}^{(j)}$ to indicate the dependence on the chart $W_{j}$. We claim that given $\\tilde{g}$ one has\n\n    $$\n    H_{v}^{(j)}=H_{v}^{(l)}\n    $$\n\n    for $v \\in W_{j} \\cap W_{l} \\cap V^{\\tilde{g}}$.

On the other hand $\\tilde{H}_{v} \\subset G_{j}$ for $v \\in W_{j}$ since $G_{j}$ is the local orbifold structure group, giving that $\\tilde{H}_{v} \\subset H_{v}^{(j)}$ from the definition of $H_{v}^{(j)}$. Similarly we also have $H_{v}^{(l)}=\\tilde{H}_{v}$, giving (8.111). Now by (8.111) and (8.110) once $\\tilde{g}$ is chosen, then\n\n    $$\n    \\left(N_{j}+1\\right) / h_{j}=\\left(N_{l}+1\\right) / h_{l}\n    $$\n\n    for different charts $W_{j}$ and $W_{l}$.

For the orbifold charts $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}$ of the fixed point orbifold $\\tilde{F}(\\subset M)$, we now take $\\bar{\\chi}_{j}$ a partition of unity of $\\tilde{F}$ subordinated to $V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} / H\\left(=\\tilde{F}_{j}\\right)$ covering $\\tilde{F}$ (for the existence of $\\bar{\\chi}_{j}$, see e.g. [13, p.37] and references therein), and treat this as a \"partition of unity\" $\\left\\{\\chi_{j}(z, \\bar{z})\\right\\}_{j}$ adapted to $\\left\\{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}\\right\\}_{j}$ although $\\cup_{j} V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}=: \\tilde{V}^{\\tilde{g}}$ does not necessarily admit a manifold structure (cf. $\\cup_{j} \\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}=\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}\\left(\\supsetneqq \\tilde{V}^{\\tilde{g}}\\right)$ is a genuine submanifold of $\\Sigma$ ).\n\nTo start with the comparison with Duistermaat's formula in [32], the identification between our $H_{M}^{j}\\left(\\Sigma, \\mathcal{O}_{\\Sigma}\\right)$ for $m=0$ and his $H^{q}\\left(M, \\mathcal{O}_{M}\\right)$ is immediate via (10.30) and Remark 10.10. The case where an extra $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle $E \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ is present yields no essential problem; the details are omitted. Now we are going to devote ourselves to comparing the integral formulas given in the RHS of the index theorems. Setting $m=0$ in (8.54) (for $m \\neq 0$ see Remark 8.42) we compute: For the below $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ means the fixed point set of $\\tilde{g}, \\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}=$ $\\left|\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)\\right|$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}, 0}$ in the LHS of (8.54) is rewritten as $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}(x) d v_{\\Sigma \\tilde{s}, 0} \\stackrel{\\text { Cor. } \\mathbf{8} \\cdot 18}{=} \\sum_{j} \\int_{\\Sigma_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}} \\chi_{j}(z, \\bar{z}) \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}(z, \\bar{z}) d v_{\\Sigma \\tilde{s}, 0} \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(8.115)}{=} \\sum_{j} \\frac{1}{N_{j}+1} \\int_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}} \\chi_{j}(z, \\bar{z}) \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}(z, \\bar{z}) d \\tilde{v}_{V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}}}(z) \\text { (see also Cor. 8.20) } \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(8.114)}{=} \\sum_{j} \\frac{1}{N_{j}+1} h_{j} \\int_{\\tilde{F}_{j}} \\bar{\\chi}_{j} \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}} d v_{\\tilde{F}_{j}} \\quad \\text { (see remarks below) } \\\\\n& \\stackrel{(8.110)}{=}(8.112) \\frac{1}{m(\\tilde{F})} \\int_{\\tilde{F}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}(x) d v_{\\tilde{F}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ For any $z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ written as $z=r e^{2 \\pi m i /\\left(N_{j}+1\\right)} e^{i \\delta}$ with $0 \\leq m \\leq N_{j}$ and $0 \\leq \\delta<\\frac{2 \\pi}{N_{j}+1}$, via the observation mentioned earlier in the proof one sees that $\\left|z \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}\\right)\\right|=\\left|r e^{i \\delta} \\circ\\left(V_{j}^{\\tilde{g}} \\times\\right.\\right.$ $\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}| |$, which implies the claim.\n    ${ }^{15}$ The $w$-coordinates here may be changing all the time, i.e. the choice of $w$ is $p$-dependent for $p \\in V_{j}$ when using Lemma $8.21 i i$ ). This dependence however yields no big problem in applying Fubini's theorem: Imaging that one is integrating over a fibre bundle $E \\rightarrow B$, one can first do so on each fibres $E_{t}$, for which the choice of coordinates on $E_{t}$ is immaterial. The situation here is similar (with the support of $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-orbits playing the role of fibres $E_{t}$ ).\n\nHere for using (8.114) above one requires the descent property of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}$ (and $\\chi_{j}$ ) that $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}$ be invariant under the action of $H=G_{j} \\subset S^{1}$, which holds as seen in Corollary 8.20. By (8.116) we can now identify terms (with $m=0$ ) in (1.6) with those in [32, (14.3) on p. 184 for the case $\\gamma=\\mathrm{Id}]$ and identify our $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}$ in (8.116) with the characteristic class $\\alpha_{\\tilde{F}}$ of Duistermaat in [32, (14.4)] (using (8.57) and Corollary 8.20), modulo certain sign differences between $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tilde{g}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\tilde{F}}$. These sign issues are discussed in the following remark.\n\nRemark 8.40. The definition of the Todd class given in [32, p.163] is basically $\\operatorname{det}_{\\mathbb{C}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\Omega /\\left(1-e^{-(i / 2 \\pi) \\Omega}\\right)\\right)$ which is indeed consistent with the usual definition of the Todd class provided that $\\Omega$ is put in the form of curvature (at least for the K\u00e4hler case). Unfortunately, Duistermaat points out that the matrix of $R$ (cf. [32, p.54]) is equal to minus the matrix of $\\Omega$ [32, p.160], which seems to render his Todd class different from the usual one. Duistermaat's adoption of such an opposite sign convention above is explained by himself in [32, pp. 56-57] where his remarks end up with \"This is one of the numerous sources of sign confusion in differential geometry . . .\". In spite of his effort for clarification, his Proposition 13.1 [32, p.163], which is based on [32, (11.17)], seems to be confusing in view of the remark above and of the previous Remark 8.35. The similar can be said with his orbifold version of the index theorem [32, Theorem 14.1 on p.184], which is based on his Proposition 13.1 (via his Proposition 13.2). Given these confusions, if Duistermaat's characteristic classes were presumed to be the same as the usual ones (as ours here), then his written form of the orbifold index theorem [32, Theorem 14.1] would agree with that of ours as shown in our proof above.\n\nRemark 8.41. For a slight simplification, recalling that by (8.116) it is going to be summing over $\\tilde{F}^{\\prime} s$ with each $\\tilde{F}$ associated with $\\tilde{g}=g_{0}^{k}, k=1, \\cdots, N$, one can first group those $\\tilde{g}^{\\prime} s$ with the same $V^{H_{k+1}}$ (see Lemma 8.37) associated to $H_{0} \\subset H_{1} \\subset$ $\\cdots \\subset H_{k+1} \\subset \\cdots \\subset H$ in the OTS (see the proof of Lemma 8.36) and then group this summation over \"types $V^{H_{k+1}} / H$ \" (with integrands still $\\tilde{g}$-dependent).\n\nRemark 8.42. ( $m>0$ case) In the previous and present subsections, the comparison between the formula of Duistermaat and that of ours is most naturally set up and made when $m=0$. If $m>0$ (without the extra bundle $E \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ as before), our formula (1.6) involves extra factors $\\tilde{g}^{m}$ (for integrals over $\\Sigma^{\\tilde{g}}$ ). Using Remark 10.10 this $m$-index on $\\Sigma$ can be converted to a natural index problem with the additional (orbifold) line bundle $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ (let us call this 0 -index for short) on the orbifold $M$; compare Example 8.25. After reaching such a reduction, one can alternatively use Duistermaat's formula for this 0 -index computation. By similar computations as in this subsection (for $m=0$ above), it turns out that the relevant term $\\lambda_{\\tilde{L}} c h(\\tilde{L})$ in [32, (14.4) on p.184] due to the extra bundle $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ (i.e. $L$ of [32] is $\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ viewed as an orbifold line bundle on $M$ via descent from $\\Sigma$ ) produces the contribution similar to that of the term $\\tilde{g}^{m} c h\\left(\\psi_{j}^{*}\\left(L_{\\Sigma}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m} \\mid V_{j}\\right)$ in our formula (1.6) where we have (8.57) inserted; here the agreement between $\\tilde{g}^{m}$ and $\\lambda_{\\tilde{L}}$ is from (3.2) and [32, the second paragraph of Section 14.5]. At this point the two formulas yield the same answer.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 9.

Suppose that $M$ is a manifold with a smooth $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{M}$. Then it is impossible to extend $\\sigma_{M}$ to a smooth map $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M}$ of (9.1) unless the action $\\sigma_{M}$ is trivial.\n\nLet us examine the simplest case: the topological group $G:=\\mathbb{R}^{+}$. Let $M$ be a topological space with a continuous $G$-action. Recall that a compactification of a topological Hausdorff space $X$ is a pair $(\\bar{X}, h)$ consisting of a compact Hausdorff space $\\bar{X}$ and a homeomorphism $h$ of $X$ onto a dense subset of $\\bar{X}$ (see [31, p.242]). We often view $X$ as a subspace of $\\bar{X}$ by identifying $X$ with $h(X) \\subset \\bar{X}$.\n\nProposition 9.2. Suppose that the topological group $G$ is $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$and that $M$ is a topological space with a continuous $G$-action $\\phi$. Let $\\bar{G}$ be any compactification of $G$ in the sense above ( $\\bar{G}$ need not be a topological group), such that $\\bar{G} \\backslash G$ is a countable set.

This implies that $\\operatorname{dim} G_{0} \\geq 1$ and hence $G_{0}=G$ since $\\operatorname{dim} G$ $=1$. We have shown that the isotropy subgroup of any $x \\in M$ is $G$; this amounts to the triviality of the action $\\phi$.\n\nProof. (of Proposition 9.1) Clearly this proposition follows immediately from Proposition 9.2.\n\nWe say that the holomorphic action $\\sigma_{M}$ extends pointwise holomorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ if for any point $p \\in M$, there is a holomorphic map $\\varphi: \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times\\{p\\} \\rightarrow M$ such that\n\n$$\n\\varphi(\\lambda, p)=\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda, p)\n$$\n\nfor $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$.\nBy Proposition 9.2 there is even no continuous extension of a nontrivial holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M \\rightarrow M$. However, the meromorphic extension does possibly exist. We say that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$ if $\\sigma_{M}$ extends to a meromorphic map $\\bar{\\sigma}_{M}: \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M-\\cdot->M$ (in the sense of Remmert [39]). Note that the singular set of a meromorphic map is of complex codimension $\\geq 2$ ([39]). See Remark 9.6 below for examples of meromorphic extension.\n\nIn the remaining of this section we mainly assume that the meromorphic extension exists. Let $\\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}$ on $M$ denote the holomorphic vector bundle of holomorphic $p$-forms. $\\sigma_{M}$ induces a holomorphic action on $\\Omega^{p}$ by pulling back. Let $H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$ denote the space of all global holomorphic $p$-forms.\n\nNotation 9.4. Let $H_{k}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$ or $H_{k, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$ denote the space of all global holomorphic $p$-forms $\\omega$ such that $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)^{*}(\\omega)=\\lambda^{k} \\omega, \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ where $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda): M \\rightarrow M$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)(p):=\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda, p)\n$$\n\nHere there is no need to talk about any regularity condition as in Definition 2.8.\nProposition 9.5. . With the notation as above, suppose that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$. Then we have\n\n$$\nH_{k}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)=\\{0\\} \\text { for } k \\neq 0 ; H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)=H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)\\left(=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\omega \\in H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{\\mathrm{p}}\\right)$. Since $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically, its pullback $\\sigma_{M}^{*} \\omega$ on $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times M$ (may contain the factor $d \\lambda$ ) extends to a holomorphic $p$-form on $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times$ $M$ by Hartogs' theorem (e.g. [39, p.81]). In particular, the parameter $\\lambda$ in the\n\nholomorphic $p$-form $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)^{*} \\omega$ on $M$ (see (9.6)) extends holomorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$. One is thus allowed to expand $\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega$ near $\\lambda=0$ to get\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{k} \\omega_{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{k} \\in H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ does not depend on $\\lambda$. Then, combining\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{k} \\zeta^{k} \\omega_{k} & =\\sigma_{M}\\left((\\lambda \\zeta)^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega \\stackrel{(9.8)}{=} \\sigma_{M}\\left(\\zeta^{-1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{k} \\omega_{k}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{k}\\left(\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\zeta^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega_{k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith (9.8), we have\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\zeta^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega_{k}=\\zeta^{k} \\omega_{k}\n$$\n\ni.e., $\\omega_{k} \\in H^{0}{ }_{+}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$. For $k>0$, the LHS of (9.9) is finite as $\\zeta \\rightarrow \\infty$ and the RHS goes to infinity (unless $\\omega_{k}=0$ ). We conclude that $\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\omega=\\omega_{0}$ in (9.8). This yields that $\\omega$ is $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant. Now that $\\omega \\in H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ is arbitrarily chosen, we are led to (9.7).\n\nRemark 9.6. (Examples for the meromorphic extension) The assumption that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$ in Proposition 9.5 holds for any compact K\u00e4hler manifold $M$ with $\\sigma_{M}$ having a fixed point (on $M$ ). For, by [76, Proposition II] $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ (through $\\sigma_{M}$ ) acts projectively on $M$. By [76, Lemma II-B] for $Y=X=M$, $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\hat{\\sigma}_{M}: \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M-\\cdot->M$. Another natural class of examples consists of $M$ that is algebraic and $\\sigma_{M}$ that is an algebraic action. Then $\\sigma_{M}$ automatically extends to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$ meromorphically. See, e.g., [9, p.777] and Remark 9.15 below.\n\nProposition 9.5 has an application to the study of $S^{1}$-action on a complex manifold $M$ via biholomorphisms. Denote such an action by $\\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}: S^{1} \\times M \\rightarrow M$. Assume that we can pass $\\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}$ to a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{M}^{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}: \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times M \\rightarrow M$. This $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ extension follows automatically if $M$ is compact (cf. [14, p. 50]). For an integer $k$, we define $H_{k, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ to be the space of all holomorphic $p$-forms $\\omega$ such that $\\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}\\left(e^{i \\vartheta}\\right)^{*} \\omega=e^{i k \\vartheta} \\omega$. By Remark 9.6, if $M$ is algebraic with an algebraic action $\\sigma_{M}^{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}$, then $\\sigma_{M}^{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}$ admits a meromorphic extension on $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$.\n\nThe following result might be known to the experts, but we are unable to find a precise reference.\n\nCorollary 9.7. With the notation above, suppose that $\\sigma_{M}^{\\mathbb{C}^{*}}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$. Then we have\n\n$$\nH_{k, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=0 \\text { for } k \\neq 0 ; H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Observe that $H_{k, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) \\subset H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) \\subset H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{S^{1}}}^{0}(M$, $\\left.\\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ by Proposition 9.5, and hence (9.10).\n\nAs another application of Proposition 9.5, we now want to relate Proposition 9.5 to [14, Corollary IV]. The main result is Proposition 9.10 below.\n\nSome preparations are in order. Denote $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) \\circ x$ by $\\lambda \\circ x$. Suppose that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\hat{\\sigma}_{M}: \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M-\\ldots>M$. Then $\\sigma_{M}$ extends pointwise holomorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1}$, i.e. (in particular) $\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda \\circ x$ exists for any fixed $x \\in M$ (cf. [27, Lemma 2.4.1]). Moreover, the singular set of the meromorphic extension $\\hat{\\sigma}_{M}$ is contained in $\\left(\\{0\\} \\times S_{0}\\right) \\cup\\left(\\{\\infty\\} \\times S_{\\infty}\\right)$ for some subvarieties $S_{0}, S_{\\infty}$ of codimension $\\geq 1$ in $M$. Observe that\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M, 0}:=\\hat{\\sigma}_{M}(0, \\cdot): M \\backslash S_{0} \\rightarrow M\n$$\n\nis meromorphic on $M$ since $\\{0\\} \\times M \\nsubseteq\\{0\\} \\times S_{0}$ (cf. [77, pp.35-36]). So $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ is actually defined and holomorphic on $M \\backslash T$ where $T \\subset S_{0}$ is of codimension at least 2 in $M$. Denote this extension by $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}: M \\backslash T \\rightarrow M$. Note that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}=\\sigma_{M, 0}$ on $M \\backslash S_{0}$, but $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ is not defined on $S_{0} \\backslash T$ where $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$ is defined.\n\nWe define $F^{0}:=\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}(M \\backslash T)$ and $G^{0}:=\\sigma_{M, 0}\\left(M \\backslash S_{0}\\right)$. Obviously $G^{0} \\subset F^{0}$. Let $F^{\\sigma_{M}}$ be the fixed point set of $\\sigma_{M}$ on $M$, i.e. $\\left\\{x \\in M \\mid \\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) x=x, \\forall \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right\\}$. $G^{0}$ equals $\\left\\{\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda \\circ x: x \\in M \\backslash S_{0}\\right\\}$ (while the same statement for $F^{0}$ via $M \\backslash T$ may not hold, a priori) which is contained in $F^{\\sigma_{M}}$. Observe that $F^{0}$ (resp. $G^{0}$ ) is connected since $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$ (resp. $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ ) is continuous on the connected space $M \\backslash T$ (resp. $M \\backslash S_{0}$ ).\nLemma 9.8. With the notation above, it holds that (a) $G^{0}$ is a complex submanifold in $M$; (b) $G^{0} \\subset M \\backslash S_{0}$; (c) $G^{0}=F^{0}$; (d) $G^{0}$ is closed in $M$.\n\nThe proof of Lemma 9.8 is postponed below.\nDefine\n\n$$\n\\pi: M \\backslash T \\rightarrow F^{0} \\text { by } \\pi(x):=\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}(x)\n$$\n\nNote that for $x \\in M \\backslash S_{0}, \\pi(x)=\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda \\circ x$. We can extend $\\pi$ to $M$ by $\\pi(x)$ $:=\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda \\circ x \\in F^{\\sigma_{M}} \\subset M$ (cf. the pointwise holomorphic extension as mentioned earlier). Note that $\\pi$ in (9.11) is holomorphic on $M \\backslash T \\subset M$ (since $\\left.\\pi\\right|_{M \\backslash T}$ $=\\left.\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}\\right|_{M \\backslash T}$ ), yet $\\pi$ on $M$ could be discontinuous across $T$. We call $\\pi$ on $M$ a canonical extension of $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$.\nLemma 9.9. Let $\\sigma_{M}$ be a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on a complex manifold $M$ (not necessarily compact). Suppose $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M-\\ldots>M$. Then there is a linear isomorphism:\n\n$$\n\\pi^{*}: H^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\pi^{*}$ is essentially defined via the \"pullback\" of the canonical map $\\pi$ of (9.11).\nProof. For $\\omega \\in H^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right)$ (which makes sense by Lemma 9.8 (a), (c)), we can now define $\\pi^{*} \\omega$ of (9.12) to be $\\pi^{*} \\omega:=\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}^{*} \\omega \\in H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ by Hartogs' extension theorem since $T$ is of codimension at least 2 in $M$. From $\\pi=\\pi \\circ(\\sigma(\\lambda))$ on $M \\backslash S_{0}$, it follows that $\\pi^{*} \\omega=\\sigma(\\lambda)^{*}\\left(\\pi^{*} \\omega\\right)$ on a dense open subset $U_{\\lambda}$ (depending on $\\lambda$ ) of $M$ (since $\\pi$ could be discontinuous), giving that $\\pi^{*} \\omega$ is $\\sigma(\\lambda)$-invariant on $U_{\\lambda}$ hence on $M\\left(\\pi^{*} \\omega\\right.$ being globally holomorphic as just defined) i.e. $\\pi^{*} \\omega \\in H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$. The map $\\pi^{*}$ of (9.12) is now well defined.\n\nSuppose $\\pi^{*} \\omega=0$ on $M$. By $\\iota_{G^{0}}: G^{0} \\hookrightarrow M$ and $M \\backslash S_{0} \\xrightarrow{\\pi} G^{0}$ and $\\left.\\pi\\right|_{G^{0}}=I d$, one has $\\left.\\pi\\right|_{M \\backslash S_{0}} \\circ \\iota_{G^{0}}=I d$ on $G^{0}$ (note that $G^{0} \\subset M \\backslash S_{0}$ by Lemma 9.8 (b)). So (recalling that $\\omega$ is on $\\left.F^{0} \\supset G^{0}\\right) \\omega\\left.\\right|_{G^{0}}=\\iota_{G^{0}}^{*} \\pi\\left.\\right|_{M \\backslash S_{0}}^{*} \\omega\\left.\\right|_{G^{0}}=\\iota_{G^{0}}^{*}\\left(\\left.\\pi^{*} \\omega\\right)\\right|_{M \\backslash S_{0}}=0$ if\n\n$\\pi^{*} \\omega=0$, giving $\\omega=0$ on $G^{0}$. Hence $\\omega=0$ on $F^{0}\\left(=G^{0}\\right.$ by Lemma 9.8 (c)). That is, $\\pi^{*}$ of (9.12) is injective.\n\nFor the surjectivity of $\\pi^{*}$ let $\\hat{\\pi}: M \\backslash S_{0} \\rightarrow G^{0}$ be the restriction of $\\pi$ to $M \\backslash S_{0}$ $\\subset M \\backslash T$ (namely $\\hat{\\pi}=\\sigma_{M, 0}$ ). At a regular point $(\\lambda, x) \\in \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times\\left(M \\backslash S_{0}\\right)$, for $v$ $\\in T_{x} M$ one has $\\hat{\\pi}_{*} v=\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\sigma(\\lambda)_{*} v \\in T_{\\hat{\\pi}(x)} G^{0}$ (which might not hold for $\\hat{\\pi}, S$ and $G^{0}$ replaced by $\\pi, T$ and $F^{0}$ respectively). Now given $\\eta \\in H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$, that is $\\sigma(\\lambda)^{*} \\eta=\\eta\\left(\\forall \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$, this invariance yields at $x \\in M \\backslash S_{0}$ with $v_{1}, . ., v_{p} \\in T_{x}\\left(M \\backslash S_{0}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\eta_{x}\\left(v_{1}, . ., v_{p}\\right) & =\\eta_{\\lambda \\circ x}\\left(\\sigma(\\lambda)_{*} v_{1}, \\cdot \\cdot, \\sigma(\\lambda)_{*} v_{p}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\eta_{\\hat{\\pi}(x)}\\left(\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\sigma(\\lambda)_{*} v_{1}, \\cdot \\cdot, \\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\sigma(\\lambda)_{*} v_{p}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\eta_{\\hat{\\pi}(x)}\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_{*} v_{1}, \\cdot \\cdot, \\hat{\\pi}_{*} v_{p}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe equality of (9.13) amounts to asserting that $\\hat{\\pi}^{*}\\left(\\iota_{G^{0}}^{*} \\eta\\right)=\\eta$ on $M \\backslash S_{0}$. In view that $M \\backslash S_{0}$ is dense (and open) and $\\hat{\\pi}^{*}\\left(\\iota_{G^{0}}^{*} \\eta\\right)$ (and $\\eta$ ) is actually holomorphic on the whole $M$ (by $\\pi^{*}$ of (9.12)), it follows that $\\hat{\\pi}^{*}\\left(\\iota_{G^{0}}^{*} \\eta\\right)=\\eta$ holds on $M$, giving in turn that $\\pi^{*}\\left(\\iota_{F^{0}}^{*} \\eta\\right)=\\eta$ on $M \\backslash S_{0}$ thus on $M$ (or, using $G^{0}=F^{0}$ in Lemma 9.8 (c)). This amounts to yielding $\\eta \\in \\operatorname{Im} \\pi^{*}$. We have shown that $\\pi^{*}$ of (9.12) is surjective hence in turn, an isomorphism.\n\nBy Proposition 9.5 and Lemma 9.9, we immediately obtain\nProposition 9.10. (cf. [14, Corollary IV] for $M$ compact K\u00e4hler) Let $\\sigma_{M}$ be a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on a complex manifold $M$ which can be noncompact. Suppose that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M--->M$. Then we have a natural linear isomorphism:\n\n$$\nH^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right) \\simeq H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet us compare Proposition 9.10 with [14, Proposition II] where $M$ is assumed to be a connected compact K\u00e4hler manifold and $\\sigma_{M}$ has at least one fixed point. In our notation above, if $M$ is compact, the closure $\\overline{F^{0}}$ in the usual complex topology is known to be a complex subvariety of $M$ by standard argument (or, one may see this via (c), (d) of Lemma 9.8). Note that $\\overline{F^{0}}$, contained in $F^{\\sigma_{M}}$ (fixed point set), is connected. In such a special situation $\\overline{F^{0}}$ is equal/reduced to the source, denoted by $F_{1}$, as is introduced in [14, Proposition II, pp.55-56]; compare the proof of Lemma 9.8 (d) below.\n\nOur result and proof above differ from those of [14, Corollary IV] in that in [14] the complex manifold $M$ is assumed to be compact and its proof relies on the so-called invariant decomposition of $M$ (associated with the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action), which was originally discovered by A. Bialynicki-Birula in the algebraic setting (cf. [7]). The comparison mentioned above is established by the following:\nLemma 9.11. Let $M, \\sigma_{M}$ be as in Proposition 9.10 (so $M$ can be noncompact). Assume that $\\overline{F^{0}}$ is an analytic subvariety of $M$. We have $H^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right)=H^{0}\\left(\\overline{F^{0}}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right)$. Here, with $\\overline{F^{0}}$ being possibly singular $\\Omega_{\\overline{F^{0}}}^{p}$ is defined in the sense of algebraic geometry (cf. [44, Chap.II, Section 8]). In particular, for $M$ compact we obtain, together with Proposition 9.10, $H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) \\cong H^{0}\\left(F_{1}, \\Omega_{F_{1}}^{p}\\right)$ by $\\overline{F^{0}}=F_{1}$, as originally stated in $[14]$.\nRemark 9.12. In fact $F^{0}=\\overline{F^{0}}$ as can be seen in the proof of Lemma 9.8 below (for (c) that $G^{0}=F^{0}$, whose argument applies here similarly).\n\nProof. (of Lemma 9.11) The natural map $H^{0}\\left(\\overline{F^{0}}, \\Omega_{\\overline{F^{0}}}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow H^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right)$ (induced by $F^{0} \\hookrightarrow \\overline{F^{0}}$ ) is injective, so it suffices to show that every $\\omega \\in H^{0}\\left(F^{0}, \\Omega_{F^{0}}^{p}\\right)$ on $F^{0}$ can be extended to $\\overline{F^{0}}$ (hence the map is also surjective). This is in general not possible unless $\\overline{F^{0}} \\backslash F^{0}$ is of codimension $\\geq 2$ in $\\overline{F^{0}}$. We are not going to need such a codimension condition (cf. Remark 9.12). Instead, making use of Proposition 9.10 and its proof we have that $\\omega$ must be of the form $\\iota_{F^{0}}^{*} \\eta\\left(\\iota_{F^{0}}: F^{0} \\hookrightarrow M\\right)$ for a unique $\\eta \\in H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$. It is now seen that $\\iota_{\\overline{F^{0}}}^{*} \\eta\\left(\\iota_{\\overline{F^{0}}}: \\overline{F^{0}} \\hookrightarrow M\\right) \\in H^{0}\\left(\\overline{F^{0}}, \\Omega_{\\overline{F^{0}}}^{p}\\right)$ is the desired extension of $\\omega$.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 9.8) Compared to the proofs above, the proof below is less conceptual as it mostly relies on use of local coordinates. Recall $G^{0} \\subset$ the fixed point set $F^{\\sigma_{M}}$ of $\\sigma_{M}$. Near any fixed point $q$ there exists a chart $U$ of local holomorphic coordinates $\\left(w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right)$ such that if $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$, then ([14, p.56], however, see Remark 9.13 below)\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)\\left(w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right)=\\left(\\lambda^{k_{1}} w_{1}, \\cdots, \\lambda^{k_{s}} w_{s}, w_{s+1}, \\cdots, w_{t}, \\lambda^{l_{t+1}} w_{t+1}, \\cdots, \\lambda^{l_{n}} w_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor integers $k_{j}>0, l_{j}<0$ ( $s$ may be 0 and $t$ may be $n$ ) with $\\left(w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right)(q)=(0$, $\\cdots, 0)$.\n\nGiven $q \\in G^{0}$, there is a point $\\tilde{q} \\in M \\backslash S_{0}$ such that $\\sigma_{M, 0}(\\tilde{q})=q$. By $\\sigma_{M, 0}(\\tilde{q})$ $=\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda \\tilde{q}$ we assume that for some $0 \\neq \\lambda_{0} \\sim 0, \\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}$ lies in a local chart where (9.14) is valid. Without loss of generality we may assume $\\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q} \\notin S_{0}$ using $\\tilde{q} \\notin$ $S_{0}$ and analyticity. Moreover $\\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}$ has coordinates $\\left(w_{1}^{0}, \\cdots, w_{t}^{0}, 0, \\cdots, 0\\right)$, proved by contradiction using the negative power $l_{j}<0$ (compare Remark 9.13 below), and similarly $w_{s+1}^{0}=\\cdots=w_{t}^{0}=0$ by $\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda\\left(\\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}\\right)=q=(0,0, \\cdots, 0)$ and (9.14). Take an open connected neighborhood $\\tilde{V} \\subset M \\backslash S_{0}$ of $\\tilde{q}$. Then $\\sigma\\left(\\lambda_{0}\\right) \\tilde{V}\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\lambda_{0}\\right)\\right.$ is a biholomorphism of $M$ ) is an open connected neighborhood of $\\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}$ in $M \\backslash S_{0}$ (if $\\tilde{V}$ small enough), hence contains $V \\times\\left\\{0_{n-t}\\right\\}$ where $V$ is an open neighborhood of $\\left(w_{1}^{0}\\right.$, $\\left.\\cdots, w_{t}^{0}\\right)$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{t}$ and $0_{m}$ denotes the origin in $\\mathbb{C}^{m}$. Then it follows from (9.14) using $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ that $\\sigma_{M, 0}\\left(\\tilde{V} \\cap\\left\\{w_{t+1}=w_{t+2}=\\cdots=w_{n}=0\\right\\}\\right) \\subset \\sigma_{M, 0}(\\tilde{V}) \\subset G^{0}$ covers an open neighborhood of $q$ in $\\left\\{0_{s}\\right\\} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{t-s} \\times\\left\\{0_{n-t}\\right\\}$. Conversely only points in the local chart having coordinates $\\left(0_{s}, w_{s+1}, \\cdots, w_{t}, 0_{n-t}\\right)$ can belong to $G^{0}$. Thus $\\left(w_{1}\\right.$, $\\left.\\cdots, w_{n}\\right)$ in (9.14) provide a complex submanifold structure of $G^{0}$ in $M$ near $q$. We have proved (a) of the lemma.\n\nSuppose $t<n$ in (9.14) for $q \\in G^{0}$. For any $\\tilde{q}_{1}$ sufficiently near $\\tilde{q}$ with $\\tilde{q}_{1}, \\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}_{1} \\notin$ $S_{0}, \\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q}_{1}$ has coordinates with vanishing $w_{t+1}, \\cdots, w_{n}$ by the similar argument as above, giving that $\\sigma\\left(\\lambda_{0}\\right) \\tilde{V}$ becomes degenerate, a contradiction to the biholomorphism of $\\sigma\\left(\\lambda_{0}\\right)$. Thus\n\n$$\nt=n \\text { in (9.14) for } q \\in G^{0}\n$$\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Proj}: U \\rightarrow G^{0}$ be the coordinate projection via (9.14) for $t=n$, i.e. $\\left(w_{1}\\right.$, $\\left.\\cdots, w_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(0, \\cdots, 0, w_{s+1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right)$. Clearly Proj holomorphically extends $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ (originally defined on $U \\backslash S_{0}$ ) to $U$. Thus $\\sigma_{M, 0}$ is regular at $q=(0, \\cdots, 0)$ since Proj is so, suggesting that $G^{0} \\subset M \\backslash S_{0}$. To prove this inclusion rigorously, by considering $\\phi:\\left(w_{1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(\\lambda^{k_{1}} w_{1}, \\cdots, \\lambda^{k_{s}} w_{s}, w_{s+1}, \\cdots, w_{n}\\right)$ one shows in a similar way that $\\sigma_{M}$ is regular at $(0, q) \\in \\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M$, and hence the claim $G^{0} \\subset M \\backslash S_{0}$ in (b) of the lemma is proved.\n\nFrom the definition of the extension $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$ it is not difficult to see $F^{0} \\subset \\overline{G^{0}}$ (via $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}=\\sigma_{M, 0}$ on $M \\backslash S_{0}$ ). Obviously $\\overline{G^{0}} \\subset F^{\\sigma_{M}}$. So given $\\bar{q} \\in F^{0}$ there is a neighborhood $U$ in $M$, which is contained in a local chart first having the property (9.14) with $\\bar{q}$ set to be $q$ there then having $t=n$ in view of $G^{0} \\subset F^{0} \\subset \\overline{G^{0}}$ and (9.15). We claim $G^{0} \\cap U=F^{0} \\cap U$. The coordinate projection Proj above defined on $U$ also holomorphically extends $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$ (on $U \\backslash T$ ) to $U$ meaning that $U$ is disjoint from the singular set $T$ of $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}$. So $T \\cap U=\\emptyset$ together with $S_{0} \\cap U=\\emptyset$ (as shown in the proof of (b) above), implies that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 0}=\\sigma_{M, 0}=$ Proj on $U$. Thus $G^{0} \\cap U=$ $F^{0} \\cap U\\left(=\\operatorname{Proj}(U)\\right.$ ) hence $G^{0}=F^{0}$ proving (c) of the lemma.\n\nThe proof of (c) actually shows that $G^{0}=\\overline{G^{0}}$ (compare the preceding sentence) hence (d) of the lemma. Recall the aforementioned $F_{1}$ after Proposition 9.10, which is defined in [14] for $M$ compact. Since $G^{0}$ is of the same complex dimension $t-s$ $(=n-s)$ as that of $F_{1}[14]$ which is connected, for $M$ compact we conclude $G^{0}(=$ $F^{0}=\\overline{F^{0}}$ by (c), (d) above $)=F_{1}$ as asserted earlier. In this connection, $F^{0}\\left(=\\overline{F^{0}}\\right)$ in our treatment here can be regarded as a replacement of $F_{1}$ when $M$ is not necessarily compact.\n\nRemark 9.13. Since (9.14) for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ is claimed without proof in [14], let us assume that $U$ is a small neighborhood of $q=(0,0, \\cdots, 0)$, in which case (9.14) only holds for $\\lambda \\sim 1$. It might happen that a point $p \\in U$ with some $w_{k}(p) \\neq 0$ $(t+1 \\leq k \\leq n)$ lying outside $U$ after the action by some $|\\lambda|<1$, travels back to $U$ after another action by $|\\lambda|<<1$. This would not occur if (9.14) were true for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ or if $U$ were large. For the remedy here we put $q_{1}=\\lambda_{0} \\tilde{q} \\in U$. The fact $\\lim _{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda q_{1}=q$ gives that $\\lambda q_{1} \\in U$ for all $|\\lambda| \\leq \\delta$ for some $\\delta>0$. Then we have, by setting $q_{2}=\\delta q_{1}, \\lambda q_{2} \\in U$ for all $|\\lambda| \\leq 1$. This yields $w_{t+1}\\left(q_{2}\\right)=\\cdots=w_{n}\\left(q_{2}\\right)$ $=0$ otherwise it follows the contradiction that $\\lambda q_{2} \\notin U$ for some $|\\lambda|<1$ (if $w_{k}\\left(q_{2}\\right)$ $\\neq 0$ for some $t+1 \\leq k \\leq n$ and $\\lambda q_{2} \\in U$ for all $|\\lambda|<1$ then $U$ cannot be small). Put differently the aforementioned scenario that a point frequently/always comes in and out through $U$ under the actions $|\\lambda|<1$ is intuitively seen to get nowhere and therefore violates the foregoing existence of limit. Remark that the above enables us to simply replace $\\lambda_{0}$ in the original argument by $\\delta \\lambda_{0}$. We are now done.\n\nAnother generalization of [14] from a quite different perspective is given in the next section.\n\nFor a general holomorphic action $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ given by a connected complex reductive Lie group $G$, we can show (below) that (9.7) of Proposition 9.5 still holds, without knowing the detailed $G$-invariant decomposition of $M$ as conjectured in [76, p.115].\n\nTo fix the notation for use shortly, let $\\mathfrak{g}$ denote a complex simple Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{h}$ a fixed Cartan subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$ and $\\Delta$ the set of all nonzero roots. In the root space decomposition $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{h}+\\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\Delta} \\mathfrak{g}^{\\alpha}$ one can choose $\\alpha_{j} \\in \\Delta, j=1, \\ldots, l, X_{j} \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{\\alpha_{j}}$ and $Y_{j} \\in \\mathfrak{g}^{-\\alpha_{j}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left[X_{j}, Y_{j}\\right]=H_{j} \\in \\mathfrak{h},\\left[H_{j}, X_{j}\\right]=2 X_{j},\\left[H_{j}, Y_{j}\\right]=-2 Y_{j}\n$$\n\nand that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is generated by $X_{j}, Y_{j}, H_{j}, 1 \\leq j \\leq l$ (cf. [45, p.482]). Also $X_{j}, Y_{j}, H_{j}$ form a canonical basis for the Lie algebra $s l(2, \\mathbb{C})$. The following is basic:\nLemma 9.14. Let $T=\\left\\{\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1}\\end{array}\\right) \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right\\} \\subset H=S L(2, \\mathbb{C})$. Then the set $\\bigcup_{h \\in H} \\operatorname{Ad}(h) T$ is dense in $S L(2, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 1.6 stated in the Introduction.\n\nProof. (of Theorem 1.6) Let us first assume that $G$ is semisimple. Associated to the Lie subalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}_{j} \\cong s l(2, \\mathbb{C})$ spanned by $X_{j}, Y_{j}, H_{j}$ of (9.16), we have exactly one connected Lie subgroup $G_{j}$ of $G$ with its Lie algebra equal to $\\mathfrak{g}_{j}$ (cf. [45, p.112]). Let $\\pi_{j}: S L(2, \\mathbb{C}) \\rightarrow G_{j}(\\subset G)$ be the covering map (since $S L(2, \\mathbb{C})$ is simply connected). We have a Lie group homomorphism $\\psi: \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\rightarrow G$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\psi: \\lambda \\longrightarrow\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda^{-1}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_{j}} G_{j} \\xrightarrow{\\text { incl }} G\n$$\n\nWith the projective compactification $\\bar{G}$ of $G$ (cf. Remark 9.15 below) and all the maps being natural, we conclude that $\\phi: S L(2, \\mathbb{C}) \\rightarrow \\bar{G}$ defined by the composition of $\\pi_{j}$ and the inclusion map \"incl\" extends meromorphically to $\\overline{S L(2, \\mathbb{C})}$. Composed with the map $\\lambda \\rightarrow\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1}\\end{array}\\right)$, we obtain that $\\psi$ extends meromorphically (holomorphically in fact) to $\\bar{\\psi}: \\mathbb{C P}^{1}=\\overline{\\mathbb{C}^{*}} \\rightarrow \\rightarrow \\bar{G}$ (cf. [76, Lemma II-C]). It implies that the holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $M$ via $\\bar{\\psi}$ extends to a meromorphic map as the following composite:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M \\xrightarrow{\\bar{\\psi} \\times i d} \\bar{G} \\times M \\xrightarrow{\\bar{\\sigma}_{M}^{G}} M\n$$\n\nHere we have used the facts that $\\bar{\\sigma}_{M}^{G}$ is meromorphic as assumed in the theorem and that the image of $\\bar{\\psi} \\times i d$ is not contained in the singular set of $\\bar{\\sigma}_{M}^{G}$ (cf. [77, pp.35-36]). Similarly the holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$ action on $M$ through the map $\\psi_{h}$ :\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\longrightarrow h\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda^{-1}\n\\end{array}\\right) h^{-1} \\xrightarrow{\\pi_{j}} G_{j} \\xrightarrow{\\text { incl }} G\n$$\n\nalso extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M-\\rightarrow M$.\nBy Proposition 9.5 and Lemma 9.14, we conclude that each holomorphic $p$-form $\\omega$ on $M$ is $G_{j}$-invariant via the action $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$. This implies that $\\omega$ is also invariant under $\\sigma_{M}^{G}(g)$ for $g$ in an open neighborhood $V$ of the identity of $G$ ([45, p.115]) since the Lie algebras of $G_{j}$ span the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ as indicated earlier in (9.16). Now that $\\cup_{k=1}^{\\infty} V^{k}=G$ since $G$ is connected (cf. [64, p.181]), it follows that $\\omega$ is $G$-invariant. This amounts to the inclusion $H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right) \\subset H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{G}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$. The converse is obvious. Hence $H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}^{G}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ for semisimple $G$. Since it is well known that a connected complex reductive group is the product of a connected semisimple group and $\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)^{k}$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$ (e.g. [50, p.168], [63, p.21]), the similar reasoning as above (by using Proposition 9.5) concludes the proof.\n\nRemark 9.15. According to [76, Remarks II-C], a good compactification $\\bar{G}$ exists for $G$ that is reductive. Suppose $G$ acts projectively (see [76, p.107] for this definition) on a compact K\u00e4hler manifold $M$ through $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$. Then $\\sigma_{M}^{G}$ extends meromorphically to $\\bar{G} \\times M$ by [76, Proposition I]. For other examples of the meromorphic extension, see Remark 9.6.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# 10. Complex manifolds with two holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-actions \n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.7 stated in the Introduction. This result combined with those of Section 8 proves Corollary 1.8. The main assertion $H^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)=H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ in Proposition 9.5 (where $\\sigma_{M}$ admits meromorphic extension) becomes a special case of $H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\cong H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ in Theorem 1.7, which is to be discussed below. See also the paragraph prior to Corollary 1.8 in the Introduction, that refers to moduli spaces with two fibrations; the results of this section might have applications to these spaces.\n\nOur strategy is to consider the globally free case first, i.e. a principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle $P$ over a complex manifold $M$ (not necessarily compact). We turn to the locally free case later.\n\nSome setup first. Denote the standard holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $P$ by $\\sigma_{s}$ and $M$ $=P / \\sigma_{s}$. Let $\\sigma_{d}$ be another globally free holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $P$, which maps fibre to fibre of the fibration $\\pi: P \\rightarrow M$ (perhaps different fibres). Let $\\sigma_{M}$ be the $\\sigma_{d}$-induced holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $M$, i.e. the commutative relation $\\pi \\circ \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)$ $=\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) \\circ \\pi$ holds for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. Assume that $B:=P / \\sigma_{d}$ is a complex manifold and the natural projection $\\pi_{2}: P \\rightarrow B$ realizes $P$ as a principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle on $B$ (via $\\sigma_{d}$ ).\n\nA typical situation that motivates us is the one in Section 9 ; here $P=\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times M$ as a trivial principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle on $M$, the \"diagonal\" action $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)(\\xi, p):=(\\lambda \\xi$, $\\left.\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) p\\right)$ for a given holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{M}$ on $M$, and $\\left.B=P / \\sigma_{d}(=\\{[(\\xi, x)] \\mid\\right.$ $(\\xi, x) \\in P\\})$. Define $\\psi: B \\rightarrow M$ by $\\psi([(\\xi, x)])=\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\xi^{-1}\\right) x$, and $\\psi^{-1}(y)=[(1, y)]$ $\\in B$ for $y \\in M$, i.e. $\\psi$ is a biholomorphism.\n\nFix a local trivialization $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times U$ for $P \\rightarrow M$. We may write 1 for the local holomorphic section $(1, y)$ on $U \\subset M$ if no confusion occurs. Write $(\\zeta, y):=\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1, y\\right)$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times U$ where $\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1=\\sigma_{s}(\\zeta) 1$ for short; similar notations \" $\\circ_{d}$ \", \" $\\circ_{M}$ \" also apply below. For $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}, \\sigma_{s}$ acts by $\\sigma_{s}(\\lambda)\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1, y\\right)=\\left((\\lambda \\zeta) \\circ_{s} 1, y\\right)$ or $\\lambda \\circ_{s}(\\zeta, y)=(\\lambda \\zeta, y)$.\n\nThroughout this section we assume that $\\sigma_{d}$ commutes with $\\sigma_{s}$, i.e. $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda) \\circ \\sigma_{s}(\\zeta)=\\sigma_{s}(\\zeta) \\circ \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)$ or $\\lambda \\circ_{d}\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} q\\right)=\\zeta \\circ_{s}\\left(\\lambda \\circ_{d} q\\right)$ for $q \\in P, \\lambda, \\zeta \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. We say that $\\sigma_{d}$ is degenerate if $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)\\left(\\zeta, y\\right)=\\left(\\zeta, \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right)$ for $\\lambda$ close to 1 in some local chart. Otherwise $\\sigma_{d}$ is said to be nondegenerate. This definition is easily seen to be intrinsic. If $\\sigma_{d}$ is nondegenerate, we claim the existence of $0 \\neq l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, such that\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\circ_{d}(\\zeta, y)=\\left(\\lambda^{l} \\zeta, \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right)\n$$\n\nHere we assume that $\\lambda$ is close to 1 to ensure that the image of $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)$ is contained in the same trivialization. Write $\\lambda \\circ_{d}(\\zeta, y)=\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda}(\\zeta), \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right)$. Then it is not hard to see\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}(\\zeta)=\\Phi_{\\lambda_{1}}\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda_{2}}(\\zeta)\\right)\\left(=\\Phi_{\\lambda_{2}}\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda_{1}}(\\zeta)\\right)\\right), \\Phi_{\\lambda}\\left(\\zeta_{1} \\zeta_{2}\\right)=\\zeta_{1} \\Phi_{\\lambda}\\left(\\zeta_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that the second equality of (10.2) follows from the commutativity of $\\sigma_{d}$ and $\\sigma_{s}:$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda}(\\zeta), \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right) & =\\lambda \\circ_{d}(\\zeta, y)=\\lambda \\circ_{d}\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s}(1, y)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\zeta \\circ_{s}\\left(\\lambda \\circ_{d}(1, y)\\right)=\\zeta \\circ_{s}\\left(\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda}(1), \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& =\\left(\\zeta \\Phi_{\\lambda}(1), \\lambda \\circ_{M} y\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLetting $\\zeta=1$ in the first equality of (10.2) gives\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}}(1)=\\Phi_{\\lambda_{1}}\\left(\\Phi_{\\lambda_{2}}(1)\\right)=\\Phi_{\\lambda_{2}}(1) \\Phi_{\\lambda_{1}}(1)\n$$\n\nso the map $\\lambda \\rightarrow \\Phi_{\\lambda}(1)$ is a holomorphic character. It follows (see Remark 10.1 below) that $\\Phi_{\\lambda}(1)=\\lambda^{l}$ for $0 \\neq l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ if $\\sigma_{d}$ is nondegenerate.\nRemark 10.1. In the reasoning above, $\\lambda$ is originally close to 1 . Under different local trivializations 1 and $1^{a}$, for the same point $\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1$ and $\\zeta^{a} \\circ_{s} 1^{a}$ lying over $y \\in M$, we have the same point $\\Phi_{\\lambda}(\\zeta) \\circ_{s} 1$ and $\\Phi_{\\lambda}^{a}\\left(\\zeta^{a}\\right) \\circ_{s} 1^{a}$ lying over $\\lambda \\circ_{M} y \\in M$. Writing $1^{a}=\\mu 1$ thus $\\zeta=\\zeta^{a} \\mu$ and using $\\Phi_{\\lambda}^{a}\\left(\\zeta \\mu^{-1}\\right)=\\mu^{-1} \\Phi_{\\lambda}^{a}(\\zeta)(10.2)$ one sees that\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\lambda}(\\zeta)=\\Phi_{\\lambda}^{a}(\\zeta)\n$$\n\nFrom $\\Phi_{\\lambda}=\\Phi_{\\lambda}^{a}$ in (10.3) it follows that $\\Phi_{\\lambda}$ can be extended to every $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ even if $\\lambda \\circ_{M} y$ may leave the original trivialization. In sum (10.2) remains valid for all $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$.\n\nWe will sometimes drop the subscripts \" $s$ \", \" $d$ \" and \" $M$ \" in \" $\\circ_{s}$ \", \" $\\circ_{d}$ \" and \" $\\circ_{M}$ \" respectively if there is no danger of confusion in the context.\n\nSuppose that $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M--->M$. As usual, $H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right)$ denotes the space of holomorphic $p$-forms on $B$. Take $\\omega_{B} \\in H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right)$. Consider the global holomorphic $p$-form $\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}$ on $P$ (where $\\pi_{2}: P \\rightarrow B$ ).\n\nTo proceed further, some preparations are in order. From the proof of Proposition 9.5, we can localize the reasoning and restrict ourselves to a local trivialization $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times U$ of $P \\rightarrow M$. The form $\\left.\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times U}$ can now be expanded at $\\zeta=0 \\in \\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ as before; this is dependent only on the local trivialization $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times U$ hence on $\\zeta$ and independent of local coordinates at $x \\in M$. With the previous notation we write\n\n$$\n\\left(\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\right)\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1, x\\right)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\zeta^{k} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}$ is a holomorphic $p$-form in $\\zeta$ and $x$, whose coefficients are independent of $\\zeta$.\nRemark 10.2. An intrinsic description for the regularity (10.4) is the following. Regarding the principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle $P \\rightarrow M$ as seated inside the associated holomorphic line bundle $L \\rightarrow M$ (cf. (10.29) below). The above regularity (10.4) is the same as to say that $\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}$ is regular at the zero section of $L$.\n\nDefine the projection $\\operatorname{Proj}_{x}$ by dropping the terms involving $d \\zeta$ :\n\n$$\n\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x):=\\operatorname{Proj}_{x} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta), k=0,1, \\cdots\n$$\n\nNote that in $\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)$ there is no dependence on $\\zeta$ and $d \\zeta$. As $\\operatorname{Proj}_{x}$ is presumably coordinate-dependent (on $\\zeta$ as aforementioned), we are going to examine the patching property of $\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)$ below.\nLemma 10.3. As given in (10.5), the p-form $\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ is globally defined on $M$, and for every $k \\geq 1\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}-\\omega_{k}\\right) / d \\zeta$ induces a global $L^{-(k+1)}$-valued $(p-1)$-form $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ on $M$, where $L$ is some holomorphic line bundle on $M$ (in fact it is the same $L$ as the one in Remark 10.2).\nProof. For later use, the following proof discusses more than what is needed in the lemma. Let $1^{\\prime}$ be another local holomorphic section such that $\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1, x\\right)=\\left(\\zeta^{\\prime} \\circ_{s} 1^{\\prime}, x\\right)$. Write $1^{\\prime}=c(x)^{-1} \\circ_{s} 1$ for some local (nowhere vanishing) holomorphic function $c(x)$, so $\\zeta^{\\prime}=c(x) \\zeta$. Write $\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\left(\\zeta \\circ_{s} 1, x\\right)=\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\left(\\zeta^{\\prime} \\circ_{s} 1^{\\prime}, x\\right)$, and thus\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\zeta^{k} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\zeta^{\\prime}\\right)^{k} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(1^{\\prime}, x, d x, d \\zeta^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nVia (10.5) one rewrites $\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}$ :\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)+\\eta_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta_{k}$ is of the form (with $J$ denoting the multi-indices $I_{p-1}$ )\n\n$$\n\\eta_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\sum_{J} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J} \\wedge d \\zeta\n$$\n\nSimilar notation with a \"prime\" applies to $\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}^{\\prime}, \\eta_{k}^{\\prime}$.\nSubstituting $d \\zeta^{\\prime}=\\zeta c_{j}(x) d x^{j}+c(x) d \\zeta$ (by differentiating $\\zeta^{\\prime}=c(x) \\zeta$ ) into $\\eta_{k}^{\\prime}$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\eta_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(1^{\\prime}, x, d x, d \\zeta^{\\prime}\\right)=\\zeta \\sum_{J, j} f_{k, J}^{\\prime} c_{j}(x) d x^{J} \\wedge d x^{j}+c(x) \\sum_{J} f_{k, J}^{\\prime} d x^{J} \\wedge d \\zeta\n$$\n\nand hence by (10.6) for the terms involving $\\zeta^{k} d \\zeta$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{J} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J} \\wedge d \\zeta=c(x)^{k+1} \\sum_{J} f_{k, J}^{\\prime}(x) d x^{J} \\wedge d \\zeta\n$$\n\nIt follows from (10.10) that\n\n$$\nf_{k, J}^{\\prime}(x) d x^{J}=c(x)^{-(k+1)} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J}\n$$\n\nLet $L^{-(k+1)}$ be the holomorphic line bundle on $M$ associated to the transition function $c(x)^{k+1}$. By (10.11) the collection\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{f}_{k}(p):=\\left\\{\\sum_{J} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor $p \\in M$ with coordinates $x=\\left(x^{j}\\right)$ is a global $L^{-(k+1)}$-valued $(p-1)$-form on $M$.\nSimilar to (10.10), by (10.6) for the terms involving $\\zeta^{k}$ (but excluding $\\zeta^{k} d \\zeta$ ) one has (see also (10.9))\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)=\\omega_{0}^{\\prime}\\left(1^{\\prime}, x, d x\\right) \\\\\n& \\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)=c(x)^{k} \\omega_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(1^{\\prime}, x, d x\\right)+c(x)^{k-1} \\sum_{J, j} f_{(k-1), J}^{\\prime} c_{j}(x) d x^{J} \\wedge d x^{j}, k \\geq 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first equality of (10.13) shows that $\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ is a globally-defined holomorphic $p$-form on $M$. The statement about $\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}-\\omega_{k}\\right) / d \\zeta$ is from (10.7), (10.8) and (10.11).\n\nRecall that $H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$ denote the space of $\\sigma_{M}$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms on $M$ (cf. Section 8). The crucial result of this section is the following:\nProposition 10.4. Let $P$ be a principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle over a complex manifold $M$, not necessarily compact. Assume that there exists a finite open covering $\\left\\{U^{a}\\right\\}_{a}$ of $M$ such that $P$ is holomorphically trivial over a neighborhood $V^{a}$ of the closure $\\overline{U^{a}}$. Let $\\sigma_{d}$ be a nondegenerate, i.e. $l \\neq 0$ in (10.1), globally free holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $P$ which maps fibre to fibre of the fibration $P \\rightarrow M$ (perhaps different fibres), and induces a holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{M}$ on $M$. Suppose that $\\sigma_{d}$ commutes with $\\sigma_{s}$ (the standard holomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action on $P$ ) and $\\sigma_{M}$ extends meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times M \\rightarrow \\rightarrow M$ (see Remark 9.6). Let $B:=P / \\sigma_{d}$, possibly noncompact. Then the following map from (10.4) and (10.5) in local coordinates:\n\n$$\n\\psi: \\omega_{B} \\in H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow \\omega_{0}(1, x, d x) \\in H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right), p=0,1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nis globally well defined and gives a linear isomorphism.\n\nRemark 10.5. If $\\sigma_{d}$ is degenerate, the assertion of the proposition may fail. For the trivial product $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times M=: P$ with $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)(\\xi, x)=\\left(\\xi, \\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) x\\right)$ we have $\\omega_{B}:=d \\xi$ for $p=1$ projecting to zero under $\\psi$. The argument in the following proof breaks down when $l$ in (10.25) equals 0 (i.e. $\\sigma_{d}$ is degenerate), and in this case no vanishing of $\\eta_{k}(k \\geq 0)$ is guaranteed (see Lemma 10.7); the foregoing $d \\xi \\neq 0$ corresponds $\\left.\\eta_{k=0}\\right)$.\nProof. (of Proposition 10.4) By Lemma 10.3 that $\\psi\\left(\\omega_{B}\\right)$ in (10.14) is a globally defined $p$-form on $M$, it remains to show that it is $\\sigma_{M}$-invariant. Writing $\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}=$ $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}$ on the LHS of (10.4) via $\\pi_{2} \\circ \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)=\\pi_{2}$ and applying (10.4) again, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\zeta^{k} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\left(\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\right)(\\zeta, x) \\\\\n= & \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*}\\left(\\left(\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}\\right)\\left(\\lambda^{l} \\zeta, \\lambda \\circ x\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\stackrel{(10.4)}{=} & \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\lambda^{l} \\zeta\\right)^{k} \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*}\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, \\lambda \\circ x, d(\\lambda \\circ x), d\\left(\\lambda^{l} \\zeta\\right))\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\lambda^{l} \\zeta\\right)^{k}\\left(\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}\\right)(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt follows from (10.15) that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}\\right)(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\lambda^{-l k} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)\n$$\n\nBy (10.16), (10.7), (10.8), (10.1) and (10.5), it is not difficult to convince oneself that, with $\\omega_{k}:=\\operatorname{Proj}_{x} \\tilde{\\omega}_{k}$,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)^{*} \\omega_{k}\\right)(1, x, d x)=\\lambda^{-l k} \\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)\n$$\n\nIt is tempting to let $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ (resp. $\\infty$ ) for $l>0$ (resp. $l<0$ ) in (10.17) and conclude that\n\n$$\n\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x) \\equiv 0 \\quad(k \\geq 1)\n$$\n\nsince the LHS of (10.17) is finite, which follows from the assumption on the meromorphic extension of $\\sigma_{M}$ and Hartogs' extension theorem.\n\nHowever, for $k \\geq 1$ (10.17) is meaningful only for $\\lambda$ close to 1 since a priori $\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)$ is local (see the second equality of (10.13)) and $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)$ may carry away the local chart if $\\lambda \\nsim 1$. For $k=0$ (10.17) together with the first equality of (10.13) did show that $\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ is a global $\\sigma_{M}$-invariant holomorphic $p$-form on $M$. So the map $\\psi$ in (10.14) of this proposition is now well defined.\n\nThe claim (10.18) enters into the proof that $\\psi$ in (10.14) is an isomorphism. To prove (10.18) rigorously, the idea is to extend the action $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)$ in (10.17) to all $\\lambda$ $\\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ (then taking $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ as reasoning above).\nLemma 10.6. For every $k \\geq 1, \\omega_{k}(1, x, d x)$ in (10.13) represents a global $L^{-k_{-}}$ valued holomorphic p-form on $M$, where the holomorphic line bundle $L^{-k} \\rightarrow M$ is as similar to (10.12) and admits a natural $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-k}$ compatible with $\\sigma_{M}$.\n\nLemma 10.6 will be obtained from the following vanishing result:\nLemma 10.7. (Vanishing result (I)) In (10.13) one has $\\sum_{J} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J} \\equiv 0, k \\geq 0$. Thus $\\eta_{k}$ in (10.8) vanishes identically.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 10.7) For a fixed $k \\geq 0$ write $\\varpi_{k}:=\\sum_{J} f_{k, J}(x) d x^{J}$ (recalling that this local $|J|$-form is independent of local coordinates at $x$, cf. remarks prior to (10.4)) and denote by $L \\rightarrow M$ the line bundle associated with $P \\rightarrow M$ (so that $e^{\\prime}=c(x)^{-1} e$ with the transition function $c(x)$ already specified, cf.(10.11)); see also (10.29) below. We claim that the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\sigma_{d}$ on $P$ induces a $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action, still denoted by $\\sigma_{d}$, on $L$. The action $\\sigma_{d}$ has been explicated in (10.1), from which the claim follows. More generally, for every $q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, L^{q} \\rightarrow M$ has a natural $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, q}(\\lambda):$\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, q}(\\lambda) \\text { sending } e_{p}^{q} \\in L_{p}^{q}(p \\in M) \\text { to }\\left(\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda) e_{p}\\right)^{q} \\in L_{\\lambda_{0_{M} p}}^{q}\n$$\n\ninduced by $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda): L \\rightarrow L$ equivariant with respect to $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)$ (thus $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, 1}=\\sigma_{d}$ on $L)$. Since $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)$ acts on the bundle of holomorphic $p$-forms on $M$ via pull-back, a moment's thought yields that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, q}(\\lambda)$ acts, still denoted by $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, q}(\\lambda)$, on the space of global sections under consideration, namely global $L^{q}$-valued $(p-1)$-forms on $M$. Here, a typical situation occurs with the global section $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ in (10.12) ( $L^{-(k+1)-}$ valued) for $q=-(k+1)$. We have now that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M, q}(\\lambda) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ makes perfect sense for every $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$.\n\nLet us first derive a scaling property for $\\varpi_{k}$ (on some open subset $U \\subset M$ ), regarded as local expressions of the global object $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}$. From (10.16), (10.17) and (10.7) we get\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\eta_{k}=\\lambda^{-l k} \\eta_{k}\n$$\n\nfor $\\lambda$ near 1 . Writing out (10.20) via (10.1) and (10.8), one is in a position to compare the terms involving $d \\zeta$. Then it is not difficult to find, via $\\Phi_{\\lambda}^{s}(d \\zeta)=\\lambda^{l} d \\zeta$, that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)^{*} \\varpi_{k}\\right)(x)=\\lambda^{-l(k+1)} \\varpi_{k}(x), \\lambda \\sim 1\n$$\n\nConsidering $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}(\\lambda) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ for $\\lambda \\sim 1$, one infers from (10.21) (with $\\lambda$ replaced by $\\lambda^{-1}$ since $\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)$ acts as $\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)^{*}$ on forms) and (10.1) (see also (10.19) and remarks below (10.22)) that $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}(\\lambda) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}=\\mathfrak{f}_{k}(\\lambda \\sim 1)$; slightly more precisely the contribution from the form-part of $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ acted on by $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}(\\lambda)$ yields a factor $\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)^{-l(k+1)}$ while the contribution from the same action on the $L^{-(k+1)}$-part of $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ gives another factor $\\left(\\lambda^{l}\\right)^{-(k+1)}$ that cancels out the preceding one. As mentioned above $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}(\\lambda) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}$ is well defined for every $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. The crucial property due to the analyticity in $\\lambda$ then leads to the important conclusion:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}(\\lambda) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}=\\mathfrak{f}_{k} \\text { not only for } \\lambda \\sim 1 \\text { but also for all } \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}\n$$\n\nDenote by $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}^{a}=\\varpi_{k}^{a} s^{a}$ where $s^{a}:=\\left(e^{a}\\right)^{-(k+1)}$ and $\\left.\\varpi_{k}^{a}=\\mathfrak{f}_{k}\\right|_{V^{a}}$ for local expression on open charts $V^{a} \\subset M$. Fix $p \\in U^{0} \\subset M$ and write $\\mathfrak{f}_{k}^{0}=\\varpi_{k}^{0} s^{0}$ where $s^{0}=\\left(e^{0}\\right)^{-(k+1)}$ around $p=p^{0}$ (if $U^{0}=U$ then $\\varpi_{k}^{0}$ is the above $\\varpi_{k}$ ); similar notation applies on $U^{a}, \\overline{U^{a}} \\subset V^{a}$. Two basic properties are introduced as follows. If $\\lambda \\circ_{M} p=p^{(a)}$ $\\in U^{a}$, with $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right) s^{a}\\left(p^{(a)}\\right)=: \\tau\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right) s^{0}(p)$ (the subscript $-(k+1)$ in $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-(k+1)}$ dropped throughout) we obtain the first property:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M}\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}\\right)(p)=\\left(\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p^{(a)}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\tau\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right) s^{0}(p)\n$$\n\nFor the second property suppose $\\nu \\circ(\\lambda \\circ p)=\\tilde{p}^{(a)} \\in U^{a}$, i.e. $p=\\lambda^{-1} \\circ\\left(\\nu^{-1} \\circ \\tilde{p}^{(a)}\\right)$ with $\\lambda \\circ p \\in U^{a}$ as above. One sees that\n\n$$\n\\tau\\left(\\lambda^{-1} \\nu^{-1}\\right)=\\nu^{l(k+1)} \\tau\\left(\\lambda^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nsince $\\nu^{-1} \\circ s^{a}=\\nu^{l(k+1)} s^{a}$ by (10.1) and (10.19). Here we need not restrict ourselves to $\\nu \\sim 1$ although the set $\\left\\{\\nu \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*} \\mid \\nu \\circ(\\lambda \\circ p) \\in U^{a}\\right\\}$ may be far from being a connected set. As the reasoning is similar to Remark 10.1, we leave it to the reader.\n\nThe following arguments constitute a refined treatment of those in (10.16)(10.18). Choose $c \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ with $|c| \\neq 1$. Suppose $|c|<1$ and $l>0$ (the remaining three cases will be similar). For the sequence $\\left\\{c^{i} \\circ_{M} p\\right\\}_{i=1,2, \\cdots}$ there exists some fixed open chart $U^{a}$ and a subsequence $\\left\\{c^{n(i)} \\circ_{M} p\\right\\}_{i=1,2, \\cdots}$ such that $\\left\\{c^{n(i)} \\circ_{M} p\\right\\}_{i}$ $\\subset U^{a}$ by the finiteness assumption on $\\left\\{U^{a}\\right\\}_{a}$ as stated in the proposition. Denote $c^{n(1)}$ by $c_{1}, c^{n(2)-n(1)}$ by $c_{2}$, etc. and set $p_{i}=c_{i} \\circ c_{i-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ c_{1} \\circ p\\left(=c^{n(i)} \\circ p\\right)=$ $c_{i} \\circ p_{i-1} \\in U^{a}$ with $p_{0}:=p$. For instance, by $c_{1}^{-1} \\circ c_{2}^{-1} \\circ p_{2}=p$ with $p_{2} \\in U^{a}$ and from $(10.22),(10.23)$\n\n$$\n\\varpi_{k}^{0}(p) s^{0}(p)=\\mathfrak{f}_{k}^{0}(p)=\\left(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M}\\left(c_{1}^{-1} c_{2}^{-1}\\right) \\mathfrak{f}_{k}\\right)(p)=\\sigma_{M}\\left(c_{2} c_{1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p_{2}\\right)\\right) \\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1} c_{2}^{-1}\\right) s^{0}(p)\n$$\n\nThis yields $\\sigma_{M}\\left(c_{2} c_{1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p_{2}\\right)\\right)=\\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1} c_{2}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\varpi_{k}^{0}(p)$ and in turn, using (10.24) for $\\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1} c_{2}^{-1}\\right)^{-1}, \\sigma_{M}\\left(c_{2} c_{1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p_{2}\\right)\\right)=c^{(n(1)-n(2)) l(k+1)} \\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\varpi_{k}^{0}(p)$.\n\nSimilarly, for $i \\geq 2$ one has\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\left(c_{i} c_{i-1} \\cdots c_{2}\\right) c_{1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\right)=c^{(n(1)-n(i)) l(k+1)} \\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\varpi_{k}^{0}(p)\n$$\n\nIt is trivial that $\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\left(c_{i} c_{i-1} \\cdots c_{2}\\right) c_{1}\\right)^{*}\\left(\\varpi_{k}^{a}\\left(p_{i}\\right)\\right)=\\left(\\sigma_{M}\\left(\\left(c_{i} c_{i-1} \\cdots c_{2}\\right) c_{1}\\right)^{*} \\varpi_{k}^{a}\\right)(p)$. Thus\n$(10.25)\\left(\\sigma_{M}\\left(c^{n(i)-n(1)} c_{1}\\right)^{*} \\varpi_{k}^{a}\\right)(p)=c^{(n(1)-n(i)) l(k+1)} \\tau\\left(c_{1}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\varpi_{k}^{0}(p)(i=2,3, \\cdots)$.\nAs an illustration, suppose $p, c \\circ p \\in U^{0}$ for the simplest case (corresponding to taking $n(1)=0$ and $n(2)=1$ ). Then\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sigma_{M}(c)^{*} \\varpi_{k}^{0}\\right)(p)=c^{-l(k+1)} \\varpi_{k}^{0}(p)\n$$\n\nreproducing (10.21) above.\nNow a contradiction follows from (10.25) by letting $i \\rightarrow \\infty$ and using the similar argument indicated in (10.18) since $|c|<1$ and $l>0$ by assumption. For other cases one may consider $\\left\\{c^{-n(i)} \\circ p\\right\\}_{i=1,2, \\cdots}$; we omit the details. Hence $\\varpi_{k} \\equiv 0$ as asserted by the lemma.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 10.6) By Lemma 10.7 and (10.13), one has\n\n$$\n\\omega_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(1^{\\prime}, x, d x\\right)=c(x)^{-k} \\omega_{k}(1, x, d x) \\quad k \\geq 1\n$$\n\nproving the first assertion of the lemma. The $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-action $\\tilde{\\sigma}_{M,-k}$ on $L^{-k}$ has been indicated in the proof of Lemma 10.7 (see (10.19)).\n\nUsing the similar method as in the previous lemma one proves the analogous statement:\n\nLemma 10.8. (Vanishing result (II)) In (10.13), $\\omega_{k}=\\omega_{k}(1, x, d x) \\equiv 0, k \\geq 1$.\nProof. Recall that $\\omega_{k}$ is a global $L^{-k}$-valued holomorphic $p$-form on $M$ by Lemma 10.6 (see (10.27)). By comparing $\\omega_{k}$ in (10.27) with $\\varpi_{k}$ in (10.11) and $\\omega_{k}$ in (10.17) with $\\varpi_{k}$ in (10.26) or (10.21), it is perhaps a tedious matter but not a difficult one to convince oneself that one can formally run the arguments similar to the vanishing of $\\varpi_{k}$ in Lemma 10.7 (which shall not be repeated here), giving the desired vanishing of this lemma.\n\nProof of Proposition 10.4 continued: In (10.7) for $\\tilde{\\omega}_{k}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)$, we obtain $\\tilde{\\omega}_{k} \\equiv 0(k \\geq 1)$ from the vanishing results Lemmas 10.7 and 10.8 above. For $k=0$, $\\tilde{\\omega}_{0}(1, x, d x, d \\zeta)=\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ since $\\eta_{0}$ in (10.7) vanishes by Lemma 10.7. By these vanishings, we thus reduce (10.4) to\n\n$$\n\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}(\\zeta \\circ 1, x)=\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)\n$$\n\nThat the linear map $\\psi$ of (10.14) is well-defined has been shown in the first half of the proof. The injectivity of $\\psi$ follows from (10.28) since the pull-back $\\pi_{2}^{*}$ of the surjective map $\\pi_{2}$ is injective. It remains to prove the surjectivity of $\\psi$.\n\nGiven an element $\\omega_{0} \\in H_{0}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)$, let $\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}:=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{0}$ on $P$ where $\\pi_{1}: P \\rightarrow M$ is the natural projection, so that locally $\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}(\\zeta \\circ 1, x)=\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ on $P$. We claim $\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\tilde{\\omega}_{B}=\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}$. For, $\\omega_{0}$ is $\\sigma_{M}$-invariant by assumption and this yields the claim:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\tilde{\\omega}_{B}=\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)^{*} \\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{0}=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\sigma_{M}^{*}(\\lambda) \\omega_{0}=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{0}=\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}\n$$\n\nusing $\\pi_{1} \\circ \\sigma_{d}(\\lambda)=\\sigma_{M}(\\lambda) \\circ \\pi_{1}$ by (10.1). So $\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}$ descends on $P / \\sigma_{d}=B$ to an element $\\omega_{B} \\in H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right)$ in the sense that $\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{B}=\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}$. This, together with $\\tilde{\\omega}_{B}=$ $\\omega_{0}(1, x, d x)$ as just mentioned, implies that $\\omega_{0}$ lies in the image of $\\psi$ in (10.14) (cf. (10.4), (10.5) and (10.28)). We have proved the surjectivity of $\\psi$, and hence the isomorphism of $\\psi$.\n\nThe following remarks will be used in the proof of Theorem 1.7.\nRemark 10.9. In the notation of Proposition 10.4, associated with $P$ is the holomorphic line bundle $L_{M}$ (resp. $L_{B}$ ) over $M$ (resp. $B$ ) by\n\n$$\nL_{M}:=P \\times_{\\sigma_{s}} \\mathbb{C}=P \\times \\mathbb{C} / \\sim_{s}\\left(\\text { resp. } L_{B}:=P \\times_{\\sigma_{d}} \\mathbb{C}=P \\times \\mathbb{C} / \\sim_{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $(u, \\zeta) \\sim_{s}\\left(\\sigma_{s}(\\lambda) u, \\lambda^{-1} \\zeta\\right)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.(u, \\zeta) \\sim_{d}\\left(\\sigma_{d}(\\lambda) u, \\lambda^{-1} \\zeta\\right)\\right)$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$. By the map $u \\rightarrow[(u, 1)]$ via $\\sigma_{s}$ (resp. $\\sigma_{d}$ ) we have an embedding $P \\cong L_{M} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}$ (resp. $L_{B} \\backslash\\{0$-section $\\}$ ) into $L_{M}$ (resp. $L_{B}$ ). We have the following linear isomorphisms:\n\n$$\nH_{m, \\sigma_{s}}^{q}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right) \\simeq H^{q}\\left(M,\\left(L_{M}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right), H_{m, \\sigma_{d}}^{q}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right) \\simeq H^{q}\\left(B,\\left(L_{B}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis fact is nothing but a restatement of Proposition 2.9 adapted to the present context. Let us just be brief. Let $\\Omega_{m, \\sigma_{s}}^{0, q}(P)$ (resp. $\\Omega_{m, \\sigma_{d}}^{0, q}(P)$ ) denote $\\Omega_{m}^{0, q}(P)$ (see Definition 2.8) with respect to $\\sigma_{s}$ (resp. $\\sigma_{d}$ ). The map from $\\eta \\otimes\\left(e^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m} \\in$ $\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(M,\\left(L_{M}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.\\Omega^{0, q}\\left(B,\\left(L_{B}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right)$ to $\\omega \\in \\Omega_{m, \\sigma_{s}}^{0, q}(P)$ (resp. $\\Omega_{m, \\sigma_{d}}^{0, q}(P)$ ), defined by\n\n$$\n\\omega(z, \\zeta e)=\\eta \\otimes\\left(e^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}(z, \\zeta e)=\\eta(z)\\left(e^{*}(\\zeta e)\\right)^{m}=\\eta(z) \\zeta^{m}\n$$\n\ninduces a linear isomorphism between $H_{m, \\sigma_{s}}^{q}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right)$ and $H^{q}\\left(M,\\left(L_{M}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)$ (resp. $\\left.H_{m, \\sigma_{d}}^{q}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right) \\text { and } H^{q}\\left(B,\\left(L_{B}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}\\right)\\right)$.\nRemark 10.10. (Generalization to locally free case, used in Example 8.25 too) Suppose $\\sigma_{s}, \\sigma_{d}$ on $P$ are only locally free in the sense that they satisfy conditions as stated in Theorem 1.1 except possibly the compactness of the quotient. Then the isomorphisms in (10.30) with $L_{M}^{*}, L_{B}^{*}$ considered as orbifold line bundles, remain valid. For, one can use Proposition 3.11 via the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-equivariant line bundle $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$ (with $\\Sigma=P$ here) and translate the $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-invariant condition there ( $L_{\\Sigma}^{*}$-valued) into an appropriate setting (cf. $L_{\\Sigma}^{*} / \\sigma, \\sigma=\\sigma_{s}, \\sigma_{d}$ ) associated with orbifolds $(\\Sigma / \\sigma=$\n\n$M, B)$ as $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-quotients of $\\Sigma=P$ here. For the tensor product $\\left(L_{M}^{*}\\right)^{\\otimes m}$ of orbifold line bundles, see for instance [1, p.14]. Compare the introductory paragraph in the proof of Theorem 1.7 after Lemma 10.11 below.\n\nWe turn now to the locally free case. The following lemma is perhaps well known (at least for the topological setting with compact group action), but we are unable to find it (i.e. the complex analytic setting with complex group action) in the literature.\n\nLemma 10.11. In the notation of Theorem 1.7, for the projection $\\pi_{1}: P \\rightarrow M$ and small open subsets $V$ of $M, \\pi_{1}^{-1}(V) \\subset P$ is biholomorphically of the form $\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U}\\right) / \\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma\\left(\\subset S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}\\right)$ is some finite group and $\\tilde{U}$ is some open domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{\\operatorname{dim}} P-1$.\n\nRemark 10.12. The arguments in the proof below may be simplified if one uses Remark 2.5.\n\nProof. (of Lemma 10.11) We follow the last paragraph in the proof of Theorem 2.3 (with its $\\Sigma$ set to be $P$ here). Given $x \\in \\tilde{U}$ and $h \\in \\Gamma$, where $\\tilde{U} \\times(-\\delta, \\delta) \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}^{+}$is a sufficiently small cone-like open neighborhood of a given point $p=(z, 0,1)$ $\\in P$ with the isotropy group $\\Gamma_{p}=: \\Gamma \\subset S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{*}$, let $\\tau(h)(x)=s h x$ for some $s$ (depending on $x$ ) near $1 \\in S^{1}$, and let $h$ act freely on $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U}$ by $\\phi(h):(\\xi, x) \\rightarrow$ $\\left(\\xi h^{-1} s^{-1}, \\tau(h)(x)\\right)$ with $\\tau$ as in (2.12). It can be verified that $\\phi\\left(h_{1} h_{2}\\right)=\\phi\\left(h_{1}\\right) \\phi\\left(h_{2}\\right)$ mainly because $\\tau$ satisfies the similar group-law property.\n\nForm the quotient $\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U}\\right) / \\Gamma$ via $\\phi$ and define a holomorphic map $\\mu:\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U}\\right) / \\Gamma$ $\\rightarrow P$ by $[(\\xi, x)] \\rightarrow \\xi \\circ_{\\sigma_{1}} x=: \\xi x$. It comes down to proving that $\\mu$ is injective. This reduces to the assertion that for $p_{1}=\\left(z_{1}, 0,1\\right), p_{2}=\\left(z_{2}, 0,1\\right)$ in $\\tilde{U} \\times\\{0\\} \\times\\{1\\}$ and $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{*}$ such that $\\xi p_{1}=p_{2}, \\xi$ must be of the form $\\xi=h s$ for some $h \\in \\Gamma$ and $s$ near 1 , i.e. $\\tau(h)\\left(p_{1}\\right)=p_{2}$. This assertion follows from the facts that in this case $\\xi \\in S^{1}$ by using Lemma $7.6 i$ ) with (2.6), and in turn that $\\xi$ is near the isotropy group $\\Gamma$ since $\\xi p \\sim p$ follows from the condition $\\xi p_{1}=p_{2}$ where $p_{1} \\sim p, p_{2} \\sim p(\\tilde{U}$ small around $z=z(p))$.\n\nProof. (of Theorem 1.7) In the locally free case, from Lemma 10.11 (and Theorem 2.3) it follows that $P \\rightarrow M=P / \\sigma_{1}$ via $\\pi_{1}$ is regarded as the total space of an orbifold principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle on the complex orbifold $M$. (We omit the detailed check on the transition functions; see Remark 10.10 for some relevant background material.) Assume that $M$ is compact, or in case it is noncompact assume that it can be covered by finitely many open subsets $V$ as specified in Proposition 10.4; that is, $\\pi^{-1}(V) \\cong\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U}\\right) / \\Gamma$ can be considered as local trivializations in the sense of orbifold bundle. As usual the local sections in the orbifold sense correspond to the $\\Gamma$-invariant local sections of $\\mathbb{C}^{*} \\times \\tilde{U} \\rightarrow \\tilde{U}$. With the preceding assumption on $M$, take now $B=P / \\sigma_{2}$. Here it does not concern us whether $B$ is compact or not. Then, after examination of the preceding proof for the globally free case, this additional condition imposed by the $\\Gamma$-invariance does not obstruct the main lines of the argument there. We leave the details to the reader.\n\nAn alternative approach is to restrict oneself to the regular part $M_{\\text {reg }}$ of $M$ where the action $\\sigma_{1}$ on $\\pi_{1}^{-1}\\left(M_{\\text {reg }}\\right)$ is globally free (here the action $\\sigma_{M}$ on $M$ induced by $\\sigma_{2}$ also maps $M_{\\text {reg }}$ to $M_{\\text {reg }}$ using the commutativity of $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ ). Now that $M_{\\text {reg }}$ is necessarily noncompact (as long as $M \\neq M_{\\text {reg }}$ ), a straightforward use\n\nof Proposition 10.4 on $M_{\\text {reg }}$ would require a finite-covering condition on $M_{\\text {reg }}$ as assumed in the statement there. Imposing the assumption of this finiteness (e.g. $M_{\\text {reg }}$ being quasi-projective with algebraic principal $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$-bundle $\\pi_{1}^{-1}\\left(M_{\\text {reg }}\\right) \\rightarrow M_{\\text {reg }}$ ) and using the Hartogs extension on normal analytic spaces (see Theorem 2.3) for the normality of $M$ ) the holomorphic $p$-forms on $M_{\\text {reg }}$ can holomorphically extend to $M$ (see Footnote ${ }^{2}$ in the Introduction for $p$-forms on orbifolds), leading to the desired isomorphism map (see the next paragraph). We omit the details.\n\nIn sum, as in (10.14) of Proposition 10.4 the map $\\omega_{B} \\rightarrow \\omega_{0}$ still gives us a linear isomorphism:\n\n$$\nH^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\simeq H_{0, \\sigma_{M}}^{0}\\left(M, \\Omega_{M}^{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe have proved (1.10) of Theorem 1.7.\nWe turn now to (1.11) of Theorem 1.7. Here we assume that $B$ is smooth, compact and K\u00e4hler. We have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} B}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right)=\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} B}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H^{p}\\left(B, \\mathcal{O}_{B}\\right)\n$$\n\nsince $H^{0}\\left(B, \\Omega_{B}^{p}\\right) \\cong H^{p}\\left(B, \\mathcal{O}_{B}\\right)$ in the K\u00e4hler case. By Remarks 10.9 and 10.10 (with $m=0$ ) identifying $H^{*}\\left(B, \\mathcal{O}_{B}\\right)$ and $H_{0, \\sigma_{2}}^{*}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right)$ so that $H_{0, \\sigma_{2}}^{\\operatorname{dim} P}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right)=$ $H^{\\operatorname{dim} P}\\left(B, \\mathcal{O}_{B}\\right)$ which is 0 since $\\operatorname{dim} P=1+\\operatorname{dim} B$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} B}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H^{p}\\left(B, \\mathcal{O}_{B}\\right)=\\sum_{p=0}^{\\operatorname{dim} P}(-1)^{p} \\operatorname{dim} H_{0, \\sigma_{2}}^{p}\\left(P, \\mathcal{O}_{P}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow (1.11) of Theorem 1.7 follows from (10.31), (10.32) and (10.33).\n\nProof. (of Corollary 1.8) Theorem 1.6 proved in the preceding section and Theorem 1.7 just proved clearly yield this corollary provided that Remark 9.6 is used to take care of the meromorphic extension condition needed in Theorem 1.7.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 16, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[1] A.

By applying the method of transversal heat kernel\nasymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can\nreinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex\norbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over\na (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from\nsingular strata. We generalize $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$-action to complex reductive\nLie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others,\nwe study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all\n$G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible\nholomorphic $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found\nbetween two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic\nassociated with these spaces can be computed by our $\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }$ local\nindex formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant\nalgebraic cobordism theory $\\Omega _{\\ast }^{\\mathbb{C}^{\\ast }}(\\Sigma ),$ a\nspeculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent\ndevelopment in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.", "updated": "2025-04-11T09:25:00Z", "published": "2024-12-15T03:33:08Z"}
