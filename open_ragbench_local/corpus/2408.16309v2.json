      "text": "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nDeformation theory of algebraic structures is important in both mathematics and physics. In mathematics, deformation theory provides insights into how an algebraic structure can change continuously within a family of similar structures. By studying small perturbations or deformations, one can better understand the rigidity and flexibility of such a structure. It also aids in the classification of algebraic structures by illustrating how seemingly different structures can be interconnected through deformations. In physics, deformation quantization is a classical process in quantum physics where classical mechanics is deformed into quantum mechanics. It provides a bridge between classical and quantum descriptions.\n\nOne of the primary tools for the deformation theory of a commutative associative algebra is the second Harrison cohomology $H^{2}(A, A)$, which describes the equivalence classes of the first-order deformations of $A$ that are commutative associative algebras. Although not all firstorder deformations can be integrated into a convergent deformation of $A$, every candidate for a deformation originates from a first-order deformation. Thus, calculating $H^{2}(A, A)$ is the initial step in understanding the deformation theory of $A$.\n\nVertex algebras are algebraic structures formed by vertex operators satisfying certain commutativity and associativity, thus can be viewed as analogues of commutative associative algebras. Based on this analogy, using the same ideas of Harrison and Hochschild cohomologies, Yi-Zhi Huang constructed the cohomology theory of a grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ and proved that the first-order vertex-algebraic deformations are classified by the second cohomology\n\n$H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ (see [H1] and [H2]). As in the case of commutative associative algebras, understanding $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ is the initial step to understanding the deformation theory of vertex algebras.\n\nComputing $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ has been a long-standing challenge, primarily due to convergence issues. In Huang's framework, the cochain complexes are defined by linear maps $\\Phi: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow \\widetilde{V}_{z_{1}, z_{2}}$ satisfying technical convergence conditions, known as the composable conditions. For the cohomology group $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$, an elements $\\Phi$ in the cochain complex is $1 / 2$-composable with vertex operators, if for $v^{\\prime} \\in V^{\\prime}, v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3} \\in V$, the series\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(v_{1}, z_{1}\\right) \\Phi\\left(v_{2} \\otimes v_{3} ; z_{2}, z_{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, \\Phi\\left(Y\\left(v_{1}, z_{1}-\\zeta\\right) Y\\left(v_{2}, z_{2}-\\zeta\\right) \\mathbf{1} \\otimes v_{3} ; \\zeta, z_{3}\\right)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, \\Phi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes, Y\\left(v_{2}, z_{2}-\\zeta\\right) Y\\left(v_{3}, z_{3}-\\zeta\\right) \\mathbf{1} ; z_{1}, \\zeta\\right)\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(v_{3}, z_{3}\\right) \\Phi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nconverges. Note that each summand in these expressions does not necessarily converge individually. Working with this $1 / 2$-composable condition is the primary obstacle in computing $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ and has been a persistent issue.\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive solution to this computational problem for a gradingrestricted vertex algebra $V$ that is freely generated by a finite set $S$. We introduce a systematic algorithm that reduces the computation of a cocycle to its image on the generators. Specifically, let $\\Phi$ be a cocycle representing a cohomology class in $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$. For every $u, v \\in S$, we set\n\n$$\nY_{1}(u, z) v=\\Phi(u \\otimes v ; z, 0)\n$$\n\nSince $Y_{1}(u, z) v$ defines a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function with pole at $z=0$, we may write\n\n$$\nY_{1}(u, z) v=\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} u_{m}^{d e f} v z^{-n-1}\n$$\n\nWe show that if the singular part of $Y_{1}$ satisfies the following commutator condition, namely, for $u, v, w \\in S$,\n\n$$\n\\left[u_{m}^{d e f}, v_{n}\\right] w+\\left[u_{m}, v_{n}^{d e f}\\right] w=\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{m}{\\alpha}\\left(\\left(u_{\\alpha}^{d e f} v\\right)_{m+n-\\alpha} w+\\left(u_{\\alpha} v\\right)_{m+n-\\alpha}^{d e f} w\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $v_{n}=\\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} z^{n} Y(v, z)$ is the component of the vertex operator $Y$, and $\\left(u_{\\alpha} v\\right)_{m}^{d e f} w$ is defined via an analytic continuation process in case $u_{\\alpha} v \\notin S$ (see Section 3.2, Theorem 3.7), then $Y_{1}$ may be uniquely extended to a map $V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$, and for every $u, v \\in V$,\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(u \\otimes v ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nis a cocycle representing a cohomology class in $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$.\nThe above extension process is very general and does not really need $V$ to be freely generated. We need the assumption that $V$ is freely generated for two supporting theorems. The first one (Theorem 3.4) states that with the modification by a coboundary, we may assume that for $u, v \\in S, Y_{1}(u, x) v$ is completely determined by its singular parts. The second one (Theorem\n\n3.10) shows that other than the cocycles extended from the singular parts of the $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ for $u, v \\in S$, there do not exist any other nontrivial cocycles.\n\nOne of the key philosophies of proving the second theorem is to utilize the techniques of generating functions. Instead of focusing on the one-variable series $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ for $u, v \\in V$, we focus on the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n+1)} \\in S$, which is the analytic continuation of the sum of the series in the parenthesis to $\\left\\{\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}: z_{i} \\neq 0, z_{i} \\neq z_{j}, i \\neq j\\right\\}$. We show that the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function uniquely determines $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ for every $u, v \\in V$. Then, we formulate the $n$-variable cocycle equation in terms of the matrix coefficients of the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. The cocycle equation is indeed a linear nonhomogeneous system of equations. Under the assumption that $V$ is freely generated, we show that the complementary solutions of the cocycle equations are all coboundaries. Thus, it suffices to find a particular solution. The extension process with the commutator condition also follows the same philosophy. We construct the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function explicitly and show that it is a solution of the cocycle equation.\n\nTheorem 5.13 summarizes the main conclusions of the paper. We apply it to compute $H_{1 / 2}(V, V)$ for the following examples. If $V$ is the universal Virasoro VOA Vir $_{c}$ or the universal affine VOA $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{g})$ associated with a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra, we show that $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ is one-dimensional, corresponding to the deformation of central charge $c$, or the level $l$, respectively. If $V$ is the Heisenberg VOA $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{h})$ of rank $r$, we show that $\\operatorname{dim} H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)=\\binom{r}{3}$ when $l \\neq 0$, and $\\operatorname{dim} H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)=3\\binom{r+1}{3}$ when $l=0$. If $V$ is the universal Zamolodchikov VOA $W_{3}^{c}$, we show that $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ is one-dimensional for every $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe proofs of Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.10 fail when relations exist among the basis elements. We may still use the same procedure to construct cocycles. But there might exist a nontrivial cocycle contributed by a regular $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ for $u, v \\in S$. There might also exist a nontrivial cocycle contributed by a complementary solution of the cocycle equation. Nevertheless, the failure of the proofs precisely points out the direction of working out $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ when $V$ is not freely generated. We shall discuss it in the future.\n\nAs a by-product, we see that $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)=H_{\\infty}^{2}(V, V)$ when $V$ is freely generated. In other words, the weaker $1 / 2$-composable condition is equivalent to the much stronger $\\infty$-composable condition. So, the composable conditions assumed in the construction of cohomology theory might be naturally strengthened. In particular, it can be strengthened naturally to ensure the convergence of the operations involved in the definition of Gerstenhaber brackets of cochains, which is important for determining the integrability of first-order deformations. We shall also discuss Gerstenhaber brackets in the future.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the prerequisites of second cohomology and first-order deformations. Section 3 formulates the cocycles on generators, the generating functions of the cocycles, and the cocycle equation it should satisfy. We prove that the complementary solutions of the cocycle equation are all coboundaries. Sections 4 and 5 extend $Y_{1}$ from the generators to general elements in $V$ under the commutator condition. Section 6 computes the examples. We show that $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$\nAcknowledgements.

We will use the notation\n\n$$\nR\\left(\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, f\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\\right\\rangle\\right)\n$$\n\nfor the sum (or limit) of the complex series (4). We will use the notation\n\n$$\nE\\left(f\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nto denote the corresponding $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function (see [H1] and [Q2] for precise definitions), which may be viewed as the analytic continuation of the sum of the series $f\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$ with coefficients in $V$.\n\nRemark 2.5. It should be noted that (5) makes sense in the region\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}: z_{i} \\neq 0,1 \\leq i \\leq n, z_{i} \\neq z_{j}, 1 \\leq i<j \\leq n\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhile (4) may converge in a much smaller region. For example, let $V$ be a vertex algebra and $v^{\\prime} \\in V^{\\prime}, u_{1}, u_{2}, v \\in V$. Then\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) v\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nconverges absolutely in the region $\\left|z_{1}\\right|>\\left|z_{2}\\right|>0$; the series\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) v\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nconverges absolutely in the region $\\left|z_{2}\\right|>\\left|z_{1}\\right|>0$. Since the regions of convergence of these two series do not intersect, we cannot equate them. However, we may say that\n\n$$\nR\\left(\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) v\\right\\rangle\\right)=R\\left(\\left\\langle v^{\\prime}, Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) v\\right\\rangle\\right)\n$$\n\nbecause these two series converge to a common rational function. We may also say that\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) v\\right)=E\\left(Y\\left(u_{2}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) v\\right)\n$$\n\nwhen $z_{1} \\neq 0, z_{2} \\neq 0, z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$, since these two series converge to the same $\\bar{V}$-valued rational functions.\n\nRemark 2.6. Many calculations on the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational functions rely on the convergence of one single series. Once we know the convergence of one series, then we may use an argument of analytic continuation to show the convergence of many other series. For example, once we show that products of vertex operators converge, then by an analytic continuation argument using [Q1] Lemma 4.5, we may prove that the iterates of vertex operators converge (see [Q1] Theorem 4.12). The details of these analytic continuations are too lengthy to include in this manuscript. Interested readers should consult [Q1], [Q2], [HQ] and [Q3] that included many such details.\n2.4. First-order deformation. Recall that a first-order deformation of a grading-restricted vertex algebra $(V, Y, \\mathbf{1})$ is defined by an operator\n\n$$\nY_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))\n$$\n\nsuch that the vector space $V^{t}=\\mathbb{C}[t] /\\left(t^{2}\\right) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}} V$, with the vertex operator\n\n$$\nY^{t}(u, x) v=Y(u, x) v+t Y_{1}(u, x) v\n$$\n\nand the vacuum element $\\mathbf{1}$, i.e., $\\left(V^{t}, Y^{t}, \\mathbf{1}\\right)$, forms a grading-restricted vertex algebra over the base ring $\\mathbb{C}[t] /\\left(t^{2}\\right)$. This requires that $Y_{1}$ satisfies the following conditions.\n(1) The grading of $V^{t}$ is automatically bounded below. The $\\mathbf{d}$-commutator formula of $Y^{t}$ implies that the $\\mathbf{d}$-commutator formula of $Y_{1}$.

In the paper [H1] and [H2], Huang showed that the equivalence classes of first-order deformations are described by the second cohomology $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ of vertex algebras. Here we shall not give a detailed review of the definitions of 2-cocycles and 2-coboundaries, but only mention what is necessary for the current paper. For brevity, we will omit the 2-prefix and simply use cocycles and coboundaries.\n\nGiven a $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V\\left[\\left[x, x^{-1}\\right]\\right]$ satisfying (1) - (6) in Section 2.4, we may obtain a cocycle in the cohomology $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(v_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v_{2}, z_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nConversely, every element in $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ may be represented by a cocycle satisfying\n\n$$\n\\Psi\\left(v \\otimes \\mathbf{1} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=\\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{1} \\otimes v ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=0\n$$\n\n(see $[\\mathrm{H} 2]$ and its addendum $[\\mathrm{H} 3]$ ). We may define\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(v_{1}, x\\right) v_{2}=\\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; x, 0\\right)\n$$\n\nand see that it satisfies (1) - (6). It should be noted that the convergence requirement in (5) precisely corresponds to the $1 / 2$-composable condition defined in [H1]. It should also be noted that the cocycle $\\Psi$ satisfies the following Harrison relation\n\n$$\n\\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=\\Psi\\left(v_{2} \\otimes v_{1} ; z_{2}, z_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nand the $D$-derivative properties\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Psi\\left(D v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right) & =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{1}} \\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right) \\\\\n\\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes D v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right) & =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{2}} \\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nD \\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{1}}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{2}}\\right) \\Psi\\left(v_{1} \\otimes v_{2} ; z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor every homogeneous map $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$ that commutes with $D$, the map\n\n$$\n\\Phi(v ; z)=e^{z D} \\phi(v)\n$$\n\nforms a 1-cochain that is composable with one vertex operator.

We use the notation $Y_{\\phi}\\left(v_{1}, z_{1}\\right) v_{2}$ for (11). The first-order deformation given by $Y_{1}=Y_{\\phi}$ is equivalent to that given by $Y_{1}=0$.\n\nRemark 2.9. Since we started with the assumption that $Y_{1}(v, x) \\mathbf{1}=Y_{1}(\\mathbf{1}, x) v=0$, when we determine if $Y_{1}$ is given by a coboundary $Y_{\\phi}$, it is necessary to restrict that $\\phi(\\mathbf{1})=0$ to make sure that $Y_{\\phi}$ gives a first-order (trivial) deformation.",

      "text": "# 3. THE COCYCLE EQUATION AND ITS COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTION \n\nIn this section, $V$ is a grading-restricted vertex algebra that is freely generated by the set $S$. The linear map $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$ satisfies the conditions (1) - (6) in Section 2.4.\n3.1. Regular part of the cocycle on the generators. We start from analyzing the regular part $Y_{1}^{+}$of a cocycle $Y_{1}$. We show that it is possible to pick a representative, such that the regular part of $Y_{1}$ is determined by its singular part $Y_{1}^{-}$.\n\nProposition 3.1. Fix $a, b \\in S$. Then there exists a homogeneous linear map $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$ (depending on $a, b$ ) such that $\\phi$ commutes with $D$, and\n\n$$\nY_{1}(a, x) b=Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a-Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b\\right)+Y_{\\phi}(a, x) b\n$$\n\nProof. We first notice from the skew-symmetry of $Y_{1}$ that\n\n$$\ne^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a-Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b=Y_{1}^{+}(a, x) b-e^{x D} Y_{1}^{+}(b,-x) a\n$$\n\ncontains no negative powers of $x$. In particular, the singular part of $e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b$ coincides with $Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b$. To construct the homogeneous linear map $\\phi$, we consider the series\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x) b & =Y_{1}(a, x) b-Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a-Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b\\right) \\\\\n& =Y_{1}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a-\\frac{1}{2} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b \\\\\n& =Y_{1}^{+}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a+\\frac{1}{2} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nClearly, $\\widetilde{Y}_{1}$ contains no negative powers of $x$. Moreover,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^{x D} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}(b,-x) a & =e^{x D}\\left(Y_{1}(b,-x) a-\\frac{1}{2} e^{-x D} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a\\right) \\\\\n& =Y_{1}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x) b-\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a=\\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x) b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $Y_{1}$ satisfies $D$-derivative property and $D$-commutator formula, so does $Y_{1}^{+}$and $Y_{1}^{-}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\left[D, \\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x)\\right] b } & =\\left[D, Y_{1}(a, x)\\right] b-\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} D Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a+\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(D b,-x) a-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[D, Y_{1}^{-}(a, x)\\right] b \\\\\n& =\\frac{d}{d x} Y_{1}(a, x)-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{d x}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a\\right)-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{d x} Y_{1}^{-}(a, x)=\\frac{d}{d x} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x) b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing\n\n$$\nD Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) a=Y_{1}^{-}(D b,-x) a+Y_{1}^{-}(b,-x) D a\n$$\n\nwe may also conclude that\n\n$$\n\\left[D, \\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x) b\\right]=\\widetilde{Y}_{1}(D a, x) b\n$$\n\nSo $\\widetilde{Y}_{1}$ also satisfies $D$-derivative property and $D$-commutator formula. Using these properties, we see that the series\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, z_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}=\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, z_{1}\\right) e^{z_{2}} b=e^{z_{2} D} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) b\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function that is indeed holomorphic everywhere. With skewsymmetry of $\\widetilde{Y}_{1}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE\\left(\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, z_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right) & =E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) b\\right)=E\\left(e^{z_{1} D} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(b,-z_{1}+z_{2}\\right) a\\right) \\\\\n& =E\\left(\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(b, z_{2}\\right) e^{z_{1} D} a\\right)=E\\left(\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(b, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a, z_{1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function has no singularities, we see that as power series in $V\\left[\\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\\right]\\right]$,\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}=\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a, x_{1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nWe define $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$ by specifying that\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(a_{-m_{1}} b_{-m_{2}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)=-\\operatorname{Res}_{x_{1}, x_{2}=0} x_{1}^{-m_{1}} x_{2}^{-m_{2}} \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nand for every other basis element $v$ of the form (1),\n\n$$\n\\phi(v)=0\n$$\n\nNote that $\\phi$ constructed in the proof annihilates $E_{\\mathrm{wt}(a)+\\mathrm{wt}(b)-1}^{S}$. Note also that (13) guarantees that\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(a_{-m_{1}} b_{-m_{2}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)=\\phi\\left(b_{-m_{2}} a_{-m_{1}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nSo the choice of $\\phi$ does not depend on the ordering of $a, b$ in $S$.\nTo check that $\\phi$ commutes with $D$, we use the $D$-derivative property and $D$-commutator formula,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1} & =\\left[D, \\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right)\\right] Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}+\\widetilde{Y}_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right)\\left[D, Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right)\\right] \\mathbf{1} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(b, x_{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTaking $\\operatorname{Res}_{x_{1}, x_{2}=0} x_{1}^{-m_{1}} x_{2}^{-m_{2}}$, we see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD \\phi\\left(a_{-m_{1}} b_{-m_{2}} \\mathbf{1}\\right) & =m_{1} \\phi\\left(a_{-m_{1}-1} b_{-m_{2}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)+m_{2} \\phi\\left(a_{-m_{1}} b_{-m_{2}-1} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\phi\\left(D a_{-m_{1}} b_{-m_{2}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\phi$ commutes with $D$. To conclude the proof, we calculate that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{\\phi}(a, x) b & =Y(\\phi(a), x) b-\\phi(Y(a, x) b)+Y(a, x) \\phi(b) \\\\\n& =-\\sum_{m \\geq 1} \\phi\\left(a_{-m} b_{-1} \\mathbf{1}\\right) x^{m-1}=\\widetilde{Y}_{1}(a, x) b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, with the so-defined $\\phi,(12)$ holds.\nRemark 3.2. Clearly, $Y_{\\phi}$ also satisfies the skew-symmetry. So for fixed $a, b \\in S$, if (12) holds, then\n\n$$\nY(b, x) a=Y_{1}^{-}(b, x) a+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}(a,-x) b-Y_{1}^{-}(b, x) a\\right)+Y_{\\phi}(b, x) a\n$$\n\nalso holds.\nProposition 3.3. Let $S=\\left\\{a^{(1)}, \\ldots, a^{(r)}\\right\\}$. Then there exists an operator $Y_{1}^{(r, r)}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$, such that\n(1) $Y_{1}^{(r, r)}$ satisfies $(1)-(6)$ in Section 2.4.\n(2) There exists a homogeneous linear map $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$ such that\n\n$$\nY_{1}(u, x) v=Y_{1}^{(r, r)}(u, x) v+Y_{\\phi}(u, x) v\n$$\n\nfor every $u, v \\in V$.\n(3) For every $1 \\leq i, j \\leq r$,\n\n$$\nY_{1}^{(r, r)}\\left(a^{(i)}, z\\right) a^{(j)}=Y_{1}^{(r, r),-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z\\right) a^{(j)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{(r, r),-}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}-Y_{1}^{(r, r),-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exists a coboundary $\\delta \\Phi$ such that for every $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq r$,\n$Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z\\right) a^{(j)}=Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z\\right) a^{(j)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}-Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)+(\\delta \\Phi)\\left(a^{(i)} \\otimes a^{(j)} ; z, 0\\right)$.\nwhere $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ is the singular part of $Y_{1}$, i.e., the part consisting only negative powers. In other words, the cohomology class of $Y_{1}$ can be represented by its singular parts.\n\nProof. Without loss of generality, we assume that wt $a^{(i)} \\leq$ wt $a^{(j)}$ for every $1 \\leq i<j \\leq r$. Arrange a linear order on 2-tuple of numbers in $\\{1, \\ldots, r\\}$ by $(1,1)<\\cdots<(1, r)<(2,1)<\\cdots<$ $(2, r)<\\cdots<(r, 1)<\\cdots<(r, r)$. We also identify $(i, r+1)$ with $(i+1,1)$ for every $i=1, \\ldots, r-1$. We use Proposition 3.1 to find a homogeneous linear map $\\phi_{1,1}: V \\rightarrow V$ such that $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}-Y_{\\phi_{1,1}}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}=Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(1)},-x\\right) a^{(1)}-Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}\\right)$ We set $Y_{1}^{(1,1)}(u, x) v=Y_{1}(u, x) v-Y_{\\phi_{1,1}}(u, x) v$. Then clearly, $Y_{1}^{(1,1)}$ is still an operator satisfying (1) - (6) in Section 2.4. Also, the singular part of $Y_{1}^{(1,1)}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}$ coincides with $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}$. Thus, from the defining formula, we have\n\n$$\nY_{1}^{(1,1)}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(1)}=Y_{1}^{(1,1),-}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{(1,1),-}\\left(a^{(1)},-x\\right) a^{(1)}-Y_{1}^{(1,1),-}\\left(a^{(1)}, a^{(1)}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nWe remark that for every $(i, j)>(1,1), Y_{\\phi_{(11)}}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ constructed in the base step can bring forth additional singular terms. Indeed, if for some $m \\geq 0, a_{m}^{(1)} a^{(2)}$ is a linear combination of $a_{-n_{1}}^{(1)} a_{-n_{2}}^{(1)} \\mathbf{1}$, then\n\n$$\nY_{\\phi_{1,1}}\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(2)}=-\\phi\\left(Y\\left(a^{(1)}, x\\right) a^{(2)}\\right)\n$$\n\nwould include a linear combination of\n\n$$\n-\\phi\\left(a_{-n_{1}}^{(1)} a_{-n_{2}}^{(1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) x^{-m-1}\n$$\n\nTherefore, to continue with construction, we have to start with $Y_{1}^{(1,1)}$ instead of $Y_{1}$, to incorporate these potential extra singular terms.\n\nGenerally, having constructed $Y_{1}^{(i, j)}$ and $Y_{1}^{\\left(i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}\\right)}$ for every $\\left(i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}\\right)<(i, j)$ satisfying the conditions, we use Proposition 3.1 to find a homogeneous map $\\phi_{i, j+1}: V \\rightarrow V$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y_{1}^{(i, j)}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j+1)}-Y_{\\phi_{i, j+1}}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j+1)} \\\\\n= & Y_{1}^{(i, j),-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j+1)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{(i, j),-}\\left(a^{(j+1)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}-Y_{1}^{(i, j),-}\\left(a^{(i)}, a^{(j+1)}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSet $Y_{1}^{(i, j+1)}(u, x) v=Y_{1}^{(i, j)}(u, x) v-Y_{\\phi_{i, j+1}}(u, x) v$.

Thus the inductive step of the construction is proved. Repeating the process, we find the operator $Y_{1}^{(r, r)}$ satisfying the required conditions.\n\nTheorem 3.4. Let $V$ be a vertex algebra that is freely generated by $S=\\left\\{a^{(1)}, \\ldots, a^{(r)}\\right\\}$. Then, every cohomology class in in $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ is represented by a map $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$, such that (1) $Y_{1}$ satisfies (1) - (6) in Section 2.4.\n(2) For every $1 \\leq i, j \\leq r$,\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}=Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}-Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)\n$$\n\n(3) For every $p \\in \\mathbb{N}, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(p)}, u, v \\in S, Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{p+1}\\right) v$ converges absolutely to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function.\n(4) For every $s, u, v \\in S, Y_{1}\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v$ convnerges absolutely to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function.\n\nProof. Let $\\Psi$ be a cocycle. Let $\\bar{Y}_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$ be the map corresponding to $\\Psi$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{1}(u, z) v=\\Psi(u \\otimes v ; z, 0)\n$$\n\nLet $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$ be the operator $\\bar{Y}_{1}{ }^{(r, r)}$ obtained in Proposition 3.3. Then clearly, $Y_{1}$ satisfies Conditions (1) and (2).\n\nWe proceed to check Condition (3). Fix $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq r$, then for $u=a^{(i)}, v=a^{(j)}$, since $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ contains finitely many terms,\n\n$$\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nis a finite sum of\n\n$$\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right)\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(j)} z_{p+1}^{-m-1}\n$$\n\nRecall from [FHL] Section 3.5 (also see [Q1], Theorem 3.4) that the product of any numbers of vertex operators converge to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Thus, the series converges absolutely to a finite sum of $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Similarly, since $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ contains only finitely many terms,\n\n$$\ne^{z_{p+1} D} Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{p+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}-z_{p+1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. By an argument using $D$-conjugation property and analytic continuation, we see that\n\n$$\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) e^{z_{p+1} D} Y^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nconverges absolutely to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Thus Condition (3) holds for $u=a^{(i)}, v=$ $a^{(j)}$ with $i \\leq j$. For the case $u=a^{(j)}, v=a^{(i)}$ with $i<j$, by skew-symmetry,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y\\left(u, z_{p+1}\\right) v \\\\\n=Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) e^{z_{p+1} D} Y\\left(a^{(i)},-z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(j)}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIts convergence follows from the convergence of\n\n$$\ne^{z_{p+1} D} Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{p+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}-z_{p+1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)},-z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nand an argument of analytic continuation. Thus Condition (3) holds for $u=a^{(j)}, v=a^{(i)}$ with $i<j$.\n\nTo check Condition (4), we evaluate $u_{1}=s, u_{2}=u, v=v$ in the cocycle equation (6) satisfied by $Y_{1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v+Y\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(s, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) u, z_{2}\\right) v+Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) u, z_{2}\\right) v\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn particular, the series\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v+Y\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. By Condition (3), the second summand $Y\\left(s, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{2}\\right) v$ converges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Thus so is the first summand.\n\nRemark 3.5. (1) Theorem 3.4 reduces the computation of $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ into the computation of its singular part\n\n$$\nY_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}=\\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(j)} x^{-m-1}\n$$\n\nthat consists of finitely many terms. For any fixed $m,\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(j)}$ is in the homogeneous subspace of weight wt $a^{(i)}-m-1+\\mathrm{wt} a^{(j)}$. Therefore, the number of free variables appearing $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ is at most $\\sum_{m \\geq 1} \\operatorname{dim} V_{\\left(\\mathrm{wt}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)-m-1+\\mathrm{wt}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)\\right)}$.\n(2) When $u, v$ are generators in $S$, the skew-symmetry is the only condition $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ should satisfy. In case $i>j, Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ should be identical to $e^{x D} Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}$ and thus is determined. In case $i=j$, the skew-symmetry further reduces the number of free variables.\n(3) The proof of Proposition 3.1 fails when there exists relations among the basis elements. For example, when $V$ is the simple affine VOA associated with $\\mathfrak{s l}_{2}$ of level 1 , then $e(-1)^{2} \\mathbf{1}$ is a singular vector. The construction of $\\phi$ in Proposition 3.1 requires that $\\phi$ sends $e(-1)^{2} \\mathbf{1}$ to the constant term of $Y_{1}(e(-1) \\mathbf{1}, x) e(-1) \\mathbf{1}$. If the constant term is nonzero, then $\\phi$ is\n\nnot well-defined. In other words, the regular part may represent a nontrivial cocycle in the cohomology group.\n\nProposition 3.6. For $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq r$, the components of the regular parts of $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$ and $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x\\right) a^{(i)}$ admit the following formula: for each $n \\geq 1$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a^{(j)}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{n+\\alpha}}{(n+\\alpha)!}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\binom{n+\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)} \\\\\n& \\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a^{(i)}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{n+\\alpha}}{(n+\\alpha)!}(-1)^{\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. We first note that since $Y_{1}$ satisfies skew symmetry, it is necessary that\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x\\right) a^{(i)}=e^{x D} Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)},-x\\right) a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nthe right-hand-side of which is computed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{\\alpha} D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{n}^{d e f} a^{(j)}(-x)^{-n-1}=\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{n}^{d e f} a^{(j)}(-1)^{n+1} x^{-n+\\alpha-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}(-1)^{n+\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{n+\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right) x^{-n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo for every $n \\geq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{n}^{d e f} a^{(i)}=\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}(-1)^{n+\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{n+\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\n$$\n\nWe now compute regular part of (14), which is contributed only by $\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}$. We compute $\\frac{1}{2} e^{x D} Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)},-x\\right) a^{(i)}$ as follows.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{\\alpha} D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!} \\sum_{n \\geq 0}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{n}^{d e f} a^{(i)}(-x)^{-n-1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!} \\sum_{n+\\alpha \\geq 0}(-1)^{n+\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{n+\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(i)} x^{-n-1} \\\\\n= & \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n \\geq 0}\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}(-1)^{n+\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{n+\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(i)}\\right) x^{-n-1}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{n \\geq 1}\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha \\geq n} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}(-1)^{\\alpha-n+1}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{\\alpha-n}^{d e f} a^{(i)}\\right) x^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a^{(j)}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq n} \\frac{D^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}(-1)^{\\alpha-n+1}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{\\alpha-n}^{d e f} a^{(i)}\n$$\n\nThis essentially implies (16) (simply swap $i$ and $j$ ). To obtain (15), we reorganize the sum over $\\alpha \\geq n$ to the sum over $\\alpha \\geq 0$, then use (17),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a^{(j)} & ==\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{n+\\alpha}}{(n+\\alpha)!}(-1)^{\\alpha+1}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(i)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{n+\\alpha}}{(n+\\alpha)!}(-1)^{\\alpha+1} \\sum_{\\beta \\geq 0} \\frac{D^{\\beta}}{\\beta!}(-1)^{\\alpha+\\beta+1}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha+\\beta}^{d e f} a^{(j)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha \\geq 0} D^{n+\\alpha}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)} \\sum_{\\beta=0}^{\\alpha} \\frac{(-1)^{\\beta}}{(n+\\alpha-\\beta)!\\beta!}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing the identity\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\beta=0}^{\\alpha} \\frac{(-1)^{\\beta}}{(n+\\alpha-\\beta)!\\beta!}=\\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{(n+\\alpha)!}\\binom{\\alpha+n-1}{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nwe obtain Formula (15).\n3.2. Generating function approach. Instead of determining the $Y_{1}(u, z) v$ for $u, v$ ranging in the basis of $V$ given by (1), we will determine the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor each $s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n)} \\in S$.

The conclusion clearly holds when $p=1$. Assume the statement holds for every $a_{-m_{1}}^{(i_{1})} \\cdots a_{-m_{p}}^{(i_{p})} \\mathbf{1}$ with lower filtration, we use the cocycle condition to form an inductive argument.

So are the individual terms.\n\nRemark 3.8. The generating function approach implicitly requires that (18) is well-defined, i.e., the corresponding series converges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. This convergence is automatic when $Y_{1}$ is a cocycle representing a class in $H_{\\infty}^{2}(V, V)$. We shall see in the subsequent sections that when $V$ is freely-generated, the convergence also holds automatically. In other words, $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)=H_{\\infty}^{2}(V, V)$.\n\n3.3. Multivariable cocycle equation. We determine the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function (18) by induction on wt $s^{(1)}+\\mathrm{wt} s^{(2)}+\\cdots+\\mathrm{wt} s^{(n+1)}$.\n3.3.1. The base case. In this case, $n=2$ and wt $s^{(1)}+\\mathrm{wt} s^{(2)}+\\mathrm{wt} s^{(3)}$ is minimal, where (18) reduces to\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)\n$$\n\nTheorem 3.4 Part (3) guarantees that the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function is well-defined. The series inside the parenthesis splits into\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}+Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\n$$\n\nThe minimal requirement implies that $Y^{-}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}$ can only basis elements of the form $s_{-m_{1}} \\mathbf{1}$ for some $s \\in S$. Then, $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}$ is determined by $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(2)}, x\\right) s(s \\in S)$ and the $D$ derivative property (9). From Theorem 3.4, it is clear that $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}$ converges absolutely to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Therefore, so is $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}$.\n\nWith these convergence results, the cocycle equation (6) with $u_{1}=s^{(1)}, u_{2}=s^{(2)}, v=s^{(3)}$ can now be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)+E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(3)},-z_{2}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) s^{(2)}\\right)+E\\left(e^{z_{3} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(3)},-z_{2}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) s^{(2)}\\right) \\\\\n& +E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y\\left(s^{(3)},-z_{3}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) s^{(2)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the convergence of the right-hand-side follows from the same argument. The problem of determining (18) reduces to determining\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor each $s^{(1)}, s^{(2)}, s^{(3)} \\in S$, we would set (23) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{s^{(1)} s^{(2)} s^{(3)}}^{0}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{3}}\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{2}}} \\mathbf{1}+\\sum_{\\substack{1 \\leq j \\leq r \\\\\nm \\geq 1}} \\frac{p_{s^{(1)} s^{(2)} s^{(3)}}^{i(m)}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{3}}\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{2}}} a_{-m}^{(i)} \\mathbf{1} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{\\substack{1 \\leq j \\leq r \\\\\nm_{k} \\geq \\cdots \\geq m_{k+k^{\\prime}} \\text { if } j_{k-1}<j_{k}=\\cdots=j_{k+k^{\\prime}}<j_{k+k^{\\prime}+1}} \\frac{p_{s^{(1)} s^{(2)} s^{(3)}}^{j_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right) \\cdots j_{p}\\left(m_{p}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{3}}\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{2}}} a_{-m_{1}}^{(j_{1})} \\cdots\\left(a_{j_{p}}\\right)_{-m_{p}} \\mathbf{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese polynomials should satisfy equation (22).\n\nRemark 3.9. We introduced these infinitely many polynomials to understand the cocycle equation (22). By no means shall we attempt to solve them directly.\n\n3.3.2. Checking the convergence. Once we understand (23) (and therefore (21)) for each $s^{(1)}, s^{(2)}, s^{(3)} \\in$ $S$ with minimal total weight, we should check that the series\n\n$$\nY\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(u_{m}, z_{m}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{m+1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{m+2}\\right) s^{(3)}\n$$\n\nconverges in $\\left|z_{1}\\right|>\\cdots>\\left|z_{m+2}\\right|>0$ to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function for each $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m} \\in S$. The convergence is needed to guarantee the existence of certain $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. We shall explain a simple case, that the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)\n$$\n\nis well-defined. The argument can be easily generalized to arbitrarily many variables. To see this, recall from [FHL] Section 3.5 (also see [Q1], Theorem 3.4) that the product of any numbers of vertex operators converge to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Therefore, the coefficient of each power of $t$ of the complex series\n\n$$\n\\left(Y\\left(u, z_{1}\\right)+t Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{1}\\right)\\right)\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right)+t Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right)\\right)\\left(Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right)+t Y_{1}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right)\\right) s^{(3)}\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Take out the coefficient of $t$, we see that $E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}+Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}+Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)$ is well-defined. From Theorem 3.4 Part (3), the rear part $E\\left(Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)$ is well-defined. From our assumption, the middle part $E\\left(Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)$ is well-defined. Therefore, the initial part $E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{3}\\right) s^{(3)}\\right)$ is well-defined. Since the singular parts reduces the filtration, we conclude that (26) is well-defined as a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function.\n3.3.3. The n-variable cocycle equation. Fix $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$. Assume that we have computed the $\\bar{V}$ valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(t^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(t^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(t^{(m)}, z_{m}\\right) t^{(m+1)}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, t^{(1)}, \\ldots, t^{(m+1)} \\in S$ with wt $t^{(1)}+\\cdots+$ wt $t^{(m+1)}<N$. Assume also that we have shown the convergence of the series\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\n$$\n\nfor every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n+1)} \\in S$ such that wt $s^{(1)}+\\cdots+$ wt $s^{(n+1)}=N$. (the base case is proved in the previous section). We analyze its limiting $\\bar{V}$-valued rational functions by studying a variant of the cocycle equation (6).\n\nSubstitute\n\n$$\nz_{2}=z_{n}, u_{1}=s^{(1)}, u_{2}=Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}, v=s^{(n+1)}\n$$\n\nin the cocycle equation (6), using our assumption on convergence, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe convergence assumption allows us to distribute $E$ to the two summands on the left-hand-side. We may further use associativity, skew-symmetry, and an argument of analytic continuation to disribute $E$ to the two summands on the right-hand-side, and reorganize the iterates on the both sides as products. The cocycle equation is therefore reorganized as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right) \\\\\n& +E\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right) \\\\\n& +E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo analyze the equation, we observe the following:\n\n- (27) may be separated as the sum of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right) \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k=2}^{n} E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(k-1)}, z_{k-1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(k)}, z_{k}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $V$ is freely generated by $S$, from Remark 2.3 , for every $k=2, \\ldots, n$, the coefficients of the series\n\n$$\nY^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(k-1)}, z_{k-1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(k)}, z_{k}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\n$$\n\nare in $E_{N-1}^{S}$. So the sum of the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function (32) is determined by previous computation.\n\n- Similarly, (29) may be separated as the sum of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right) \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k=2}^{n} E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(k-1)}, z_{k-1}-z_{n}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(s^{(k)}, z_{k}-z_{n}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly as above, (34) is also determined by previous computation.\n\nIn summary, the cocycle equation $(27)+(28)=(29)+(30)$ is now rewritten as $(31)+(32)+$ $(28)=(33)+(34)+(30)$, where $(32),(28),(34)$, and $(30)$ are all determined by previous computation.\n3.3.4. The ansatz for the solution the $n$-variable cocycle equation. To study the structure of the solutions of the cocycle equation $(31)+(32)+(28)=(33)+(34)+(30)$, for every choice of $s^{(1)}, s^{(2)}, \\ldots, s^{(n+1)} \\in S$, we set $(31)$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{p_{s^{(1)} \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{(0)}}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}} \\mathbf{1}+\\sum_{\\substack{1 \\leq j \\leq r \\\\\nm \\geq 1}} \\frac{p_{s^{(1)} \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{j(m)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}} a_{-m}^{(j)}} \\mathbf{1} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{\\substack{l \\geq 2,1 \\leq j_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq j_{l} \\leq l, m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{r} \\geq 1, \\\\\nm_{k} \\geq \\cdots \\geq m_{k+k^{\\prime}} \\text { if } j_{k-1}<j_{k}=\\cdots=j_{k+k^{\\prime}}<j_{k+k^{\\prime}+1}}} \\frac{p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{j_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right)\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}} a_{-m_{1}}^{(j_{1})} \\cdots a_{-m_{l}}^{(j_{l})}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{j_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$ are homogeneous polynomial functions, $w_{k}=\\mathrm{wt} s^{(k)}$ for $k=$ $1, \\ldots, n+1$. Note that (33) is uniquely determined by (31), we see that the equation $(31)+(32)+$ $(28)=(33)+(34)+(30)$ defines a linear nonhomogeneous system of equations concerning the coefficients of the polynomials $p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{j_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$ for $1 \\leq j_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq j_{l} \\leq l, m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{l} \\geq 1$.\n\nWe determine the degree of $p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{j_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)$ explicitly.

Complementary solutions are coboundaries. It is know from elementary linear algebra that the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear system of equations is the sum of a particular solution and the complementary solution, namely, the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous linear system. In our case, the homogeneous system is given by $(31)=(33)$. A solution of the homogeneous system can be viewed a cocycle $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$, such that\n(1) (31) makes sense for every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n+1)} \\in S$ with $\\mathrm{wt} s^{(1)}+\\cdots+\\mathrm{wt} s^{(n+1)}=N$.\n\n(2) For every $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, t^{(1)}, \\ldots, t^{(m+1)} \\in S$ with $\\mathrm{wt} t^{(1)}+\\cdots+\\mathrm{wt} t^{(m+1)}<N$,\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(t^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(t^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(t^{(m)}, z_{m}\\right) t^{(m+1)}=0\n$$\n\nIn this section we shall focus on the homogeneous system and prove the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.10.

From the coefficient of $\\mathbf{1}$ of the equation, we see that\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{(0)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)}{z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}}=\\frac{p_{s^{(n+1) s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n)}}}^{(0)}\\left(-z_{n}, z_{1}-z_{n}, \\ldots, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right)}{\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{n}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{k+1}}}\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides out, we see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{(0)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{n}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{k+1}} \\\\\n= & p_{s^{(n+1) s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n)}}}^{(0)}\\left(-z_{n}, z_{1}-z_{n}, \\ldots, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, it is necessary that\n\n$$\n\\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}} \\text { divides } p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{(0)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, from (36), $\\operatorname{deg} p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}}^{(0)}=n(n-1) w_{1}$ that is strictly smaller than $\\operatorname{deg} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-\\right.$ $\\left.z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}=(n-1) w_{1}+w_{2}+\\cdots+w_{k}$.

However, since the coefficients of lower weights elements are all polynomials, the identity (37) is now modified as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{s^{(1)} \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{i_{1}\\left(m_{1}\\right) \\ldots i_{l}\\left(m_{l}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{n}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{k+1}} \\\\\n= & p_{s^{(n+1)} s^{(1)} \\ldots s^{(n)}}^{(1)}\\left(-z_{n}, z_{1}-z_{n}, \\ldots, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n+\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{n}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{n+1}+w_{k+1}} \\cdot z_{1}^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k}} \\cdot(\\text { some polynomial })\n$$\n\nthe identity (40) is now modified as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{s^{(3) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}{ }_{s^{(1)}}^{\\left(m_{1}\\right) \\ldots i_{l}\\left(m_{l}\\right)}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{n}\\right)\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k+2}} \\\\\n= & p_{s^{(1) \\ldots s^{(n+1)}}^{\\left(i_{1}\\right) \\ldots i_{l}\\left(m_{l}\\right)}\\left(-z_{n}, z_{1}-z_{n}, \\ldots, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) z_{1}^{w_{2}+w_{1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{2}+w_{k+1}} \\\\\n& +\\left(-z_{n}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{n+1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{1}+w_{k+2}} \\cdot z_{1}^{w_{2}+w_{1}} \\prod_{k=2}^{n}\\left(z_{1}-z_{k}\\right)^{w_{2}+w_{k+1}} \\cdot(\\text { some polynomial })\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the divisible relation (43) still holds.\nSo we showed that the coefficients of all elements in the (35) are polynomial functions. Thus, (31) is a $\\bar{V}$-valued polynomial function.\n\nProposition 3.12. Let $Y_{1}$ be as in Theorem 3.10. Then for every $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, v^{\\prime} \\in V, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n)}, s^{(n+1)} \\in$ $S$ and every permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, \\ldots, n+1\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(\\sigma(1))}, z_{\\sigma(1)}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(\\sigma(2))}, z_{\\sigma(2)}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(\\sigma(r))}, z_{\\sigma(r)}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(\\sigma(n+1))}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. From the creation property and an argument of analytic continuation, we know that the series\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. Moreover, From the commutativity of the vertex operators, using an argument of analytic continuation, we see that for every permutation $\\sigma$ on $\\{2, \\ldots, n, n+1\\}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right) \\\\\n=E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(\\sigma(2))}, z_{\\sigma(2)}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(\\sigma(r))}, z_{\\sigma(r)}\\right) s^{(n+1)}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nUsing the assumption that $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(i)}, z\\right)$ annihilates any element in $E_{N-1}^{S}$, we may replace all the $Y$ 's by $Y^{+}$, to obtain the conclusion for any permutaiton $\\sigma$ of $\\{2, \\ldots, n, n+1\\}$.\n\nIt remains to show the equality for $\\sigma=(12)$. Again from the commutativity of vertex operator, using an argument of analytic continuation, we see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(e^{z_{n} D} Y_{1}\\left(s^{(n+1)},-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{n}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n-1)}, z_{n-1}-z_{n}\\right) s^{(n)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAgain we may replace $Y$ by $Y^{+}$. The conclusion then follows from the equation $(31)=(33)$.\n\nProof of Theorem 3.10. Construct a 1-cochain by defining a linear homogeneous map $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$, such that\n$\\phi\\left(s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right)=-\\operatorname{Res}_{z_{1}=0} z_{1}^{-m_{1}} \\cdots \\operatorname{Res}_{z_{n+1}=0} z_{n+1}^{-m_{n+1}} E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)$ for every $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(n+1)} \\in S$, and\n\n$$\n\\phi(v)=0\n$$\n\nfor any other basis element $v$. In particular, we note that $\\phi$ annihilates $E_{N}^{S}$ for every $N<$ wt $s^{(1)}+\\cdots+$ wt $s^{(n+1)}$.\n\nWe check that $\\phi$ is well-defined. From Formula (3.1.9) in [LL], for every permutation $\\sigma \\in$ $\\operatorname{Sym}\\{1, \\ldots, n+1\\}$, the difference of $s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}$ and $s_{-m_{\\sigma(1)}}^{(n+1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{\\sigma(n+1)}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}$ differs by an element in $E_{N}^{S}$ for $N \\leq$ wt $s^{(1)}+\\cdots+$ wt $s^{(n+1)}-1$ that is annihilated by $\\phi$. Therefore, $\\phi$ is well-defined if and only if\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right)=\\phi\\left(s_{-m_{\\sigma(1)}}^{(n+1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{\\sigma(n+1)}}^{(\\sigma(n+1) \\mathbf{1}} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nBut this is guaranteed by Proposition 3.12.\nWe check that $\\phi$ commutes with $D$. From the $D$-derivative property (10) of $Y_{1}$ and that of $Y$, we have\n$D E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{1}}+\\cdots+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{n+1}}\\right) E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)$\nTaking $\\operatorname{Res}_{z_{1}=0} z_{1}^{-m_{1}} \\cdots \\operatorname{Res}_{z_{n+1}=0} z_{n+1}^{-m_{n+1}}$ on both sides, we see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& D \\phi\\left(s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} m_{i} \\phi\\left(s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{i}-1}^{(i)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}-1}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\phi\\left(D s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $\\phi$ commutes with $D$. Now we consider the coboundary defined by $\\phi$. We study the coboundary $\\delta \\Phi$ corresponding to $\\phi$ using (11). Since $\\phi$ annihilates $E_{N}^{S}$ for every $N<$ wt $s^{(1)}+$ $\\cdots+$ wt $s^{(n+1)}, Y_{1}\\left(\\phi\\left(s^{(1)}\\right), x\\right) s_{m_{2}}^{(2)} \\cdots s_{m_{n}}^{(n)} s^{(n+1)}$ and $Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, x\\right) \\phi\\left(s_{m_{2}}^{(2)} \\cdots s_{m_{n}}^{(n)} s^{(n+1)}\\right)$ are both zero for every $m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (\\delta \\Phi)\\left(s^{(1)} \\otimes Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}-z_{n+1}\\right) s^{(n+1)} ; z_{1}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(-\\phi\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}-z_{n+1}\\right) s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(-\\phi\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}\\right) Y\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & -E\\left(\\sum_{m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\phi\\left(s_{m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) z_{1}^{-m_{1}-1} \\cdots z_{n+1}^{-m_{n+1}-1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $V$ is freely generated by $S$, and $\\phi\\left(s_{m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\neq 0$ only when $m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{n+1}<0$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (\\delta \\Phi)\\left(s^{(1)} \\otimes Y\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}-z_{n+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(n)}, z_{n}-z_{n+1}\\right) s^{(n+1)} ; z_{1}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\\\\n= & -E\\left(\\sum_{m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{n+1} \\geq 1} \\phi\\left(s_{-m_{1}}^{(1)} \\cdots s_{-m_{n+1}}^{(n+1)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) z_{1}^{m_{1}-1} \\cdots z_{n+1}^{m_{n+1}-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(s^{(2)}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y^{+}\\left(s^{(n+1)}, z_{n+1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe conclusion then follows by evaluating $z_{n+1}=0$.\nRemark 3.13. (1) Theorem 3.10 basically states that the complementary solutions of the cocycle equation are all coboundaries. Therefore, to solve the cocycle equation, it suffices to find one particular solution. We shall achieve this in the next section.\n(2) The proof of Theorem 3.10 fails when there exists relations among the basis vectors. For example, in the simple affine VOA associated with $s l_{2}$ with level $n$, we have $e(-1)^{n+1} \\mathbf{1}=0$. In this case, $\\phi$ is not well-defined if the constant term\n\n$$\nY_{1}\\left(e(-1) \\mathbf{1}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(e(-1) \\mathbf{1}, z_{2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(e(-1) \\mathbf{1}, z_{n}\\right) e(-1) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nis nonzero. So in this case, the complementary solution might not be a coboundary and thus might represent a nontrivial cohomology class.",

When $m \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{-}$or $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{-}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, (44) trivially follows from the definition. We check (44) for $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{-}$. For convenience, we substitute $m \\mapsto-m$ and $n \\mapsto-n$ in (44) and set $m, n \\geq 1$.

Adding up these two equalities, we obtain (52).\n\nRemark 4.5. It should be remarked that the minimal weight assumption is not needed if the operator product expansion of the vertex operator is linear, so that $a_{\\alpha}^{(j)} a^{(k)}, a_{\\alpha}^{(k)} a^{(i)}$ and $a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}$ are linear combinations of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $a_{-q}^{(p)} \\mathbf{1}$. In general, $a_{\\alpha}^{(j)} a^{(k)}, a_{\\alpha}^{(k)} a^{(i)}$ and $a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}$ might be linear combinations of $a_{-\\left.q_{1}\\right]}^{(p_{1})} \\cdots a_{-\\left.q_{s}\\right]}^{(p_{s})} \\mathbf{1}$. We will handle the situation with induction and analytic continuation. The minimal weight case serves as the starting point of the induction.\n\nProposition 4.6.

With the minimal weight assumption, we already showed that (44) holds for all integers. We now multiply (44) by $x_{1}^{-m-1} x_{2}^{-n-1}$ and sum over all $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, to see that the left-hand-side of $(53)$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{m}{\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m+n-\\alpha} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m+n-\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) x_{1}^{-m-1} x_{2}^{-n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} ^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\binom{m-n+\\alpha}{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-m+n-\\alpha-1} x_{2}^{-n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\binom{m-n+\\alpha}{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-m+n-\\alpha-1} x_{2}^{-n-1}=\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\binom{-m+n-1}{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-m+n-\\alpha-1} x_{2}^{-n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-m+n-1} x_{2}^{-n-1}=x_{2}^{-m-1} \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-m+n-1} x_{2}^{m-n} \\\\\n= & x_{2}^{-m-1} \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-1} \\delta\\left(\\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus the left-hand-side of (53) is expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) x_{2}^{-m-1} \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-1} \\delta\\left(\\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha!}\\left(Y\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}, x_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}+Y_{1}\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}, x_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} x_{1}^{-1} \\delta\\left(\\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is precisely the right-hand-side of (53).\n\nCorollary 4.7. For $i, j, k=1, \\ldots, r$ such that $a^{(i)}, a^{(j)}$ and $a^{(k)}$ are of minimal weight, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{3}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn particular, the cocycle equation with $u=a^{(i)}, v=a^{(j)}, w=a^{(k)}$ is satisfied.\nProof. From the Proposition 4.6, and the fact that $\\delta$-function is an expansion of zero, we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right) \\\\\n=E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe first equality then follows from the creation property, the $D$-conjugation formula and a change of variables. The second equality follows from the followign trivial variant of (54), namely,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)},-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)+E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(k)},-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y_{1}\\left(a^{(k)},-z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)+E\\left(e^{z_{2} D} Y\\left(a^{(k)},-z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn greater detail, if we pass $e^{z_{2} D}$ in the left-hand-side through the first operator, then apply skew-symmetry to the second operator, we recover the left-hand-side of (54). We then apply the skew-symmmetry to the first operator on the right-hand-side. This process yields the equality\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right) \\\\\n=E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) a^{(j)}, z_{2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSo the cocycle equation (6) with $u_{1}=a^{(i)}, u_{2}=a^{(j)}$ and $v=a^{(k)}$ holds. Then we use creation property, $D$-conjugation formula and a change of variables to recover the second identity.\n4.4. Checking the convergence: minimal weight case. To prepare for the next level of calculation, we need the following proposition.\n\nProposition 4.8. Let $a^{(i)}, a^{(j)}, a^{(k)} \\in S$ such that they are of minimal weight. Then for every $p \\in \\mathbb{N}, s^{(1)}, \\ldots, s^{(p)} \\in S$, the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\n$$\n\nis well-defined.\n\nProof. We first work out the case $j \\leq k$. We already know the convergence of\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(u, z_{p+1}\\right) v\\right)\n$$\n\nfor every $u, v \\in S$ from Theorem 3.4 (3). With the minimal weight assumption, it is clear that the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\n$$\n\nis well-defined. It suffices to study the series\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n= & Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& +Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}^{+}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- We first study (57). By definition,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a_{-n}^{(j)} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1} z_{p+2}^{n-1}=\\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a_{-n}^{(j)} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1} z_{p+1}^{-m-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\left(a_{-n}^{(j)}\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1}+\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a_{m}^{(i)} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1}-a_{m}^{(i)}\\left(a^{(j)}\\right)_{-n}^{d e f} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1}\\right) z_{p+1}^{-m-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{m \\geq 0} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{m}{\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m-n-\\alpha} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m-n-\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{-m-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that for each fixed $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$, the first two summands in (59) contains only finitely elements. If we sum up (59) with $n \\geq 1$ and act $Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right)$, what we get is simply\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& +Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& -Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y_{1}^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe series differs from the series\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& +Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& -Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y_{1}^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)} \\\\\n& +Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe convergence of (62) is guaranteed by the convergence of (56) (where the third line follows a similar argument in the proof of Theorem 3.4 (3) using $D$-conjugation property). The convergence of (63) follows from the convergence of vertex operator since both $Y^{-}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)}$\n\nand $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)}$ contains finitely many terms. Therefore, (61) converges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. So the part in (57) contributed by (59) converges.\n\nTo discuss the contribution of (60) in (57), we first compute the sum of (60) over $n \\geq 1$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{n \\geq 1} \\sum_{m \\geq 0} \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{m}{\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m-n-\\alpha} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m-n-\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{-m-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n \\geq 1} \\sum_{m+n+\\alpha \\geq 0}\\binom{m+n+\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{-m-n-\\alpha-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m \\geq-\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) \\sum_{n \\geq 1}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} z_{p+1}^{-m-n-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m \\leq-\\alpha-1}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) \\sum_{n \\geq-m-\\alpha}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} z_{p+1}^{-m-n-1} z_{p+2}^{n-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\sum_{m \\geq-\\alpha}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{-m-1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\sum_{m \\leq-\\alpha-1}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{\\alpha} z_{p+2}^{-m-\\alpha-1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo the contribution of (60) in (57) is given by the contribution of (64) and (65). Clearly, (64) contains only finitely many terms. So the convergence of its contribution in (57) follows from the convergence of products of vertex operators. For (65), note that it differs to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m} a^{(k)}+\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{m}^{d e f} a^{(k)}\\right) z_{p+1}^{\\alpha} z_{p+2}^{-m-\\alpha-1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_{p+1}}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left(Y\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right)+Y_{1}\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right)\\right) a^{(k)} z_{p+1}^{\\alpha} z_{p+2}^{-\\alpha}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby finitely many terms. We then use the the existence of (56) to conclude that the action of $Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right)$ ) on (66) converges. So the contribution of (65) in (57) also converges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function.\n\n- We now study (58).

First note that the summation of $\\alpha$ in (67) is finite. For each $\\alpha \\geq 0$, by the convergence of products of $Y$-operator,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y\\left(\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n=\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right)\\left(a^{(i)}\\right)_{\\alpha}^{d e f} a^{(j)}\\right)_{-m} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1} z_{p+1}^{m-1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nconverges to a $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function. The same holds if we remove the finitely many parts with $m<\\alpha+2$. Apply the partial derivatives with the coefficients, and sum up those finitely many $\\alpha$ 's, we conclude the part in (58) contributed by (67) converges. Similarly, we prove that the part in (58) contributed by (68) also converges. For the part in (58) contributed by (69), the only difference is that we start with the series\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n=\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}} Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right)\\left(a_{\\alpha}^{(i)} a^{(j)}\\right)_{-m}^{d e f} a_{-1}^{(k)} \\mathbf{1} z_{p+1}^{m-1}\\left(z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nthe convergence of which follows from the minimal weight assumption and the convergence of (56). Similarly, we prove that the part in (58) contributed by (70) also converges. Finally, for the part in (58) contributed by (71), we use Theorem 3.4 (3) to see that\n\n$$\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(k)}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nY\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(k)},-z_{p+1}\\right) a^{(i)}\n$$\n\nRemoving finitely many terms, we may replace the $Y\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right)$ by its regular part $Y^{+}\\left(a^{(j)}, z_{p+2}\\right)$. Then with an argument similar to that in the proof of Theorem 3.4 (3), we conclude that the part in (58) contributed by (71) also converges. Therefore, (58) converges. Once we established the convergence for $j \\leq k$, the case $j>k$ follows easily from an analytic continuation argument. From what is shown above,\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(k)}, z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)\n$$\n\nexists. By skew-symmetry and $D$-conjugation formula,\n\n$$\nE\\left(e^{z_{p+2} D} Y\\left(s^{(1)}, z_{1}-z_{p+2}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(s^{(p)}, z_{p}-z_{p+2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{p+1}-z_{p+2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)},-z_{p+2}\\right) a^{(k)}\\right)\n$$\n\nexists. Since $e^{z_{p+2} D}$ does not interfere with the convergence, with a change of variable, we see that (55) exists.\n\nRemark 4.9. As pointed in Section 3.3.2, this convergence guarantees that for every $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, j \\in$ $\\{1, \\ldots, r\\}$ such that $a^{\\left(i_{1}\\right)}, a^{\\left(i_{2}\\right)}, a^{\\left(i_{3}\\right)}$ and $a^{(j)}$ are of minimal weight, the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{\\left(i_{1}\\right)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{\\left(i_{2}\\right)}, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{\\left(i_{3}\\right)}, z_{3}\\right) a^{(j)}\\right)\n$$\n\nis well-defined. This is the starting point of the cocycle equation with one additional variable in Section 3.3.3.\n4.5. Iterates. In order to check the condition of Lemma 4.3 in the inductive step, we also need the following result.\n\nLemma 4.10.

We first proceed to understand the $Y_{1}\\left(a_{-p}^{(j)} v, z_{2}\\right)$ in the first two lines of (75). Substitute $z_{1} \\mapsto x_{1}$ in (73), take $\\operatorname{Res}_{x_{1}=z_{2}}\\left(x_{1}-z_{2}\\right)^{-p}$ and rearrange the terms, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y_{1}\\left(a_{-p}^{(j)} v, z_{2}\\right) w \\\\\n= & \\operatorname{Res}_{x_{1}=z_{2}}\\left(x_{1}-z_{2}\\right)^{-p} E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w+Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w-Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether with a similar expression of $Y\\left(a_{-p}^{(j)} v, z_{2}\\right)$, we see that a sufficient condition for (75) is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n& +E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)-E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n& -E\\left(Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom commutatitivity of the vertex operator $Y$, the terms with negative signs, namely,\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right) \\text { and } E\\left(Y\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right)\n$$\n\nare equal and thus can be both removed. We then use associativity to rewrite the iterate $Y\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}-z_{2}\\right) v, z_{2}\\right)$ as a product $Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right)$, use commutativity of $Y$-operator to rearrange the ordering, finally moving terms around, to rewrite the identity as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)-E\\left(Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n& +E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n= & E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right)+E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) w\\right) \\\\\n& -E\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom (74), the left-hand-side is precisely\n\n$$\nE\\left(Y\\left(a^{(j)}, x_{1}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z_{1}\\right) Y\\left(v, z_{2}\\right) w\\right)\n$$\n\nThe identity then follows from (72). So we proved the first equality of (75). The second equality follows from a similar argument as in Corollary 4.7 and shall not be repeated here.\n\nLemma 4.11.

Indeed, from commutativity of the $Y$-operator, we may assume that $i_{3} \\leq \\cdots \\leq$ $i_{n+1}$. Proposition 5.8 basically states that the equation holds no matter how $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ are chosen.\n\nRemark 5.10. Together with Theorem 3.7 and a similar residue argument, it is straightforward to show that the extended $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow V((x))$ given in the proof Theorem 3.7 satisfies the cocycle equation (6). We shall omit the details here.\n\nRemark 5.11. The reader might be tempted to use Dong-Li Lemma (Proposition 5.5.15 in [LL], see also [L2]) to bypass the technicalities. However, our attempt showed that this approach has various conceptual and technical difficulties. The application of Dong-Li Lemma to first-order deformations requires substantial modifications that might not be a lot easier than the above.",

Theorem 3.4 shows that we may pick $Y_{1}$ such that its regular part is completely determined by its singular part.

Section 3.3.3 formulated the cocycle equation (119) should satisfy. Theorem 3.10 showed that the complementary solutions of the cocycle equation are all coboundaries. We then construct (119) via the modes of $Y_{1}$ in Section 4.1. Theorem 5.1 proves that the so-constructed (119) satisfy the cocycle equation. Theorem 3.7 shows (119) determines $Y_{1}(u, x) v$ for generic $u, v \\in V$. Remark 5.10 explains how to show the cocycle equation holds for generic $u, v \\in V$.\n\nRemark 5.14. The construction in Section 4.1 and the conclusion of Theorem 5.1 do not essentially depend on the freely generated assumption on $V$. For a general vertex algebra $V$, starting from $Y_{1}: S \\otimes S \\rightarrow V((x))$, we may follow the same process to extend it to $Y_{1}: V \\otimes V \\rightarrow$ $V((x))$ and make sure that $Y_{1}$ sends the singular vectors to zero. The only problem is that the so-constructed $Y_{1}$ is only a particular solution of the cocycle equation. There might be other cocycles from the complementary solution that is nontrivial in $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$. Besides, we have to make sure that after carrying out the extension process, $Y_{1}$ should send singular vectors to zero. This implies additional constraints on the choice of $Y_{1}^{-}\\left(a^{(i)}, x\\right) a^{(j)}$.\n\nRecall that in [H1], based on the different convergence requirements, there are different versions of cohomology theories. In [H2], it is shown that the first cohomology does not essentially depend on these convergence conditions. We now show that the same holds for the second cohomology of freely generated vertex algebras.\n\nTheorem 5.15. If $V$ is a freely generated vertex algebra, then $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V) \\simeq H_{\\infty}^{2}(V, V)$.\nProof. From Theorem 5.1 and Lemma 5.5, by taking an appropriate residue, we see that for every $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{l}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}, w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{n} \\in V$, the $\\bar{V}$-valued rational function\n$E\\left(Y\\left(u_{1}, z_{1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(u_{l}, z_{l}\\right) Y_{1}\\left(Y\\left(v_{1}, z_{l+1}-\\zeta\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(v_{l+m}, z_{l+m}-\\zeta\\right) \\mathbf{1}, \\zeta\\right) Y\\left(w_{1}, z_{l+m+1}\\right) \\cdots Y\\left(w_{n}, z_{l+m+n}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right)$\nis well-defined. This in turn shows that every representative of $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$ is indeed composable with infinitely many vertex operators (see [H1], [H2] and [Q2] for formal definitions). Let $K_{\\infty}$ and $B_{\\infty}$ respectively be the spaces of cocycles and coboundaries that are composable with infinitely many vertex operators. Let $K_{1 / 2}$ and $B_{1 / 2}$ respectively be the spaces of cocycles and coboundaries satisfying the $1 / 2$-composable condition in [H2]. What we have proved is that\n\n$$\nK_{1 / 2} / B_{1 / 2}=\\left(K_{\\infty}+B_{1 / 2}\\right) / B_{1 / 2}=\\left(K_{\\infty}+B_{1 / 2}\\right) / B_{\\infty} / B_{1 / 2} / B_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nFrom the second isomorphism theorem, we conclude that\n\n$$\nK_{1 / 2} / B_{1 / 2} \\simeq K_{\\infty} / B_{\\infty} /\\left(K_{\\infty} \\cap B_{1 / 2}\\right) / B_{\\infty} \\simeq K_{\\infty} / B_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nsince $K_{\\infty} \\cap B_{1 / 2}=B_{\\infty}$. The conclusion then follows.",

EXAMPLES \n\nSummarizing the results from Section $3-5$, we see that to determine $H_{1 / 2}^{2}(V, V)$, it suffices to classify $Y_{1}\\left(a^{(i)}, z\\right) a^{(j)}$ containing only the singular parts, and the components satisfy the commutator condition (44) in Section 4.2.

Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra. Recall that the universal affine VOA $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{g})$ is generated by $\\mathfrak{g}$ that is identified with the weight-1 subspace.

Now for a generic root $\\beta$, there exists a simple root $\\alpha$ with $\\left\\langle h_{\\alpha}, h_{\\beta}\\right\\rangle \\neq 0$. Applying the same argument, we see that $B_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ is a constant for every root $\\alpha$. So the notation is justified. It is straightforward to check that for every $a, b \\in \\mathfrak{g}$,\n\n$$\nB(a, b)-l\\langle f(a), b\\rangle-l\\langle a, f(b)\\rangle=\\langle a, b\\rangle B_{\\mathfrak{g}}\n$$\n\nWe construct $\\phi: V \\rightarrow V$ by\n\n$$\n\\phi(a(-m) \\mathbf{1})=(f(a))(-m) \\mathbf{1}\n$$\n\nand for every other basis element of $V$,\n\n$$\n\\phi(v)=0\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{\\phi}(a, x) b= & Y(f(a), x) b-\\phi\\left(Y^{-}(a, x) b\\right)+Y(a, x) f(b) \\\\\n= & l\\langle f(a), b\\rangle \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}+[f(a), b] x^{-1}+f([a, b]) x^{-1} \\\\\n& +l\\langle a, f(b)\\rangle \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}+[a, f(b)] x^{-1}+Y^{+}(f(a), b)+Y^{+}(a, x) f(b) \\\\\n= & (l\\langle f(a), b\\rangle+l\\langle a, f(b)\\rangle) \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}+([f(a), b]-f([a, b])+[a, f(b)]) x^{-1} \\\\\n& +Y^{+}(f(a), b)+Y^{+}(a, x) f(b) \\\\\n= & \\left(B(a, b)+\\langle a, b\\rangle B_{\\mathfrak{g}}\\right) \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}+M(a, b) x^{-1}+Y^{+}(f(a), x) b+Y^{+}(a, x) f(b)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words,\n\n$$\nY_{1}(a, x) b-Y_{\\phi}(a, x) b-\\langle a, b\\rangle B_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}\n$$\n\ncontains only the regular part. Clearly, the map $a \\otimes b \\mapsto\\langle a, b\\rangle B_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\mathbf{1}$ satisfies the commutator condition and thus extends to a cocycle. So (125) gives rise to a regular cocycle. From Proposition 3.1, we see that (125) is represented by a coboundary. Thus $Y_{1}(a, x) b-\\langle a, b\\rangle B_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\mathbf{1} x^{-2}$ is a coboundary.

The results in Section 6.1 and 6.2 basically implies that aside from the deformation perturbing the central charge $c$ of $\\operatorname{Vir}_{c}$ (the level $l$ of $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{g})$, respectively), no other deformation can possibly exist.\n6.3. Heisenberg VOA. Let $\\mathfrak{h}$ be a finite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra with a nondegenerate bilinear form $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle$. Recall that the Heisenberg VOA $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{h})$ is generated by $\\mathfrak{h}$ that is identified with weight-1 subspace.

Therefore, it is impossible to further reduce the right-hand-side of (129) via coboundaries.

If the map $M$ satisfies the Jacobi identity, then $(\\mathfrak{h}, M)$ forms a quadratic Lie algebra with respect to the bilinear form on $\\mathfrak{h}$ (see, for example, [HK]. In that case, $V^{l}(\\mathfrak{h})$ deforms to an affine VOA. This is analogous to the classical fact that the universal enveloping algebra $U(\\mathfrak{g})$ is a deformation of the symmetric algebra $S(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n6.4.

  "abstract": "We solve the problem of how to classify the first-order vertex-algebraic\ndeformations for any grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ that is freely\ngenerated by homogeneous elements of positive weights. We approach by computing\nthe second cohomology $H^2_{1/2}(V, V)$ constructed by Yi-Zhi Huang. We start\nwith the cocycle on two generators and show that its cohomology class is\ncompletely determined by its singular part. To extend the cocycle to any pair\nof elements in $V$, we take a generating function approach, formulate the\ncocycle equation, and show that all the complementary solutions are\ncoboundaries. Then we use a very general procedure to construct a particular\nsolution. The procedure applies to vertex algebras that are not freely\ngenerated. As a by-product, we show that $H^2_{1/2}(V, V) = H^2_\\infty(V, V)$.\nUsing these results, we explicitly determine the first-order deformations of\nthe universal Virasoro VOA $Vir_c$, universal affine VOA $V^l(\\mathfrak{g})$,\nHeisenberg VOA $V^l(\\mathfrak{h})$, and the universal Zamolodchikov VOA\n$W_3^c$.",
