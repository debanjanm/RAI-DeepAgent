With the growing availability of diverse data types and the integration of econometric models with textual and image data, researchers often encounter applications of MNL models with a massive number of choices; see the applications discussed in Section 1.2. In these cases, even if the number of parameters for each choice is small, the total number of parameters, which increases linearly with the number of choices, will be large due to large choice sets. As a result, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can become computationally intractable due to the high cost of solving an optimization problem for a large number of parameters. ${ }^{1}$\n\nResearchers in diverse disciplines have explored various approaches and proposed numerous methods to numerically solve the MLE; see the numerical algorithms discussed in Section 1.2. However, there is a notable lack of theoretical results ensuring the consistency or asymptotic efficiency of the estimators derived from these methods. This gap in the literature between numerical computation and statistical inference motivates the present study.\n\nOur proposed estimator utilizes the multinomial-Poisson (MP) transformation, which reformulates the multinomial likelihood into a Poisson likelihood by incorporating individual fixed effects into the MNL model. When all the covariates are categorical, Baker (1994) establishes that the multinomial likelihood and the Poisson likelihood produce identical estimates of the parameters in the MNL model and advocates the computational advantage of maximizing the Poisson likelihood. However, the MP transformation has also been employed in MNL models with continuous or mixed discrete and continuous covariates. For instance, Gentzkow et al. (2019) note that they \"... approximate the likelihood of [their] multinomial logit model with the likelihood of a Poisson model...\".\n\nAs the first contribution of this paper, we establish an equivalence result for all types of covariates, continuous, discrete, or mixed, justifying the application of the MP transformation in these cases. To accomplish this, we re-interpret the Poisson likelihood from the MP transformation as a conditional quasi-log-likelihood function given the covariates. Maximizing this function provides a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) for the MNL model. The equivalence result is established by demonstrating that the resulting QMLE is identical to the MLE of the MNL model.\n\nWhile the QMLE is computationally more efficient than the MLE, it remains costly when applied to MNL models with large choice sets. To address this computational challenge, Taddy (2015) exploits an important feature of the quasi-loglikelihood function: for any given fixed effects, the function is additively separable in\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ MLE of the MNL model refers to the conditional MLE given the covariate and total counts.\n\nthe parameters across different choices of the MNL model. Taddy (2015) proposes to estimate parameters for each choice separately at a specific value of the fixed effects and calls the resulting estimator distributed computing estimator. As noted in Taddy (2015), however, his distributed computing estimator is inconsistent except in a few very special cases.\n\nTo regain consistency and asymptotic efficiency, we adopt the idea of iterative backfitting algorithms studied in Pastorello et al. (2003), Dominitz and Sherman (2005), and Fan et al. (2015) to compute the QMLE of the parameters in the MNL model and fixed effects iteratively. ${ }^{2}$ During each iteration, we first solve for the parameters of interest through distributed computing, given approximate values of the individual fixed effects. Then, we update estimates of the individual fixed effects based on their expressions derived from maximizing the quasi-log-likelihood function using the previous estimates of the model parameters. We call our estimator iterative distributed computing (IDC) estimator. This is the second and main contribution of the paper. The IDC algorithm is fast because of distributed computing, even when the choice set is large. We consider three IDC estimators based on three different initial estimators: a consistent estimator based on pairwise binomial logistic regression, Taddy (2015)'s distributed computing estimator, and a maximum likelihood estimator assuming that the distribution of total counts is Poisson. The latter two estimators are inconsistent in general. All three initial estimators are fast to compute because they allow for distributed computing.\n\nAs the third contribution, we establish theoretical results on the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of all three IDC estimators. When the initial estimator is consistent, we show that the IDC estimator with any finite number of iterations is always consistent and is asymptotically efficient under an information dominance condition when the number of iterations diverges with respect to the sample size $n$ at $\\log (n)$ rate. With inconsistent initial estimators, the IDC estimators are consistent and asymptotically efficient under a stronger contraction mapping condition when the number of iterations diverges with respect to $n$ at a polynomial rate.\n\nWhen the number of choices is large, conducting inference via plug-in estimation of the variance matrix becomes infeasible. This is because the Fisher information matrix has a very large dimension, causing the computation of the inverse of its estimator to be both time-consuming and unreliable. The fourth contribution of the paper is that we propose a parametric bootstrap inference procedure and show its consistency. Because the IDC estimator is fast to compute, our inference procedure is computationally feasible.\n\nLastly, we conduct extensive simulations to study the finite sample performance\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Similar iterative algorithms have also been developed for dynamic discrete games of incomplete information where directly computing the MLE using the nested fixed-point algorithm proves computationally infeasible, see Aguirregabiria and Mira $(2002,2007)$ for a nested pseudo-likelihood (NPL) algorithm. Kasahara and Shimotsu (2012) further analyze the conditions necessary for the convergence of the NPL algorithm and derive its convergence rate.\n\nof our estimator and inference procedure. We are particularly interested in the computational time of the IDC estimator and its accuracy compared to the maximum likelihood estimator. The simulation results show that the IDC estimator is very fast to compute, with a running time approximately linear in the number of choices. Compared to the maximum likelihood estimator, our estimator has a very similar mean squared error in all the different model settings but is much faster to compute when the number of choices is large. We also study the finite sample behavior of the proposed bootstrap inference procedure. The results suggest that the procedure achieves the correct size and is consistent.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 1.2 Related Literature \n\nApplications The proposed IDC estimator can be applied to study various economics and computer science topics such as text analysis, dimensionality reduction, spatial choice models, image classification (Russakovsky et al. (2015)), and video recommendation (Davidson et al. (2010)).\n\nText analysis: The integration of text data into econometric models is increasingly prominent in economics. For example, Baker and Wurgler (2006) analyze investor sentiment's effect on stock returns, while Chen et al. (2021) explore how hedge funds capitalize on sentiment changes. Modeling text data often involves treating word counts as a multinomial distribution, as Taddy (2015) demonstrates using Yelp reviews to predict outcomes based on user and business attributes. Gentzkow et al. (2019) use the distributed computing estimator in Taddy (2015) for the multinomial regression to measure polarization in Congressional speeches. Kelly et al. (2019) extend this approach, using Hurdle Distributed Multinomial Regression to backcast, nowcast, and forecast macroeconomic variables from newspaper text.\n\nDimensionality Reduction: Our estimator aids in dimensionality reduction for inverse multinomial regression, as Taddy (2013) discusses. Instead of inferring sentiment from text, Taddy (2013)'s approach estimates word distribution given sentiment. He introduces a score based on word frequencies and regression parameters, which is useful in forward-regression models.\n\nSpatial Choice Models: High-dimensional choices also appear in spatial models. Buchholz (2021) models taxi drivers' location choices with a dynamic spatial search, reducing dimensionality via discretization. Similarly, Pellegrini and Fotheringham (2002) apply hierarchical discrete choice models to immigration, while Bettman (1979) addresses brand choices in limited-option settings, proposing hierarchical selection for high-dimensional cases.\n\nNumerical Algorithms To address the computational difficulty of solving the MLE of the MNL model, researchers have proposed several numerical methods to find approximate solutions. B\u00f6hning and Lindsay (1988) and B\u00f6hning (1992) propose replacing the Hessian matrix in the Newton-Raphson iteration with its easy-\n\nto-compute global lower bound and show that the approximate solution converges with the number of iterations. Because the convergence rate depends crucially on the difference between the Hessian matrix and its lower bound, the algorithm can be slow to run for certain model parameters. Additionally, based on our simulation exercise, if the choice probabilities vary significantly across different choices with some being close to zero, the algorithm becomes unstable. In comparison, our IDC algorithm is stable in all the simulation settings. Boyd et al. (2011) introduce an alternating direction method of multipliers, which reformulates the original optimization problem by introducing redundant linear constraints. Gopal and Yang (2013) propose a log concavity method, which replaces the log partition function of the multinomial logit with a parallelizable upper bound. Recht et al. (2011), Raman et al. (2016), and Fagan and Iyengar (2018) study a stochastic gradient descent method, which uses random training samples to calculate the gradient at each iteration. Although these methods can be computationally efficient, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no consistency or asymptotic efficiency result has been shown in these works.\n\nPenalization methods have also been introduced to the MNL regression and some of the numerical methods discussed above are adopted in solving the penalized MNL regression, see e.g., Friedman et al. (2010), Simon et al. (2013), and Nibbering and Hastie (2022), The proposed IDC procedure in this paper can be combined with the aforementioned algorithms to further improve the performance of penalized MNL regressions.\n\nOrganization of the rest of this paper The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a comprehensive overview of the multinomial logistic regression model and the MP transformation. Section 3 introduces our iterative distributed computing estimator along with some initial values. In Section 4 we provide the asymptotic theory of the iterative distributed computing estimator. Section 5 contains the simulation results. Finally, with Section 6 we conclude. Appendix A collects the notations and equations used in the paper. All the technical proofs are provided in Appendix B.

Because the dimension of $\\mathcal{I}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)$ is $d p \\times d p$, calculating the inverse of its estimator is not only time-consuming but also unreliable when $d$ is large. As a result, we proceed by applying the following parametric bootstrap, which is feasible thanks to the fact that the IDC estimator is fast to compute.\n\nGiven $\\left\\{\\left(\\boldsymbol{V}_{i}, M_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ of the original sample, we draw the bootstrap sample $\\boldsymbol{C}_{i n}^{\\ddagger}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n$ from the multinomial logistic regression model with the conditional probability mass function given by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{MNL}\\left(\\boldsymbol{C}_{i n}^{\\ddagger} ; \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}_{i}, M_{i}\\right), \\text { where } \\widehat{\\eta}_{i k}=\\boldsymbol{V}_{i}^{\\prime} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}^{(S)} \\text { for } k=1, \\ldots d\n$$\n\nThe bootstrap version of the iterative estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}$ is obtained by applying the algorithm introduced in Section 3.2 with bootstrap sample $\\left\\{\\left(\\boldsymbol{C}_{i n}^{\\ddagger}, \\boldsymbol{V}_{i}, M_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n}$.\n\nAssume that we start with a consistent initial estimator.

Lastly, we study the finite sample size and power of our bootstrap inference procedure.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 16, "text": "### 5.1 Estimation\n\nIn what follows, we present results on the finite sample performance of the IDC estimator in terms of MSE and running time in four tables. The reported running times in the tables are obtained from a cluster of 25 AWS EC2 instances with 12 vCPUs and 16GB memory. Such a configuration can be formed on commonly used cloud computing platforms within minutes. We employ this basic configuration to illustrate that our IDC estimator achieves superior performance compared to existing estimators, even when computational resources are suboptimal for distributed computing. All of the results presented in this section are repeated five hundred times and averaged.\n\nWe first study the finite sample performance of the IDC estimator with consistent $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ initialization, specifically what happens to MSE ( $n$ increasing, $d$ fixed) and running time ( $d$ increasing, $n$ fixed). We consider the following data generating process (DGP):\n\nDGP-A [MNL]: We set $p=5$. The covariate vector $\\boldsymbol{V}$ follows the standard normal distribution; $M$ follows the discrete uniform distribution on $[20,30]$; and the values of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ are obtained by random draws from the standard normal distribution.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable I: Finite sample performance of IDC estimator with $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ initialization\n\nFrom Table I, we observe that the MSE of the IDC estimator decreases as the sample size increases. When the number of iterations $S$ increases, we see an improvement in the MSE. However, the improvement is marginal, suggesting that the IDC estimator with $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ initialization stabilizes with only a few iterations. We also see from Table I that the running time is approximately a linear function of $d$. When the number of cores available does not exceed the number of choices, the additional computational cost of increasing $d$ is very small. After the cores are fully occupied by the number of processes, the running time becomes approximately linear. The nominal value of running time depends on the hardware specifications.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable II: MSE and running time of MLE $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$\n\nTo compare the performance of our IDC estimator with the MLE $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, we simulate the MSE and running time of $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ from the same DGP and present the result in Table II. ${ }^{7}$ It can be seen that the MSE of the IDC estimator with $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ initialization is very close to that of the MLE even when the number of iterations is only 10 . Note that the main advantage of the parallel estimator is best observed for high enough $d$ because for low\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ We also write code to try estimators in B\u00f6hning and Lindsay (1988), B\u00f6hning (1992), and Simon et al. (2013) for comparison. However, our simulation result suggests that their performance depends crucially on the number of iterations.\n\n$d$, the communication between parallel processes is unnecessary and hence parallel computing increases the running time unnecessarily. The superior performance of the IDC estimator is apparent when $d$ is large. For instance, when $d=150$ and $n=2000$, the IDC estimator with $S=10$ achieves a similar MSE as the MLE with only about one-tenth of the running time. For higher-dimensional cases, such as when $d$ exceeds 150 , computing the MLE becomes computationally intensive and may not be practical for many applications. In comparison, the IDC estimator with $S=10$ demonstrates more efficient computation times, requiring approximately 5,10 , and 20 minutes for sample sizes $n=500,1000$, and 2000 , respectively. Moreover, the running time for the IDC estimator can be further decreased if more compute instances are used. For example, using 96 instances, the running time of the IDC estimator for $d=150$ can be further reduced to 34,51 , and 188 seconds for $n=500,1000,2000$ respectively even for $S=40$. Compared to the corresponding running time of MLE, the running time of the IDC estimator using 96 instances is more than 10,30 , and 50 times shorter.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nTable III: Finite sample performance of IDC estimator with $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ initialization\n\nIn Table III, we present the MSE and running time of IDC estimators with $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ as initial estimators, respectively, for two different numbers of iterations $S$. Comparing MSEs of three IDC estimators with different initial values: $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ (Table I) and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}$ (Table III) or $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ (Table III), we observe that the IDC estimator with the consistent initial estimator reduces the MSEs for the same number of iterations.\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nTable IV: MSE comparison of competing estimators. Number of iterations $S=20$.\n\nTable IV presents MSEs of different estimators for three $(d, n)$ pairs each. We set the largest $d$ be 50 so that MLE can be computed in a reasonable time. $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P B}^{I}, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}^{I}$, and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}^{I}$ denote the IDC estimators with $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}$, and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ as the initial estimators respectively. Besides DGP-A, we consider two additional DGPs to study the performance of the IDC estimator under different data settings. In all DGPs, we let $p=5$.\n\nDGP-B [Poisson]: The random variable $\\boldsymbol{V}$ follows a standard normal distribution; $C_{i k}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $e^{n_{i k}^{n}}$; and $M$ is obtained by summing up realizations of the Poisson draws for different choices.\n\nDGP-C [Mixture]: We let $\\boldsymbol{V}$ follow a mixture of Gaussian distributions with means 0 and 4 with standard deviations 1 for both distributions. $M$ is also set to follow a mixture of Gaussian distributions with means 10 and 60 and rounded to the closest integer. The standard deviations are 1 and 5 respectively. We have made these modifications so that some choices are rarely selected and ensure the robustness of our estimator in those cases.\n\nBased on the simulation result, our IDC algorithm is successfully executed for all DGPs and exhibits stability. In contrast, we encounter errors for DGP-C when computing the estimators in B\u00f6hning and Lindsay (1988), B\u00f6hning (1992), and Simon et al. (2013). We see from Table IV that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P B}^{I}$ performs close to $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ for all DGPs and $(d, n)$ pairs. In DGP-B, the initial estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ is the maximum likelihood estimator. As a result, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}^{I}$ starts with not only a consistent but asymptotically efficient initial estimator. Even in this case, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P B}^{I}$ has comparable MSEs.\n\nIn summary, the IDC estimators with all three initial estimators have finite sample performance similar to the MLE for the DGPs studied in this section. They are much\n\nfaster to compute than the MLE for large $d$ and are feasible even when the MLE might be intractable. Moreover, if the IDC estimator starts with the consistent initial estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, its finite sample performance will be further improved and is almost the same as the MLE.", "tables": {"table_0": "|  |  |  | $n=500$ |  | $n=1000$ |  | $n=2000$ |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(0)}$ | $S$ | d | MSE | Time | MSE | Time | MSE | Time |\n| $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ | 10 | 10 | .0030 | 45 s | .0020 | 97 s | .0012 | 252 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0083 | 52 s | .0052 | 113 s | .0020 | 277 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0373 | 85 s | .0182 | 174 s | .0094 | 453 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0793 | 157 s | .0381 | 349 s | .0171 | 756 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1749 | 211 s | .0585 | 455 s | .0223 | 1007 s |\n|  | 40 | 10 | .0037 | 168 s | .0021 | 320 s | .0012 | 672 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0081 | 196 s | .0040 | 352 s | .0019 | 739 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0365 | 320 s | .0185 | 576 s | .0091 | 1142 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0661 | 590 s | .0336 | 890 s | .0158 | 1948 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1815 | 770 s | .0577 | 1184 s | .0211 | 2822 s |", "table_1": "|  | $n=500$ |  | $n=1000$ |  | $n=2000$ |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $d$ | MSE | Time | MSE | Time | MSE | Time |\n| 10 | .0040 | 36 s | .0020 | 105 s | .0015 | 350 s |\n| 20 | .0101 | 54 s | .0045 | 152 s | .0026 | 652 s |\n| 50 | .0263 | 96 s | .0187 | 308 s | .0098 | 1523 s |\n| 100 | .0852 | 250 s | .0405 | 862 s | .0151 | 4375 s |\n| 150 | .1179 | 457 s | .0536 | 1523 s | .0291 | 9352 s |", "table_2": "|  |  |  | $n=500$ |  | $n=1000$ |  | $n=2000$ |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(0)}$ | $S$ | d | MSE | Time | MSE | Time | MSE | Time |\n| $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}$ | 10 | 10 | .0048 | 42 s | .0023 | 95 s | .0017 | 247 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0098 | 49 s | .0058 | 106 s | .0038 | 278 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0466 | 83 s | .0197 | 175 s | .0100 | 442 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0809 | 151 s | .0381 | 339 s | .0184 | 754 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1725 | 206 s | .0590 | 451 s | .0242 | 998 s |\n|  | 40 | 10 | .0051 | 160 s | .0025 | 311 s | .0017 | 667 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0102 | 187 s | .0052 | 337 s | .0022 | 728 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0464 | 309 s | .0198 | 564 s | .0094 | 1128 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0867 | 581 s | .0407 | 876 s | .0179 | 1938 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1808 | 758 s | .0588 | 1177 s | .0219 | 2801s |\n|  |  |  | $n=500$ |  | $n=1000$ |  | $n=2000$ |  |\n| $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(0)}$ | $S$ | d | MSE | Time | MSE | Time | MSE | Time |\n| $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}$ | 10 | 10 | .0068 | 52 s | .0023 | 97 s | .0016 | 244 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0118 | 59 s | .0058 | 111 s | .0038 | 290 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0466 | 83 s | .0197 | 177 s | .0100 | 438 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0808 | 155 s | .0382 | 341 s | .0184 | 751 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1739 | 209 s | .0588 | 457 s | .0258 | 1008 s |\n|  | 40 | 10 | .0050 | 160 s | .0025 | 322 s | .0017 | 651 s |\n|  |  | 20 | .0102 | 198 s | .0052 | 355 s | .0022 | 728 s |\n|  |  | 50 | .0464 | 318 s | .0198 | 570 s | .0095 | 1140 s |\n|  |  | 100 | .0866 | 577 s | .0407 | 881 s | .0179 | 1957 s |\n|  |  | 150 | .1926 | 761 s | .0587 | 1151 s | .0245 | 2811 s |", "table_3": "|  | $d$ | $n$ | $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ | $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P B}^{I}$ | $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{P}^{I}$ | $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{T}^{I}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| DGP-A | 20 | 500 | .0102 | .0083 | .0102 | .0102 |\n|  | 20 | 1000 | .0049 | .0048 | .0052 | .0052 |\n|  | 50 | 1000 | .0155 | .0158 | .0198 | .0198 |\n| DGP-B | 20 | 500 | .0007 | .0008 | .0006 | .0303 |\n|  | 20 | 1000 | .0002 | .0002 | .0003 | .0403 |\n|  | 50 | 1000 | .0005 | .0005 | .0006 | .0121 |\n| DGP-C | 20 | 500 | .0060 | .0062 | .0072 | .0061 |\n|  | 20 | 1000 | .0032 | .0032 | .0032 | .0045 |\n|  | 50 | 1000 | .0315 | .0318 | .0305 | .0323 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 17, "text": "# 5.2 Inference \n\nIn this section, we illustrate the bootstrap inference procedure introduced in Section 4.2.

And when the true value $\\theta_{11}^{*}$ deviates more from the null hypothesis, the rejection probabilities increase. The same pattern appears for both $d=20$ and $d=50$. The finite sample performance of the test when $d=50$ is not as good as that when $d=20$. This is predictable because there are many more unknown parameters in the model when $d=50$ than when $d=20$.

When the number of iterations goes to infinity, we show that our estimator is both consistent and asymptotically efficient. Based on the simulation study, the computational time of our estimator increases linearly with the number of choices. Moreover, our estimator has comparable finite sample performance to MLE when the latter is computationally feasible.\n\nExtensions abound. First, our IDC estimator can be combined with several existing algorithms to accommodate more complex settings. For example, when minimizing $Q_{k n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s-1)}\\right)\\right)$ for $k=1, \\ldots, d$, we can replace the gradient of the objective function with its stochastic approximation calculated from a randomly selected subset of the data. Such an algorithm is an online algorithm and might reduce the running time especially when $n$ is large. We can also employ a one-step Newton-Raphson to compute $\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k} \\in \\Theta_{k}} Q_{k n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s-1)}\\right)\\right)$ in each iteration or even replace the Hessian matrix with its dominant. These modifications to the IDC estimator have the potential to further enhance computational efficiency, depending on the application. However, their theoretical properties require further investigation. Second, the asymptotic properties of the IDC estimator in this paper are established for a large but fixed number of choices. Asymptotic theory allowing for the number of choices to diverge with the sample size is yet to be established. Third, in cases where the number of covariates is also large, $\\ell_{1}$ or $\\ell_{2}$ regularization could be adopted. In a companion paper, we develop an asymptotic theory for a regularized iterative distributed computing estimator.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 19, "text": "# Appendix A Notations and

holds because $\\mu_{i} \\sum_{k=1}^{d} C_{i k}=M_{i} \\mu_{i}$. Therefore, adding $\\mu_{i}$ does not change the likelihood.\n\nProof of Lemma 2.2: Notice that $Q_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ is differentiable w.r.t. $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ for any given $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. By letting $\\frac{\\partial Q_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}=\\mathbf{0}$, we can obtain function $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ such that $\\left.\\frac{\\partial Q_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}=$ $\\mathbf{0}$ for every $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.

Since $\\frac{\\partial f(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})}{\\partial \\mu_{i}}=M_{i}-e^{\\mu_{i}} \\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}$, we obtain the expression of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ as in (3.3). Plugging it into (2.5), we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right) \\\\\n= & -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[M_{i} \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right)+M_{i} \\log \\left(\\frac{m_{i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}}\\right)-e^{\\log \\left(\\frac{M_{i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}}\\right)} \\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right] \\\\\n= & -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[M_{i} \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right)+M_{i} \\log M_{i}-M_{i} \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{M_{i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}}\\right) \\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right] \\\\\n= & -\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[M_{i} \\log M_{i}-M_{i}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich does not depend on $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.

Under Assumption 4.2, $-L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is convex in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\n\nProof of Lemma B.1: By the definitions of $l_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and Assumption 4.2, we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\frac{1}{n} l_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) & =-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[C_{i 1} \\eta_{i 1}+\\cdots+C_{i d} \\eta_{i d}-M_{i} \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\eta_{i k}}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =-\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[C_{i 1} \\boldsymbol{V}_{i}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}+\\cdots+C_{i d} \\boldsymbol{V}_{i}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{d}-M_{i} \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}_{i}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{p}-\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[C_{1} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}\\right]+\\cdots+\\mathbb{E}\\left[C_{d} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{d}\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[M \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}}\\right)\\right]\\right) \\\\\n& \\equiv-L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\\\\n& =-\\sum_{k=1}^{d} \\mathbb{E}\\left[C_{k} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[M \\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term is convex in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ because it only involves linear functions. It has been shown in Section 3.1.5 in Boyd et al. (2004) that $\\log \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}}\\right)$ is convex in $\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{d}$. Because $\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}$ is a linear function of $\\theta_{k}$ and sums of convex functions are convex, the second term is convex in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.\n\nLemma B.2. Under Assumption 4.2, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ is the unique fixed point of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.\nProof of Lemma B.2: By definition, $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}) \\equiv \\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\Theta} Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})$. Thus, if we can show that $\\left.\\frac{\\partial Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}=\\mathbf{0}$ holds only at $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$, then $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ is the unique fixed point of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\cdot)$. Taking the first order derivative of $-L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\cdot)$, we obtain that for any $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\in \\Theta$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\left.\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} & =\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{M e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{1}} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}}-C_{1} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime}\\right], \\ldots, \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{M e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{d-1}} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{d} e^{\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}}}-C_{d-1} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\prime}\\right]\\right]^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =\\left.\\frac{\\partial Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right|_{(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})=(\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, proving that $\\left.\\frac{\\partial Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}=\\mathbf{0}$ holds only at $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ is equivalent to showing that $\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbf{0}$ only at $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$. By Lemma B.1, $-L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is convex in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. The set $\\Theta$ is convex by Assumption 4.2. For a convex function over a convex set, any local minimum is also a global minimum. Along with the identification assumption in Section 2.1 that $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ is the unique solution to $\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\Theta}-L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, we obtain that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} L_{C \\mid V, M}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbf{0}$ holds only at $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$.\n\nProof of Lemma 4.1: Part (i) follows by applying Theorem 2 in Jennrich (1969) on the uniform law of large numbers with conditions satisfied by Assumption 4.2.\n\nSince $Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})$ is continuous in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and $\\Theta$ is compact by Assumption 4.2 (i), $Q^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})$ achieves its minimum in $\\Theta$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}$.

By Assumption 4.2 (ii) and (iii) and the uniform law of large numbers, we have\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta} \\in \\Theta}\\left\\|\\Omega_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})-\\Omega(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})\\right\\| \\xrightarrow{p} 0\n$$\n\nBy Assumption 4.2 (i), $\\Theta$ is convex. Applying a multivariate Taylor expansion (Dieudonn\u00e9 (2011), p. 190), we can write $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})=\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}} \\in \\Theta$, where\n\n$$\n\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{1} \\Omega(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}+\\xi(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})) d \\xi\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we have $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})=\\Lambda_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}} \\in \\Theta$, where\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{1} \\Omega_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}+\\xi(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}}-\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta})) d \\xi\n$$\n\nIt holds that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}\\right)-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right)\\right\\| \\leq & \\left\\|\\left[\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}\\right)-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right)\\right]-\\left[\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}\\right)-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right)\\right]\\right\\| \\\\\n& +\\left\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}\\right)-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right)\\right\\| \\\\\n\\leq & \\left\\|\\left[\\Lambda_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})-\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}})\\right]\\left[\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}\\right)-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right)\\right]\\right\\| \\\\\n& +C_{\\epsilon}\\left\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right\\|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality follows from the triangular inequality and the second inequality holds by (B.9). Because the first term on the right-hand side has the order $o_{p}\\left(\\left\\|\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s+1)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(s)}\\right\\|\\right)$ because of (B.10), we have shown that (B.8) holds with $c=C_{\\epsilon}<1$. The lemma follows.\n\nProof of Theorem 4.3: We aim to show that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}$ has the same influence function as $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. By the definition of the IDC estimator in Section 3.2, we have that\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} Q_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}}=\\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nApplying the Taylor expansion to the function on the left-hand-side of the above equation round $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}$, we can obtain that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} Q_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}} \\\\\n& +\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} Q_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)=\\mathbf{0}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}$ lies between $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}$. The definition of $Q_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})$ implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} Q_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}} \\\\\n& =-\\left.\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the expression of $f(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu})$, it can be shown that\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} f\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}}=\\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nTherefore, (B.11) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} Q_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)\\right)\\right|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right)=\\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma B.3, we have $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S+1)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}=o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$. This implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}\\right) & =o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)+\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\dagger}\\right)\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the second equality follows from the Taylor expansion and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\dagger}$ lies between $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$.\n\nBy Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, we have that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)} \\xrightarrow{p} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ either for any fixed $S$ or as $S \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, by Assumption 4.2 and Taylor's theorem, we can obtain that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\dagger}\\right)=\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)+o_{p}(1)\n$$\n\nSince matrix inversion is continuous (at non-singular matrices), it follows that the inverse of $\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)$ exists with high probability and\n\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{1}{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{\\prime}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)\\right]^{-1} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathcal{I}^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{I}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)$ is the Fisher information matrix defined in Section 4.2. Using this result to (B.12), we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\mathcal{I}^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right) \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)+o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S-1)}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}+o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$ by Lemma B.3, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}=\\mathcal{I}^{-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right) \\frac{1}{n} \\frac{d}{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}} l_{C \\mid V, M}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{*}\\right)+o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt can be seen that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}$ and the maximum likelihood estimator $\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ have the same influence function. Hence, under the assumptions in either part (i) or (ii) of the theorem, we have $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(S)}-\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}=o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$.\n\nProof of Corollary 4.4: The result directly follows from Theorem 4.3 and the standard result on the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator.\n\nProof of Theorem 4.5: The proof of the theorem follows from the discussion in Section 4.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 21, "text": "# References \n\nAguirregabiria, V. and P.
