It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI ${ }^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nIt is one of the goals of statistical mechanics to derive simple, analytical models that describe universal aspects of physical systems in an approximative way. One class of such models is given by ensembles of random matrices. Their application in physics is two-fold. Firstly, they may model physical operators such as the Hamilton and the Dirac operator. Secondly, they typically belong to the wider class of static Coulomb gases with logarithmic interaction. From this point of view and at specific values of the inverse temperature $\\beta$, these models can be interpreted as statistical ensembles of eigenvalues\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *akemann@physik.uni-bielefeld.de\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ noah.ayguen@uni-bielefeld.de\n    ${ }^{\\ddagger}$ corresponding author: m.kieburg@unimelb.edu.au\n    $\\S$ patricia@physik.uni-bielefeld.de\n\nof matrices. In the present work, we will focus on random matrices with complex eigenvalues, thus relating to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas. A prominent example is the Ginibre ensemble [1] with complex matrix elements, corresponding to $\\beta=2$.\n\nThe Ginibre ensemble, non-Hermitian random matrices and Coulomb gases in general have seen a recent revival of interest in physics and mathematics, see recent reviews [2, 3, 4]. One of the reasons is that they describe open quantum mechanical systems in the regime when they become chaotic. This goes back to the work of Grobe, Haake and Sommers [5], generalising the quantum chaos conjecture for closed systems relating to Hermitian random matrices in the chaotic regime, and Poisson statistic for generic integrable quantum systems. Such and similar applications of nonHermitian random matrices include the kicked top with damping $[5,6]$, Hamiltonian systems with imaginary vector potential [7], quantum field theory with quark chemical potential $[8,9,10,11]$ as well as with lattice corrections $[12,13,14]$, quantum spin chains with dissipative disorder $[15,16,17,18]$, quantum maps $[19,20,21]$ and time-lagged correlation matrices $[22,23]$.\n\nA crucial question to be addressed before applying random matrices is the identification of the corresponding symmetry class of the physical system under consideration. Only then the benchmarks obtained from random matrix theory can be expected to be an approximation. In the Hermitian case with real spectra, this has been facilitated through the symmetry classification by Altland and Zirnbauer [24] in the so-called ten-fold way, utilising the Cartan classification from semi-simple Lie algebras. As the authors emphasise, this is not a classification of the possible limiting eigenvalue statistics in the limit of large matrix size, but rather the classes of possible $\\sigma$-models and their effective Lagrangians. For example, it turns out that for Hermitian random matrices in the bulk of the spectrum generically only three different bulk statistics result, that coincide with Dyson's earlier classification, the three-fold way [25]. In contrast, at the hard edge more limiting statistics emerge, for references and an overview over all 10 classes in the context of quantum field theory and their naive lattice discretisations see [26].\n\nWhat is the situation for non-Hermitian random matrices? Based on a symmetry classification of non-Hermitian random matrices by Bernard and LeClair [27], a matrix representation was proposed by Magnea [28]. Recently, the classification [27] was revisited by Kawabata et al. [29] through the lens of topological properties, finding a total of 38 symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices ${ }^{1}$. Much less is known to date about the complex eigenvalue statistics of these 38 classes. Only for 7 classes the joint probability density of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Gaussian ensembles is known for finite matrix size $N$, the three Ginibre ensembles with real, complex and quaternion matrix entries $[1,30]$, their chiral counterparts $[10,31,32]$ and the pseudo-Hermitian matrix ensemble (also known as the Wilson-Dirac random matrix in QCD) [14]. All 7 ensembles have been solved for finite- $N$ and in various large- $N$ limits, as they represent determinantal and Pfaffian point processes, see [33, 14] for a list of the corresponding kernels in these 7 classes.\n\nIt came as a surprise that only 3 different kinds of local bulk statistics have been identified in [15] amongst 9 of the 38 classes. This analysis was based on numerical computations of the nearestneighbour spacing distribution of complex eigenvalues in radial distance away from the edge and symmetry axes and points (such as the real axis and the origin) and on $N=2$ computations. The latter are actually not good approximations to the large- $N$ limit $[34]^{2}$. The authors of [15] identify a transposition symmetry to be responsible for the deformation of the bulk statistics in a subset of 9 classes. They also show numerically that these 3 bulk statistics are shared by random matrices with Gaussian and Bernoulli distributed elements and, hence, show universal characteristics. The difference between these 3 universality classes has furthermore been observed in numerical computations of their respective complex spacing ratios $[16,11]$ introduced in [16].\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Cf. the revised version v2 of [27] that was submitted after [29] appeared.\n    ${ }^{2}$ This is in stark contrast to the Wigner surmise for Hermitian ensembles, as pointed out for class A already in [5].\n\nDue to the insights of $[15,34]$, there is a conjecture that only three universality classes of the bulk statistics for complex eigenvalues exist. Partial analytical results exist about an agreement for the limiting eigenvalue statistics within different non-Hermitian ensembles. Tao and Vu [38] have proven for a large class of complex Wigner ensembles that the local statistics in the bulk and at the edge agree with the complex Ginibre ensemble. It was also shown for the real and quaternion Ginibre ensemble that away from the real axis their limiting eigenvalue statistics agree with that of the simpler complex Ginibre ensemble in the bulk $[35,20]$ and at the edge $[36]$ of the spectrum (while they differ along the real line). Likewise, the complex Ginibre ensemble and its chiral counterpart where shown to share the same limiting statistics at the edge [37]. Hence, at least 6 of the 38 classes follow the local spectral statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble in the bulk and at least 4 at the edge of the spectrum.\n\nIn the present work, we analytically confirm the conjecture $[15,34]$ that two symmetry classes, complex symmetric matrices (class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ ) and the $2 N$-dimensional complex self-dual random matrices (class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ ), do not follow the local statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble (class A). These ensembles are all Gaussian to keep the analysis simple. For the complex Ginibre ensemble the nearest-neighbour spacing distribution in the bulk (as well as all other complex eigenvalue correlation functions) is well known, see [5]. However, there are no analytical results known so far for the symmetry classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ in the large- $N$ limit, except for the spectral density at weak non-Hermiticity for class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ in [39]. It is given in terms of a triple integral.\n\nIt is the goal of this article to start filling this gap, by providing analytical results, in particular in the global limit, local bulk and local edge scaling limit for classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. We will show that in all these limits the difference amongst the 3 classes prevails. Due to the lack of an explicit expression for the joint probability density of the complex eigenvalues for the two classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, we have chosen to study expectation values of products of characteristic polynomials to demonstrate their differences. For those quantities, a direct computation based on their matrix representation is feasible with the help of supersymmetric techniques, see [40] for an introduction of this method. An alternative approach uses diffusion equations [41], which has been applied to the 9 classes considered in [15], including classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. In [41], a duality was derived expressing the average over $k$ pairs of characteristic polynomials with matrix size $N$ by matrix averages of dimension $k$, without taking the large- $N$ limit though. We will recover these expressions using supersymmetry.\n\nCharacteristic polynomials are useful quantities in mathematics and physics, and we refer to [42] for a review when studying Hermitian and unitary ensembles. In non-Hermitian ensembles characteristic polynomials have been employed in the replica method [43, 44, 45], offering access to the effective Lagrangian. For finite matrix size, general expressions exist for products [46] and ratios [47, 48, 49] of characteristic polynomials in general determinantal ensembles, which have been generalised to Pfaffian ensembles for products in $[50,51,52,32,13,53]$. Such relations are important for algebraic aspects of the corresponding determinantal and Pfaffian point processes, providing representations for the respective (skew-)orthogonal polynomials and their kernels, see [57, 58]. However, such direct relations do not (yet) exist for products of characteristic polynomials in classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. At large- $N$ and away from the real line it was shown for products that the real and symplectic Ginibre ensemble agree [53] with the much simpler complex Ginibre ensemble [54]. The universality of products of characteristic polynomials has been explored for independent matrix entries using supersymmetric [55] and probabilistic methods [56].\n\nOur findings presented in the ensuing sections are as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the ensembles and our notation. The main result in this section is Proposition 2.1 about the analytical expressions for a single pair of characteristic polynomials for finite matrix size $N$ which are proven in Subsection 2.3. They are given most explicitly in terms of sums of truncated exponentials in all three ensembles. Section 3 is devoted to several large- $N$ limits, also for $k=1$. We begin with the global limit, which is compared to the rescaled quantities from Subsection 2.3, plotted at various values of\n\n$N$. To set the stage for the local scaling limits, we briefly recall the limiting results for the complex Ginibre ensemble class A in the bulk and at the edge of the spectrum. Our intention is to highlight the intimate relation between the expected pair of characteristic polynomials and the kernel as well as the spectral density, which allows to make such an identification. In Subsection 3.3, we derive new analytical expressions in class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ for the edge of the spectrum which are summarised in Theorem 3.2. The local bulk limit is covered in Proposition 3.3 in Subsection 3.4. While both results follow easily from finite matrix dimension $N$ in class A and $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$, class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ is more involved, requiring a detailed analysis. A differential equation for its integral representation is presented in Appendix A.\n\nIn Section 4, we consider expectation values of products of $k>1$ pairs of characteristic polynomials. Both limiting expressions when zooming into in the bulk (Theorem 4.1) and at the edge (Theorem 4.2) are new and can be found in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. The former is given in terms of Itzykson-Zuber integrals [59], which are compact group integrals over the unitary, unitary-symplectic, and orthogonal group of dimensions $k$, respectively $2 k$. At the edge, the resulting group integrals of the same dimensions become non-compact, over complex, quaternion and real valued matrices. In class A these group integrals can be performed and a comparison based on previous results on orthogonal polynomials is made in Appendix B. Our conclusions and open questions are presented in Section 5.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Finite- $N$ results for a single pair of characteristic polynomials\n### 2.1 Definition of the ensembles of random matrices of class $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$\n\nTo get an idea of our techniques and results as well as have very explicitly formulas, we consider the expectation value of a product of two characteristic polynomials. One characteristic polynomial depends on the non-Hermitian random matrix $J$ and the other one on its complex conjugate $J^{*}$, i.e., the main object will be\n\n$$\nD_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right):=\\left\\langle\\operatorname{det}\\left[z \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}-J\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[w^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}-J^{*}\\right]\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwith $z, w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ fixed, $\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}$ is the identity matrix of matrix dimension $d_{N}$, and $J$ is drawn from a Gaussian probability density\n\n$$\nP(J)=\\frac{1}{Z_{N}} \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(J J^{\\dagger}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere the partition function $Z_{N}$ (normalisation constant) is specified below. The latter certainly strongly depends on from which non-Hermitian matrix space $J$ is taken. The average over an observable $\\mathcal{O}(J)$ is denoted for all ensembles by\n\n$$\n\\langle\\mathcal{O}(J)\\rangle:=\\frac{1}{Z_{N}} \\int[d J] \\mathcal{O}(J) \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(J J^{\\dagger}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $[d J]$ denotes the flat Lebesgue measure over all independent complex matrix elements. We underline that the measure $[d J]$ looks different for the three ensembles when writing it out explicitly, as the possible symmetries relate the matrix entries. This leads to $N^{2}$ complex independent elements for class $A, N(N+1) / 2$ for class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $2 N^{2}-N$ for class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. The measure of a complex number $z=x+i y$ is chosen as $d^{2} z=d x d y$. The Hermitian conjugate of $J$ is denoted by $J^{\\dagger}$.\n\nThe first and simplest ensemble, we study, has been introduced by Ginibre [1]. It is given by $N \\times N$ random matrices with independent identically normal distributed complex matrix elements, $J_{i j} \\in \\mathcal{N}_{\\mathbb{C}}(0,1)$ for $i, j=1, \\ldots, N$. We adapt the notation of $[24,29,2]$ and label it with the Cartan class notation A. Its partition function reads\n\n$$\nZ_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}:=\\int[d J] \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(J J^{\\dagger}\\right)\\right]=\\prod_{i, j=1}^{N} \\int d^{2} J_{i j} \\exp \\left[-\\left|J_{i j}\\right|^{2}\\right]=\\pi^{N^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe second ensemble we consider consists of complex symmetric $N \\times N$ matrices $J=J^{T}$. As in the complex Ginibre ensemble, the requirement of invariance under the group action $J \\rightarrow U J U^{T}$ for any unitary matrix $U \\in \\mathrm{U}(N)$ fixes the weight up to a scaling, when assuming that all independent matrix elements are Gaussian. This however also implies that the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements have a different variance. We label this ensemble with $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$, see [24, 29, 2], and its partition function is\n$Z_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}:=\\int[d J] \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(J J^{\\dagger}\\right)\\right]=\\prod_{l=1}^{N} \\int d^{2} J_{l l} \\exp \\left[-\\left|J_{l l}\\right|^{2}\\right] \\prod_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq N} \\int d^{2} J_{i j} \\exp \\left[-2\\left|J_{i j}\\right|^{2}\\right]=\\pi^{N}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}}$.\nThe third ensemble we consider is that of a complex self-dual $2 N \\times 2 N$ random matrix $J$. In a $2 N$-dimensional complex representation it consists of 3 complex non-Hermitian matrices $A, B, C$ of size $N \\times N$, where the latter two are anti-symmetric, $B^{T}=-B, C^{T}=-C$ :\n\n$$\nJ=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nA & B \\\\\nC & A^{T}\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad \\text { with } J^{\\dagger}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nA^{\\dagger} & -C^{*} \\\\\n-B^{*} & A^{*}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nChoosing the following embedding of the second Pauli matrix\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{y}:=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -i \\mathbf{1}_{N} \\\\\ni \\mathbf{1}_{N} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad \\Sigma_{y}^{-1}=\\Sigma_{y}\n$$\n\nwe have the following symmetry on $J$\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{y} J^{T} \\Sigma_{y}=J\n$$\n\nThis symmetry is called self-duality, and we follow [24, 29, 2] by labelling the ensemble with $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$.

In order to do the integrals, we linearised the quartic term in the Grassmann variables with an auxiliary variable $a \\in \\mathbb{C}$ integrated over the complex plane, i.e.,\n\n$$\n1=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int d^{2} a \\exp \\left[-\\left(a-i \\sum_{l=1}^{N} \\xi_{l} \\psi_{l}\\right)\\left(a^{*}-i \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\xi_{j}^{*} \\psi_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe single sum in the exponent in (2.27) is the scalar product\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left(\\xi_{j}^{*} z \\xi_{j}+\\psi_{j}^{*} w^{*} \\psi_{j}+i a \\xi_{j}^{*} \\psi_{j}^{*}+i a^{*} \\xi_{j} \\psi_{j}\\right)=\\left(\\xi^{\\dagger}, \\psi^{T}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nz \\mathbf{1}_{N} & i a \\mathbf{1}_{N} \\\\\n-i a^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{N} & -w^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{N}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{\\xi}{\\psi^{*}}\n$$\n\nIt is not difficult to see that in the integral (2.12) an exchange of variables $\\xi \\leftrightarrow \\xi^{*}$ leads to a Jacobian of $(-1)^{N}$. This change of variables will put the scalar product in (2.29) into the form that (2.12) can be applied, in this case for a $2 N \\times 2 N$ matrix. This leads to the result ${ }^{3}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{N}^{\\Lambda}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right) & =\\frac{(-1)^{N}}{\\pi} \\int d^{2} a e^{-|a|^{2}} \\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nz \\mathbf{1}_{N} & i a \\mathbf{1}_{N} \\\\\n-i a^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{N} & -w^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{N}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int d^{2} a \\exp \\left[-|a|^{2}\\right]\\left[z w^{*}+|a|^{2}\\right]^{N} \\\\\n& =\\exp \\left[z w^{*}\\right] \\int_{z w^{*}}^{\\infty} d t \\exp [-t] t^{N}=e^{z w^{*}} \\Gamma\\left(N+1, z w^{*}\\right)=N!E_{N}\\left(z w^{*}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, we changed to polar coordinates $a=\\sqrt{t} e^{i \\phi}$ with $t$ the squared radius of $a$ and exploited (2.14) and (2.15). Because the upper incomplete Gamma-function (2.15) is analytic in its second argument we are allowed to employ it for complex $z w^{*}$, as well.\n\nThe normalisation can be readily obtained from this result,\n\n$$\nD_{N}^{\\Lambda}(0,0)=N!\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ Because the integrals over Grassmann variables are in the end always integrals over polynomials in these variables, they commute with the Gaussian integral(s).\n\nfinishing the proof of (2.22) for the complex Ginibre ensemble (class A).\nClass $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ : Next, we show (2.23) for the ensemble of complex symmetric matrices. The average of the determinants can be expressed as in (2.25), however, we now have to take into account the symmetry $J_{j l}=J_{l

Using the fact that the Pfaffian determinant of an antisymmetric matrix $G$ relates to the determinant as $\\operatorname{Pf}[G]=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{det}[G]}$, as well as the evaluation of determinants with block matrices $A, B, C, D$ ( $A$ must be invertible) via Schur complement,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\nA & B \\\\\nC & D\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\operatorname{det}\\left[A D-A C A^{-1} B\\right]\n$$\n\nwe can compute the Pfaffian in (2.38) which is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2 z w^{*}+|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{N} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2 z w^{*}+|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{N}\n\\end{array}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{2^{N}}\\left(2 z w^{*}+|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}\\right)^{N}\n$$\n\nThis leads to the following double integral expression for the expected characteristic polynomials\n\n$$\nD_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI} \\dagger}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)=\\int \\frac{d^{2} a d^{2} b}{\\pi^{2}} \\exp \\left[-|a|^{2}-|b|^{2}\\right] \\frac{1}{2^{N}}\\left(2 z w^{*}+|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}\\right)^{N}=\\frac{1}{2^{N}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d t e^{-t} t\\left(2 z w^{*}+t\\right)^{N}\n$$\n\nIn the second equality we have employed spherical coordinates with $t=|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}$ the squared radius.

First, we present plots for the rescaled characteristic polynomials at different values of $N$ over the entire range of the spectrum, helping us in identifying different scaling regimes. In particular, we present the global limit for all three classes, before zooming into the local edge and bulk regime in the subsequent subsections. To deal with those in a unifying way, it is useful to introduce the dimension\n\n$$\nd_{N}=N \\quad \\text { for } \\quad \\mathrm{A} \\text { and } \\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad d_{N}=2 N \\quad \\text { for } \\quad \\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}\n$$\n\nand the scaling\n\n$$\ns=1 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad \\mathrm{A} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad s=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\text { for } \\quad \\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger} \\text { and } \\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}\n$$\n\nThe scaling $s$ properly normalises the limiting support of the expectation value (2.1) as well as the eigenvalues to the unit disc for all three ensembles. The latter we have checked numerically which also implies that the local mean level spacing of the eigenvalues is normalised to the same distance so that the local statistics become comparable.\n\nOur results for the global limit can be summarised as follows.\nProposition 3.1 (Global limit for a pair of characteristic polynomials).\nLet $r \\geq 0$. For the rescaled characteristic polynomials\n\n$$\nF_{N}(r):=\\left.\\exp \\left[-d_{N} z w^{*}\\right] \\frac{D_{N}\\left(\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z, \\sqrt{d_{N}} s w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}(0,0)}\\right|_{z w^{*}=r^{2}}\n$$\n\ncf., Proposition 2.1, we obtain the following global limits\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& D_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r):=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} F_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r)=\\Theta(1-r) \\\\\n& D_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(r):=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} F_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(r)=\\left(1-r^{2}\\right) \\Theta(1-r) \\\\\n& D_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(r):=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} F_{N}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(r)=\\frac{1}{1-r^{2}} \\Theta(1-r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Theta(1-r)$ is the Heaviside step-function restricting the support to the interval $[0,1]$.\nClass A: Anew, we begin with the derivation for the complex Ginibre ensemble, where it is well known that it converges to the circular law, since $F_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r)$ is up to a normalisation factor the global spectral density of the eigenvalues in the complex plane when $z=w$, see [1]. The rescaled quantity (3.3) can be rewritten in terms of the ratio (2.16) due to (2.22), i.e.,\n\n$$\nF_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r)=Q\\left(N+1, N r^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe exponential factor in (2.22) is removed, as it is well known that the remaining normalised incomplete Gamma-function has a finite limit. The global limit of this function is obtained from the convergence of the normalised lower incomplete Gamma-function [61, 8.11.6 \\& 8.11.7]\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r)=\\Theta(1-r)\n$$\n\nThe corrections are exponentially suppressed except when $r \\approx 1$ where it becomes algebraic due to [61, 8.11.12]. Later, in the local edge scaling limit the step of the function $F_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}(r)$ at $r=1$ will be studied at a finer resolution, cf., eqs. (3.17) and (3.19). The results (3.5) and (3.6) are plotted in Fig. 1 (top left plot) for $N=10,20,50$ and in the limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nClass $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ : We turn to the derivation for complex symmetric matrices. Due to the very similar form, cf., eqs. (2.22) and (2.23), the computation goes along the same lines. We would like to emphasise that the joint probability density of the eigenvalues for this ensemble is unknown, and no relation between the expected characteristic polynomials and the eigenvalue density can be expected a priori. The global spectral density is expected to satisfy the circular law with radius $\\sqrt{2}$ without introducing the scaling $s$.\n\nTo have a similar situation as in the complex Ginibre ensemble, we also remove the exponential prefactor in (2.23). Once we use the result (2.23) in (3.3), we consider\n\n$$\nF_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(r)=Q\\left(N+1, N r^{2}\\right)-\\frac{N r^{2}}{N+1} Q\\left(N, N r^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs for class $A$, it is clear from the asymptotic of the incomplete Gamma-function [61, 8.11.6 \\& 8.11.7] that we obtain for the global limit\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(r)=\\left(1-r^{2}\\right) \\Theta(1-r)\n$$\n\nAs in class A the correction terms are exponentially suppressed when staying away from the vicinity about $r=1$. Plots of (3.7) for $N=10,20,50$ and (3.8) for $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ can be found in Fig. 1 (top right plot).\n\nClass $\\mathbf{A I I}^{\\dagger}$ : The case of the complex self-dual ensemble is more involved. We start like before with properly scaling the spectral variables $z$ and $w^{*}$ and then removing the exponential prefactor in (2.24),\n\n$$\nF_{N}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(r)=\\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\frac{N!(2 N-2 j)!}{(2 N)!(N-j)!}\\left(4 N r^{2}\\right)^{j} Q\\left(2 N-2 j+1,2 N r^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Plots of the rescaled characteristic polynomials for finite- $N$ as a function of $r=z w^{*} \\geq 0$ for $N=10,20,50$ (dotted orange, dashed green, solid red, respectively) and the global limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ (thick blue). Top left: rescaled density of the complex Ginibre ensemble (3.5) (class A); Top right: rescaled characteristic polynomials for the complex symmetric ensemble (3.7) (class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ ); Bottom: rescaled characteristic polynomials for the complex self-dual ensemble (3.9) (class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ ). The position of the edge of the global limit is rescaled to unity.\n\nWe have renamed the summation index $j \\rightarrow N-j$ as the main contribution for $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ comes from a neighbourhood where $j$ is of order one. The summands have indeed a point wise limit\n\n$$\n\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{N!(2 N-2 j)!}{(2 N)!(N-j)!}\\left(4 N r^{2}\\right)^{j} Q\\left(2 N-2 j+1,2 N r^{2}\\right)=r^{2 j} \\Theta(1-r)\n$$\n\nfor any fixed $j$, due Stirling's approximation for the factorials and the asymptotic of the incomplete Gamma-function [61, 8.11.6 \\& 8.11.7]. One can even relax the fixed condition of $j$ and allow any $j=o(\\sqrt{N})$ when considering the Taylor expansion of the summands. We omit here to show that there is actually a sequence of $N$-independent summands whose series converges. This would be needed to be allowed to apply Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem.\n\nSummarising, we obtain a geometric series\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {global }}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(r) \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} r^{2 j} \\Theta(1-r)=\\frac{1}{1-r^{2}} \\Theta(1-r)\n$$\n\nwhich is drawn in Fig. 1 (bottom plot) as well as for the values $N=10,20,50$ of the finite- $N$ expression (3.9).\n\nLet us remark again that in both classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ the rescaled characteristic polynomials do not directly relate to the eigenvalue density as it is the case in class A, though some kind of relation will be still present. Therefore, the quantity $D_{\\text {global }}(r)$ is not normalised nor it is guaranteed to be normalisable as we can see in the class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ for which (3.11) is not integrable over its support. Indeed, the integrals over their finite- $N$ expressions depend on the matrix dimension.\n\nThe question remains how we can interpret the different shapes of the curves in Fig. 1. In [34], the local nearest-neighbour spacing distribution in radial distance in the bulk of the spectrum was compared for complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices to the one of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas as a function of inverse temperature $\\beta$ (the Dyson index). Fitting the value of $\\beta$ accordingly, the following values of $\\beta \\approx 1.4\\left(\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}\\right)$ and $\\beta \\approx 2.6\\left(\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}\\right)$ were found in [34]. This approximate local description by a two-dimensional Coulomb gas was further corroborated by fitting also the next-to-nearest-neighbour spacing distributions, that confirm these approximate values of $\\beta$, see [18]. Furthermore, perturbation theoretic methods [64] as well as recent numerical simulations [65] show that for $\\beta>2$ the spectral density of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas overshoots the $\\beta=2$ result in the neighbourhood of the edge and eventually starts to oscillate when increasing $\\beta$ even further, cf., [64, Figure 1] and [65, Figure 4]. The overshooting is also visible for class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ for the average of a pair of characteristic polynomials, see bottom plot of Fig. 1. In contrast, for $\\beta<2$ the authors of [65] found a damping of the spectral density at the edge compared to $\\beta=2$, see Figure 2 therein, which agrees with what we found for the pair of characteristic polynomials in the top right plot of Fig. 1 for class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$. Thus, our analytical findings in the present work are consistent with the (approximate) values of $\\beta \\approx 1.4$ and $\\beta \\approx 2.6$ for the ensembles $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ for their respective local bulk statistics.\n\nWe conclude that although we have to emphasise that the expectation value of two characteristic polynomials does not have any known relation to the spectral density in the $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ or $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ ensemble, the behaviour just described is consistent with the heuristically determined $\\beta$-values in [34, 18], and the properties of a two-dimensional Coulomb gas in $[64,65]$.

{"section_id": 6, "text": "# 3.2 Complex Ginibre ensemble: Edge and bulk scaling of the density revisited \n\nIn this subsection, we briefly recall the edge and bulk scaling limit of the complex Ginibre ensemble, which is a determinantal point process with kernel $K_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)$. We choose the convention that $K_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)$ denotes the polynomial part of the kernel, without the corresponding weight functions, which is also know as pre-kernel. In this form it equals the normalised expectation value of two conjugate characteristic polynomials.\n\nThe following relation is known between this kernel at finite- $N$ and the characteristic polynomials, e.g., see $[1,46]$,\n\n$$\nK_{N}(z, w)=\\frac{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}(0,0)}=E_{N}\\left(z w^{*}\\right)=e^{z w^{*}} Q\\left(N+1, z w^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe eigenvalue density is given by the kernel at equal arguments, times the weight function of the Ginibre ensemble, $w(z)=\\exp \\left[-|z|^{2}\\right]$,\n\n$$\nR_{1, N}(z)=e^{-|z|^{2}} K_{N}\\left(z, z^{*}\\right)=Q\\left(N+1,|z|^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe would like to point out that this density is normalised to $N$.\nIn the global large- $N$ limit it converges to the circular law on a disc of radius $\\sqrt{N}$ in this normalisation,\n\n$$\nR_{1, N}(z) \\sim \\Theta(\\sqrt{N}-|z|)\n$$\n\nA further rescaling $z \\rightarrow \\sqrt{N} z$ maps the support to the unit disc.\nThe local bulk scaling limit is defined as follows. We pick a point $\\sqrt{N} z_{0}$ in the bulk of the spectrum, that is with $\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$. The vicinity of this bulk point is then parametrised as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz & =\\sqrt{N} z_{0}+\\chi, \\quad w^{*}=\\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*}+\\eta^{*} \\\\\nx & :=z w^{*}=N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}, \\quad y:=\\left(\\chi z_{0}^{*}+\\eta^{*} z_{0}\\right) / \\sqrt{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe limiting kernel in the bulk is, then, obtained by replacing the truncated sum $E_{N}\\left(z w^{*}\\right)$ in (3.12) by an exponential, leading to\n\n$$\nK_{\\text {bulk }}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} K_{N}\\left(\\sqrt{N} z_{0}+\\chi, \\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*}+\\eta^{*}\\right)\\left|{ }_{|z_{0}|<1} \\sim \\exp \\left[N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}\\right]\\right.\n$$\n\nStrictly speaking, the pre-kernel does not have a limit. Only after multiplying with the weight function, $e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(|z|^{2}+|w|^{2}\\right)} K_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)$ and after cancelling cocycles that drop out in the determinant of the $k$-point correlation function, it does lead to the limiting Ginibre kernel. This is why below we will remove the exponential factor in (3.12) when taking limits. Nevertheless, the bulk asymptotic (3.16) and edge asymptotic below will be very useful when comparing results for averages over more than one pair of characteristic polynomials, cf., Appendix B.\n\nTurning to the local edge scaling limit, we will choose the same rescaling as in (3.15), but require now that the point we zoom in is located on the unit circle, that is $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$. For the edge scaling we rewrite the truncated exponential function in the following way,\n\n$$\nE_{N}(x)=e^{x} Q(N+1, x)=e^{x}(1-P(N+1, x))\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nP(N+1, x)=\\frac{\\gamma(N+1, x)}{\\Gamma(N+1)}\n$$\n\nis the regularised lower incomplete Gamma-function $\\gamma(a, x)=\\Gamma(a)-\\Gamma(a, x)$. It enjoys the following asymptotic $[61,8.11 .10]$ for large- $N$, with the edge rescaling (3.15) at $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$,\n\n$$\nP(N+1, x)=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}(-y)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith the complementary error function (2.17). Once, we employ the identity (2.18), we find\n\n$$\nQ(N+1, x)=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}(y)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand hence the edge scaling asymptotic becomes\n\n$$\nK_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)=\\left.\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} K_{N}\\left(\\sqrt{N} z_{0}+\\chi, \\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*}+\\eta^{*}\\right)\\right|_{\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1} \\sim \\frac{1}{2} \\exp \\left[N+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}\\right] \\operatorname{erfc}(y)\n$$\n\nAfter multiplying it with the weight function and removing cocycles, it leads to the universal complementary error function kernel (sometimes called Faddeyeva plasma-kernel [66]).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 3.3 Local edge scaling limit for one pair of characteristic polynomials \n\nBecause only one of the three ensembles we consider is a determinantal point process, the complex Ginibre ensemble, we do not have the freedom to remove $N$-dependent cocycles from the limiting characteristic polynomials which are proportional to the kernel, nor can we argue why to multiply\n\nwith a weight function as in the Ginibre class A, which removes the leading contribution $\\exp \\left[N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right]$ from the expected characteristic polynomials in that case.\n\nTherefore, we choose a different route in defining the limiting characteristic polynomials, by removing the exponential prefactor $\\exp \\left[z w^{*}\\right]$ that appears in all three ensembles, see eqs. (2.22), (2.23) and (2.24), respectively. Furthermore, as in the expressions for finite matrix dimension $N$ given in Proposition 2.1, we divide by the value of the respective characteristic polynomials at the origin, $D_{N}(0,0)$. It turns out that for classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ an additional rescaling in powers of $N^{ \\pm 1 / 2}$ is necessary.\n\nTheorem 3.2 (Local limits of a pair of characteristic polynomials at the spectral edge).\nWe recall the definitions (3.1), (3.2) as well as Owen's T-function (2.21) and the results of Proposition 2.1. The vicinity of edge points is defined as\n\n$$\nz=\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0}+s \\chi, \\quad w^{*}=\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0}^{*}+s \\eta^{*}, \\quad z w^{*}=s^{2}\\left(d_{N}+\\sqrt{2 d_{N}} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$ and $y=\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right) / \\sqrt{2}$.

We normalised the expectation value by its value at $\\chi=\\eta^{*}=0$ for comparability which is given by (3.29). The curve for class A (solid blue) with $D_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)$ from (3.23) normalised by $D_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{A}}(0,0)$ saturates at 2 . Class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ (dashed orange) given by (3.24) has a clearly visible linear rise, and class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ (dotted red) following (3.25) shows the decay $\\sim-1 / \\sqrt{2} y$ which starts to be visible for large negative values of $y$.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, we need Owen's $T$-function at $x=0$ in its first argument, see (2.21), which is an elementary integral. We need the values (3.29) when going over to an average over $k \\geq 1$ pairs of characteristic polynomials, see Theorem 4.2 .\n\nWe would like to highlight that the edge limits of all three ensembles are translation invariant along the boundary since they only depend on $y$ and not on $\\chi$ and $\\eta^{*}$ independently. Indeed, when shifting $\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)+t\\left(z_{0},-z_{0}^{*}\\right)$ the variable $y$ remains unchanged, see (3.15). This could be expected for a smooth boundary of the global support because in the local limit the boundary will be well-approximated by its tangent at this point so that the edge will follow this straight line.\n\nTheorem 3.2 implies that at the edge of the spectrum we indeed found three different classes of limiting characteristic polynomials. They are conjectured to be universal based on numerics and symmetry arguments [29]. They are plotted in Fig. 2 for illustration and comparison.\n\nThe difference between the three ensembles is obvious. It is perhaps simplest to see in the left tail asymptotic, $y \\rightarrow-\\infty$ for which we have given not only the leading but also the next to leading order. For the complex Ginibre ensemble the limiting characteristic polynomial saturates to unity, the mean value of the spectral density, whereas for the classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ a linear rise and an algebraic decay dominates, respectively, cf., Fig. 1. The right tail in the complex Ginibre ensemble was noted first in [44] for the decay of the density at the edge.\n\nWe can only speculate why a different scaling is needed in all three ensembles in the edge scaling limit. For comparison, in the real and quaternion Ginibre ensembles the corresponding skew-symmetric\n\nkernel, that relates to the spectral density, is obtained from the expectation value of two characteristic polynomials after multiplying, respectively dividing by the difference of the arguments. When rescaling them with $\\sqrt{N}$ as it is done here, this will also give rise to extra powers in $\\sqrt{N}$. Our choice of the numerical part of the scaling is natural as we multiply with $\\sqrt{d_{N}}=\\sqrt{N}$ for $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and divide by $1 / \\sqrt{d_{N}}=1 / \\sqrt{2 N}$\n\nClass A: The edge limit of the complex Ginibre ensemble is well known and has been summarised in the previous subsection, especially one needs to insert the expansion (3.19) together with (3.17) into the definition (3.23) and (2.22) to arrive at the claim. The tail asymptotic (3.26) follows from the expansion of the complementary error function $[61,7.12 .1]$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{erfc}(z) \\sim\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} z} e^{-z^{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 z^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(z^{-4}\\right)\\right), & \\text { for } z \\rightarrow+\\infty \\\\\n2+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} z} e^{-z^{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 z^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(z^{-4}\\right)\\right), & \\text { for } z \\rightarrow-\\infty\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere we give the next-to-leading order, as well.\nClass AI ${ }^{\\dagger}$ : For the complex symmetric ensemble, it is preferable to write $E_{N-1}(x)=\\partial_{x} E_{N}(x)=$ $\\partial_{x}\\left(e^{x} Q(N+1, x)\\right)$ in (2.23). Let us mention again that the scaling with $s=1 / \\sqrt{2}$ guarantees the unit disc as the limiting support. Proceeding as for the Ginibre ensemble, we multiply (2.23) with $e^{-2 z w^{*}}$ to cancel the exponential and set $x=2 z w^{*}=N+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}$,\n\n$$\ne^{-2 z w^{*}} \\frac{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(0,0)}=Q(N+1, x)-\\frac{x e^{-x}}{N+1} \\partial_{x}\\left(e^{x} Q(N+1, x)\\right)\n$$\n\nWith help of the edge rescaling (3.22) at $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$ and the asymptotic (3.20) with $y=\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right) / \\sqrt{2}$, we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^{-2 z w^{*}} \\frac{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}(0,0)}= & \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}(y)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) \\\\\n& -\\frac{N+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}}{N+1}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 N}} \\partial_{y}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}(y)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n= & -\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2 N}} \\operatorname{erfc}(y)+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi N}} e^{-y^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe two order one terms cancel after expanding the ratio in $1 / N$. Eventually, we multiply with $\\sqrt{N}$ to find the result (3.24).\n\nFor the tail asymptotic we insert (3.30) into (3.24) and see that the leading order Gaussian decay cancels for the right tail, $y \\rightarrow+\\infty$\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) \\sim-y \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} y} e^{-y^{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 y^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-4}\\right)\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-y^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} y^{2}} e^{-y^{2}}\\left(1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe errors are uniform for any compact set where $y$ can be drawn from so that the derivative can indeed be interchanged with the limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nFor the left tail with $y \\rightarrow-\\infty$, we obtain from the corresponding asymptotic (3.30) of the complementary error function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) & \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-y^{2}}-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(2+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} y} e^{-y^{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2 y^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-4}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\sqrt{2} y+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} y^{2}} e^{-y^{2}}\\left(1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-2}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\na linear rise in $y$ (as $y<0$ ) as the leading term.\nClass AII ${ }^{1}$ : For the remaining ensemble of complex self-dual matrices, we cannot use standard asymptotic results. Our starting point is the integral representation (2.63) of (2.24) in the derivation for finite $N$, that we repeat for the readers' convenience:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.\\frac{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(0,0)}\\right|_{x=z w^{*}} & =\\frac{1}{(2 N)!} f_{N}(x), \\quad f_{N}(x)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d u e^{S(u, v)} \\\\\nS(u, v) & :=-u-v+N \\log \\left(4 x v+(2 x+u)^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis calls for a Laplace approximation at large $N$. Any critical point $\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n0=\\partial_{v} S\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)=-1+\\frac{4 N x}{4 x v_{*}+\\left(2 x+u_{*}\\right)^{2}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 0=\\partial_{u} S\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)=-1+\\frac{2 N\\left(2 x+u_{*}\\right)}{4 x v_{*}+\\left(2 x+u_{*}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nInserting the first into the second equation yields $u_{*}=0$, and reinserted into the first equation gives $v_{*}=N-x$.\n\nTo figure out whether the point $\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)$ is the global maximum of $S(u, v)$ we need to compare it with the extrema along the two boundaries. For the boundary $u=0$ and $v \\geq 0$,\n\n$$\n0=\\partial_{v} S(0, v)=-1+\\frac{N}{v+x}\n$$\n\nwe find the same point $\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)$, whereas along the boundary $u \\geq 0$ and $v=0$\n\n$$\n0=\\partial_{u} S\\left(u_{0}, 0\\right)=-1+\\frac{2 N}{2 x+u_{0}}\n$$\n\nwe find $\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)=(2(N-x), 0)$. Taking the second derivative confirms that both extrema are indeed local maxima. However, when inserting the scaling limit (3.22) with $x=N+\\sqrt{N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*} / 2$, since $d_{N}=2 N$ and $s=1 / \\sqrt{2}$, we see that both maxima $\\left(v_{*}, u_{*}\\right)$ and $\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)$ are only within the integration domain $v, u \\geq 0$ for negative values $y<0$. This can be expected as this is the direction into the bulk of the spectrum which becomes immediate when setting $z=w$.\n\nWhat is more important is that the leading order of both extrema is $\\sqrt{N}$ which is the same scale as the standard deviations of the Gaussians once we would expand about these points. This means that even an expansion about the origin would cover all relevant contributions from this integral. To pursue this direction we rescale $v=\\sqrt{N} v^{\\prime}$ and $u=2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}$,\n\n$$\nf_{N}(x)=(2 N)^{2 N+1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v^{\\prime} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d u^{\\prime} \\exp \\left[-\\sqrt{N} v^{\\prime}-2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}+N \\log \\left(\\frac{x v^{\\prime}}{N^{3 / 2}}+\\left(\\frac{x}{N}+\\frac{u^{\\prime}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe logarithm can be expanded as follows,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log \\left[\\frac{x v^{\\prime}}{N^{3 / 2}}+\\left(\\frac{x}{N}+\\frac{u^{\\prime}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\log \\left[1+\\frac{v^{\\prime}+2 u^{\\prime}+2 y}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\frac{1}{N}\\left(y v^{\\prime}+\\left(y+u^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+\\chi \\eta^{*}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{v^{\\prime}+u^{\\prime}}{N^{3 / 2}}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n= & 1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left(v^{\\prime}+2 u^{\\prime}+2 y\\right)-\\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\frac{\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}}{2}+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+y^{2}+2 v^{\\prime} u^{\\prime}+v^{\\prime} y+2 u^{\\prime} y-\\chi \\eta^{*}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)^{3}+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{3}}{N^{3 / 2}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis expansion can be stopped at the second order as long as $\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)^{3}+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{3} \\ll \\sqrt{N}$ because the logarithm is multiplied with $N$. This restriction is, nonetheless, not a problem since already for $v^{\\prime}+u^{\\prime} \\geq N^{\\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$ the integrand in (3.39) times $e^{-2 \\sqrt{N} y}$ is exponentially small which we omit to show here. It is essentially due to the fact that the maximum of the integrand in the region $v^{\\prime}+u^{\\prime} \\geq N^{\\varepsilon}$ is attained on the boundary $v^{\\prime}+u^{\\prime}=N^{\\varepsilon}$, because the directional derivative of $S(u, v)$ is always negative when the direction vector is non-zero and has non-negative entries, cf. the partial derivatives (3.36) which are negative in this region.\n\nSummarising, it is asymptotically\n\n$$\nf_{N}(x) \\sim(2 N)^{2 N+1} e^{2 \\sqrt{N} y-y^{2}+\\chi \\eta^{*}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d u e^{-u^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} v^{2}-y(v+2 u)-2 v u}\n$$\n\nwhen $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.

To get a closed expression as stated in (3.25), we make the ansatz\n\n$$\ng^{\\prime}(v)=-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{2} v) e^{v^{2}}\n$$\n\ncf., Appendix A, which would simplify the integral (3.44) as follows\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{AH}^{\\dagger}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)=e^{-y^{2} / 2}(g(y / \\sqrt{2})-g(+\\infty))\n$$\n\nThis approach is motivated by the fact that the original integral (2.62) satisfies an inhomogenous first order differential equation, as derived in the Appendix A. Here, we directly solve the differential equation (3.45) for $g(v)$.\n\nFor this purpose, we make use of Owen's $T$-function with an imaginary number in its second entry (2.21). Its derivative in its first entry is explicitly given by\n\n$$\n\\partial_{x} T(x, i b)=-\\frac{i x}{2 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{b} d u e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^{2}\\left(1-u^{2}\\right)}=-\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi}} e^{-x^{2} / 2} \\operatorname{erfi}\\left[\\frac{b x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThence, when choosing $x=2 v$ and $b=1 / \\sqrt{2}$, the derivative of\n\n$$\ng(v)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{2} v) \\operatorname{erfi}(v)-i \\sqrt{\\pi} T\\left(2 v, \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nsolves the differential equation (3.45).\nWe still have to determine $g(+\\infty)$. While the asymptotic of the complementary error function is given in (3.30), for the error function at imaginary argument we have [67]\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{erfi}(v)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi} v} e^{+v^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2 v^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(1 / v^{4}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is even valid for both $y \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$. Therefore, for the first term in (3.48) we obtain\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\operatorname{erfc}(\\sqrt{2} v) \\operatorname{erfi}(v) \\sim \\begin{cases}-\\frac{1}{4 \\sqrt{2 \\pi} v^{2}} e^{-v^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{4 v^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(v^{-4}\\right)\\right), & \\text { for } v \\rightarrow+\\infty \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2 v} e^{+v^{2}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2 v^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(v^{-4}\\right)\\right), & \\text { for } v \\rightarrow-\\infty\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nimplying that it vanishes for $v \\rightarrow+\\infty$. For the tail asymptotic, we also give the expansion for $v \\rightarrow-\\infty$.\nWe did not find the asymptotic of Owen's $T$-function in the literature. Hence, we present a short derivation. Starting from (2.21), the substitution $z=\\left(1-u^{2}\\right) v^{2}$ leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-i \\sqrt{\\pi} T(2 v, i / \\sqrt{2}) & =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} v^{2}} e^{-v^{2}} \\int_{0}^{v^{2}} d z e^{-z}\\left(1+\\frac{z}{v^{2}}\\right)^{-1}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{v^{2}}\\right)^{-1 / 2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} v^{2}} e^{-v^{2}} \\int_{0}^{v^{2}} d z e^{-z}\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{z}{v^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{z^{2}}{v^{4}}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} v^{2}} e^{-v^{2}}\\left[1-\\frac{1}{2 v^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{v^{4}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last step we used elementary integrals. The expansion of the integrand is only uniform when cutting off at $z \\leq v^{\\varepsilon} \\ll v^{2}$ for any constant $\\varepsilon \\in(0,2)$. Like before this is not a problem as the integrand is uniformly bounded from above by $e^{-v^{\\varepsilon}} / \\sqrt{1-z / v^{2}}$ when $z \\in\\left(v^{\\varepsilon}, v^{2}\\right)$, whose integral thus vanishes exponentially for $v \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nLet us remark that the expansion in $1 / v$ holds for both $y \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$; in particular, it vanishes in both limits. As a result, the asymptotic yields $g(+\\infty)=0$ so that the full solution for the edge scaling limit from (3.46) is given by (3.25).\n\nAfter having evaluated the asymptotic of $g(v)$ already in great detail, we can immediately give the tail estimates. For $y \\rightarrow+\\infty$, it is\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) \\sim e^{-y^{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8 \\pi} y^{2}}\\left(1-\\frac{5}{2 y^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-4}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere both terms in (3.25) contribute to the same order. For $y \\rightarrow-\\infty$, the asymptotic of the complementary error function (3.30) gives the leading contribution while Owen's $T$-function can be neglected. Thence, it is\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {edge }}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) \\sim-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} y}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{y^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-4}\\right)\\right)+e^{-y^{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} y^{2}}\\left(1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(y^{-2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich completes the derivation of (3.28). We note that for negative $y$ this is a positive function.\nAll three limiting characteristic polynomials at the edge are plotted in Fig. 2. The difference is most pronounced at large negative $y$.

{"section_id": 8, "text": "# 3.4 Bulk scaling limit for one pair of characteristic polynomials \n\nThe limiting expressions for the rescaled characteristic polynomials in the bulk can be defined in a similar way as at the edge.\n\nProposition 3.3 (Local limits of a pair of characteristic polynomials in the spectral bulk).\nRecalling Proposition 2.1, the local scaling in the bulk, defined

\\eta^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$ and $y=\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right) / \\sqrt{2}$ as well as the definitions (3.1) and (3.2), leads to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{\\text {bulk }}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) & :=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-z w^{*}} \\frac{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(z,

w^{*}\\right)}{D_{N}^{\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}}(0,0)}=\\frac{1}{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAll three results are consistent with the respective global limit eqs. (3.6), (3.8) and (3.11) with $r=\\left|z_{0}\\right|$. In particular, they give unity at the origin, by setting $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=0$ on the right hand sides, which is consistent with their definition. This agreement and its independence of $\\chi$ and $\\eta^{*}$ reflect that all three ensembles satisfy locally translation invariance and isotropy as it is well-known for the three Ginibre ensembles.\n\nClass A: Looking at (2.22), the result for the Ginibre ensemble is trivial, as the corrections to $e^{-x} E_{N}(x) \\rightarrow 1$ are exponentially suppressed in this kind of large- $N$ limit.\n\nClass $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ : Likewise, the result (2.23) for complex symmetric matrices yields for the limit (3.56)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-2 z w^{*}}\\left(E_{N}\\left(2 z w^{*}\\right)-\\frac{2 z w^{*}}{N+1} E_{N-1}\\left(2 z w^{*}\\right)\\right) & =1-\\frac{N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{2 N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*}}{N+1} \\\\\n& =1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}} y+\\mathcal{O}(1 / N)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas both truncated exponentials give unity. Evidently, the subleading term contains non-trivial information about the local spectral fluctuation $y$, that deviates from a constant behaviour.\n\nClass $\\mathbf{A I I}^{\\dagger}$ : Let us turn to the ensemble of complex self-dual matrices, where we return to (3.36) determining the critical points. We note that this time the bulk scaling (3.54) is equal to $x=z w^{*}=$ $N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{N} y+\\chi \\eta^{*} / 2$, with $0<\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$. Because of that, the maximum at $\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)=(0, N-x)$ (and maximum at the boundary $(0, v>0)$ ) as well the maximum $\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)=(2(N-x), 0)$ at the boundary $(u>0,0)$ are both inside the integration domain $u, v \\geq 0$.\n\nWe need to compare the integrand in $f_{N}(x)$, see (2.63), at these two points to decide which of those is the global maximum. For this purpose, we ask for the leading asymptotic of the integrand $\\exp [S(u, v)]$, with\n\n$$\nS(u, v)=-u-v+N \\log \\left[4 x v+(2 x+u)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nat these two points which is\n\n$$\ne^{S\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)} \\sim\\left(2 N\\left|z_{0}\\right|\\right)^{2 N} \\exp \\left[-N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\right] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad e^{S\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)} \\sim(2 N)^{2 N} \\exp \\left[-2 N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThus, we obtain for the difference\n\n$$\nS\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)-S\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right) \\sim N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+2 \\log \\left|z_{0}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nThe function $h(a)=1-a+\\log a$ is strictly increasing for $a=\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2} \\in(0,1)$ and takes its maximum at $a=1$ which is $h(1)=0$. Therefore, it is $S\\left(u_{*}, v_{*}\\right)<S\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)$ for suitable large $N$ and $\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)=$ $(2(N-x), 0)$ is the position of the global maximum.\n\nConsequently, we substitute $u=2 N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)+2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}$ while the variable $v$ remains unchanged. Plugging this into the integral (3.35) we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{N}(x)= & 2 \\sqrt{N} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\int_{-\\sqrt{N}\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)}^{\\infty} d u^{\\prime} e^{-2 N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)-2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}-v}\\left[4 x v+\\left(2 x+2 N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)+2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{N} \\\\\n= & \\frac{(2 N)^{2 N+1}}{\\sqrt{N}} e^{-2 N\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\int_{-\\sqrt{N}\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)}^{\\infty} d u^{\\prime} e^{-2 \\sqrt{N} u^{\\prime}-v}\\left[1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\frac{1}{N}\\left(v\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\chi \\eta^{*}+\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)^{2}\\right)+\\frac{1}{N^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\left(v y+\\chi \\eta^{*}\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{v+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}}{N^{2}}\\right)\\right]^{N}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, we have inserted the bulk scaling (3.54) and expanded far enough to keep the first subleading order in the final result. In the next step, we have to exponentiate the bracket to the $N$ th power, and then expand the logarithm up to third order, $\\log [1+z]=z-\\frac{z^{2}}{2}+\\frac{z^{3}}{3}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(z^{4}\\right)$. In addition, from the definition (3.57) we have to appropriately normalise according to (3.35). Inserting all together a lot of terms cancel, and we arrive at\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^{-2 x} \\frac{f_{N}(x)}{(2 N)!}= & \\frac{(2 N)^{2 N+1} e^{-2 N}}{\\sqrt{N}(2 N)!} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\int_{-\\sqrt{N}\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)}^{\\infty} d u^{\\prime} \\exp \\left[-v\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)-\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& \\times\\left[1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left(v y-2\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)\\left(v y+\\frac{1}{2} \\chi \\eta^{*}-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(u^{\\prime}+y\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{v^{2}+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{4}}{N}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying the Stirling formula simplifies the prefactor to $1 / \\sqrt{\\pi}$ when $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. The error in the integral is uniform when we restrict the integration to $v^{2}+\\left(u^{\\prime}\\right)^{4} \\ll N$. As before, one can show that this does not cause any problems since the integrand is exponentially small compared to the main contribution at the origin for any choice $\\varepsilon>0$ of $v+\\left|u^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq N^{\\varepsilon}$, since the maximum of $S(u, v)$ in this region lies on the boundary $v+\\left|u^{\\prime}\\right|=N^{\\varepsilon}$. Therefore, Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem is applicable.\n\nA similar statement would also allow us to extend the integral to $-\\infty$ for which we skip the rigorous mathematical details. Once done, we can exploit that all the odd moments in the Gaussian variable $u^{\\prime}+y$ vanish, i.e.,\n\n$$\ne^{-2 x} \\frac{f_{N}(x)}{(2 N)!}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d v \\exp \\left[-v\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\right]\\left[1+\\frac{v y}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{v^{2}}{N}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nHere, we carried out the integral over $u^{\\prime}$ yielding $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ up to order $1 / N$. We are left with the elementary integral over the variable $v$ which is\n\n$$\ne^{-2 x} \\frac{f_{N}(x)}{(2 N)!}=\\frac{1}{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\frac{y}{\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis ends the derivation of the bulk limit for class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ in (3.57), including the first $y$-dependent correction term.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 4 Expectation values for $k$ pairs of characteristic polynomials \n\nAs the classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ lack the insight of an explicit joint probability density of the complex eigenvalues we need to circumvent this obstacle. The aim is to derive an effective Lagrangian representation, similar to those for real eigenvalue statistics of Hermitian random matrix ensembles. Those\n\nwere very helpful in explaining the applicability of random matrix theory to quantum field theories [68] and condensed matter theory [69].\n\nIn these applications, the main object is usually an average over products or ratios of characteristic polynomials. For instance, we consider the quantity\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{N, k}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right) & :=\\frac{\\left\\langle\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\operatorname{det}\\left[J-z_{j} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[J^{\\dagger}-w_{j}^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}\\right]\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle\\left|\\operatorname{det}\\left[J-\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}\\right]\\right|^{2 k}\\right\\rangle} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left\\langle\\operatorname{det}\\left[J \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes Z\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes W^{*}\\right]\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle\\left|\\operatorname{det}\\left[J \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}\\right]\\right|^{2}\\right\\rangle}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $Z=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{k}\\right)$ and $W^{*}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(w_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, w_{k}^{*}\\right)$. We recall the definitions (3.1) and (3.2), in particular that the dimension $d_{N}$ and the scaling $s$ depend on the ensemble. We employed tensor notation to write everything in a compact form, and we normalised the expectation value to simplify the calculations below so that we can easily keep track of the normalisation constants; especially it holds $D_{N, k}\\left(\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}, \\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}}\\right)=1$.\n\nIn the physics literature, e.g., see $[68,69,70]$, expectation values as those in the numerator of (4.1) can be usually cast for large- $N$ into the form\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\operatorname{det}\\left[J \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes Z\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes W^{*}\\right]\\right\\rangle \\sim C_{N} \\int_{\\mathcal{S}} d \\mu(U) \\exp \\left[-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\left(U, Z, W^{*}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{N}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)$ is some $N$-dependent constant, $\\mathcal{S}$ is a saddle point manifold (also known as Goldstone manifold) whose size depends on $k$ but is independent of $N, d \\mu(U)$ is the uniform measure on $\\mathcal{S}$, and $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {eff }}\\left(U, Z, W^{*}\\right)$ is the effective Lagrangian depending on the source variables $Z$ and $W^{*}$ as well as on $U$. The spurion analysis [70] gives some low order expansion for $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {eff }}\\left(U, Z, W^{*}\\right)$ in terms of its arguments. We note that the set $\\mathcal{S}$ as well as the Lagrangian usually depend on the points where one zooms into. In our case, this zooming is given by\n\n$$\nz_{j}=\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0}+s \\chi_{j} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad w_{j}^{*}=\\sqrt{d_{N}} s z_{0}+s \\eta_{j}^{*}\n$$\n\nwith $\\chi=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\chi_{1}, \\ldots, \\chi_{k}\\right)$ and $\\eta=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta_{1}, \\ldots, \\eta_{k}\\right)$. We will indeed see that both, the saddle point manifold and the Lagrangian, change depending on whether $z_{0}$ lies in the bulk or at the spectral edge. Here, $z_{0}$ (fixed in $N$ ) is chosen to be either at the edge of the spectrum when $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$, or in the bulk of the spectrum $\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$. The parameters $\\chi_{j}$ and $\\eta_{j}^{*}$ are also fixed and probe the spectral fluctuations on the scale of the local mean level spacing. We recall that we average over Gaussian random matrices of the form $\\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} J J^{\\dagger}\\right]$ for any symmetry class. Hence, we need to adjust $d_{N}$ and $s$ for any of those.\n\nThis procedure works rather well in quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. It is also very effective for a zero-dimensional field theories which are essentially random matrix theories. We will see in the derivations of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 that all three ensembles we consider, with the normalisation (4.1), exhibit the very same effective Lagrangian in the bulk $\\left(\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\text {bulk }}\\left(U, Z, W^{*}\\right)=\\sqrt{d_{N}} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(\\chi, \\chi) U^{\\dagger} \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\eta^{*}\\right) U\\right)\n$$\n\nas well as at the edge $\\left(\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\text {edge }}\\left(A, Z, W^{*}\\right)= & \\sqrt{d_{N}} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi\\right)^{2}+\\left(z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& -\\frac{z_{0}^{*}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} A \\operatorname{diag}(\\chi, \\chi)-\\frac{z_{0}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\operatorname{Tr} A A^{\\dagger} \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\eta^{*}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(A^{\\dagger} A\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOnly the saddle point manifolds are varying from ensemble to ensemble which are the most important indicator that the spectral statistics are different for the three ensembles. At the edge the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is actually a vector space so that the uniform measure is the Lebesgue measure on this vector space, while in the bulk we will see that the saddle point manifolds are classical Lie groups.\n\nWe would like to emphasise that we have checked and compared with existing literature [35, 20, 36] that the real and quaternion Ginibre ensemble yield the very same Lagrangians and saddle point manifolds as the complex one (class A) when staying away from the real axis. Only when zooming in on the real axis $\\mathcal{S}$ will be different from class $A$ though the Lagrangian still looks the same. We will, however, not show this here and postpone it to future work where we want to discuss all symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices in this way.\n\nComing back to the three ensembles we discuss here, we would like to remark that the normalisation with respect to the denominator of (4.1) helps to keep track of the normalisation though it is not enough to have a well-defined limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. This can be seen in the resulting Lagrangians (4.4) and (4.5), due to the $d_{N}$-dependent term. To take care of that we normalise the ratio as follows\n\n$$\n\\widehat{D}_{N, k}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right):=\\frac{D_{N, k}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)}{\\prod_{j=1}^{k} D_{N, 1}\\left(z_{j}, w_{j}^{*}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe pairings into arguments $\\left(z_{j}, w_{j}^{*}\\right)$ in the product of expectation values in the denominator is introduced ad hoc but becomes natural when choosing $w_{j}^{*}=z_{j}^{*}$. The latter choice gives the source variables an interpretation of some complex conjugate pairs of \"test-charges\" that explore the spectrum of the random matrix $J$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# 4.1 Bulk limit for $k>1$ pairs of characteristic polynomials \n\nTheorem 4.1 (Bulk limit for $k>1$ ).\nWe recall the definitions (4.1) and (4.6). In the bulk limit (4.3) with $\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$ we obtain the following expressions for\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{\\text {bulk }, k}^{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) & :=\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\widehat{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} \\chi \\eta^{*}\\right] \\int_{\\mathcal{G}} d \\mu(U) \\exp \\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\operatorname{diag}(\\chi, \\chi) U^{\\dagger} \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\eta^{*}\\right) U\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn all three cases, the saddle point manifolds are Lie groups given by $\\mathcal{G}=\\mathrm{U}(k)$ for class $R=A$ (complex Ginibre), $\\mathcal{G}=\\operatorname{USp}(2 k)$ for class $R=A I^{\\dagger}$ (complex symmetric), and $\\mathcal{G}=\\mathrm{O}(2 k)$ for class $R=A I I^{\\dagger}$ (complex self-dual), where $d \\mu(U)$ is their normalised Haar measure. For class $A$, we embed $\\mathrm{U}(k)$ into the $2 k \\times 2 k$ matrices as follows, $U=\\operatorname{diag}(\\widetilde{U}, \\widetilde{U})$ with $\\widetilde{U} \\in \\mathrm{U}(k)$, to write the result for all three classes in a unifying way.\n\nThe expression (4.7) is translation and rotation invariant, particularly it is\n\n$$\nD_{\\text {bulk }, k}^{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right)=D_{\\text {bulk }, k}^{\\mathrm{R}}\\left(e^{i \\vartheta} \\chi+\\lambda \\mathbf{1}_{k}, e^{-i \\vartheta} \\eta^{*}+\\lambda^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor any fixed $\\vartheta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$. As aforementioned, this is one of the main features of a bulk point. Actually the symmetry group is even larger in this particular case as the invariance even holds for $\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(e^{i \\vartheta} \\chi+\\lambda \\mathbf{1}_{k}, e^{-i \\vartheta} \\eta^{*}+\\mu^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{k}\\right)$ for any $\\vartheta, \\lambda, \\mu \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This is due to the analyticity in both arguments, $\\chi$ and $\\eta^{*}$, individually.\n\nThe result (4.7) for class A was previously derived in [54, Theorem 1.15]. It was shown in [53] that away from the real axis the same result prevails for the real and quaternion Ginibre ensemble. We\n\nhave checked this statement independently using the same technique as below. The group integral is actually the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral [71, 59] which is explicitly known\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{\\text {bulk }, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\chi, \\eta^{*}\\right) & =\\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} \\chi \\eta^{*}\\right] \\int_{\\mathrm{U}(k)} d \\mu(U) \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\chi \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\eta^{*} \\widetilde{U}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\left(\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} j!\\right) \\frac{\\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} \\chi \\eta^{*}\\right]}{\\Delta_{k}(\\chi) \\Delta_{k}\\left(\\eta^{*}\\right)} \\operatorname{det}\\left[\\exp \\left(\\chi_{a} \\eta_{b}^{*}\\right)\\right]_{a, b=1, \\ldots, k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{k}(x)=\\prod_{1 \\leq a<b \\leq k}\\left(x_{b}-x_{a}\\right)\n$$\n\nis the Vandermonde determinant. This agrees with a derivation based on planar orthogonal polynomials presented in Appendix B.\n\nThe group integrals in (4.7) for $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ are the other two Itzykson-Zuber integrals [59] which are not known explicitly, and only recurrence relations exist [72]. In particular, the authors observed that the recurrence relations are incompatible with determinantal or Pfaffian structures.\n\nClass A: We start with the derivation for the complex Ginibre ensemble, in order to be selfcontained. Let us recall that it is $d_{N}=N$ and $s=1$ in this case.\n\nTo deal with the characteristic polynomials in (4.1) we introduce two $N \\times k$ dimensional complex Grassmann matrices\n\n$$\n\\xi=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\xi_{11} & \\cdots & \\xi_{1 k} \\\\\n\\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\xi_{N 1} & \\cdots & \\xi_{N k}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\psi_{11} & \\cdots & \\psi_{1 k} \\\\\n\\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\psi_{N 1} & \\cdots & \\psi_{N k}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nvia the standard identity\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{det}\\left[J \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{N} \\otimes Z\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{N} \\otimes W^{*}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr} J \\xi \\xi^{\\dagger}+\\operatorname{Tr} J^{\\dagger} \\psi \\psi^{\\dagger}+\\operatorname{Tr} Z \\xi^{\\dagger} \\xi+\\operatorname{Tr} W^{*} \\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $[d \\xi][d \\psi]=\\prod_{l=1}^{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{k} d \\xi_{l j} d \\xi_{l j}^{*} d \\psi_{l j} d \\psi_{l j}^{*}$ and $\\psi^{\\dagger}$ being the transpose and complex conjugate of $\\psi_{l}$ which is the generalisation of (2.12). We would like to underline that we have exploited the anticommutation relations of Grassmann variables when interchanging the matrices $\\psi$ and $\\psi^{\\dagger}$. For the determinant in the denominator in (4.1) we only need to set $\\chi_{j}=\\eta_{j}=0$ in the above expression.\n\nFor the complex Ginibre ensemble the matrix $J$ does not satisfy any symmetries so that we can take the expectation of it without further ado,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& D_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)= \\\\\n= & \\frac{\\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr} \\xi \\xi^{\\dagger} \\psi \\psi^{\\dagger}+\\operatorname{Tr} Z \\xi^{\\dagger} \\xi+\\operatorname{Tr} W^{*} \\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi\\right]}{\\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr} \\xi \\xi^{\\dagger} \\psi \\psi^{\\dagger}+\\sqrt{N} z_{0} \\operatorname{Tr} \\xi^{\\dagger} \\xi+\\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*} \\operatorname{Tr} \\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi\\right]} \\\\\n= & \\frac{\\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{k \\times k}}[d A] \\exp \\left[-N \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} A+i \\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr} A \\psi^{\\dagger} \\xi+i \\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} \\xi^{\\dagger} \\psi+\\operatorname{Tr} Z \\xi^{\\dagger} \\xi+\\operatorname{Tr} W^{*} \\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi\\right]}{\\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{k \\times k}}[d A] \\exp \\left[-N \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} A+i \\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr} A \\psi^{\\dagger} \\xi+i \\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} \\xi^{\\dagger} \\psi+\\sqrt{N} z_{0} \\operatorname{Tr} \\xi^{\\dagger} \\xi+\\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*} \\operatorname{Tr} \\psi^{\\dagger} \\psi\\right]}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used the anti-commutativity of the Grassmann variables and applied the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation [73] in the second equality.

This is evidently uniquely given when\n\n$$\nA^{\\dagger} A=\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{k}\n$$\n\nwhich follows from differentiating $\\mathcal{L}$ in $A^{\\dagger} A$.\nWe expand about this solution by first going over to the polar decomposition $A=\\widetilde{U} H$ with $\\widetilde{U} \\in \\mathrm{U}(k)$ a unitary matrix and $H=H^{\\dagger} \\geq 0$ a positive semi-definite matrix. The measure transforms (up to a normalisation) as follows\n\n$$\n[d A] \\propto \\operatorname{det}\\left(H \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\mathbf{1}_{k} \\otimes H\\right)[d H] d \\widetilde{\\mu}(\\widetilde{U})\n$$\n\nwhere $d \\widetilde{\\mu}(\\widetilde{U})$ is the normalised Haar measure on $\\mathrm{U}(k)$. The Jacobian can be computed by performing first a singular value decomposition of $A$ and then reverse the eigenvalue decomposition of $H$. In this way, the term $\\operatorname{det}\\left(H \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\mathbf{1}_{k} \\otimes H\\right)$ is reminiscent of the fact that the singular value decomposition yields a square of a Vandermonde determinant in the squared singular values of $A$ as well as a factor $\\operatorname{det} H$. The singular values are, however, the eigenvalues of $H$ whose eigenvalue decomposition only needs a square of a Vandermonde determinant in the eigenvalues, and not their squares which is corrected by the non-trivial term $\\operatorname{det}\\left(H \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\mathbf{1}_{k} \\otimes H\\right)$.\n\nAfter this transformation we set $H=\\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\delta H / \\sqrt{N}$ and expand in $1 / \\sqrt{N}$, showing that the term $\\operatorname{det}\\left(H \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\mathbf{1}_{k} \\otimes H\\right)$ only yields a constant in leading order. For the determinant, we use\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\frac{Z W^{*}}{N}+A^{\\dagger}\\left(W^{*}\\right)^{-1} A W^{*}\\right] & =\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nz_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\frac{\\chi}{\\sqrt{N}} & \\left(\\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\frac{\\delta H}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right) \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\\\\n-\\widetilde{U}\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\frac{\\delta H}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right) & z_{0}^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\frac{\\eta^{*}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\\\\n=\\operatorname{det}\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{2 k}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nz_{0}^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{k} & -\\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\\\\n\\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} & z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{k}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\chi & \\delta H \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\\\\n-\\widetilde{U} \\delta H & \\eta^{*}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich can be found by going back to the structure to the determinant in (4.14) with the matrix in its block form. This leads to the expansion\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\exp \\left[-N \\operatorname{Tr} A^{\\dagger} A\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[\\frac{Z W^{*}}{N}+A^{\\dagger}\\left(W^{*}\\right)^{-1} A W^{*}\\right]^{N} \\\\\n= & \\exp \\left[-N k\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right)+\\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi\\right)^{2}+\\left(z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)^{2}-2\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right) \\chi \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\eta^{*} \\widetilde{U}\\right]\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-2\\left(1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}\\right) \\operatorname{Tr} \\delta H^{2}-2 \\sqrt{1-\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}} \\operatorname{Tr} \\delta H\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\eta^{*} \\widetilde{U}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\|\\delta H\\|^{3}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\|X\\|=\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Tr} X X^{\\dagger}}$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of a matrix. This highlights that we obtain a Gaussian approximation in $\\delta H$ uniformly when $\\|\\delta H\\| \\ll N^{1 / 6}$. One can, however, show that the integral restricted to $\\|\\delta H\\| \\gg N^{\\varepsilon}$ for any fixed $\\varepsilon>0$ is exponentially small compared to the main contribution at $\\delta H=0$ so that a restriction to say $\\|\\delta H\\| \\leq N^{1 / 12}$ is sufficient. We will not work out these mathematical details as they do not illuminate the problem further.\n\nThe Gaussian integral in $\\delta H$ we obtain after these expansions are integrated out and we arrive at\n\n$$\nD_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)=\\exp \\left[\\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)\\right] \\int_{\\mathrm{U}(k)} d \\tilde{\\mu}(\\widetilde{U}) \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\chi \\widetilde{U}^{\\dagger} \\eta^{*} \\widetilde{U}\\right)\\right]\\left[1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nWe note that for $k=1$ it is trivially\n\n$$\n\\prod_{l=1}^{k} D_{N, 1}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(z_{l}, w_{l}^{*}\\right) \\sim \\exp \\left[\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{j}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\exp \\left[\\sum_{l=1}^{k} \\chi_{l} \\eta_{l}^{*}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhich shows how the exponential prefactor comes about for class $A$. Finally, we bring it into the unifying form (4.7) by choosing $U=\\operatorname{diag}(\\widetilde{U}, \\widetilde{U})$ and $d \\mu(U)=d \\tilde{\\mu}(\\widetilde{U})$.\n\nClasses $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathbf{A I I}^{\\dagger}$ : We turn to the complex symmetric and complex self-dual random matrices which can be dealt with in parallel. We recall that the scaling is for both ensembles $s=1 / 2$ while the dimension is $d_{N}=N$ for class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $d_{N}=2 N$ for class $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$. Their corresponding symmetry can be written in a unifying form $J^{T}=T J T$, with\n\n$$\nT=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\mathbf{1}_{N}, & J \\text { is symmetric, } \\quad d_{N}=N, \\quad \\text { class } \\mathrm{R}=\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger} \\\\\n\\tau_{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{N}=\\Sigma_{y}, & J \\text { is self-dual, } \\quad d_{N}=2 N, \\quad \\text { class } \\mathrm{R}=\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{2}$ is the second Pauli matrix.

Using these two matrices, we may rewrite the determinants in terms of Pfaffians\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}\\left[J \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes Z\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}_{k}-\\mathbf{1}_{d_{N}} \\otimes W^{*}\\right]= \\pm \\operatorname{Pf}[T J \\otimes \\hat{T}-T \\otimes \\tilde{z} \\hat{T}] \\operatorname{Pf}\\left[T J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\hat{T}-T \\otimes \\tilde{w} \\hat{T}\\right]\n$$\n\nwith $\\tilde{z}=\\operatorname{diag}(Z, Z)$ and $\\tilde{w}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(W^{*}, W^{*}\\right)$. The overall sign is, however, not a problem as it is cancelled in the ratio (4.1). The two Pfaffians can be expressed as Gaussian integrals over two $d_{N} \\times 2 k$ real Grassmann matrices\n\n$$\n\\xi=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\xi_{11} & \\cdots & \\xi_{12 k} \\\\\n\\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\xi_{d_{N} 1} & \\cdots & \\xi_{d_{N} 2 k}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\psi_{11} & \\cdots & \\psi_{12 k} \\\\\n\\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\psi_{d_{N} 1} & \\cdots & \\psi_{d_{N} 2 k}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nsimilar to (2.13), namely\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Pf}[T J \\otimes \\hat{T}-T \\otimes \\tilde{z} \\hat{T}] \\operatorname{Pf}\\left[T J^{\\dagger} \\otimes \\hat{T}-T \\otimes \\tilde{w} \\hat{T}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\int[d \\xi][d \\psi] \\exp \\left[\\operatorname{Tr} T J \\xi \\hat{T} \\xi^{T}+\\operatorname{Tr} T J^{\\dagger} \\psi \\hat{T} \\psi^{T}+\\operatorname{Tr} \\xi^{T} T \\xi \\tilde{z} \\hat{T}+\\operatorname{Tr} \\psi^{T} T \\psi \\tilde{w} \\hat{T}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet the superscript R be either $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ or $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$ to point out the ensemble in the ensuing computation.

We present the derivation of the results for class A to be self-consistent and to prepare for the other two symmetry classes.\n\nClass A: We anew begin with the derivation for the complex Ginibre ensemble and can even start with (4.15) where $z_{0}$ is now a complex phase, i.e., $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$. The expansion is much simpler than in the bulk as the Lagrangian (4.16), which is still the same, takes its maximum at the origin in the current situation. Therefore, we only rescale as follows $A=(2 / N)^{1 / 4} \\widetilde{A}$ and, then, expand the determinant\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{det}\\left[\\frac{Z W^{*}}{N}+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}} \\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger}\\left(w^{*}\\right)^{-1} \\widetilde{A} w^{*}\\right]^{N}=\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\mathbf{1}_{2 k}+\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nN^{-1 / 2} z_{0}^{*} \\chi & (2 / N)^{1 / 4} z_{0}^{*} \\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\\\\n-(2 / N)^{1 / 4} z_{0} \\widetilde{A} & N^{-1 / 2} z_{0} \\eta^{*}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right)^{N} \\\\\n& =\\exp \\left[\\sqrt{N} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi+z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi\\right)^{2}+\\left(z_{0} \\eta^{*}\\right)^{2}\\right]+\\sqrt{2 N} \\operatorname{Tr} \\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\widetilde{A}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-\\sqrt{2} z_{0}^{*} \\operatorname{Tr} \\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\widetilde{A} \\chi-\\sqrt{2} z_{0} \\operatorname{Tr} \\widetilde{A} \\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\eta^{*}-\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\widetilde{A}\\right)^{2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\left\\|\\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\widetilde{A}\\right\\|^{3}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe error shows that it becomes uniform when assuming a cut-off for the integral so that $\\left\\|\\widetilde{A}^{\\dagger} \\widetilde{A}\\right\\| \\ll$ $N^{1 / 6}$.

Finally, we put these results together with the normalisation (4.36) and the normalisation from (4.6) given in (3.23), to obtain the simplification (4.41).\n\nClasses $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathbf{A I I}^{\\dagger}$ : The very same strategy as for class A to derive (4.35) works out for both, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. The only difference is the rescaling, which is given by $A \\rightarrow\\left(\\frac{2}{d_{N}}\\right)^{-1 / 4} A$, and the change of parameters, in particular we need to replace $N \\rightarrow d_{N} / 2$, $\\chi \\rightarrow \\operatorname{diag}(\\chi / \\sqrt{2}, \\chi / \\sqrt{2})$ and $\\eta^{*} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta^{*} / \\sqrt{2}, \\eta^{*} / \\sqrt{2}\\right)$.

To render this limit mathematically rigorous one needs to cut-off from the original integration the region $\\left\\|A^{\\dagger} A\\right\\| \\geq N^{\\varepsilon}$ for some $0<\\varepsilon<1 / 6$. Then, the expansion is uniform on the complement while for $\\left\\|A^{\\dagger} A\\right\\| \\geq N^{\\varepsilon}$ one can find an exponentially suppressed bound compared to the main contribution about the origin.\n\nOnce we normalise along the definitions (4.1) and (4.6), we arrive at (4.35). What is left to do is to compute the normalisation constants (4.37) and (4.38).\n\nNormalisation of Class $\\mathbf{A I}^{\\dagger}$ : We compute along the same ideas as before to find the normalisation (4.37).

Like for the complex Ginibre case, we integrate out the Gaussian in the prefactor and go over to a singular value decomposition $A=U \\operatorname{diag}(\\sqrt{S}, \\sqrt{S}) V^{\\dagger}$ with $U, V \\in \\operatorname{USp}(2 k)$ and $S=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k}\\right) \\geq 0$ without worrying about the normalisation constants resulting from such a change of variables as those in the numerator and denominator cancel each other,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k} \\times k}\\left[d A \\mid \\exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(A^{\\dagger} A\\right)^{2}\\right]=\\pi^{2 k^{2}} \\frac{\\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}}[d S] \\mid \\Delta_{k}(S)\\left.\\right|^{4} \\operatorname{det} S \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} S^{2}\\right]}{\\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}}[d S] \\mid \\Delta_{k}(S)\\left.\\right|^{4} \\operatorname{det} S \\exp [-\\operatorname{Tr} S]}\n$$\n\nLet us recall that the singular values of a quaternion matrix are Kramers degenerate. Anew, we notice that the integral in the denominator is a Selberg integral and employ the result of [74, Eq. (17.6.5)]. For the numerator we use the trick suggested in [51, Sec. 4] and double the number of integration variables by introducing first derivatives of Dirac delta functions,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}}[d S]\\left|\\Delta_{k}(S)\\right|^{4} \\operatorname{det} S \\exp \\left[-\\operatorname{Tr} S^{2}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\frac{2^{k} k!}{(2 k)!} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2 k}} d s_{1} \\cdots d s_{2 k} \\Delta_{2 k}\\left(s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{2 k}\\right) \\operatorname{Pf}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{a}-\\partial_{b}\\right) \\delta\\left(s_{a}-s_{b}\\right)\\right]_{a, b=1, \\ldots, 2 k} \\prod_{j=1}^{2 k} \\sqrt{s_{j}} e^{-s_{j}^{2} / 2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe combinatorial prefactor properly normalises the rest which can be checked when expanding the Pfaffian and applying the derivatives. They effectively only act on terms of pairwise differences in the Vandermonde determinant as they would otherwise vanish when evaluating the Dirac delta function, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{2 j}-\\partial_{2 j-1}\\right) \\Delta_{2 k}\\left(s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{2 k}\\right)\\left.\\right|_{s_{2 j}=s_{2 j-1}}=\\left|\\Delta_{k}\\left(s_{1}, s_{3}, \\ldots, s_{2 k-1}\\right)\\right|^{4}\n$$\n\nThe benefit of this way of writing the integral is that we can expand the Vandermonde determinant $\\Delta_{2 k}\\left(s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{2 k}\\right)$ and apply de Bruijn's integral identity [76] which yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{k \\times k}}[d A] \\exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(A^{\\dagger} A\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n= & \\frac{2^{k} \\pi^{2 k^{2}}}{\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}(2 j+2)!(2 j+1)!} \\frac{2^{k} k!}{(2 k)!}(2 k)!\\operatorname{Pf}\\left[\\int_{\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}} d s_{1} d s_{2} s_{1}^{a-1 / 2} s_{2}^{b-1 / 2} e^{-\\left(s_{1}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}\\right) / 2} \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{1}-\\partial_{2}\\right) \\delta\\left(s_{1}-s_{2}\\right)\\right]_{a, b=1}^{2 k} \\\\\n= & \\frac{\\pi^{2 k^{2}}}{\\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}[(2 j+1)!]^{2}} \\operatorname{Pf}\\left[(b-a) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d s_{1} s_{1}^{a+b-2} e^{-s_{1}^{2}}\\right]_{a, b=1}^{2 k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe remaining integral in the Pfaffian determinant gives $\\Gamma[(a+b-1) / 2] / 2$.

Choosing expectation values of $k$ pairs of conjugate characteristic polynomials as correlations functions, we proved that indeed all three ensembles lead to different local bulk and edge statistics for the complex eigenvalues. The explicit expressions for $k=1$ pair in class $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, see Proposition 2.1, show a remarkably similar structure to the well known respective answer for the complex Ginibre ensemble for finite- $N$, being given in terms of sums of truncated exponentials. This allowed us to derive asymptotic results in the local bulk and edge scaling limit, as well as for the global large- $N$ limit, with different results in all three limits for each ensemble, cf., Propositions 3.1 and 3.3 and Theorem 3.2. In particular, the resulting properties at the edge are compatible with the expected behaviour of the spectral density based on an approximate Coulomb gas description with three different values of inverse temperature $\\beta$.\n\nFor general $k$ we have identified the effective Lagrangians in the local bulk (Theorem 4.1) and in the edge scaling limit (Theorem 4.2). In both limits the respective Lagrangians agree for all three classes. However, the integration domain differs for each ensemble. In the bulk it is given by the compact unitary, unitary symplectic and orthogonal group for class $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, respectively. At the edge, integrals over complex, quaternion and real valued matrices result. Only in class A these group integrals can be performed for $k>1$ and mapped to known results. Also here, from the known properties of these integrals it is clear that all three ensembles differ. We expect that these effective Lagrangians as well as Goldstone manifolds will be universal and should be shared with physical systems with the corresponding symmetries. The effective Lagrangians (4.4) and (4.5) would then appear as the potential part of the corresponding non-linear $\\sigma$-models.\n\nSeveral open questions prevail for these three representatives of local bulk and edge statistics. Is it possible to access more detailed spectral information in the two classes $\\mathrm{AI}^{\\dagger}$ and $\\mathrm{AII}^{\\dagger}$, despite the lack of a joint eigenvalue density? Can we analytically prove universality in these two cases by deforming the Gaussian ensembles considered so far? More generally, is it possible to prove that all other known non-Hermitian symmetry classes fall into these three classes, away form their symmetry axes and symmetry points?

It is valid for any determinantal point process of orthogonal polynomial type, having a joint density of complex (or real) eigenvalues that includes the modulus square of the Vandermonde determinant, see (4.10). A special case of the theorem proven in [46], when the number $k$ of factors and conjugate factors agrees, is given by\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right):=\\left\\langle\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\operatorname{det}\\left[z_{j} \\mathbf{1}_{N}-J\\right] \\operatorname{det}\\left[w_{j}^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{N}-J^{*}\\right]\\right\\rangle=\\prod_{i=N}^{N+k-1} h_{i} \\frac{\\operatorname{det}_{j, l=1}^{k}\\left[K_{N+k}\\left(z_{j}, w_{l}^{*}\\right)\\right]}{\\Delta_{k}(Z) \\Delta_{k}\\left(W^{*}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwith $W=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{k}\\right)$. Here, the expectation value defined in (2.3) is taken with respect to class A, cf. eq. (2.4). The $h_{j}$ are the squared norms of the orthogonal polynomials $P_{j}(z)=z^{j}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(z^{j-1}\\right)$ in monic normalisation, and\n\n$$\nK_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)=\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{h_{j}} P_{j}(z) P_{j}\\left(w^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nis the polynomial part of the kernel (also known as pre-kernel). In the particular case of the complex Ginibre ensemble we have\n\n$$\nK_{N}\\left(z, w^{*}\\right)=E_{N-1}\\left(z w^{*}\\right), \\quad P_{j}(z)=z^{j}, \\quad h_{j}=j!\n$$\n\nIn particular, setting $k=1$ in (B.1) for this case we obtain (3.12).\nIn Section 4, explicit expressions in terms of $k$-dimensional group integrals were given for such expectation values for $k>1$ for all three ensembles, in the bulk and at the edge. For class A these group integrals can be solved, with the resulting expressions (4.9) and (4.36) to be rederived here.\n\nThe asymptotic of the kernel in (B.1) in the bulk and at the edge were already discussed in Subsection 3.2 so that we can be very brief. In line with Section 4, we recall the scaling of the $k$ arguments,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nZ & =\\sqrt{N} z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\chi, \\quad \\chi=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\chi_{1}, \\ldots, \\chi_{k}\\right) \\\\\nW & =\\sqrt{N} z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{k}+\\eta, \\quad \\eta=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\eta_{1}, \\ldots, \\eta_{k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDue to the translational invariance of the Vandermonde determinant (4.10), it immediately follows that $\\Delta_{k}(Z)=\\Delta_{k}(\\chi)$, and likewise for $\\Delta_{k}\\left(W^{*}\\right)=\\Delta_{k}\\left(\\eta^{*}\\right)$.\n\nIn bulk scaling for $\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1$, we insert (3.16) into (B.1) to arrive at\n\n$$\n\\left.\\widetilde{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)\\right|_{\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1} \\sim\\left(\\prod_{j=N}^{N+k-1} j!\\right) \\exp \\left[k N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{j}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\frac{\\operatorname{det}_{i, j=1}^{k}\\left[\\exp \\left[\\chi_{i} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right]\\right]}{\\Delta_{k}(\\chi) \\Delta_{k}\\left(\\eta^{*}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThis has to be normalised by the product of the individual expectation values, for which it immediately follows\n\n$$\n\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\widetilde{D}_{N, 1}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\sqrt{N} z_{0}+\\chi_{j}, \\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*}+\\eta_{j}^{*}\\right) \\mid_{\\left|z_{0}\\right|<1} \\sim(N!)^{k} \\exp \\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\left(N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{N}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{j}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)+\\chi_{j} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nAfter taking the ratio (4.6) with $D_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)=\\widetilde{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right) / \\widetilde{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(z_{0} \\mathbf{1}_{k}, z_{0}^{*} \\mathbf{1}_{k}\\right)$ all factorials and most of the exponential pre-factors cancel, leading to the result (4.9) in Section 4.\n\nWhen turning to the edge scaling limit, with $\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1$, the only difference resulting from the limiting kernel (3.21) is the extra factor of the complementary error function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left.\\tilde{D}_{N, k}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(Z, W^{*}\\right)\\right|_{\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1} \\sim & \\left(\\prod_{j=N}^{N+k-1} j!\\right) \\exp \\left[k N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{j}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\times \\frac{\\operatorname{det}_{i, j=1}^{k}\\left[\\exp \\left[\\chi_{i} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right] \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{i}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right)\\right]}{\\Delta_{k}(\\chi) \\Delta_{k}\\left(\\eta^{*}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn comparison, the normalising product of the expectation values for $k=1$ are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\tilde{D}_{N, 1}^{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(\\sqrt{N} z_{0}+\\chi_{j}, \\sqrt{N} z_{0}^{*}+\\eta_{j}^{*}\\right) \\mid_{\\left|z_{0}\\right|=1} \\sim & (N!)^{k} \\exp \\left[k N\\left|z_{0}\\right|^{2}+\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{j}+z_{0} \\eta_{j}^{*}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\times e^{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\chi_{j} \\eta_{j}^{*}} \\prod_{l=1}^{k} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(z_{0}^{*} \\chi_{l}+z_{0} \\eta_{l}^{*}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOnce again the factors in the first line cancel those in (B.7) when taking the ratio.

It claims that there are only three\nuniversality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum\nsystems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the\nexpectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials\nin three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for\nthe three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric\nand complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of\nnon-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\\dag$ and\nAII$^\\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive\nexplicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials\nfor finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the\nglobal limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum,\nproviding new analytical results for classes AI$^\\dag$ and AII$^\\dag$. For\ngeneral $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the\nnon-linear $\\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly,\nthey agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone\nmanifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are\ndifferent and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In\nparticular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed\ndifferent local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture\nfurther.", "updated": "2025-04-17T07:41:22Z", "published": "2024-10-28T13:53:40Z"}
