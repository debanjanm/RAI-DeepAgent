      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nSuppose all industrial sectors of the entire economy reveal constant returns to scale. Then, for each sector, the unit cost function with pregiven level of productivity becomes scale-free and only dependent on factor prices. Owing to the fact that all commodities are made by means of commodities, while assuming all commodities are produced by different but unique sectors (i.e., no joint production) and that there is only one kind of primary factor not made by means of commodities, the prices of commodities relative to the primary factor are determined as the solution to the general equilibrium system of equations that equilibrate commodity prices to unit costs of sectors. Shephard's lemma nonetheless indicates that input-output coefficients will only be affected by the equilibrium price change, which will only be triggered by the propagation of productivity shocks across all sectors. ${ }^{1}$\n\nThe idea of aggregating productivity growths associated with industrial sectors into national aggregate output growth measures is called the Domar aggregation. In a closed economy, aggregate output growth in the above setting essentially equals the aggregated commodity prices via the representative household's indirect utility, where the commodity prices are determined by the sectoral unit cost functions with productivity growths exogenously given. Hulten (1978) claimed that sectoral productivity growths can be mapped into national aggregate output growth by linear aggregation using Domar weights. Linear aggregation of sectoral productivity growths, however, is only possible in an economy where the representative household and all the production sectors aggregate commodities in a Cobb-Douglas fashion, so that the monetary input-output coefficients remain constant. ${ }^{2}$\n\nAccordingly, Acemoglu et al (2012, 2017); Acemoglu and Azar (2020) studied Domar aggregation under Cobb-Douglas technology where Domar weights are the product of representative household's expenditure shares and the (monetary) Leontief inverse. In this case, the volatility of the aggregate output fluctuations will contract disproportionally to the number of sectors whose productivity shocks are being aggregated, owing to the granular property (Gabaix, 2011) of the Leontief inverse. Baqaee and Farhi (2019); Nakano and Nishimura (2021) then studied aggregate fluctuations of an economy comprising non-Cobb-Douglas technology and showed that aggregate fluctuations will have nonnormal tails even if sectoral productivity shocks have normal tails, owing to the nonlinear nature of Domar aggregation that can potentially induce network transformation.\n\nFrom empirical perspective, Kim et al (2017); Nakano and Nishimura (2024) examined economy-wide propagation of innovation, where innovation is proxied by productivity shocks and their propagation is concerned across the production network of sectors with empirically estimated CES (constant elasticity of substitution) unit cost functions. In this setting, the fixed point solution to the general equilibrium system of equations is solved by way of recursive mapping from factor prices onto commodity unit costs which will globally converge to a unique equilibrium, owing to the concavity of the mapping, if only the solution existed in the positive-finite domain. During the course of analyses, however, there were cases (of productivity shocks) where the recursive mapping experienced nonconvergence, indicating the absence of the solution in the positive-finite domain.\n\nThe abovementioned nonlinear Domar aggregation (which thus implies synergism among productivity shocks) and potential zero/infinite prices (which thus implies singularity of the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ In contrast, the invariance of input-output coefficients with respect to changes in quantitative magnitude under the setting specified above is known as the non-substitution theorem (see, e.g., Koopmans, 1951).\n    ${ }^{2}$ Klein (1952) showed that, while the physical input-output coefficients will be affected by the economywide propagation of sectoral productivity shocks, the monetary input-output coefficients will not change because of the substitution elasticity of Cobb-Douglas technology which is neutral (i.e., unitary).\n\ninput-output linkages) can never be encountered under production networks base on CobbDouglas technology, where the monetary input-output linkages are stable. In this study we hence explore the role of substitution elasticities in regard to the emergence of network singularity and synergism in nonlinear Domar aggregation. ${ }^{3}$ In so doing, we work on CES production networks with a universal substitution elasticity $\\sigma$, where the system of unit cost functions becomes linear with respect to the transcendent variables, i.e., variables transformed by the power of $(1-\\sigma)$ th order. The final assessment of commodity prices by the representative household, nonetheless, remains as Cobb-Douglas, for simplicity.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section we present the benchmark general equilibrium system of equations encompassing multifactor CES unit cost functions with single (universal) substitution elasticity, and derive the Domar aggregation function with respect to the productivity shocks. The universal substitution elasticity setting with the use of transcendent variables allows us to handle general equilibrium solutions by means of linear algebra. In Section 3, we discuss network singularity and specify the conditions under which such situation can actually take place. We find that an inelastic (elastic) network may encounter a negative (positive) singularity. In Section 4, we discuss synergy in the economic evaluation of two different innovations. We find that an inelastic (elastic) network entails negative (positive) synergism. Section 5 concludes the paper.",

The share parameter for the $i$ th item is denoted by $\\kappa_{i}$ where $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\kappa_{i}=1$. The equivalence of the two functions is shown in Appendix A. The price index in this case is described as $I(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\left(p_{i}\\right)^{\\kappa_{i}}$. The representative household's indirect utility $V$ can then be referred to as the aggregate output (or, real GDP). Since we fix the amount of labor force $L$ and the wage rate $p_{0}$, the national income $B=p_{0} L$, or the nominal GDP, stays constant. The real GDP, on the other hand, will change as the price index $I(\\boldsymbol{p})$ changes. Thus, if we normalize the price of commodities at the reference state by unity, the aggregate output growth will be evaluated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\log V=-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\kappa_{i} \\log p_{i}=-(\\log \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\log \\boldsymbol{p}=\\left(\\log p_{1}, \\cdots, \\log p_{n}\\right)$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}=\\left(\\kappa_{1}, \\cdots, \\kappa_{n}\\right)^{\\top}$ denotes the column vector of expenditure share parameters.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The singularity of the input-output structure and its association with infinite/zero prices are studied in Hawkins and Simon (1949) and Kurz and Salvadori (1994) from different perspectives.",

      "text": "# 3.2 Multisector model \n\nThe purpose of this section is to study whether if the transcendent network $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}\\rangle \\mathbf{A}$ turns out to be viable. In the former part of this section we show the viability of the reference network $\\mathbf{A}$ and its equivalence to $\\mathbf{A}^{\\infty}=0$, and in the latter part we discuss the viability of the transcendent network $\\langle\\zeta\\rangle \\mathbf{A}$ in reference to $(\\langle\\zeta\\rangle \\mathbf{A})^{\\infty} .{ }^{4}$ To study the matter formally, let us first define network viability, as follows:\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Hawkins and Simon (1949)'s approach to examine the viability of the network $\\mathbf{W}$, is to see whether if all the successive principal minor determinants of $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}$ are positive, which is exactly the one we took for the two-sector case in (17). For the multisector case we take an alternative approach of Nikaido (1968)'s.\n\nDefinition (Column viability). A network, i.e., $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, is said to be column viable, if for any column vector $\\mathbf{f}>0$, there exists a column vector $\\mathbf{y}>0$ such that $\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{f}+\\mathbf{W y}$.\nDefinition (Row viability). A network, i.e., $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, is said to be row viable, if for any row vector $\\mathbf{v}>0$, there exists a row vector $\\mathbf{q}>0$ such that $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{q W}$.\n\nAssumption. The reference network $\\mathbf{A}$ is nondefective, meaning all $n$ nonzero eigenvalues are distinct, thus diagonalizable.\n\nBy virtue of Lemmas 3, 4, 5, and 6, which we append to Appendix D with proofs, we know that reference network $\\mathbf{A}$ is row (and also column) viable and that $\\mathbf{A}^{\\infty}=0$. Moreover, by virtue of the above Assumption, $\\mathbf{A}$ is diagonalizable as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{Q}\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}\\rangle \\mathbf{Q}^{-1}>0\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}=\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\cdots, \\lambda_{n}\\right)$ denotes the set of $n$ nonzero eigenvalues and $\\mathbf{Q}$ is some invertable matrix.

      "text": "# 5 Concluding Remarks \n\nAccording to Eden et al (2012), singularity hypotheses refer to two distinct scenarios. One is the intelligence explosion (Good, 1966), whereby machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence through computational advancement, which entails recursive self-improvement. The other scenario is the biointelligence explosion, which entails the amplification of human capabilities to overcome all existing human limitations (Kurzweil, 2005). In both ways, however, the concept of singularity (i.e., explosion) does not go beyond exponential growth, if not extreme. The economic singularity theory of Nordhaus (2021) also exploits the idea of extreme exponential growth of intelligence capital deepening by a large elasticity of substitution. In contrast, the singularity presented in this study is based on matrix singularity where the matrix is transformed by virtue of the substitution elasticity that is nonneutral.\n\nOf course, positive singularity cannot take place unless some finite amount of non-labor commodity can completely substitute the primary factor of production. Our model allowed convergence towards positive singularity because our (standard) CES production function allowed production even at the extreme position of the isoquant near the axes. On the other hand, negative singularity is not an improbable event. With some productivity-diminishing innovations, such as those involving environmental conservation technologies, network transformation under inelastic network can encounter a state that some commodity cannot be produced in net. Finally, as regards the matter of industrial policy, whether to promote a portfolio of projects, or rather to take a selective policy, depends on the synergism inherent in the production network where the elasticity of substitution plays the important role.",

      "text": "## Appendix D (Viability assessment of networks)\n\nThe following lemmas owe to Nikaido (1968), McKenzie (2009), and Takayama (1985).\nLemma 3 The reference Leontief matrix $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}$ is nonsingular.\nProof. Suppose that $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}$ is singular. Then, there is a column vector $\\boldsymbol{x} \\neq 0$ such that $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}] \\boldsymbol{x}=0$. Consider the $i$ th equation of $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}] \\boldsymbol{x}=0$ as follows,\n\n$$\nx_{i}-\\alpha_{i 1} x_{1}-\\alpha_{i 2} x_{2} \\cdots-\\alpha_{i k} x_{k} \\cdots-\\alpha_{i n} x_{n}=0\n$$\n\nSumming all $n$ equations gives the following:\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i 1}\\right) x_{1}+\\cdots+\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_{i n}\\right) x_{n}=0\n$$\n\nSince, $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\alpha_{i j}=1$ for all $j=1, \\cdots, n$ where $\\alpha_{i j}>0$, the terms inside the parentheses are all positive, therefore, $x_{1}, \\cdots, x_{n}$ cannot be all positive or all negative. By rearranging the order of elements, we may let $x_{1}, \\cdots, x_{k}$ be negative, and $x_{k+1}, \\cdots, x_{n}$ be positive. Summing the first $k$ equations on both sides gives:\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i 1}\\right) x_{1}+\\cdots+\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i k}\\right) x_{k}-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \\alpha_{i j} x_{j}=0\n$$\n\nSince the terms inside the parentheses are all positive, the left hand side must be negative, which draws a contradiction with the right hand side. Hence $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}$ cannot be singular.\n\nLemma 4 The reference network (input-output coefficient matrix) $\\mathbf{A}$ is column viable. ${ }^{5}$\nProof. Consider the $i$ th equation of $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}] \\boldsymbol{x}=\\mathbf{f}>0$ as follows,\n\n$$\ny_{i}-\\alpha_{i 1} x_{1}-\\alpha_{i 2} x_{2} \\cdots-\\alpha_{i k} x_{k} \\cdots-\\alpha_{i n} x_{n}=f_{i}>0\n$$\n\nSuppose that $x_{1}, \\cdots, x_{k}$ are not all positive. By rearranging the order of elements, we may let $x_{1}, \\cdots, x_{k}$ be negative, and $x_{k+1}, \\cdots, x_{n}$ be positive. Summing the first $k$ equations on both sides gives:\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i 1}\\right) x_{1}+\\cdots+\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i k}\\right) x_{k}-\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \\alpha_{i j} x_{j}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_{i}>0\n$$\n\nSince, $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\alpha_{i j}=1$ for all $j=1, \\cdots, n$ where $\\alpha_{i j}>0$, all the terms inside the parentheses are positive. Then, the left hand side must be negative, which draws a contradiction with the right hand side. Hence, $x_{1}, \\cdots, x_{n}$ must all be positive.\n\nLemma 5 If an $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ is column viable and $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}$ is nonsingular, then $\\mathbf{W}$ is row viable and $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>0$.\n\nProof. Since $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}$ is nonsingular it has an inverse $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}$ where we denote each item by $\\ell_{i j}$. Consider the $i$ th equation of $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1} \\mathbf{f}=\\mathbf{y}$, as follows.\n\n$$\n\\ell_{i 1} f_{1}+\\cdots+\\ell_{i n} f_{n}=y_{i}\n$$\n\nSuppose if, by rearranging the order of elements, the first $k$ entries are negative, i.e., $\\ell_{i j}<0$ for $j=1, \\cdots, k$ and the rest are positive. By the column viability of $\\mathbf{W}$, any nonnegative set $\\left(f_{1}, \\cdots, f_{n}\\right)$ must make the left hand side positive. However, if we choose $f_{j}=1$ for $j=1, \\cdots, k$ and $f_{j}=0$ for $j=k+1, \\cdots, n$, the left hand side will be negative, which draws a contradiction with the right hand side that is postive. Thus, $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>0$, which then implies that for any row vector $\\mathbf{v}>0, \\mathbf{v}[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>0$, or the row viability of $\\mathbf{W}$.\n\nLemma 6 An $n \\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}>0$ is row viable and $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>0 . \\Longleftrightarrow \\mathbf{W}^{\\infty}=0$.\nProof. Define $\\mathbf{L}_{T}=\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{W}+\\mathbf{W}^{2}+\\cdots+\\mathbf{W}^{T}$. Because $\\mathbf{W}>0$, we know that $\\mathbf{L}_{T}>0$ is monotonically increasing in $T$, and also that $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}] \\mathbf{L}_{T}=\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}^{T+1}<\\mathbf{I}$. We then see that $\\mathbf{L}_{T}$ is bounded from above by the following exposition:\n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>\\mathbf{L}_{T}>\\mathbf{L}_{T-1}>\\cdots>\\mathbf{L}_{0}\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathbf{L}_{T}$ is bounded and monotonically increasing in $T$, we know that $\\mathbf{L}_{\\infty}$ is convergent. Hence, we arrive at the wanted result:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}^{\\infty}=\\lim _{T \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(\\mathbf{L}_{T}-\\mathbf{L}_{T-1}\\right) \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nTo show the converse, consider the following exposition:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}_{T}[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]=\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}^{T+1}=[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}] \\mathbf{L}_{T}\n$$\n\nThen, let $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, as follows, so that we know by (40) that $\\mathbf{L}_{\\infty}=[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}$.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}_{\\infty}[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]=\\mathbf{I}=[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}] \\mathbf{L}_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nBut since $\\mathbf{L}_{\\infty}>0$, we obtain $[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{W}]^{-1}>0$, whence the row viability of $\\mathbf{W}$ is obvious.",

  "abstract": "The economy-wide production network, i.e., the monetary input-output\ncoefficients, will no longer be stable against the general equilibrium\npropagation of sectoral productivity shocks, when the substitution elasticities\nof sectoral production are nonneutral. The associated network transformation\nhence renders nonlinearity in aggregating sectoral productivity shocks into the\neconomy's output, i.e., Domar aggregation. In this study, we demonstrate the\npossibility of production networks being transformed into a singular one. We\nalso explore the conditions under which the productivity shocks experience\nsynergism in Domar aggregation.",
