Exploiting an empirical correlation between the integrated radio polarization direction of a spiral galaxy and its apparent shape, we devise an unbiased minimum-variance estimator for the rotation angle, which should achieve an uncertainty of $5^{\\circ}-15^{\\circ}$ per galaxy. Large galaxy samples from the forthcoming SKA continuum surveys, together with optical shape catalogs, promise a comparable or even lower noise power spectrum for the rotation angle than in the CMB Stage-IV (CMB-S4) experiment, with different systematics.\n\n\nIntroduction - The study of fundamental discrete symmetries have led to important discoveries [1-3]. The axion was originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics [4-7]. Generic axions were later shown to arise abundantly in string theory $[8,9]$. The Chern-Simons interaction between the axion and electromagnetism causes the parity-violating cosmic birefringence effect [10]:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=-\\frac{1}{4} g_{a \\gamma \\gamma} a F^{\\mu \\nu} \\tilde{F}_{\\mu \\nu}=g_{a \\gamma \\gamma} a \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the axion field, $F^{\\mu \\nu}$ is the field strength tensor, and $\\tilde{F}^{\\mu \\nu}$ its dual. As a photon travels, its polarization plane rotates by an angle proportional to the net change in the unwrapped axion field value along its worldline, multiplied by the axion-photon coupling $g_{a \\gamma \\gamma}$ [11-13]. Recent analyses of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have shown hints of birefringence uniform across the sky at a fraction of a degree [14, 15]. Possible foreground contamination is being investigated [16]. On the other hand, searches for anisotropic birefringence have not uncovered a signal [17-20].\n\nMeasuring birefringence toward any single astrophysical source is hindered by our lack of knowledge about the intrinsic polarization direction. The use of the CMB as a probe statistically solves this problem. Rotation angles correlated across the sky are measurable following accurate cosmological prediction for the Gaussian statistics of the primary CMB anisotropies [20-23]. To robustly confirm cosmic birefringence, it is important to consider alternative detection methods based on independent cosmological or astrophysical probes.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new probe of cosmic birefringence that relies on surveying spiral galaxies with both radio polarization and apparent shape measurements. This is motivated by empirical findings that the integrated radio emission of nearby spiral galaxies\n\n[^0]![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 1. (Mis)alignment between the polarization of the integrated radio emission (solid blue) and the apparent minor axis (dashed black) of a spiral galaxy.\nat 4.8 GHz is significantly polarized and aligns on average with the apparent minor axis of the optical galactic disk [24]. A plausible explanation for this alignment is that the polarized radio emission is predominantly synchrotron radiation powered by star formation feedback and has a polarization direction locally perpendicular to the ordered toroidal magnetic field. Integrating over an inclined disk results in a non-zero net polarization. It seems reasonable to assume that such correlation is true for a cosmological population of spirals. The shape ellipse can be measured with either optical or interferometric radio imaging, with the former available from weak lensing catalogs [25-27] or from imaging surveys [28, 29].\n\nThe polarization-shape alignment is imperfect for each single galaxy. Nonetheless, one expects that the mean misalignment angle is zero among unrelated galaxies, as long as all relevant physics on the (sub-)galactic scale respects parity. If there is one galaxy whose integrated polarization is offset from the apparent minor axis to the clockwise side, it should be equally probable that another galaxy appears as its mirror reflection and has a counterclockwise misalignment (Fig. 1).\n\nIt has been proposed that polarization-shape correlation can be exploited to calibrate galaxy intrinsic shapes and reduce noise in weak lensing shear measurements [30-33]. Reversing this logic, one can calibrate the intrinsic polarization direction to source morphol-\n\n\n[^0]:    * winstonyin@berkeley.edu\n\nogy [34, 35]. With cosmic birefringence, unrelated galaxies in a patch of the sky will have polarization rotated by nearly the same angle, leading to a mean misalignment biased from zero.\n\nIn this Letter, we construct a minimum-variance quadratic estimator for polarization rotation using galaxies with both integrated radio polarization and shape measurements, and forecast its angular noise power spectrum. Radio polarization measurements may come from the VLA Sky Survey [36] or the upcoming SKA continuum surveys [37], while the optical counterparts can come from photometric galaxy catalogs with shape measurements, such as from the DESI Legacy Surveys (DECaLS) [28] or LSST [29].\n\nGalaxy Radio Polarization - The polarization degree of the integrated radio emission depends on the disk inclination and radio luminosity, as well as the randomly oriented component of the magnetic field throughout the galaxy. Ref. [24] found that the net polarization degree of nearby spirals at 4.8 GHz is $\\sim 1 \\%-18 \\%$ with a mean $\\sim 4 \\%$. The sample of [24] shows a mean misalignment angle consistent with zero and an RMS value of $\\sim 26^{\\circ}$. As we will show, the effective scatter in this misalignment angle, which limits the precision of birefringence measurements, can be reduced to $5^{\\circ}-15^{\\circ}$, once a proper estimator is used.\n\nEstimating Cosmic Birefrigence - Linear polarization is described by the Stokes parameters $(Q, U)$. Define a spin-2 variable:\n\n$$\nP_{ \\pm} \\equiv Q \\pm i U=I p e^{ \\pm 2 i \\theta_{P}}\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the intensity [38], $p$ is the polarization degree $(0<p<1)$, and $\\theta_{P}$ is the polarization position angle. The apparent elliptical shape of an inclined galaxy can be described by the spin-2 ellipticity [39, p. 11]\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ \\pm} \\equiv q \\pm i u=(a-b) /(a+b) e^{ \\pm 2 i \\theta_{\\epsilon}}\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the semi-minor and semi-major axes, respectively, and $\\theta_{\\epsilon}$ is the position angle of the semimajor axis. Since $\\theta_{P}-\\theta_{\\epsilon}$ is rotationally invariant, we define dimensionless spin-0 quantities\n\n$$\nX \\pm i Y \\equiv-P_{ \\pm} \\epsilon_{\\mp} / I=p|\\epsilon| e^{ \\pm 2 i \\Delta \\theta}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\theta \\equiv \\theta_{P}-\\theta_{\\epsilon}-\\pi / 2$ is the misalignment angle and $|\\epsilon| \\equiv(a-b) /(a+b)$. The quantities $X$ and $Y$ have even and odd parity, respectively.\n\nThe quantities $p,|\\epsilon|$, and $\\Delta \\theta$ are intrinsic to each galaxy. Since there is no known evidence for macroscopic parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM) correlated between many galaxies over intergalactic distances, we assume that $\\Delta \\theta$ has a distribution symmetric about zero, and that correlated parity-violating effects only occur externally as a result of cosmic birefringence, which can be quantified by a polarization rotation field $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ coherent over some scales on the sky. This field may be uniform on the sky [40], or behave as a Gaussian random field [41, 42], or is highly non-Gaussian [13]. Thus,\ncosmic birefringence causes the distribution of $\\Delta \\theta$ to be biased from zero by an amount $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ for galaxies in a local sky patch in the direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$. For a first analysis, we assume that $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ is independent of galaxy distance, and that $(I p, \\Delta \\theta)$ are independently drawn from the same global distribution for individual galaxies.\n\nThe Faraday effect in the Milky Way (MW)'s ISM also rotates the polarization coherently on the sky, with an angle that scales with the wavelength squared. This can be distinguished from the wavelength-independent effect of the axion [11]. We assume that MW Faraday rotation is corrected prior to the following analysis. This does require observation in multiple radio bands, the effectiveness of which is subject to further study. On the other hand, inhomogeneous Faraday rotation within the source galaxy causes depolarization of the integrated emission particularly at lower radio frequencies [24, 43]. This is not a concern here, as depolarization at 4.8 GHz is included in the polarization-shape (mis)alignment data.\n\nParity-odd combinations of $X$ and $Y$ have a vanishing mean over the galaxy ensemble when $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})=0$ :\n\n$$\n\\langle Y\\rangle=\\langle X Y\\rangle=0\n$$\n\nStatistically significant deviation of $\\langle Y\\rangle$ or $\\langle X Y\\rangle$ from zero would therefore be a smoking gun of parity violation.\n\nWith a non-zero $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$, the polarization is rotated while the disk shape is unaffected:\n\n$$\nP_{ \\pm} \\rightarrow P_{ \\pm} e^{ \\pm 2 i \\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})}, \\quad \\epsilon_{ \\pm} \\rightarrow \\epsilon_{ \\pm}\n$$\n\nThis implies for $X$ and $Y$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X \\rightarrow X \\cos 2 \\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})-Y \\sin 2 \\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}) \\\\\n& Y \\rightarrow Y \\cos 2 \\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})+X \\sin 2 \\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotably, the value of $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ does not change observables of a galaxy along a different direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}^{\\prime} \\neq \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$.\n\nWe construct an unbiased, minimum-variance quadratic estimator for $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$ using $X$ and $Y$ following weak-lensing [44] and birefringence [21-23, 45] applications. It can be derived via maximizing the likelihood [46] (App. B).\n\nFor a single galaxy, it is\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}=\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_{Y}^{2} \\bar{X} \\hat{Y}+\\left(\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right) \\hat{X} \\hat{Y}}{2\\left[\\left(\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{X}^{2} \\bar{X}^{2}\\right]}\n$$\n\nwhose variance under the null hypothesis is\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_{X}^{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_{Y}^{2}}{4\\left[\\left(\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{X}^{2} \\bar{X}^{2}\\right]}\n$$\n\nThe errors in $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{Y}$ including measurement noises are:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{X, Y}^{2}=\\sigma_{X, Y}^{2}+f\\left(\\sigma_{\\epsilon} / \\mathrm{SNR}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\epsilon} \\equiv \\sqrt{\\left.\\langle | \\epsilon\\right|^{2}}\\rangle \\approx 0.3$ is the intrinsic galaxy shape error, and $\\sigma_{X, Y}^{2}$ are the intrinsic variances of $X$ and $Y$.\n\nRadio interferometry with pure noise has $f=1$ (detailed derivation in App. A). In the following, we derive numerical forecast assuming the conservative $f=1$.\n\nSensitivity - From the observed $p,|\\epsilon|$, and $\\Delta \\theta, X$ and $Y$ for each galaxy can be computed. We obtain values for $p$ and $\\Delta \\theta$ for 13 nearby spirals from Ref. [24], and compute values for $|\\epsilon|$ using SIMBAD shapes [47]. We exclude M31 as its proximity and high degree of polarization ( $18 \\%$ ) hint at systematics. This results in the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\bar{X} \\pm \\sigma_{X}=(1.3 \\pm 2.1) \\times 10^{-2} \\\\\n& \\bar{Y} \\pm \\sigma_{Y}=(0.04 \\pm 4.4) \\times 10^{-3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDespite the small sample size, we find $\\sqrt{\\left.\\langle | \\epsilon \\mid{ }^{2}\\right\\rangle}=0.30$, consistent with what is assumed in galaxy weak lensing. It is more uncertain whether the radio properties of this sample are representative of a cosmological sample. Verification would require analyzing distant galaxies (e.g. $[36,43,48]$ ). Using values in Eq. (12) for $\\bar{X}, \\sigma_{X}$ and $\\sigma_{Y}$ and setting $\\bar{Y}=0$, Eq. (9) gives $\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}\\rangle=0.5^{\\circ}$ and a sample standard deviation $4.4^{\\circ}$, consistent with no birefringence; Eq. (10) forecasts $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle}=5^{\\circ}$ per galaxy in the limit of negligible measurement error.\n\nRemarkably, $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle}=5^{\\circ}$ is five times smaller than the standard deviation of $\\Delta \\theta$ at $26^{\\circ}$ as estimated from nearby spirals. We attribute this improvement to an anticorrelation between the scatter in the misalignment angle $\\Delta \\theta$ and the product $p|\\epsilon|$. According to Eq. (4), when computing the statistics of $X$ and $Y$ in Eq. (12), galaxies with large $\\Delta \\theta$ are down-weighted due to smaller $p|\\epsilon|$ values.\n\nThis anti-correlation has a geometrical origin [24]. The intrinsic misalignment angle has a large variance for galaxies showing a low $p$ and a low $|\\epsilon|$, as these lowinclination galaxies appear rather circular. Since $p$ and $|\\epsilon|$ both increase with inclination, $p|\\epsilon|$ down-weights faceon galaxies and emphasizes edge-on ones on which birefringence would be more detectable. While we do not pursue it in this work, it seems possible to accurately model this anti-correlation as a function of the inclination and derive an improved definition of $X$ and $Y$ to replace Eq. (4).\n\nThe $5^{\\circ}$ error may result from a particularly good polarization-shape alignment in the small galaxy sample. Larger samples are required to refine this figure. Our primary claim is not this precise error value, but rather that our novel estimator effectively exploits the inclinationdependent statistics of the misalignment angle and has the potential to dramatically improve sensitivity to birefringence.\n\nFig. 2 estimates the uncertainty in this number by bootstrapping and demonstrates that the anti-correlation between $p|\\epsilon|$ and $\\Delta \\theta$ is not a statistical fluke. In each run, $p|\\epsilon|$ and $\\Delta \\theta$ are independently drawn with replacement from the Stil et al. sample to form 13 artificial galaxies, from which $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle$ is computed. In 2,000 runs, $97.5 \\%$ produce a higher estimator uncertainty than $5^{\\circ}$, strongly\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 2. Distribution of the standard deviation of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ from 2000 bootstrap sets of 13 galaxies (blue), compared to the case of erasing the anti-correlation between $p|\\epsilon|$ and $\\Delta \\theta$ (orange). The dashed line marks the standard deviation of $\\hat{\\alpha}$ measured from the Stil et al. sample of 13 galaxies. Its lower value compared to the orange distribution indicates a genuine anticorrelation between $\\Delta \\theta$ and $p|\\epsilon|$.\nsupporting a genuine anti-correlation between $\\Delta \\theta$ and $p|\\epsilon|$. We note that $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle}=13^{\\circ}$ if NGC 4565 , an edgeon galaxy with $p=10.5 \\%$, is excluded. Its ellipticity implies a $\\sim 10 \\%$ chance of occurrence for such \"good\" galaxies. Therefore, it may be expected that there is one such galaxy out of a sample of 13 .\n\nGalaxy Survey - Under the flat-sky approximation, the estimator is given by a sum over $N$ galaxies\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{L})=(\\Omega / N) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{-i \\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\alpha}}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Omega$ is survey area in steradians.

[49] to count available spiral galaxies. We first compute the redshiftdependent radio luminosity function of spiral galaxies. The radio luminosity function at 4.8 GHz at redshift $z$ can be related to that at 1.4 GHz at $z=0$, taking into account luminosity evolution [50] and the spectral index ( $S_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha=-0.7[51,52]$ ). We choose 4.8 GHz because Ref. [24] established the empirical correlation at this frequency and Faraday rotation in both the source and the MW is greatly reduced at higher frequencies. Next, the local radio luminosity function can be obtained\n\nfrom the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity function [53, 54] using a nearly linear relation between the radio and FIR luminosities of star-forming galaxies [55-60].\n\nThe number of spirals with an observed spectral flux density $S_{\\nu}$ above a threshold $S_{\\nu}^{\\min }$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& N\\left[S_{\\nu}>S_{\\nu}^{\\min }\\right]= \\\\\n& \\quad \\Omega \\int \\mathrm{d} z \\int_{\\log \\lambda(z)^{-1} L_{4.8}^{\\min }(z)}^{\\log L_{4.8}^{\\min }} \\mathrm{d} \\log L_{4.8} \\frac{c s(z)^{2}}{H(z)} \\phi\\left(\\log L_{4.8}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $s(z)=\\int_{0}^{z} c / H\\left(z^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} z^{\\prime}$ is the comoving distance to redshift $z ; H(z)$ is the expansion rate for $H_{0}=$ $70 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}, \\Omega_{\\mathrm{A}}=0.7, \\Omega_{m}=0.3 ; \\Omega$ is the surveyed sky area in steradians; $\\phi$ is the 4.8 GHz radio luminosity function (per unit comoving volume) of spirals at $z=0$ (see App. D); $L_{4.8}^{\\min }=10^{25} \\mathrm{~W} \\mathrm{~Hz}^{-1}$ is a generous upper bound on the radio luminosity of a spiral galaxy; $L_{4}^{\\min }$ is the galaxy luminosity at redshift $z$ with an observed spectral flux density $S_{\\nu}^{\\min }$ :\n\n$$\nL_{4.8}^{\\min }(z)=\\mathrm{d} \\pi s(z)^{2}(1+z)^{1-\\alpha} S_{\\nu}^{\\min }\n$$\n\nfor the radio spectral index $\\alpha=-0.7[51,52]$, and $\\lambda(z)$ describes the luminosity evolution with $z$ for spiral galaxies [50]. The upper limit in the $z$ integral should not exceed $z=1.5$; above that, nearly all massive halos host spheroidal galaxies [61, 62]. The lower limit in the $z$ integral should exceed the redshift of detectable birefringence sources. There is a trade-off between the galaxy number and the accumulation of birefringence along the line of sight. A more sophisticated calculation considering birefringence sources interspersed amongst the galaxies throughout all redshifts is model-dependent and is left for a future study.\n\nThe highest sensitivity achievable with data in the near future will likely come from correlating polarized SKA radio galaxies with LSST shape data (or using resolved SKA radio shapes). Similar to Ref. [63], we define Wide, Deep, and Ultradeep reference surveys, which have $\\sigma_{I}=1 \\mu \\mathrm{Jy}, 0.2 \\mu \\mathrm{Jy}$, and $0.05 \\mu \\mathrm{Jy}$, and cover $1000 \\mathrm{deg}^{2}$, $20 \\mathrm{deg}^{2}$, and $1 \\mathrm{deg}^{2}$, respectively, and consider SKA-MID Band 5a (4.6-8.5 GHz [64]). Including galaxies whose integrated 4.8 GHz intensities have $\\mathrm{SNR}>5$, we estimate the number of measurable spiral galaxies at $0.2<z<1.5$ to be $N=1.6 \\times 10^{6}, 2.1 \\times 10^{5}$ and $2.8 \\times 10^{4}$ for each survey, respectively. For $0.8<z<1.5$, the numbers are $N=2.8 \\times 10^{5}, 9.5 \\times 10^{4}$ and $1.7 \\times 10^{4}$, respectively (see App. D for calculation details).\n\nFor most detectable galaxies the polarization measurement error significantly contributes to the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$. Those galaxies collectively provide a non-negligible amount of information to reduce estimation noise. Consider $N$ galaxies in a small sky patch $\\mathrm{d} \\Omega$, each with a rotation estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}$. A linear combination $\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\text {best }} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\hat{\\alpha}_{i}$ with weights $w_{i}=\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{-1} / \\sum_{j}\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}_{j}^{2}\\right\\rangle^{-1}$ gives an unbiased minimumvariance estimator. For different galaxies, $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}^{2}\\right\\rangle$ only depends on the unpolarized radio SNR, which in turn only\ndepends on $z$ and $L_{4.8}$. Let us denote it as $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle(x)$, where $x=\\left(z, \\log L_{4.8}\\right)$.\n\nWith Eq. (17) rewritten as $N=\\mathrm{d} \\Omega \\int \\Phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x$, the weights are\n\n$$\nw(x)=\\mathrm{d} \\Omega^{-1}\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle(x)^{-1}\\left[\\int\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1} \\Phi\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x^{\\prime}\\right]^{-1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi(x)$ quantifies the galaxy distribution with redshift and luminosity as defined in Eq. (C1) in App. C. This leads to\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\text {best }}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\mathrm{d} \\Omega^{-1}\\left[\\int\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle(x)^{-1} \\Phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x\\right]^{-1}\n$$\n\nAccounting for the SNR distribution is therefore equivalent to having $N$ identically measured galaxies, each with an effective estimator variance\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle_{\\text {eff }}=N\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\text {best }}^{2}\\right\\rangle=\\frac{\\int \\Phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x}{\\int\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right\\rangle^{-1} \\Phi\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nWe replace $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle$ in Eq.

(17), the integral approaches a minimal value as $S_{\\nu}^{\\min }$ decreases, until saturation at $S_{\\nu}^{\\min } / \\sigma_{I} \\lesssim 5$.\n\nFig. 3 shows the noise angular power spectrum of the rotation estimator, compared with sensitivity curves for current and projected CMB surveys [20]. SKA will enable a noise power spectrum comparable to or even lower than that of CMB-S4 for $L \\gtrsim 5$, but probe a more limited $z$ range of birefringence sources. The noise spectra are compared to the maximal signal allowed by Planck [20] due to ultralight axion strings [13] approximated by the loop crossing model [65].\n\nDiscussion - Using Eq. (9), rotation can be estimated at discrete galaxy locations $\\left\\{\\hat{\\alpha}_{i}\\right\\}_{i}$, which is suited for realspace approaches that exploit the non-Gaussian statistics of $\\alpha(\\mathbf{n})$. This is applicable to birefringence from axion strings $[66,67]$.\n\nThe reduced intrinsic noise $\\left(5^{\\circ}-15^{\\circ}\\right)$ of our carefully constructed estimator compared to the spread of the misalignment angle $\\left(26^{\\circ}\\right)$ is promising for reducing shot noise and bias due to intrinsic alignment in cosmic shear estimation [30].\n\nMeasuring birefringence in the CMB has the advantage of being sensitive to all sources up to $z \\approx 1100$. Spiral galaxies do not effectively probe birefringence sources at $z \\gtrsim 1.5$. Nonetheless, galaxies present an opportunity for extracting the $z$-dependence of the birefringence sources. One could compare CMB rotation estimation with that from radio galaxies, or compare galaxy estimation between different $z$ bins. For example, if axion strings exist\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFIG. 3. Polarization rotation noise power spectra for SKA radio galaxy surveys combined with an overlapping optical imaging galaxy survey, compared to those for three CMB surveys. The effective per-galaxy sensitivity (Eq. (21)) is labeled in matching color. The low- $L$ cutoffs of SKA curves are set by the proposed survey areas. We show signal power spectra from ultralight axion strings (see main text) up to $z=z_{\\text {cmb }}$ (gray dashed) and up to $z=1.5,1,0.5$ (gray solid; from top to bottom). Colored bands mark the $68 \\%$ and $95 \\%$ confidence intervals of the noise floor estimated from bootstrapping the sample of 13 galaxies from [24].\nfor much of the cosmic history, this would enable the measurement of their size and number evolution with $z$ [65]. An axion field that is homogeneous but dynamic for $z \\lesssim 1100$ [40] could also show up as $z$-dependent from galaxy-based tomographic estimation, complementing recently proposed tomography methods for the CMB [6871]. Furthermore, any detection of birefringence through the CMB [14] can be validated with galaxies. Foreground systematics , e.g. from the MW, would show up in every\nredshift bin and could thus be identified and subtracted.\nConclusion - We have developed an unbiased minimum-variance quadratic estimator to detect anisotropic cosmic birefringence from correlation between radio polarization and shape in spiral galaxies. This offers an independent technique that complements CMB probes. This will be enabled by a synergy between upcoming large radio galaxy surveys such as SKA and optical imaging surveys such as LSST. The noise floor of the polarization rotation angular power spectrum of the galaxy-based method using SKA will be better than that of CMB-S4. We plan to test the empirical correlations of [24] on cosmological galaxy samples using data from existing smaller radio surveys $[36,43,48]$.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-0.jpeg":

Since $X$ and $Y$ are computed from the ellipticity, one may be concerned about weak lensing effects. For CMB anisotropies, quadratic estimators for cosmic shear and for polarization rotation are orthogonal to each other to first order in each of the effects due to their opposite parity [20]. We expect this first-order non-contamination to hold for our birefringence estimator. Cosmic shear induces a white noise on $Y \\approx p|\\epsilon| \\gamma=0.002(p / 0.1)(\\gamma / 0.02)|\\epsilon|$ where $\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\gamma^{2}\\right\\rangle} \\approx 0.02$ at $z \\sim 1$ [72], which is smaller than the intrinsic $\\sigma_{Y}=0.004$ (Eq. (12)). With both weak lensing and galaxy intrinsic shape alignment, a correlated noise contribution to $\\hat{\\alpha}$ arises, but with a magnitude significantly smaller than the noise floor derived here. We will therefore disregard weak lensing below.\n\nWe first comment on the measurement error in polarization. The important quantities for our purpose are $\\sigma_{I}$, the measurement error in the total intensity, and $\\sigma_{Q, U}$, the measurement error in the Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$, assumed to be equal. For a monochromatic electromagnetic wave described by complex electric field amplitudes $E_{x}, E_{y}$, the Stokes parameters are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI & =\\left|E_{x}\\right|^{2}+\\left|E_{y}\\right|^{2} \\\\\nQ & =\\left|E_{x}\\right|^{2}-\\left|E_{y}\\right|^{2} \\\\\nU & =2 \\operatorname{Re}\\left[E_{x} E_{y}^{*}\\right] \\\\\nV & =-2 \\operatorname{Im}\\left[E_{x} E_{y}^{*}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn the absence of any signal, we model components of $E_{x}, E_{y}$ as independent Gaussian distributions with zero mean and equal variance. The variances of the Stokes parameters satisfy\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{Q}^{2}=\\sigma_{U}^{2}=\\sigma_{V}^{2}=f \\sigma_{I}^{2}\n$$\n\nwith $f=1$.\nThis derivation applies to coherent monochromatic noise. While $E_{x}, E_{y}$ are Gaussian, the Stokes parameters are non-Gaussian. In the practical case of integration over a frequency band, Eqs. (A1)-(A4) are modified to statistical averages over frequency and time. The distributions of the Stokes parameters $I, Q, U, V$ approach Gaussian by the central limit theorem. In other words, the measurement noise of the Stokes parameters in a realistic measurement of radio polarization may be assumed to be Gaussian.\n\nIn practice, the presence of a signal predominant in $I$ increases $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$ more than $\\sigma_{Q, U, V}^{2}$. The precise error in radio polarization measurements varies depending on the beam profile, frequency, duration of observation, number of pointings, and whether model fitting is involved in polarization detection, generally with $f \\lesssim 1$. For measurements of spiral galaxies by VLA, this ratio is less than $1 / 2$ (e.g. 0.45 at 4.8 GHz and 0.36 at 1.4 GHz [73]). In forecasting sensitivities of SKA-MID configurations, we adopt $f=1$, leading to a conservative forecast. Note that Ref. [74] assumes $f=1 / 2$ for SKA-MID at 1.4 GHz .\n\nNext, we assume that the uncertainty in $p=P / I=\\sqrt{Q^{2}+U^{2}} / I$ is dominated by uncertainty in the numerator rather than the denominator, as the unpolarized intensity typically has a much higher SNR than the polarized emission. For realistic deep optical imaging surveys with shape measurements, the radio polarization measurement error dominates over the error in ellipticity measurement, an assumption we adopt. Polarization and shape noise components are assumed to be statistically independent from each other and from the polarization and noise signals.\n\nWith tildes denoting observed quantities with measurement noise, for each galaxy with total flux $I$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\langle\\tilde{Y}^{2}\\right\\rangle & =\\left\\langle\\left[\\operatorname{Im}\\left(-\\tilde{P}_{+} \\tilde{\\epsilon}_{-} / \\tilde{I}\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& \\approx\\left\\langle\\left[\\operatorname{Im}\\left(-\\tilde{P}_{+} \\epsilon_{-} / I\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\left\\langle\\left(\\tilde{U}^{2} \\epsilon_{1}^{2}+\\tilde{Q}^{2} \\epsilon_{2}^{2}-2 \\tilde{Q} \\tilde{U} \\epsilon_{1} \\epsilon_{2}\\right) / I^{2}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\left\\langle Y^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\left(\\sigma_{U}^{2}\\left\\langle\\epsilon_{1}^{2}\\right\\rangle+\\sigma_{Q}^{2}\\left\\langle\\epsilon_{2}^{2}\\right\\rangle\\right) / I^{2} \\\\\n& =\\left\\langle Y^{2}\\right\\rangle+f\\left(\\sigma_{I}^{2} / I^{2}\\right)\\left\\langle|\\epsilon|^{2}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAfter a similar calculation for $\\left\\langle\\tilde{X}^{2}\\right\\rangle$, we obtain the errors in $X$ and $Y$ including measurement error:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{X, Y}^{2}=\\sigma_{X, Y}^{2}+f \\frac{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\mathrm{SNR}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere the total flux SNR enters the expression, and $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=\\sqrt{\\left\\langle|\\epsilon|^{2}\\right\\rangle} \\approx 0.3$ as in the main text.\nWe now calculate the propagation of this error into the variance of the quadratic estimator. Let $\\hat{\\alpha}$ for each galaxy be constructed from the observed quantities (with tilde) including measurement errors, up to quadratic combinations:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha} \\equiv u \\tilde{X}+v \\tilde{Y}+u^{\\prime} \\tilde{X}^{2}+v^{\\prime} \\tilde{Y}^{2}+w \\tilde{X} \\tilde{Y}\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients are to be determined.\nUnder a polarization rotation $\\alpha$ at the galaxy's location, the observed quantities are transformed:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{X} \\rightarrow \\tilde{X}-2 \\alpha Y, \\quad \\tilde{Y} \\rightarrow \\tilde{Y}+2 \\alpha X\n$$\n\nwhere the small angle approximation $(\\alpha \\ll 1)$ is used, since large birefringence angles are observationally ruled out. Note that the transformation is proportional to quantities without measurement noises, since cosmic birefringence is applied before detection. By requiring that the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}$ be unbiased, namely $\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}\\rangle=\\alpha$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =u\\langle X\\rangle+u^{\\prime}\\left\\langle X^{2}\\right\\rangle+v^{\\prime}\\left\\langle Y^{2}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & =v\\langle X\\rangle+w\\left\\langle X^{2}\\right\\rangle-w\\left\\langle Y^{2}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing these, $u$ can be expressed in terms of $u^{\\prime}$ and $v^{\\prime}$, and $v$ can be expressed in terms of $w$. It remains to minimize the variance of the estimator, $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle$, under the null hypothesis, with respect to $u^{\\prime}, v^{\\prime}$, and $w$.\n\nTo enable analytic calculations, we approximate $X$ as a Gaussian random variable with mean $\\bar{X}$ and variance $\\sigma_{X}^{2}$, and $Y$ a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance $\\sigma_{Y}^{2}$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are only approximately Gaussian, this gives a nearly optimal quadratic estimator. The true optimal estimator could be obtained by numerically minimizing $\\left\\langle\\hat{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle$ given empirical distributions for $I p,|\\epsilon|$, and $\\Delta \\theta$.\n\nAfter some algebra, we obtain the claimed result in Eq. (9):\n\n$$\nu=u^{\\prime}=v^{\\prime}=0, \\quad v=\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_{Y}^{2} \\bar{X}}{2\\left[\\left(\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{X}^{2} \\bar{X}^{2}\\right]}, \\quad w=\\frac{\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}}{2\\left[\\left(\\sigma_{X}^{2}-\\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)^{2}+\\hat{\\sigma}_{X}^{2} \\bar{X}^{2}\\right]}\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# Appendix B: Maximum likelihood approach \n\nInspired by the idea originally put forth in Ref. [46] and closely following the formalism presented in Ref. [20], we pursue an maximum-likelihood approach to estimating the polarization rotation field $\\alpha(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}})$. For detailed justifications of some assumptions we are about to make, we refer to Sections 3 and 4.1 of Ref. [20].\nLet $\\mathbf{X}_{i} \\equiv\\left(\\hat{X}_{i} \\hat{Y}_{i}\\right)^{T}$ denote the observed quantities including measurement error for the $i$-th galaxy, located in the direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}$, among a total of $N$ galaxies. We start by assuming the following log-likelihood function:\n\n$$\n\\ln \\mathcal{L}\\left[\\alpha ;\\left\\{\\mathbf{X}_{i}, \\mathbf{N}_{i}\\right\\}\\right]=-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{\\left[M\\left(\\alpha\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{i}-\\mathbf{N}_{i}\\right)-\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{i}\\right]^{T} C_{\\mathbf{X}_{i}}^{-1}\\left[M\\left(\\alpha\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{i}-\\mathbf{N}_{i}\\right)-\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{i}\\right]+\\mathbf{N}_{i}^{T} C_{\\mathbf{N}_{i}}^{-1} \\mathbf{N}_{i}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{N}_{i}$ is the measurement error of $\\mathbf{X}_{i} ; \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{i}$ is the mean of $\\mathbf{X}$ over an ensemble of galaxies; $C_{\\mathbf{X}_{i}}$ is the covariance matrix of the intrinsic, unrotated quantities $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ (which in general may depend on the type or other properties of the $i$-th galaxy); $C_{\\mathbf{N}_{i}}$ is the covariance matrix of the measurement noise given by the second term in Eq. (11), meaning $C_{\\mathbf{N}_{i}}=\\left(\\sigma_{c}^{2} / 2\\right) \\mathrm{SNR}_{i}^{2} \\operatorname{diag}(1,1) ;$ and $M\\left(\\alpha\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{i}\\right)\\right)$ is the effect of polarization rotation on the intrinsic quantities. Eq. (B1) assumes that each $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ is a random Gaussian variable, the same approximation we used in the main text, meaning $C_{\\mathbf{X}_{i}}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\sigma_{\\hat{X}_{i}}^{2}, \\sigma_{\\hat{Y}_{i}}^{2}\\right)$.
