Unraveling the notation, the deterministic system is given by\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{i}=v_{i}, \\quad \\dot{v}_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} m_{j} \\phi\\left(x_{i}-x_{j}\\right)\\left(v_{j}-v_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince its inception the Cucker-Smale system has been the focus of numerous studies with applications to swarming, satellite navigation, control, etc, see accounts [ABF+19, Axe97, BN05, EK01, PEG09, VZ12, MT14, MP18, Shv21, Tad21]. The system owes its success to predictability of alignment outcome based only on the properties of the kernel, and not perpetual assumptions on the flock such as connectivity or thickness. More precisely the following theorem holds.\n\nTheorem 1.1 ([CS07a, CS07b, HT08, HL09]). If the kernel is fat tail, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\phi(r) d r=\\infty$, then solutions to (4) align exponentially fast to the conserved mean velocity $\\bar{v}=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} m_{j}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} m_{j} v_{j}$, while the flock remains bounded\n\n$$\n\\max _{i=1, \\ldots, N}\\left|v_{i}-\\bar{v}\\right| \\leqslant C e^{-\\delta t}, \\quad \\max _{i, j=1, \\ldots, N}\\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\\right| \\leqslant \\bar{D}\n$$\n\nwhere $C, \\delta, \\bar{D}$ depend only on the initial condition and parameters of the kernel.\nThe kinetic and macroscopic analogues of this theorem were established in [CFRT10, TT14], respectively.\nMany variants of the Cucker-Smale model were introduced to address issues related to specific modeling scenarios. Among the earlier ones is the Motsch-Tadmor model, [MT11, MT14], given by\n$\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}=1, \\quad[u]_{\\rho}=\\frac{(u \\rho) * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}\n$$\n\nUnlike $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$, the model prescribes a pure density-weighted averaging protocol $[\\cdot]_{\\rho}$, also called Favre filtration [Fav83], which allows to calibrate the balance of forces between clusters of vastly different masses. The model, however is a-symmetric which is part of the reason for the lack of developed well-posedness analysis for it.\n\nOne can consider a range of interpolated models between $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$, called $\\beta$-models,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}=(\\rho * \\phi)^{\\beta}, \\quad[u]_{\\rho}=\\frac{(u \\rho) * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}, \\quad \\beta \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nA symmetric version of the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$-model was implemented in [Shv22] in the study of relaxation and hydrodynamic limit: assuming $\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}$ and $\\int \\phi \\mathrm{d} x=1$,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}=1, \\quad[u]_{\\rho}=\\left(\\frac{(u \\rho) * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}\\right) * \\phi\n$$\n\nMulti-flock and multi-species variants of the Cucker-Smale model were discussed in [HT17, ST21]. Topological interactions introduced in [ST20] can be also put in the same context if properly desingularized, see [Shv24a].\n\nAnother core example of a non-Galilean invariant system was introduced in [Shv24a] as a model of consensus formation in segregated communities. Consider a smooth partition of unity $g_{l} \\in C^{\\infty}(\\Omega), g_{l} \\geqslant 0$, and $\\sum_{l=1}^{L} g_{l}=1$ subordinated to an open cover $\\left\\{\\mathcal{O}_{l}\\right\\}_{l=1}^{L}$ of $\\Omega$, so that supp $g_{l} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_{l}$. One defines the model by setting\n$\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}=1, \\quad[u]_{\\rho}(x)=\\sum_{l=1}^{L} g_{l}(x) \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} u g_{l} \\rho \\mathrm{~d} y}{\\int_{\\Omega} g_{l} \\rho \\mathrm{~d} y}\n$$\n\nThe noise included in (2) is not only a standard attribute of many agent-based models of swarming, but it also serves as a natural mechanism to break so called locked states that may occur in dynamics under local communication. Let us elaborate more on the latter point.\n\nSystems of Cucker-Smale type present a viable setting for the study of emergence. Emergence is the problem of finding collective outcomes when communication between agents, in contrast to the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, is properly local, $\\mathbb{1}_{r<r_{0}} \\lesssim \\phi(r) \\lesssim \\mathbb{1}_{r<r_{1}}$. The periodic environment $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is a mathematically convenient way to focus on dynamics in the 'bulk' of the flock away from its boundaries. So, for any of the systems based on Favre filtration, if $r_{1}$ is small enough, there are natural counterexamples to alignment a pair of agents may evolve on parallel geodesic orbits with different velocities and without ever coming to contact within the radius. Any other configuration of agents with rationally dependent velocities $v_{i}$ may result in a similar locked solution. However, such solutions form a measure zero set in the configuration space $\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)^{N}$, and hence, are unlikely to be observed, see [Shv24b] for more on this.\n\nIn the context of stochastically forced systems the locked states will be disrupted by the noise, and the problem of emergence becomes the problem of relaxation to the corresponding equilibrium $\\mu$. For the model (1), with thermalization proportional to $s_{\\rho}$, such equilibria are given by the global Maxwellians,\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}}=\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|(2 \\pi \\sigma)^{n / 2}} e^{-\\frac{(v-\\bar{u})^{2}}{2 \\sigma}}, \\quad \\bar{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\n$$\n\nSo, the problem of emergence $f \\rightarrow \\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}}$ becomes accessible by the methods of hypercoercivity, see [Vil09]. When $f$ is already close to $\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}}$ initially in the sense that $g=\\left(f-\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}}\\right) / \\sqrt{\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}}}$ is small in a higher order Sobolev metric, the relaxation was established by Duan et al [DFT10]. For the model with purely local alignment force $\\nabla_{v}((v-u) f)$ and $s_{\\rho} \\equiv 1$ the same result was proved in [Cho16]. In the perturbative regime the system avoids two problems - degeneracy of the strength $s_{\\rho}$ as a thermalization parameter in (1), and regularity of the macroscopic $u$. The first non-perturbative result was established in [Shv22] for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi^{-}}$ model under the assumption that $u$ remains uniformly bounded for all times. And finally, in [Shv24a] the unconditional relaxation was proved for any smooth solution to (1) based on the classical Cucker-Smale model with a Bochner-positive kernel $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$; while for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$-model and more generally for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-models the result still holds for perturbative data but in the much weaker sense of small Fisher information.\n\nIn light of these developments it has become imperative to develop a consistent well-posedness theory for the Fokker-Planck-Alignment models (1) away from equilibrium. The first such result was presented for the Cucker-Smale-based model with constant diffusion coefficient, $\\sigma \\Delta_{v} f$, by Bolley, Ca\u00f1izo, and Carrillo in [BCnC11], for measure-valued solutions with sub-Maxwellian decay, $\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} e^{a|v|^{2}} f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x<\\infty$. Karper, Mellet, and Trivisa [KMT13] prove existence of weak solutions with data in $f \\in L^{1}\\left(1+|v|^{2}+|x|^{2}\\right) \\cap L^{\\infty}$ satisfying entropy inequality, and the result carries over to the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$-case also. The regularity of obtained solutions, however, is insufficient to carry out hypocoercivity analysis, and non of the previous studies attempted to address the hypoelliptic regularization in the context of Fokker-Planck-Alignment models. It should be noted, however, that H\u00f6lder-based regularization for models similar to (1) with no alignment but thermalization parameter depending on the density $\\rho$ have been established in [AZ24, IM21]. Their approach relies on availability of an a priori $L^{\\infty}$-control on the distribution $h=f / \\mu \\in L^{\\infty}$, which in the presence of alignment fails to be the case.\n\nThe theory of classical solutions suitable for relaxation analysis was started in the same works [Shv22, Shv24a]. We developed global well-posedness in properly weighted Sobolev spaces for models of general type (1) starting from \"thick\" initial data, meaning data with the ball-averages of the density bounded from below\n\n$$\n\\inf _{x \\in \\Omega} \\int_{|y-x|<r_{0}} \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y>c_{0}\n$$\n\nHere, $r_{0}$ is the minimal radius of communication encoded in the environmental averaging $[u]_{\\rho}$. It was observed in [Shv24a] that the proper formulation of Sobolev regularity compatible with the non-homogeneous FokkerPlanck operator in (1) must incorporate regressive weights:\n\n$$\nH_{q}^{m}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)=\\left\\{f: \\sum_{2|\\mathbf{k}|+|\\mathbf{l}| \\leqslant 2 m} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\langle v\\rangle^{q-2|\\mathbf{k}|-|\\mathbf{l}|}\\left|\\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}} \\partial_{v}^{\\mathbf{l}} f\\right|^{2} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x<\\infty\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf $q, m$ are large enough, the $H_{q}^{m}$-metric controls various information functionals needed in the hypocoercivity estimates, see [TV00], and consequently the result of [Shv24a] applies to establish exponential relaxation\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f(t)-\\mu_{\\sigma, \\tilde{u}}\\right\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\lesssim \\sigma^{-1 / 2} e^{-c \\sigma t}\n$$\n\nfor any classical solutions in $H_{q}^{m}$ for the following models:\n\n- the Cucker-Smale model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ with a Bochner-positive kernel $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$;\n- the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model with $\\inf \\phi>0$;\n- the segregation model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ with $\\operatorname{supp} g_{l}=\\Omega$ for all $l=1, \\ldots, L$.\n- the non-symmetric models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$, with $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$, and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ without any restrictions, provided\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}\\left(f_{0}\\right)=\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\left|\\sigma \\nabla_{v} f_{0}+v f_{0}\\right|^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\leqslant \\delta \\sigma\n$$\n\nfor some small $\\delta>0$ depending only on the parameters of the model.\nFor general data Sobolev settings are too restrictive even for local well-posedness. So, a suitable formulation of solutions for such data would be on the distributional level as in [BCnC11, KMT13]. Such solutions, however, lack the regularity needed for the analysis of long time behavior. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an existence theory that comes together with the hypoelliptic regularization and relaxation. For many models, including the original Cucker-Smale based Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation, the theory gives a complete description of the dynamics from an arbitrary vacuous data, see Theorem 1.2 below.\n\nLet us point out the main technical issues. First and foremost, thin data yields a degenerate diffusion coefficient $\\mathrm{s}_{p}$, which meddles with the hypoellipticity of the equation. Second, the regularity of weak solutions provided by the Fisher information, $\\mathrm{s}_{p} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\in L_{t, x, v}^{1}$, is in insufficient for the application of classical techniques such as comparison principle. To circumvent these issues we show that weak solutions are automatically renormalized in the sense of DiPerna-Lions, and as a consequence satisfy the entropy equality from time $t=0$, as well as a weak maximum principle, see Lemma 3.6. Incidentally, the Fisher information plays the same role of critical regularity for the entropy law as Onsager- $1 / 3$ regularity for the energy conservation in incompressible fluids, see [Ise18, ES06, DLS09, CET94, CCFS08] and references therein. The problem of degeneracy of the Fisher information, however, is the main technical difficulty that prevents the use of such regularity directly. We therefore implement a new approach based on considering evolution of a thickness-weighted mollification, $\\frac{\\left|\\theta f\\right|_{t_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}$, where $\\theta$ is the thickness of the flock, see (15), (80), and $\\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{2}>0$ are small parameters. Formally, if $\\varepsilon_{1}=\\varepsilon_{2}=0$, this restores the original solution, however, in the intermediate estimates on the flux terms, by considering such mollification, we gain direct access to the a priori known Fisher-regularity of $\\theta f$.\n\nWith the renormalization at hand, we can apply the spread of positivity result of [Shv24a, Proposition $7.3]$ to show gain of Gaussian tails,\n\n$$\nf(t, x, v) \\geqslant b e^{-a|v|^{2}}, \\quad \\forall(t, x, v) \\in \\mathbb{T}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times[\\varepsilon, \\infty)\n$$\n\nThus, the solution becomes non-vacuous, which makes coefficients involved in (1) smooth. This subsequently opens access to a global hypoelliptic regularization, which we prove in Theorem 5.1.\n\nIn the next section we describe full statements of the results which apply to all core models - some unconditionally, some with additional assumptions on the kernel or data. The classical Cucker-Smale model happens to require the fewest assumptions as it pertains to the averaging protocol itself. So, in this case we can complete the description of dynamics starting from any data. Let us summarize the result here.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Consider the Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation (1) based on the Cucker-Smale averaging protocol $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ with a Bochner-positive kernel $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$. For any data $f_{0} \\in L^{\\infty} \\cap L^{1},|v|^{2} f_{0} \\in L^{1},|v|^{q} f_{0} \\in L^{2}$, $q \\geqslant 2$, there exists a global weak solution in the same class and with finite Fisher information $\\mathrm{s}_{p} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\in$ $L_{t, x, v}^{1}$, satisfying the entropy law (37). Every such solution gains uniform Gaussian tails (9) and regularizes into $H_{q}^{m}$ for any $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ instantly. If $q$ is large enough, then solutions are unique from thick data, and every solution relaxes to the Maxwellian exponentially fast,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f(t)-\\mu_{\\sigma, \\tilde{u}_{0}}\\right\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\leqslant c_{1} \\sigma^{-1 / 2} e^{-c_{2} \\sigma t}\n$$\n\nTable 1.

EnVIRONMENTAL AVERAGING MODELS, DESCRIPTION OF THE RESULTS \n\nIn this section we give detailed description of our results. Following [Shv24a], we adopt the framework of environmental averaging models, which encompasses all the examples introduced above, and allows us to state results more generally.\n2.1. Environmental averaging models and their regularity. Let $\\Omega=\\mathbb{T}^{n}$. Denote by $\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)$ the set of probability measures on $\\Omega$. An environmental averaging model is a family of pairs\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}=\\left\\{\\left(\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho},\\left[\\cdot\\right]_{\\rho}\\right): \\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}, \\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\in C(\\Omega)$, represents a (specific) scalar communication strength, and $\\left[\\cdot\\right]_{\\rho}$ is a family of order-preserving bounded linear operators on weighted $L_{\\rho}^{\\infty}$ spaces with $[1]_{\\rho}=1$. Many of the axiomatic properties listed in the original work [Shv24a] will be automatically satisfied in the specific class of models adopted here. Namely, we consider models where the weighted averages\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}[u]_{\\rho}\n$$\n\nare given in the form of a bounded integral operator\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)=\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) u(y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(y), \\quad \\rho \\text {-a.e. }\n$$\n\nrepresented by a non-negative communication kernel $\\phi_{\\rho} \\in L^{1}(\\mathrm{~d} \\rho \\otimes \\mathrm{d} \\rho), \\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}$, satisfying\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(y)=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}(x), \\quad \\rho \\text {-a.e. }\n$$\n\nAll our core models have explicit formulas for their kernels stated in Table 1.\nIt is very convenient to formulate regularity and mapping properties of a model $\\mathcal{M}$ directly in terms of its strength $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}$ and kernel $\\phi_{\\rho}$. In particular, we assume that our models are local, meaning that agents always interact within some radius $r_{0}>0$, called radius of communication:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\geqslant c_{0}, \\text { for all }|x-y|<r_{0}, \\text { and all } \\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\n$$\n\nFurther conditions involve the concept of thickness, which is defined here as the mass of a flock in a local neighborhood,\n\n$$\n\\theta(\\rho, x)=\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho\\left(x-r_{0} y\\right) \\chi(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}$ is a standard radially symmetric mollifier supported on the unit ball. We also define the global thickness as\n\n$$\n\\theta(\\rho, \\Omega)=\\inf _{x \\in \\Omega} \\theta(\\rho, x)\n$$\n\nBasic conditions on the strength are\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sup _{\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)}\\left\\|\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant \\bar{S} \\\\\n& \\rho \\rightarrow \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\text { is continuous from } L^{1}(\\Omega) \\text { to } L^{\\infty}(\\Omega) \\\\\n& \\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}(x) \\geqslant c \\theta(\\rho, x) \\quad \\text { for all } x \\in \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we state the list of basic regularity assumptions for uniformly thick flocks. These are necessary to develop a local well-posedness theory for classical thick data.\n\nDefinition 2.1. We say that a model $\\mathcal{M}$ is regular if in addition to the above it meets the following set of conditions: for all $\\rho, \\rho^{\\prime}, \\rho^{\\prime \\prime} \\in L^{1}(\\Omega)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\partial_{x}^{k} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{\\infty}+\\left\\|\\partial_{x}^{k} \\phi_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{\\infty}+\\left\\|\\partial_{y}^{k} \\phi_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant C_{k}(\\theta(\\rho, \\Omega)), \\quad k=0,1, \\ldots \\\\\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho^{\\prime}}-\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}}\\right\\|_{\\infty}+\\left\\|\\phi_{\\rho^{\\prime}}-\\phi_{\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant C\\left(\\theta\\left(\\rho^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right), \\theta\\left(\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}, \\Omega\\right)\\right)\\left\\|\\rho^{\\prime}-\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\|_{1}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nRemark 2.2. This definition differs from one used in [Shv24a] in only one detail - the Lipschitzness assumption (20) was stated in terms of the Wasserstein distance $W_{1}\\left(\\rho^{\\prime}, \\rho^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. The use of the weaker metric was necessary to carry out the mean-field limit and well-posedness of the corresponding discrete model. For our purposes here, the strong metric is sufficient, although it is obvious that all our core models are regular in the stronger sense of the definition stated in [Shv24a].\nTheorem 2.3 ([Shv24a]). Suppose that the model $\\mathcal{M}$ is regular. Let $f_{0} \\in H_{q}^{m}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right), q, m \\geqslant n+3$, be a uniformly thick initial condition,\n\n$$\n\\theta\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\Omega\\right)>0\n$$\n\nThen there exists a unique local solution to (1) on a time interval $[0, T)$ in the regularity class\n\n$$\nf \\in C_{w}\\left([0, T) ; H_{q}^{m}\\right), \\quad \\nabla_{v} f \\in L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; H_{q}^{m}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $T>0$ depends only on the initial energy $\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} f_{0} d v d x$ and thickness $\\theta\\left(\\rho_{0}, \\Omega\\right)$.\nMoreover, if $f \\in L_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; H_{q}^{m}\\right)$ is a given solution such that\n\n$$\n\\inf _{[0, T)} \\theta(\\rho, \\Omega)>0\n$$\n\nthen $f$ can be extended to an interval $[0, T+\\varepsilon)$ in the same class.\nRemark 2.4. Many models possess a native thickness $\\Theta(\\rho, x)$, relative to which they are regular. For example, for all $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$-models and the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model it is natural to define $\\Theta(\\rho, x)=\\rho * \\phi$. The segregation model is regular relative to\n\n$$\n\\Theta(\\rho, x)=\\min _{l: x \\in \\operatorname{supp} g_{l}} \\rho\\left(g_{l}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn all these cases $\\Theta(\\rho, x) \\geqslant c \\theta(\\rho, x)$, which on the one hand makes our notion of thickness $\\theta$ universal, but at the same time makes it harder for a flock to be $\\theta$-thick rather than natively $\\Theta$-thick. In particular, Theorem 2.3 would impose less stringent requirement on data if stated in terms of $\\Theta$. In [Shv24a] we formulated a set of conditions on $\\Theta$ which allow to prove such a native version of Theorem 2.3. However, for our purposes here, where Theorem 2.3 will only be used as an intermediate step to get solutions for non-vacuous data, the choice of using generic $\\theta$ will be sufficient.\n\nTo construct weak solutions from any data, a model needs to meet certain criteria that do not depend on thickness. As far as the strength-function is concerned, our basic assumptions of boundedness (16) and continuity-in- $\\rho$ (17) are already sufficient. For the communication kernel, we assume that the family is uniformly in Schur's class\n\n$$\n\\overline{S r}=\\sup _{\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}}\\left\\|\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, \\cdot) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(x)\\right\\|_{\\infty}<\\infty\n$$\n\nand the corresponding continuity-in- $\\rho$ condition is stated as follows: for any sequence of densities $\\rho_{n} \\rightarrow \\rho$ in $L^{1}$, and any subordinate sequence $\\left|\\tilde{\\rho}_{n}\\right| \\leqslant C \\rho_{n},|\\tilde{\\rho}| \\leqslant C \\rho$, with $\\tilde{\\rho}_{n} \\rightarrow \\tilde{\\rho}$ in $L^{1}$, one has\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho_{n}}(x, \\cdot) \\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\rightarrow \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, \\cdot) \\tilde{\\rho}(x) \\mathrm{d} x, \\text { weakly* in } L_{\\rho}^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nLet note that (24) together with the corresponding symmetric condition in $y$, which is automatically satisfied due to (13) and (16), form a set of classical Schur's conditions. Kernels in Schur's class define operators bounded on any $L_{y}^{p}, 1 \\leqslant p \\leqslant \\infty$. In our terms, it implies that the energy of weighted averages are bounded by the macroscopic energy:\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)\\right\\|_{L_{y}^{q}} \\leqslant(\\overline{S r} \\bar{S})^{1 / 2}\\|u\\|_{L_{y}^{q}}\n$$\n\nFor future reference we make the following definition.\nDefinition 2.5. A regular model satisfying (24)-(25) is said to belong to Schur's class.\n\nLemma 2.6. All models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{seg}}$ are regular of Schur's class.\nProof. First, we already noted that all models are trivially regular. Let us focus on Schur's conditions. The boundedness (24) follows immediately from (13) and (16) for all symmetric models,\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y)=\\phi_{\\rho}(y, x)\n$$\n\nThose include $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$, and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ from our list. We regard to $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$, including the Motsch-Tadmor model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$, condition (24) reduces to showing that the expression $\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{(\\rho * \\phi)^{1-\\beta}}\\right) * \\phi$ is uniformly bounded in $L^{\\infty}$ and over all $\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}$. This follows from a more precise bound proved in [Shv24a], and [KMT13] in the case $\\beta=0$,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{(\\rho * \\phi)^{1-\\beta}}\\right) * \\phi \\leqslant C(\\rho * \\phi)^{\\beta}, \\quad \\forall 0 \\leqslant \\beta \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nCondition (25) is trivial for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$-model, and for others it is somewhat more involved. Let us break it down by models.\n\nLet us verify (25) for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$-models, $0 \\leqslant \\beta<1$. Let us fix a test function $g \\in L_{\\rho}^{1}$ and notice the following uniform continuity: for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that whenever $\\rho * \\phi(x)<\\delta$, then $(g \\rho) * \\phi(x)<\\varepsilon$. Indeed, otherwise, there exists a sequence $x_{n} \\in \\Omega$ such that $\\rho * \\phi\\left(x_{n}\\right)<1 / n$, yet $(g \\rho) * \\phi\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon_{0}$. By compactness, $x_{n} \\rightarrow x_{0}$, and by continuity $\\rho * \\phi\\left(x_{0}\\right)=0$, yet $(g \\rho) * \\phi\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon_{0}$, a contradiction. So, for any $\\varepsilon>0$ let us pick $\\delta>0$ as above, and compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\phi_{\\rho_{n}}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)-\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}(x)\\right) \\mathrm{d} x g(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y & =\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi(x)}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}(x)}{\\rho * \\phi(x)}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\rho * \\phi \\geqslant \\delta}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi(x)}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}(x)}{\\rho * \\phi(x)}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\rho * \\phi<\\delta}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi(x)}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}(x)}{\\rho * \\phi(x)}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x:=I+I I\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that since $\\rho_{n} \\rightarrow \\rho$ in $L^{1}$, starting from some $n$, we will have $\\rho_{n} * \\phi \\geqslant \\delta / 2$ in the first integral. It is clear then that $I \\rightarrow 0$. For $I I$ we have\n\n$$\n|I I| \\leqslant C \\varepsilon \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{n}(x)}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi(x)}+\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\rho * \\phi(x)}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x\n$$\n\nIt remains to prove that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\rho \\in L^{1}} \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\rho * \\phi(x)} \\mathrm{d} x<\\infty\n$$\n\nThis is in fact related to (28), and goes by the same proof, but since we will be using it over again later, let us present a short argument. In fact, in view of the locality of the kernel $\\phi$, it follows from\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\rho \\in L^{1}} \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\theta(\\rho, x)} \\mathrm{d} x<\\infty\n$$\n\nLet us recall that the mollifier used to define $\\theta$ is bounded from below on the ball of radius $r_{0} / 2$. So, $\\theta(\\rho, x) \\gtrsim \\int_{B_{r_{0} / 2}(x)} \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y$. Now by a standard covering, there exist $J$ balls, where $J$ depends only on $n$ and $r_{0}$ such that $\\Omega \\subset \\cup_{j=1}^{J} B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right)$. Then, since for all $x \\in B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right), B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right) \\subset B_{r_{0} / 2}(x)$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\theta(\\rho, x)} \\mathrm{d} x \\lesssim \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\int_{B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right)} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\int_{B_{r_{0} / 2}(x)} \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y} \\mathrm{~d} x \\leqslant \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\int_{B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right)} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\int_{B_{r_{0} / 4}\\left(x_{j}\\right)} \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y} \\mathrm{~d} x=J\n$$\n\nThus, $\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\theta(\\rho, x)} \\mathrm{d} x \\lesssim J$. This proves (30), which implies that $|I I| \\leqslant C \\varepsilon$, and consequently, (25).\n\nLet us verify (25) for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model. Switching convolutions with the kernel $\\phi$ twice we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\phi_{\\rho_{n}}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)-\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}(x)\\right) \\mathrm{d} x g(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y & =\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n} * \\phi}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho} * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\rho * \\phi \\geqslant \\delta}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n} * \\phi}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho} * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\rho * \\phi<\\delta}\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho}_{n} * \\phi}{\\rho_{n} * \\phi}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\rho} * \\phi}{\\rho * \\phi}\\right)(g \\rho) * \\phi \\mathrm{~d} x:=I+I I\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs before $I \\rightarrow 0$ trivially, and $|I I| \\lesssim \\varepsilon$ simply by the subordination of the tilda-sequence.\nLastly, let us verify (25) for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$-model.\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\phi_{\\rho_{n}}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}_{n}(x)-\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\tilde{\\rho}(x)\\right) \\mathrm{d} x g(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y=\\sum_{l=1}^{L}\\left(\\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} \\tilde{\\rho}_{n} g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} x}{\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_{n} g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} z}-\\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} \\tilde{\\rho} g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} x}{\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} z}\\right) \\int_{\\Omega} g_{l}(y) g(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nNote that by the subordination the coefficients in the sum are all bounded. Now, if for an $l \\leqslant L, \\int_{\\Omega} \\rho g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} z=$ $\\delta>0$, then $\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_{n} g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} z \\geqslant \\delta / 2$ starting from some $n$, the that term clearly vanishes in the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. If $\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho g_{l} \\mathrm{~d} z=0$, then $\\int_{\\Omega} g_{l}(y) g(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y=0$, and consequently that term is missing from the sum. This concludes the proof.\n\nRemark 2.7. As a side note we mention that the same $L^{2}$-boundedness (26) holds for Hilbert-Schmidt kernels\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}^{2}(x, y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(x)<\\infty\n$$\n\nOne can in principle construct an alternative well-posedness theory based on conditions of Hilbert-Schmidt type, for example, by requiring\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sup _{y \\in \\Omega, \\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)}\\left|\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y)\\right| \\leqslant C(\\theta(\\rho, x)) \\\\\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\theta(\\rho, x) \\geqslant \\delta}\\left|\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y)-\\phi_{\\rho_{n}}(x, y)\\right|^{2} \\mathrm{~d} \\rho_{n}(x) \\mathrm{d} \\rho_{n}(y) \\rightarrow 0, \\text { as }\\left\\|\\rho-\\rho_{n}\\right\\|_{1} \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nin place of (24) - (25). In our situation this approach appears to be less inclusive as it does not apply to the thickness-nonlocal $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model. Still it is worth noting that the Hilbert-Schmidt condition itself (31) holds for all our core models and plays a crucial role in establishing hydrodynamic limits passing from kinetic to macroscopic description, see [Shv24a, KMT15].\n2.2. Existence of weak solutions for regular models of Schur's class. Let us now state our first main result.

Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a regular model of Schur's class.\nExistence: For any initial condition $f_{0} \\in L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}$ there exists a global weak solution to (1) in the class\n\n$$\nf \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}\\right) \\cap C\\left([0, T) ; \\mathcal{D}^{\\prime}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right), \\quad s_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\in L^{1}\\left([0, T) \\times \\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor any $T>0$.\nEntropy: Any weak solution in the above class satisfies the entropy equality\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{H} & =\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} f \\log f d v d x+\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} f d v d x \\\\\n\\mathcal{H}(t)-\\mathcal{H}(0) & =-\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} s_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f+v f\\right|^{2}}{f} d v d x d s+\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u), u\\right)_{\\rho} d s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRenormalization: any weak solution is automatically renormalized in the sense of DiPerna-Lions, see Proposition 3.1.\n\nUniqueness: Let $f^{\\prime}, f^{\\prime \\prime}$ be two weak solutions in class (36) with $f_{0}^{\\prime}=f_{0}^{\\prime \\prime} \\in L_{q}^{2}, q \\geqslant n+4$, and $\\theta\\left(\\rho^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right)>0$ on $[0, T)$. Then $f^{\\prime}=f^{\\prime \\prime}$ on $[0, T)$.\n\nHigher moments: If $f_{0} \\in L_{q}^{1}$ for $q>2$, then in addition to (36) there exists a solution with $f \\in$ $L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L_{q}^{1}\\right)$, for any $T>0$.\n\nAs a consequence of Lemma 2.6, all models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ fall under the range of Theorem 2.10. Let us note, however, that the result falls short in two details - it does not provide uniqueness for non-thick data, and the propagation of higher moments is not claimed for any given solution. Instead, we show that at least one such weak solution exists. To prove propagation requires boundedness of the drift $\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)$, see Theorem 4.1, which is not guaranteed for all models. This will be discussed in the next section.\n2.3. Gain of positivity and parabolic regularization. Theorem 2.10 represents the best well-posedness result we can obtain under no additional assumptions on the model $\\mathcal{M}$. Solutions to Fokker-Planck type equations are expected to gain more regularity due to the classical hypoelliptic interplay between the transport and diffusion terms. In our situation this result stumbles upon two issues - a possibly degenerate thermalization coefficient $s_{\\rho}$, and lack of regularity of the drift $\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}$. For regular models $\\mathcal{M}$, both issues are resolved for thick flocks $\\theta(\\rho, \\Omega)>0$ as readily seen from the assumptions (18), (19). So, the first step in proving regularization result consists in establishing gain of positivity for solutions of (1). The following result was proved in [Shv24a] for classical solutions, and we will show extend it to the class of weak solutions in Section 3.8.\n\nProposition 2.11. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a regular model. For a given weak $f$ in class (36) on a time interval $[0, T)$ there exists $a, b>0$ which depend only on the parameters of the model $\\mathcal{M}$, time $T$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\bar{W}=\\sup _{t \\in[0, T)}\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\\\\n& \\bar{H}=\\sup _{t \\in[0, T)} \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} f d v d x+\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} f|\\log f| d v d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\nf(t, x, v) \\geqslant b e^{-a|v|^{2}}, \\quad \\forall(t, x, v) \\in \\mathbb{T}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times[T / 2, T)\n$$\n\nClearly the result applies instantaneously in time on $[\\varepsilon, T)$, with $a, b$ being dependent on $\\varepsilon, T$, and the Gaussian bound (39) makes the flock non-vacuous, and hence, thick. As a consequence of the regularity of $\\mathcal{M}$, all the coefficients of the equation become smooth on $[0, T)$ and thermalization $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}$ strictly positive. This puts the model (1) within the applicability of the classical regularization theory. In Theorem 5.1 we stated a version of global hypoellipticity result that puts our solutions directly in the weighted Sobolev spaces $H_{q}^{m}$ as long as the data has finite $q$-moment $f_{0} \\in L_{q}^{2}$. Since $f \\in L^{\\infty} L_{q}^{2}$, setting $f_{0}=f(\\varepsilon)$ as initial condition, provides instantaneous regularization into $H_{2}^{m}$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\|f(t)\\|_{H_{2}^{m}} \\lesssim 1 /(t-\\varepsilon)^{\\kappa}$.\n\nWe thus conclude that regularization of solutions is based upon control over two key quantities (38). So, let us discuss the absolute entropy $\\bar{H}$ first. For Schur's models, $\\bar{H}$ remains bounded on any finite time interval. Indeed, due to the $L^{2}$-boundedness (26), we can see from the energy law (77) that $\\mathcal{E}<C_{1}$ on $[0, T)$. Hence, from (37), $\\mathcal{H}<C_{2}$ on $[0, T)$. By the classical inequality, [Lio94, GJV04], there is an absolute constant $C_{3}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|f \\log f| \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\leqslant \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} f \\log f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+\\frac{1}{4} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+C_{3} \\leqslant \\mathcal{H}+C_{3}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\bar{H} \\leqslant 2 \\mathcal{H}+C_{3}<C_{4}\n$$\n\nThus, Schur's conditions are sufficient to control the absolute entropy $\\bar{H}$.\nAs to the drift $\\bar{W}$, we need to add it as an additional assumption on solution. Our most general regularization result can be stated as follows.\n\nTheorem 2.12. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a regular model of Schur's class. Then any weak solution $f$ to (1) in class (36) and with bounded drift, $\\bar{W}<\\infty$, gains instant regularization on $[\\varepsilon, T)$ with\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{H_{2}^{m}} \\leqslant C_{\\varepsilon, T, m}, \\quad \\forall m \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nIf, in addition, $f_{0} \\in L_{q}^{2}, q \\geqslant 2$, then\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{H_{2}^{m}} \\leqslant C_{\\varepsilon, T, m}, \\quad \\forall m \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nThe second conclusion follows from the propagation of moments Theorem 4.1. It ensures that $f \\in L^{\\infty} L_{q}^{2}$ as long as $\\bar{W}<\\infty$, which results in (43) by Theorem 5.1.\n\nFor a narrower yet still extensive class of models the drift $\\bar{W}$ is automatically controlled by the energy these are the models with uniform $L^{2}$-to- $L^{\\infty}$ regularization property:\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}(u)\\right\\|_{L_{\\rho}^{\\infty}} \\leqslant C\\|u\\|_{L_{\\rho}^{2}}\n$$\n\nwith $C>0$ independent of $\\rho \\in L^{1}$. Conditions of this sort for general integral operators is a classical subject, see [Lev09] for a comprehensive overview. The boundedness between $L_{\\rho}^{p} \\rightarrow L_{\\rho}^{q}$ holds for a class of kernels satisfying the following mixed Lebesgue integrability condition:\n\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{p, q}=\\sup _{\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{p}^{*}(x, y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(y)\\right)^{q / p^{*}} \\mathrm{~d} \\rho(x)<\\infty, \\quad \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{p^{*}}=1\n$$\n\nFor the case in question, $p=2, q=\\infty$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{2, \\infty}=\\sup _{\\rho \\in \\mathcal{P}}\\left\\|\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{p}^{2}(\\cdot, y) \\mathrm{d} \\rho(y)\\right\\|_{\\infty}<\\infty\n$$\n\nThis is clearly satisfied for the Cucker-Smale model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$. More generally, in the range of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$-models, we have (44) satisfied only $\\beta \\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}\\left|\\frac{\\phi(x-y)}{(\\rho * \\phi)^{1-\\beta}(x)}\\right|^{2} \\mathrm{~d} \\rho(y) \\leqslant\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\frac{\\rho_{\\phi}(x)}{(\\rho * \\phi)^{2-2 \\beta}(x)}=\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}(\\rho * \\phi)^{2 \\beta-1}(x) \\leqslant\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}^{2 \\beta}\n$$\n\nAmong other core models, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$, and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$, condition (46) does not hold for general kernels, unless the kernel is global, i.e. if $\\inf \\phi>0$, or if $\\operatorname{supp} g_{l}=\\Omega$, for all $l \\leqslant L$, for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$-model. Let us collect these observations as a corollary.\nCorollary 2.13. The conclusions of Theorem 2.12 hold for any weak solution to (1) based on\n(1) all the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$-models with $\\beta \\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$, and in particular, for the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$-model;\n\n(2) all the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$-models with $\\beta \\geqslant 0$ including $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}$, and for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$, provided $\\inf \\phi>0$;\n(3) $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$, provided $\\operatorname{supp} g_{l}=\\Omega$, for all $l \\leqslant L$.\n2.4. Global relaxation. Relaxation of solutions starting from arbitrary data relies to two key factors. One is sufficient regularity of solutions to conduct the hypocercivity estimates, and in particular derive an equation on the total Fisher information\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I} & =\\mathcal{I}_{v v}+\\mathcal{I}_{x x} \\\\\n\\mathcal{I}_{v v} & =\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\left|\\sigma \\nabla_{v} f+v f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x, \\quad \\mathcal{I}_{x x}=\\sigma \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{x} f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe Fisher information is controlled by $H_{q}^{m}$ if $m, q$ are large enough, [TV00, Lemma 1].\nSecond, the flock must maintain uniform thickness which by regularity of $\\mathcal{M}$ implies smoothness of all the coefficients in (1), and must also maintain a uniform bound on the spectral gap of the averages. More precisely, let us recall the following result proved in [Shv24a].\n\nProposition 2.14. Suppose $\\mathcal{M}$ is a regular model. Let $f \\in H_{q}^{m}$ be a classical solution to (1) with density $\\rho$ satisfying the following conditions uniformly in time\n(i) $\\theta(\\rho, \\Omega) \\geqslant c_{0}$\n(ii) there exists a constant $\\varepsilon_{0}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\int u \\rho d x=0} \\frac{\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}}{(u, u)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}} \\leqslant 1-\\varepsilon_{0}, \\quad \\kappa_{\\rho}=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\rho\n$$\n\nThen $f$ relaxes to the corresponding Maxwellian exponentially fast,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f(t)-\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}(t)}\\right\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\leqslant c_{1} \\sqrt{\\sigma^{-1} \\mathcal{I}\\left(f_{0}\\right)} e^{-c_{2} \\sigma t}\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{1}, c_{2}>0$ depend only on the parameters of the model $\\mathcal{M}$, and\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}=\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} v f(t, x, v) d v d x\n$$\n\nGenerally, the momentum $\\bar{u}$ is not conserved, even though the result still holds. However, one can show that the momentum still settles exponentially fast $\\bar{u} \\rightarrow u_{\\infty}$ for some $u_{\\infty} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for all our core models. Indeed, a general sufficient condition which holds for all of them was obtained in [Shv24a, Lemma 8.6]:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|}}(x, y) \\mathrm{d} x=\\mathrm{s}_{\\frac{1}{|\\Omega|}}(y)\n$$\n\nCorollary 2.15. For all core models, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$, under the assumptions of Proposition 2.14 the solution relaxes to a fixed Maxwellian $f \\rightarrow \\mu_{\\sigma, u_{\\infty}}$.\n\nFor a class of conservative models satisfying\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) \\rho(x) \\mathrm{d} x=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}(y)\n$$\n\nthe momentum is conserved\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{t}=\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho}(x, y) u(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\rho(x) \\mathrm{d} x-\\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}(y) u(y) \\rho(y) \\mathrm{d} y=0\n$$\n\nSo, in this case, $u_{\\infty}=\\bar{u}_{0}$. All symmetric models, $\\phi_{\\rho}(x, y)=\\phi_{\\rho}(y, x)$, are obviously conservative, including $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$. There are, however, examples of conservative non-symmetric models, see [Shv24a].\n\nLet us now analyze and collect properties of a model necessary to achieve global relaxation starting from any data with higher finite momentum $f_{0} \\in L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1} \\cap L_{q}^{2}$. First, we need $\\mathcal{M}$ to be of regular Schur's class in order to guarantee global existence of a weak solution by Theorem 2.10. This is not a restrictive class as all our core models are Schur by Lemma 2.6. Second, any such solution need to regularize to become classical, so $\\mathcal{M}$ must satisfy the uniform $L^{2}$-to- $L^{\\infty}$ regularization property (44). Third, we need to guarantee gain of thickness (i) uniformly in time. Proposition 2.11 provides a gain contingent upon uniform bounds on $\\bar{H}$ and $\\bar{W}$. In view of (44), $\\bar{W}$ is controlled by the energy $\\mathcal{E}$, which in turn is controlled by $\\bar{H}$, which is controlled\n\nby $\\mathcal{H}$ thanks to (41). So, everything reduces to controlling the entropy. We can rewrite the entropy law in a different way:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\mathcal{H}=-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} s_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f+(v-u) f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\|u\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\kappa_{\\rho}\\right)}^{2}+\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}} \\leqslant-\\|u\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\kappa_{\\rho}\\right)}^{2}+\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}\n$$\n\nIf the averaging operator $[u]_{\\rho}: L_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}^{2} \\rightarrow L_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}^{2}$ is contractive, then $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\mathcal{H} \\leqslant 0$, and hence $\\mathcal{H} \\leqslant \\mathcal{H}_{0}$. It was shown in [Shv24a] that all conservative models are contractive. So, let us assume that $\\mathcal{M}$ is conservative (which also implies the conclusion with $u_{\\infty}=\\bar{u}=\\bar{u}_{0}$ ).\n\nForth, for many models the spectral gap condition (ii) is controlled by the thickness: for some $\\varepsilon: \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{0} \\geqslant \\varepsilon(\\theta(\\rho, \\Omega))\n$$\n\nA large class of models for which such estimates were obtained are symmetric positive-semi-definite models (or more generally ball-positive models, see [Shv24a]), $\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}} \\geqslant 0$. These include $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}$ if the kernel is Bochner-positive, $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$,\n\n$$\n\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}=\\int_{\\Omega}\\left((u \\rho) * \\psi\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nthe $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model,\n\n$$\n\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}=\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{((u \\rho) * \\phi)^{2}}{\\rho * \\phi} \\mathrm{~d} x \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nand $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$-model,\n\n$$\n\\left(u,[u]_{\\rho}\\right)_{\\kappa_{\\rho}}=\\sum_{l=1}^{L} g_{l}(x) \\frac{\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} u g_{l} \\rho \\mathrm{~d} y\\right)^{2}}{\\int_{\\Omega} g_{l} \\rho \\mathrm{~d} y} \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nThe corresponding estimates on the gap are listed in the following table:\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nGathering all the discussed conditions we obtain the following general statement.\nTheorem 2.16. Suppose $\\mathcal{M}$ is a regular conservative model of Schur's class satisfying the uniform $L^{2}$-to$L^{\\infty}$ mapping property (44), and the spectral gap estimate (52). Then for any data $f_{0} \\in L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1} \\cap L_{q}^{2}, q \\gg 2$, there exists a global weak solution with uniformly bounded energy $\\mathcal{E}$ and entropy $\\mathcal{H}$, which regularizes into any $H_{q}^{m}$ instantaneously, and relaxes to the Maxwellian exponentially fast,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f(t)-\\mu_{\\sigma, \\bar{u}_{0}}\\right\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\leqslant c_{1} \\sqrt{\\sigma^{-1} \\mathcal{I}\\left(f_{0}\\right)} e^{-c_{2} \\sigma t}\n$$\n\nIn particular, the statement applies to the following models\n\n- the Cucker-Smale model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {CS }}$ with a Bochner-positive kernel $\\phi=\\psi * \\psi$;\n- the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model with inf $\\phi>0$;\n- the segregation model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ with supp $g_{l}=\\Omega$ for all $l=1, \\ldots, L$.\n\nRemark 2.17. The uniform $L^{2}$-to- $L^{\\infty}$ mapping property (44) is the only property lacking by the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$ models with general kernels. One can however state a conditional result for solutions with uniformly bounded macroscopic velocities\n\n$$\n\\sup _{t}\\|u(t)\\|_{\\infty}<\\infty\n$$\n\nIndeed, since $\\left\\|\\left[\\cdot\\right]_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}}=1$, the uniform control over $\\bar{W}$ is guaranteed for such solutions. For the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}$-model this result was proved in [Shv22].\n\nWhat about non-symmetric models, such as $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text {MT }}$ ? Such models, despite the lack assumptions listed in Theorem 2.16, do possess them for almost uniformly distributed densities $\\rho$, which applies to distributions $f$ located near the Maxwellian. Indeed, for all the core models $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{CS}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{MT}}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\beta}$, with Bochner-positive $\\phi$, and for $\\mathcal{M}_{\\phi}, \\mathcal{M}_{\\text {seg }}$, the spectral gap $\\varepsilon_{0}$ and thickness $\\theta$ will remain uniformly positive for any density sufficiently close to uniform (see [Shv24a, Propositions 4.16, 4.18])\n\n$$\n\\|\\rho-1 /|\\Omega|\\|_{1} \\leqslant \\delta_{0}\n$$\n\nAt the same time, a modified Fisher information\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{I}}=c_{1} \\mathcal{I}_{v v}+c_{2} \\varepsilon \\mathcal{I}_{x v}+c_{3} \\mathcal{I}_{x x}+c_{4} \\mathcal{H}, \\quad \\varepsilon \\ll 1\n$$\n\nis a Lyapunov functional (as follows from the proof of Proposition 2.14),\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\tilde{\\mathcal{I}} \\leqslant-c \\sigma \\tilde{\\mathcal{I}}\n$$\n\nwhere $c$ depends on $\\theta$ and $\\varepsilon_{0}$.

We therefore obtain the following final result.\n\nTheorem 2.18.

Global existence of weak solutions \n\nIn this section we prove all the statements of Theorem 2.10, except the uniqueness part which will be postponed till next section.\n3.1. Approximation. Let us consider a modification of (1) where all the macroscopic densities are uniformly supported from below by a small parameter $\\varepsilon>0$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t} f^{\\varepsilon}+v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} f^{\\varepsilon} & =\\mathrm{s}^{\\varepsilon} \\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\nabla_{v} f^{\\varepsilon}+v f^{\\varepsilon}\\right)+\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\nabla_{v} f^{\\varepsilon} \\\\\n\\mathrm{s}^{\\varepsilon}=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}} \\quad \\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}(x) & =\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}(x, y) u^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)} & =\\frac{\\rho^{\\varepsilon}+\\varepsilon}{1+\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $f_{0}^{\\varepsilon}$ is a smooth truncation of the mollified initial condition $f_{0} \\in L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}$, for example\n\n$$\nf_{0}^{\\varepsilon}(x, v)=\\chi(x, \\varepsilon v) f_{0} * \\chi_{\\varepsilon}(x, v)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}$ is any approximating identity scaling of $\\chi$ periodic in $x$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|f_{0}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}} \\leqslant\\left\\|f_{0}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}}\n$$\n\nand $f_{0}^{\\varepsilon} \\in H_{Q}^{M}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ for any $M, Q \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nLet us be mindful of the fact that $\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}$ is not the macroscropic density of $f^{\\varepsilon}$, and there is a disconnect between $\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}$ and the native $\\rho^{\\varepsilon}$ in the definition of $\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}$. It is done intentionally to give the kernel a degree of regularity, be it $\\varepsilon$-dependent, yet preserving the integrity of the pairing $u^{\\varepsilon} \\rho^{\\varepsilon}$ in the integral operator. Since $\\mathrm{s}^{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}$ are uniformly in time in $C^{\\infty}$ the proof of the local well-posedness theorem Theorem 2.3 applies in the obvious manner. Since the thickness is bounded from below by $\\varepsilon$, the continuation criterion applies to yield global solution. Thus, the approximated system (55) gives rise to a global solution $f^{\\varepsilon}$ in $H_{Q}^{M}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ for any $M, Q$.\n\nLet us note that although the Sobolev norm is expected to deteriorate with $\\varepsilon$, the energy\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\varepsilon}=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} f^{\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x\n$$\n\nremains exponentially bounded in time independently of $\\varepsilon$. Indeed, we have the following equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\mathcal{E}^{\\varepsilon}=-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(v \\cdot \\nabla_{v} f^{\\varepsilon}+|v|^{2} f^{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+\\left(\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}, u^{\\varepsilon}\\right)_{\\rho^{\\varepsilon}}\n$$\n\nAfter integration by parts in the first term we can see it is bounded by an absolute constant $n \\bar{S}$. As to the macroscopic term $\\left(\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}, u^{\\varepsilon}\\right)_{\\rho^{\\varepsilon}}$ we observe that the particular nature of the mollification $\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}$ allows to preserve its $L^{2}$-boundedness relative to the native density $\\rho^{\\varepsilon}$. We have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\rho^{\\varepsilon}\\right)}^{2}=\\int_{\\Omega}\\left|\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}(x, y) u^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\mathrm{d} y\\right|^{2} \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(x) \\mathrm{d} x\n$$\n\nUsing that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}(x, y) \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\leqslant(1+\\varepsilon) \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}(x, y) \\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}(y) \\mathrm{d} y=(1+\\varepsilon) \\mathrm{s}^{\\varepsilon}(x) \\leqslant 2 \\bar{S}\n$$\n\nHence, by the H\u00f6lder inequality,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\rho^{\\varepsilon}\\right)}^{2} \\leqslant 2 \\bar{S} \\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{\\Omega} \\phi_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}}(x, y)\\left|u^{\\varepsilon}(y)\\right|^{2} \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\rho^{\\varepsilon}(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\leqslant 2 \\overline{S r S}\\left\\|u^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\rho^{\\varepsilon}\\right)}^{2}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\mathcal{E}^{\\varepsilon} \\leqslant C_{1}+C_{2} \\mathcal{E}^{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{1}, C_{2}$ are independent of $\\varepsilon$, and consequently,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{\\varepsilon}(t) \\leqslant C e^{C t}\n$$\n\nfor all $t>0$ and $C$ being independent of $\\varepsilon$. In particular it follows that (55) is globally well-posed.\nWe can now use it as an approximation scheme to establish existence of global weak solutions to the original FPA (1). Let us record, as a consequence of (57) and (59) we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\rho^{\\varepsilon}\\right)} \\leqslant C_{T}\n$$\n\nSince $f^{\\varepsilon} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T] ; H_{Q}^{M}\\right)$ its maximum is achieved on a ball $\\Omega \\times B_{R}(0)$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$. So, by Rademacher's lemma, we can evaluate (55) at a point of maximum at any time and obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t}\\left\\|f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant n \\bar{S}\\left\\|f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nHence, one obtains a uniform bound on the density on $[0, T]$ independent of $\\varepsilon$.\nWe have determined that\n\n$$\nf^{\\varepsilon} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nuniformly in $\\varepsilon$. Moreover, from the equation (55) we also conclude $\\partial_{t} f^{\\varepsilon} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; H^{-2}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right.$ ), and from (61), $f^{\\varepsilon} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{2}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right)$. Since $L^{2} \\hookrightarrow H^{-1}$ compactly, and $H^{-1} \\subset H^{-2}$, by the Aubin-Lions Lemma, $\\left\\{f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\}_{\\varepsilon} \\subset C\\left([0, T) ; H^{-1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right)$ compactly. All the above implies that there exists a subsequence $f^{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\rightharpoonup f$ weakly in $L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}\\right)$ and strongly in $C\\left([0, T) ; H^{-1}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right)$. Thus, the limiting function belongs to\n\n$$\nf \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{\\infty} \\cap L_{2}^{1}\\right) \\cap C\\left([0, T) ; \\mathcal{D}^{\\prime}\\left(\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nas required in Definition 2.8 .\n3.2. Averaging Lemma. In order to show that the limiting function is indeed a weak solution of (1) we need extra compactness provided by the the classical averaging lemma. To apply it let us make a few preparations. We can rewrite (55) as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} f^{\\varepsilon}+v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} f^{\\varepsilon}=\\Delta_{v}\\left(g_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)+\\nabla_{v} \\cdot g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\ng_{1}^{\\varepsilon}=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho^{(\\varepsilon)}} f^{\\varepsilon}, \\quad g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}=v f^{\\varepsilon}+\\mathrm{w}^{\\varepsilon} f^{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nFrom (61) it is clear that $g_{1}^{\\varepsilon} \\in L_{t, x, v}^{2}$ uniformly on any time interval $[0, T]$. As to $g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left\\|g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{t, v}^{2}}^{2} \\leqslant\\left\\|f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\left\\|f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{2}^{2}}+\\left\\|f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left|w^{\\varepsilon}\\right|^{2} \\rho^{\\varepsilon} \\mathrm{~d} x \\leqslant C_{T}\n$$\n\nWe conclude that all the $g$-functions are uniformly bounded in $\\varepsilon$ in the space $L_{t, x, v}^{2}$.\n\nSince $f^{\\varepsilon}$ solves the Cauchy problem, let us fix a time-cutoff function $h \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}(0, T)$, and rewrite (63) as follows\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t}\\left(h f^{\\varepsilon}\\right)+v \\cdot \\nabla_{x}\\left(h f^{\\varepsilon}\\right)=\\Delta_{v}\\left(h g_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)+\\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(h g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)+g_{3}^{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nwhere $g_{3}^{\\varepsilon}=f^{\\varepsilon} \\partial_{t} h$. Now, $h f^{\\varepsilon}$ solves the equation on the entire time line $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $\\psi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(B_{R}\\right)$, and denote\n\n$$\n\\rho_{\\psi}^{\\varepsilon}(t, x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\psi(v) f^{\\varepsilon}(t, x, v) \\mathrm{d} v\n$$\n\nThen by the classical averaging lemma, see for example [Gla96, Theorem 7.2.1], we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|h \\rho_{\\psi}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{H_{1, \\kappa}^{1, \\kappa}} \\leqslant C_{R}\\left(\\left\\|h f^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{t, x, v}^{2}}+\\left\\|h g_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{t, x, v}^{2}}+\\left\\|h g_{2}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{t, x, v}^{2}}+\\left\\|h g_{3}^{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L_{t, x, v}^{2}}\\right) \\leqslant C\n$$\n\nLet us recall that for a sequence $\\varepsilon_{n} \\rightarrow 0$ we already have $f^{\\varepsilon_{n}} \\rightarrow f$ weakly. By compactness of embedding $H_{0}^{1 / 6}([0, T] \\times \\Omega) \\hookrightarrow L^{2}$ and uniqueness of the limit all the macroscopic quantities at hand converge in $L^{2}$-metric.

Obtaining a weak solution. Let us now demonstrate that $f$ is a weak solution on $[0, T) \\times \\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By approximation we can assume that a test function $\\varphi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) \\times \\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ is given by $\\varphi=\\chi(t, x) \\psi(v)$. Plugging it into (35) we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_{\\psi}^{n}(t, x) \\partial_{t} \\chi(t, x) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{~d} t+\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_{\\psi}^{n}(0, x) \\chi(0, x) \\mathrm{d} x+\\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega} \\rho_{\\psi \\psi}^{n}(t, x) \\cdot \\nabla_{x} \\chi(t, x) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{~d} t \\\\\n= & -\\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{s}^{n}(x) \\rho_{\\Delta_{v} \\psi}^{n}(t, x) \\chi(t, x) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{~d} t+\\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{s}^{n}(x) \\rho_{\\psi}^{n} \\nabla_{\\psi}(t, x) \\chi(t, x) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{~d} t \\\\\n& -\\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{w}^{n} \\cdot \\rho_{\\nabla \\psi}^{n}(t, x) \\chi(t, x) \\mathrm{d} x \\mathrm{~d} t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nConvergence of the left hand side is trivial. Let us focus on the right hand side. The first two terms on the right hand side are similar, so let us address the first one only. Here we use convergence (68), and hence by (17), $\\left\\|\\mathrm{s}^{n}-\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\rightarrow 0$. We also have by the averaging lemma, $\\left\\|\\rho_{\\Delta_{v} \\psi}^{n}(t, x)-\\rho_{\\Delta_{v} \\psi}\\right\\|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$.

Energy law. We now focus on establishing entropy equality for weak solutions. It is worth noting that obtaining such equality from the weak limit of the approximating sequence $f^{\\varepsilon}$ is fruitless because the relative entropy and Fisher functionals are only lower-semicontinuous. So, such approach would only prove an inequality. Instead, we work directly with the weak formulation, which we can state including a terminal time $t$ by the distributional continuity:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\varphi(t, x, v) f(t, x, v) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x- & \\int_{0}^{T} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\partial_{t} \\varphi f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} t-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\varphi(0, x, v) f_{0} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} \\varphi f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} f \\Delta_{v} \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& -\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(v-[u]_{\\rho}\\right) f \\cdot \\nabla_{v} \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe first establish the energy equality, where the time derivative is distributional\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} \\underline{\\underline{\\mathcal{e}}}=-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(v \\cdot \\nabla_{v} f+|v|^{2} f\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+(\\mathrm{w}, u)_{\\rho}\n$$\n\nThis is done by testing (76) with $\\frac{1}{2}|v|^{2} \\psi(v / R)$, where $\\psi$ is a smooth cut-off function supported on $|v|<1$ and $=1$ on $|v|<1 / 2$. We obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} \\psi(v / R) f(t, x, v) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x & -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}|v|^{2} \\psi(v / R) f_{0} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n= & -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} f \\cdot \\nabla_{v}\\left(|v|^{2} \\psi(v / R)\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(v-[u]_{\\rho}\\right) f \\cdot \\nabla_{v}\\left(|v|^{2} \\psi(v / R)\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nClearly, the right hand side of the identity converges to $\\mathcal{E}(t)-\\mathcal{E}(0)$. The next term on the left hand side is equal to\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} f \\cdot v \\psi(v / R) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} t+\\frac{1}{R} \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}|v|^{2} \\nabla_{v} f \\cdot \\nabla \\psi(v / R) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} t=I(R)+I I(R)\n$$\n\nLet us observe that by the H\u00f6lder inequality\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f \\cdot v\\right| \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\leqslant \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|}{\\sqrt{f}}|v| \\sqrt{f} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\leqslant \\sqrt{S} \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f} \\mathrm{~d} s \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathcal{E} \\mathrm{~d} s\n$$\n\nand so the integral is finite.

A similar computation shows that $I I(R)$ is bounded by the same integral but evaluated over the band $\\left\\{\\frac{R}{2}<|v|<R\\right\\}$, implying that $I I(R) \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nWe thus have established the energy equality in the integral form, which implies (77) as desired.\n3.6. Renormalization. To derive the remaining part of the entropy law related to the equation of the Boltzmann entropy $f \\log f$, and for the future proof of propagation of higher momenta, we show that all weak solutions to (1) are automatically renormalized in the sense of DiPerna-Lions, [DL89]. We start with a smooth version of renormalization, and then progress to include moderately singular functions of $f$ such that $f \\log f$, see\n\nProposition 3.1. Let $f$ be a weak solution to (1) in the regularity class (36). Let $G \\in C_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ be an arbitrary function. Then $G(f)$ satisfies the renormalized equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} G(f)+v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} G(f)=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\nabla_{v} G(f)+v f G^{\\prime}(f)\\right)-\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} f \\cdot\\left(\\nabla_{v} f+v f\\right) G^{\\prime \\prime}(f)-\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho} \\cdot \\nabla_{v} G(f)\n$$\n\nin the weak sense.\nProof. Note that since $f \\in L^{\\infty}, G(f)$ accesses only a limited support of $G$, and so $G(f)$ has the same regularity as $f$.\n\nWe introduce a special mollification of the equation with the use of the thickness function $\\theta=\\theta(\\rho, x)$ in a manner similar to Favre filtration. We call it $\\theta$-renormalization of (1). The reason behind it is that paring with thickness gives our test-function access to the weighted Fisher information and integrability of $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} \\sqrt{f}\\right|^{2}$, as opposed to simply $f$. This access is necessary to control the diffusion term.\n\nSo, let us fix two small parameters $\\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{2}>0$ and fix the standard time-independent mollifier $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}$. Denoting $g_{\\varepsilon}=g * \\chi_{\\varepsilon}$ we consider the following filtered equation, which holds in the distributional sense,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t}\\left[\\frac{(\\theta f)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right]+\\frac{\\left(\\theta v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} f\\right)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}=\\frac{\\left(\\theta \\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\Delta_{v} f\\right)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}+\\frac{\\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\theta \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} v f\\right)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} & \\\\\n& -\\frac{\\nabla_{v} \\cdot(\\theta \\mathrm{w} f)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}+\\frac{\\left(f \\partial_{t} \\theta\\right)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}-\\frac{(\\theta f)_{\\varepsilon_{1}} \\partial_{t} \\theta}{\\left[\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}\\right]^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet us fix a smooth function $\\varphi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) \\times \\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ and test the equation with $\\varphi G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{\\varepsilon_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right)$ :\n\nWe now test (80) against $G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right)$, and integrate in time:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times\\{t\\}} G\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times\\{0\\}} G\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times\\{t\\}} G\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\partial_{t} \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n= & -\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\left(\\theta v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} f\\right)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\left(\\theta s_{\\rho} \\Delta_{v} f\\right)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n+ & \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\theta \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} v f\\right)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s-\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\frac{\\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\theta \\mathrm{w}_{\\rho} f\\right)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n+ & \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left[\\frac{\\left(f \\partial_{t} \\theta\\right)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}-\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}} \\partial_{t} \\theta}{\\left[\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}\\right]^{2}}\\right] G^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s:=-I+I I+I I I-I V+V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet us note that $\\theta$ satisfies the mollified continuity equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\theta=-(u \\rho) * \\nabla \\chi_{r_{0}}\n$$\n\nand so,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\partial_{t} \\theta\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\lesssim\\|u\\|_{L_{\\rho}^{2}} \\lesssim C\n$$\n\nIn what follows we will be taking consecutive limits as $\\varepsilon_{1} \\rightarrow 0$ and then $\\varepsilon_{2} \\rightarrow 0$.\nThe left hand side converges to its natural limit since $G$ is smooth and $\\frac{(\\theta f)_{z_{1}}}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} \\rightarrow \\frac{\\theta f}{\\theta+\\varepsilon_{2}} \\rightarrow f$ pointwise almost everywhere.

Let us note that Proposition 3.1 has been proved for any weak solution in the regularity class (36) with no association to the macroscopic quantities $u, \\rho$.

Weak maximum principle and Proposition 2.11. Let us explore properties of a super-solution to (1), i.e. an $f$ satisfying (92) in regularity class (36). Then as we noted above $G(f)$ would define a supersolution for any increasing smooth $G$. Denote $f_{-}=-\\min \\{f, 0\\}$ and $f_{+}=\\max \\{f, 0\\}$. We intend to show that $f_{+}$is another super-solution and $f_{-}$is a sub-solution. Since $\\nabla_{v} f \\in L_{\\text {loc }}^{2}\\left(\\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}>0\\right)$, by the classical result [?], we have $\\nabla_{v} f_{+}=\\nabla_{v} f \\mathbb{1}_{f \\geqslant 0}$ a.e. on the set $\\left\\{\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}>0\\right\\}$, while on $\\left\\{\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}=0\\right\\}$ all the relevant integrals vanish. To approximate $f_{+}$we consider an approximating sequence of $C^{\\infty}$ function $G_{\\varepsilon}$ so that $G_{\\varepsilon}(x)=0$ for $x \\leqslant 0$, $G_{\\varepsilon}(x)=x$, for $x>\\varepsilon, G_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime} \\geqslant 0$, and so that $G_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime \\prime} \\geqslant 0$ and $x G_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime \\prime}(x) \\rightarrow 0$ pointwise and boundedly. For any test function $\\varphi \\in W^{1, \\infty}$ we have the corresponding inequality in (93). Then we can pass to the limit classically in all integrals involving $G_{\\varepsilon}(f)$. Next, $\\left(\\nabla_{v} f+v f\\right) G_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime}(f) \\rightarrow\\left(\\nabla_{v} f_{+}+v f_{+}\\right)$pointwise with a common dominant, so we have convergence\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(\\nabla_{v} G_{\\varepsilon}(f)+v f G_{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime}(f)\\right) \\nabla_{v} \\cdot \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\rightarrow-\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(\\nabla_{v} f_{+}+v f_{+}\\right) \\nabla_{v} \\cdot \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\n$$\n\nNext,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} f \\cdot\\left(\\nabla_{v} f+v f\\right) G_{e}^{\\prime \\prime}(f) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\\right| & \\leqslant \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f} f G_{e}^{\\prime \\prime}(f) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right||v| f G_{e}^{\\prime \\prime}(f) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nby the dominated convergence since $f G_{e}^{\\prime \\prime}(f) \\rightarrow 0$ pointwise boundedly, and $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2}}{f}$ and $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right||v|$ are in $L^{1}$ and dominate the corresponding sequences.\n\nSimilar arguments will work for solutions and sub-solutions. We summarize them in the following statement.\n\nLemma 3.5. If $f$ is a weak solution to (1) in the regularity class (36), then so are $f_{+}, f_{-},|f|$. If $f$ is a super-solution then so is $f_{+}$, while $f_{-}$is a sub-solution. All such solutions are automatically renormalized for increasing $G$ 's.\n\nWe now prove a weak maximum principle in parabolic domains with \"thick\" Dirichlet boundary condition. The issue with weak solutions is their limited regularity which does not provide a way of defining traces on hypersurfaces. However, we can provide boundary conditions on an open neighborhood of a boundary.\n\nLet us fix a bounded subdomain $\\Omega_{0} \\subset \\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with smooth boundary, and let us assume that $\\Omega_{t}, 0<t<T$ is a family of bounded subdomains with smooth boundaries such that $\\mathcal{D}=\\left\\{(x, t): x \\in \\Omega_{t}, 0 \\leqslant t<T\\right\\}$ is a parabolic domain with smooth boundary as well. We denote $\\partial \\mathcal{D}=\\Omega_{0} \\times\\{0\\} \\cup\\left\\{(x, t): x \\in \\partial \\Omega_{t}, 0 \\leqslant t<T\\right\\}$, the parabolic boundary.\n\nLemma 3.6. Suppose $f$ is a weak super-solution to (1) in the regularity class (36) such that there exists an relatively open neighborhood $U \\subset \\mathcal{D}$ of $\\partial \\mathcal{D}$ such that $f \\geqslant 0$ almost everywhere on $U$. Then $f \\geqslant 0$ almost everywhere on $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nNote that this maximum principe works regardless of whether the diffusion coefficient $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho}$ is degenerate or not. The reason is that even for the transport equation it would work by solving along the characteristics if the boundary condition is kept at 0 .\n\nProof. Let us consider $f_{-}$as a sub-solution to (1). We know that $f_{-}=0$ on $U$. Let us consider a smooth cutoff function $\\varphi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{D})$ with $\\varphi=1$ on $\\mathcal{D} \\backslash U$. Since $f_{-}$is also renormalized let us use $G=x^{2}$ and $\\varphi$ as a test-function. We obtain from (93), noting that $\\varphi=1$ on the support of $f_{-}$inside $\\mathcal{D}$, and that $f_{-}(0) \\varphi=0$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega_{t}} f_{-}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x & =\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega_{x}} f_{-}^{2} \\partial_{s} \\varphi \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-2 \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega_{x}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(\\left|\\nabla_{v} f_{-}\\right|^{2}+\\nabla_{v} f_{-} \\cdot v f_{-}\\right) \\varphi \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega_{x}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left(-\\left|\\nabla_{v} f_{-}\\right|^{2}+|v|^{2} f_{-}^{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& \\leqslant C \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega_{x}} f_{-}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nGr\u00f6nwall's Lemma applies to $\\int_{\\Omega_{t}} f_{-}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x$ to prove that it vanishes.\nWe now make remarks about the extension of Proposition 2.11 as stated to the class of weak solutions. In fact the proof presented in [Shv24a] goes ad verbatim as it relies mostly on weak formulation and makes use of the weak Harnack inequality proved in [GI23] for weak solutions as well. Let us bring the attention to [Shv24a, Lemma 7.8] which is the only spot in the proof relying on the classical comparison principle for strong solutions.

We rely on the fact that $f$ is a super-solution of (1), and for a properly chosen $A>0$, the barrier function\n\n$$\n\\chi(t, x, v)=-A t+\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{|x-t v|^{2}}{r^{2}}-\\frac{|v|^{2}}{R^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis a (classical) sub-solution to (1) for $t<t_{1}$. This makes $f-\\chi$ a weak super-solution to (1).\nNow, define $\\Omega_{t}=\\left\\{\\frac{|x-t v|^{2}}{r^{2}}+\\frac{|v|^{2}}{R^{2}} \\leqslant \\frac{1}{4}\\right\\}$, and stack them up into $\\mathcal{D}$ as above for $t<t_{1}$. From the initial data (98) we gather that $f-\\chi \\geqslant 0$ on $(x, v) \\in \\Omega_{t}$, for $t<\\tau$. At the same time, $\\chi=-A t$ on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega_{t}$. So, for $t>\\tau / 2$, there is an open neighborhood of $\\partial \\Omega_{t}$ on which still $\\chi<0$. On that neighborhood we trivially have $f-\\chi>0$. Lemma 3.6 implies $f-\\chi \\geqslant 0$ on $\\mathcal{D}$ and this proves the needed bound from below.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. Propagation of moments and uniqueness \n\nIn this section we address propagation of moments from initial condition. We start by providing justification for the last claim in Theorem 2.10.\n\nWe know that the approximate sequence $f^{n}$ is regular and decays with any polynomial rate. So, we can test the equation (55) with $\\langle v\\rangle^{q}$ and justify all the computations classically.

We thus conclude that $f^{n} \\in L^{\\infty} L_{q}^{1}$ uniformly, and in the limit obtain a solution in the same class.\n\nWe will make use of tapered moments as a way to approach a priori unbounded true moments. We consider\n\n$$\n\\omega_{q, R}(v)=\\langle v\\rangle^{q}\\langle v / R\\rangle^{-Q}, \\quad R>1, Q>q+n+1\n$$\n\nThe important feature of this particular tapered moment is that it controls its higher weighted gradients, it's hierarchial-in- $q$, and it has doubling property, all independent of $R$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left(1+|v|^{k}\\right)\\left|\\nabla_{v}^{k} \\omega_{q, R}(v)\\right| \\leqslant C_{k} \\omega_{q, R}(v), \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\\\\n\\left|\\nabla_{v}^{k} \\omega_{q, R}(v)\\right| \\leqslant C_{k} \\omega_{q-k, R}(v), \\quad k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\\\\nc \\leqslant \\frac{\\omega_{q, R}\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\omega_{q, R}\\left(v^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)} \\leqslant C, \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\leqslant \\frac{\\left|v^{\\prime}\\right|}{\\left|v^{\\prime \\prime}\\right|} \\leqslant 2\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nIn order to address the uniqueness we first need to show that the initial momentum $L_{q}^{2}$ is propagated in time for a given solution. This can be done under the assumption that the weighted averages $\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}$ remain bounded. This result is radically different from the one we obtained above in that we cannot rely on an a priori decay of the solution $f$ in $v$. So, instead, the proof is centered around working again with the $\\theta$-renormalization (80) and employing properly tapered weights.\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a regular model. Then any weak solution in the class (36) with bounded $\\mathrm{w} \\in L_{t, v}^{\\infty}$ and with initial condition $f_{0} \\in L_{q}^{p}$, for $1 \\leqslant p<\\infty, q>0$, will propagate its moment, $f \\in L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L_{q}^{p}\\right)$. Moreover, for $p>1$, any such solution will belong to the class $s_{p}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2} f^{p-2} \\in L^{1}\\left([0, T) ; L_{q}^{1}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Before we begin we make one observation. Since weak solution in the class stated in (36) have integrability of $\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho} \\nabla_{v} f$ one can move one derivate from $\\Delta_{v} \\phi$ in the definition of weak solutions (35) back on $f$. Then since all the remaining test function appear in derivative of first order against integrable functions, by elementary approximation, the equation (35) extends to locally Lipschitz bounded test functions. By this observation we can test with an algebraically decaying in $v$ functions.\n\nSo, we will start from the renormalization (93) with $G=x^{p}$, and $\\varphi=\\omega_{q, R}$. Note that these $G, \\varphi$ satisfy the conditions of Proposition 3.4. Denote\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{m}_{p, q, R}=\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\omega_{q, R} f^{p} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x\n$$\n\nWe obtain from (93), and the boundedness of $\\mathrm{w}_{\\rho}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{m}_{p, q, R}(t)-\\mathrm{m}_{p, q, R}(0)= & \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} f^{p} \\Delta_{v} \\omega_{q, R} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s-p \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} f^{p} v \\cdot \\nabla_{v} \\omega_{q, R} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& -p(p-1) \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2} f^{p-2} \\omega_{q, R} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& +(p-1) \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho} f^{p} \\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(v \\omega_{q, R}\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} f^{p} \\mathrm{w}_{\\rho} \\cdot \\nabla_{v} \\omega_{q, R} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n& \\lesssim \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathrm{~m}_{p, q, R} \\mathrm{~d} s-p(p-1) \\int_{0}^{t} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~s}_{\\rho}\\left|\\nabla_{v} f\\right|^{2} f^{p-2} \\omega_{q, R} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIgnoring the dissipation term for a moment we obtain by the Gr\u00f6nwall's Lemma, $\\mathrm{m}_{p, q, R}(t) \\leqslant \\mathrm{m}_{p, q, R}(0) e^{c t}$.

As a consequence of (81), $\\theta\\left(\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}, \\Omega\\right) \\geqslant c_{0} / 2$ on some interval of time $\\left[0, t^{*}\\right)$. If uniqueness is proved on $\\left[0, t^{*}\\right)$, then by continuation, we cover the entire interval $[0, T)$. So, we can assume that both solutions are thick. Then, thanks to the regularity of the model, the strengths $\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{s}_{\\rho^{\\prime}}, \\mathrm{s}^{\\prime \\prime}=s_{\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}}$ remains $C^{\\infty}$ and bounded from below, and the kernels $\\phi^{\\prime}, \\phi^{\\prime \\prime}$ are also $C_{x, y}^{\\infty}$. Then the condition $\\mathrm{w}^{\\prime}, \\mathrm{w}^{\\prime \\prime} \\in L^{\\infty}$ is trivially satisfied and Theorem 4.1 applies to show the $L_{q}^{2}$-moment propagation for both solutions as well as $\\nabla_{v} f, \\nabla_{v} f^{\\prime \\prime} \\in L_{t, x, v}^{2}$. The proof of Theorem 4.1 also applies to the difference of solutions $g=f^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime \\prime}$ (in fact it is not even necessary to $\\theta$-renormalize the equation for thick solutions). So, the formal computations below are justified.\n\nFor notational brevity we relabel $q \\rightarrow q+2$, and assume that $q \\geqslant n+2$, while the $(q+2)$-moments are bounded.\n\nWe have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t}\\|g\\|_{L_{q}^{2}}^{2}= & -\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} s^{\\prime}\\left|\\nabla_{v} g\\right|^{2}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} s^{\\prime} g \\nabla_{v} g \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& -\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\nabla_{v} f^{\\prime \\prime} \\cdot \\nabla_{v} g\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\nabla_{v} f^{\\prime \\prime} g \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} s^{\\prime} v g^{2} \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& -\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) v f^{\\prime \\prime} \\nabla_{v} g\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\mathrm{~s}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{s}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) v f^{\\prime \\prime} g \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& -\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{w}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} g^{2} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x-\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\mathrm{w}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{w}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\cdot \\nabla_{v} f^{\\prime \\prime} g\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term gives diffusion supported from below $c \\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left|\\nabla_{v} g\\right|^{2}\\langle v\\rangle^{q} \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x$.

Once $f$ is regular, we perform a priori estimates and obtain the required bound independent of the regularity of the initial condition.\n\nThe proof is in the spirit of global hypoellipticity methods summarized for the classical Fokker-Planck case, for example, in [Vil09]. The advantage of this method, as opposed to local methods such as Di Giorgi, is that it puts the solution directly into a weighted space, thus controlling the growth of derivatives by design. Such control is crucial for the relaxation analysis in particular.\n\nAs one can see from the definition of the Sobolev space, the control over higher order derivatives deteriorates, and in fact for $2 m>q$, they may grow to infinity at large $v$.

Weak solutions to (103) are unique in class $L^{\\infty}\\left([0, T) ; L^{1} \\cap L^{2}\\right) \\cap C\\left([0, T) ; \\mathcal{D}^{\\prime}\\right)$, and for any two solutions $f, g$ one has\n\n$$\n\\sup _{t \\in T}\\|f-g\\|_{2} \\leqslant C_{T}\\left\\|f_{0}-g_{0}\\right\\|_{2}\n$$\n\nIn order to prove Theorem 5.1 it would be convenient to know a priori that $f$ is already smooth just so we can differentiate the right hand side of the equation. To do that we need to have an approximated sequence of smooth solutions and ensure that the estimates on that sequence obey the bound (107) independent of approximation parameter. So, let us consider a sequence of smoothed and compactly supported initial data $f_{0}^{(n)} \\rightarrow f_{0}$ in $L^{1} \\cap L^{2}$. For such data the equation (103) is globally well-posed in any $H_{q}^{m}$-space. This follows from the standard analysis. Indeed, the regularized equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} f+v \\cdot \\nabla_{x} f=\\nabla_{v}\\left(\\mathrm{~A} \\nabla_{v} f\\right)+\\frac{1}{R} \\Delta_{x} f+\\nabla_{v} \\cdot\\left(\\omega_{0, R} \\mathrm{~b} f\\right)\n$$\n\nis a generator of an analytic $C_{0}$-semigroup in any classical $H^{*}$-space, and solutions from compactly supported data decay at infinity exponentially fast as follows from the bounds on the Green's function, see for example [Kry96]. Thus, the solutions will remain in any $H_{Q}^{M}$ at all times. The fact that they remain in $H_{Q}^{M}$ uniformly in $R$ on any finite time interval $[0, T)$ will follow from our Sobolev estimate (114) performed similarly on (112). The classical compactness argument produces a solution to (103) in the class $f^{(n)} \\in L^{\\infty} H_{Q}^{M}, \\nabla_{v} f^{(n)} \\in L^{2} H_{Q}^{M}$ on any $[0, T)$. If we prove (107) uniformly in $n$, i.e. independent of regularity of the initial data, then by the contraction bound (111), $f^{(n)} \\rightarrow f$ in $L^{2}$, and by weak lower semi-continuity $\\|f\\|_{H_{q}^{\\infty}} \\leqslant \\liminf _{n}\\left\\|f^{(n)}\\right\\|_{H_{q}^{\\infty}}$, and Theorem 5.1 would be proved.\n\nIn conclusion, while proving Theorem 5.1 we can assume a priori that the solution belongs to $f \\in H_{Q}^{M}$, for $M \\gg m$ and $Q \\gg q$.\n\nProof of Theorem 5.1. By the above reasoning, we can formally assume that $f \\in H_{Q}^{M}$, for $M \\gg m$ and $Q \\gg q$, so that all the estimates below are justified.\n\nLet us introduce the dissipation terms\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}_{q}^{k, l}=\\mathrm{h}_{q}^{k, l+1}, \\quad \\mathrm{~d}=\\sum_{2 k+l \\leqslant 2 m} \\mathrm{~d}_{q-2 k-l}^{k, l}\n$$\n\nIn what follows, all the constants $c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots$ depend only on the regularity of $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{b}$.\nLemma 5.4.

We start by observing that the total contribution of the $x$-transport term in the equation for $\\mathrm{m}_{q-2 k}^{k}$ is the negative term $-\\mathrm{h}_{q-2 k}^{k, 0}$. The contribution of the dissipation and the b -drift will be denoted $D_{k, q}$ and $B_{k, q}$, respectively:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathrm{m}}_{q-2 k}^{k}=-\\mathrm{h}_{q-2 k}^{k, 0}+D_{k, q}+B_{k, q}\n$$\n\nThus, summing over $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant m$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathrm{m}}=-\\mathrm{x}+D+B\n$$\n\nThe rest of the proof is devoted to estimating the remainder terms $D, B$.\nSo, we fix $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant m$, and start with the dissipation term\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{k, q} & =\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\langle v\\rangle^{q-2 k} \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}}\\left(\\mathrm{A} \\nabla_{v} f\\right) \\cdot \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}-1} \\partial_{v} \\nabla_{v} f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q-2 k} \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}}\\left(\\mathrm{A} \\nabla_{v} f\\right) \\cdot \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}-1} \\partial_{v} f \\mathrm{~d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\nabla_{v}\\langle v\\rangle^{q-2 k} \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}} f \\cdot \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}-1} \\partial_{v}\\left(\\mathrm{~A} \\nabla_{v} f\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x+\\int_{\\Omega \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\langle v\\rangle^{q-2 k} \\nabla_{v} \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}} f \\cdot \\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}-1} \\partial_{v}\\left(\\mathrm{~A} \\nabla_{v} f\\right) \\mathrm{d} v \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& :=D^{1}+D^{2}+D^{3}+D^{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn $D^{1}$, the second integrand $\\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}-1} \\partial_{v} \\nabla_{v} f$ has the indexing $2(k-1)+2=2 k$, which is consistent with the power of the weight. So, expanding the $\\partial_{x}^{\\mathbf{k}}$ partials in the first integrant, we naturally single out the all-on- $f$ term $\\mathrm{A} \\nabla_{v} \\partial_{x}^{\\mathrm{k}} f$, which results in a bound $\\left(\\mathrm{d}_{q-2 k}^{k, 0}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\mathrm{v}^{1 / 2} \\leqslant \\mathrm{~d}^{1 / 2} \\mathrm{v}^{1 / 2}$.

The main\nfeature of these results, as opposed to previously known ones, is the lack of\nregularity or no-vacuum requirements on the initial data. With a particular\napplication to the classical kinetic Cucker-Smale model, we demonstrate that\nany bounded data with finite energy, $(1+ |v|^2) f_0 \\in L^1$, $f_0 \\in\nL^\\infty$, and finite higher moment $|v|^q f\\in L^2$, $q \\gg 2$, gives rise to\na global instantly smooth solution, satisfying entropy equality and relaxing\nexponentially fast.\n  The results are achieved through the use of a new thickness-based\nrenormalization, which circumvents the problem of degenerate diffusion in\nnon-perturbative regime.", "updated": "2025-04-19T19:24:37Z", "published": "2024-12-28T23:06:09Z"}
