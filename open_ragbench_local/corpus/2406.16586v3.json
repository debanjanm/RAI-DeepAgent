      "text": "## INTRODUCTION\n\nFields with extra structure are an important object of study in model theory. Classical examples of such theories are the theory of differentially closed fields in characteristic 0 (see [6],[18]), the theory of algebraically closed fields with an automorphism [9], the theory of beautiful pairs of algebraically closed fields in a fixed characteristic [23] or the theory of separably closed fields in a given characteristic and of a fixed degree of imperfection [11].\n\nOften, such theories can be treated in a uniform way (see e.g. [3]) due to the fact that they are either obtained from an algebraically closed field by adding new symbols (e.g. a derivation, a predicate) or their models embed into an algebraically closed field (e.g. separably closed fields). Concepts such as non-forking independence or model theoretic algebraic closure can then be described in terms of the stable theory $T_{0}$ of algebraically closed fields.\n\nIn a broader context, not exclusively considering theories of fields, the present note follows the approach of [3]: Throughout the work we consider an $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ such that the models of $T$ embed into models of a stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ where $\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\subset \\mathcal{L}$ and $T_{0}$ has elimination of quantifiers and imaginaries. In Section 1, we first introduce this setting and then define properties of $T$ with respect to $T_{0}$ that allow to deduce stationarity of types over algebraically closed sets in the home sort (i.e. real algebraically closed sets) in $T$ from stationarity in $T_{0}$. Our approach applies in particular to classical examples (see Section 2), which yields the following results (see Theorem 1.10, Corollary 2.3 and Corollary 2.6):\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Date: April 10, 2025.\n    2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 2010: 03C45.\n    Key words and phrases. Stability, Stationarity, Imaginaries, Pairs, Separably Closed Fields.\n\nMain Theorem. Given a stable $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ controlled by the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (see Definition 1.8), types in $T$ over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nIn particular, types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary in the theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection. The same is true for the theory $T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs of a stable nfcp theory $T_{0}$ whenever $T_{0}$ has elimination of quantifiers as well as elimination of imaginaries.\n\nWe present the application of the theorem to the examples mentioned above in Section 2. After proving the result, we realized that stationarity of types in separably closed fields already follows from work of Krupi\u0144ski [15]. Yet, we believe that the general theorem contains some interesting ideas.\n\nWe will state without proof all the properties used for our examples in Section 2. The reader is referred to [12] for further explanation on the theory of separably closed fields and to [23] as well as [1] for material on beautiful pairs.\n\nThe second part of this note links the results to non-elimination of imaginaries. In stable theories, weak elimination of imaginaries implies stationarity of types over real algebraically closed sets. Delon proved in [11] that the theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ does not have elimination of imaginaries. Moreover, Messmer and Wood showed the same result for $D C F_{p}$ in [19]. By a result of Pillay and Vassiliev in [22], the theory of pairs does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries if an infinite group is definable in $T_{0}$.\n\nMotivated by Delon's proof and by the proof of Messmer and Wood, we formulate two variants of a general criterion that yield the failure of geometric elimination of imaginaries in an arbitrary simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $T_{0}^{\\varphi} \\subset T$ for a stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$, even after naming the elements of a model of $T$. More precisely, we assume the existence of two new $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subgroups $H_{2} \\leq H_{1}$ of an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group $G$. The $\\mathcal{L}$-definable groups $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ can be considered in a model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of $T_{0}$ as (possibly non-definable) subgroups of the stable group $G$. Wagner's results on definable hulls in stable groups from [27] enable us to deduce in Proposition 4.3 and 4.4 that imaginaries representing certain cosets of $H_{2}$ in $H_{1}$ cannot be geometrically eliminated.\n\nWe state below a customized version of Proposition 4.4 with $H_{1}=G(M)$ :\nProposition. Let $(G, \\cdot)$ be an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group in the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$. Given a simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $T_{0}^{\\varphi} \\subset T$ satisfying Property ( $\\left.\\approx\\right)$ (see Section 1), suppose that there is a model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ such that $(G(M), \\cdot)$ is a group in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nAssume further that there exists an $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subgroup $H$ of infinite index in $G(M)$, defined over a a small elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$, and that:\n(1) for every $\\mathcal{L}$-generic $g$ in $G(M)$ over $N$ we have that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$, and (2) the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable hull $\\mathrm{dc}_{G}(H(M))$ of $H(M)$ in $G$ equals $G$.\n\nThen, the theory $T$ does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries, even after adding constants for the model $\\mathcal{N}$ to the language.\n\nWe assume a certain familiarity with stability theory and the general theory of stable groups (see for example [24] or [28]). In Section 3 we will introduce the work of Wagner on definable hulls and the setting in which we use his results. The criterion itself is presented\n\nin Section 4 where we also discuss variants and equivalent formulations. At the end of the section, we show that the criterion applies to the theories mentioned above (beautiful pairs and separably closed fields) and to the new example of separably differentially closed fields (see [14]). We hope that the criterion may provide more examples in the future.\n\nAcknowledgments. Part of this work was done during a research stay in Lyon supported by the ANR GeoMod (ANR-DFG, AAPG2019).

      "text": "# 1. THE SETTING AND STATIONARITY \n\nWe fix a complete stable theory $T_{0}$ in a language $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$ and assume all throughout this article that $T_{0}$ has elimination of quantifiers and elimination of imaginaries. Note that we may always achieve quantifier elimination by a Morleyization and elimination of imaginaries by considering $T_{0}^{e q}$. We will work inside a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of $T_{0}$.\n\nWe now consider a theory $T$ in a language $\\mathcal{L}$ expanding $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$ such that $T_{0}^{\\forall} \\subset T$, or equivalently, such that every model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ embeds (as a structure in the sublanguage $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$ ) into the model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of $T_{0}$. Since $\\mathcal{L}$ is an expansion of $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$, quantifier elimination yields that the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-type of a tuple $\\bar{m}$ in $M$ (seen as a tuple in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ ) is completely determined by its quantifier-free type inside the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-substructure $\\mathcal{M}$, and in particular by its $\\mathcal{L}$-type in $\\mathcal{M}$. It follows immediately that the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable and algebraic closures of subsets of $\\mathcal{M}$ do not depend on the embedding into a model of $T_{0}$.\n\nFrom now on, we consider a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}$ of the theory $T$ inside $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$. If not explicitly stated otherwise, all tuples and subsets will be taken in $\\mathcal{M}$. If we want to refer to their properties with respect to the theory $T_{0}$, we will use the index 0 and otherwise the index $\\mathcal{L}$. For example, we denote by $\\operatorname{dcl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$ (resp. $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(A)$ ) the definable closure in $T$ (resp. in $T_{0}$ ) of a subset $A$.\n\nQuantifier elimination of $T_{0}$ and the above discussion yield the following easy observations:\nRemark 1.1. Consider a subset $A$ as well as tuples $\\bar{b}$ and $\\bar{b}^{\\prime}$.\n(1) If $\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\bar{b} / A)=\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\bar{b}^{\\prime} / A)$ (also denoted as $\\bar{b} \\triangleq_{A} \\bar{b}^{\\prime}$ ), then $\\bar{b} \\triangleq_{A} \\bar{b}^{\\prime}$.\n(2) The $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-substructure $\\langle A\\rangle_{0}$ generated by $A$ is contained in the $\\mathcal{L}$-substructure $\\langle A\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ and hence in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n(3) If $A$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-definably closed, then $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{M}=A$. More generally we have that $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{M} \\subset \\operatorname{dcl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$.\n(4) Similarly, $\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{M} \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$, so $\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{M}=A$ if $A$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed.\n(5) If $T_{0}$ is a reduct of $T$, we have that $\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(A) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$, so $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed subsets are also $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-algebraically closed .\n\nIn Section 2 we will show that types over real algebraically closed sets in certain classical stable theories are stationary. The properties described here do not require $T$ to be stable\n\nand work all under the more general assumption of simplicity. However, the result of Theorem 1.10 will imply $T$ to be stable. For the sake of generality, we will from now on assume that $T$ is simple and denote by $\\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}$ the non-forking independence in $T$, whilst $\\perp^{0}$ denotes non-forking independence in the sense of $T_{0}$.\n\nThe following general property of $T$ with respect to $T_{0}$ will be used several times throughout this work.\n\nProperty ( $\\#$ ). ([3, Hypoth\u00e8se 1]) For every $\\mathcal{L}$-elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$, every element of $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(N)$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-interdefinable with a tuple from $N$.\n\nRemark 1.2. In most of our examples, the theory $T$ will be a theory of fields and $T_{0}$ the theory of algebraically closed fields in characteristic $p$ (for $p$ prime or 0 ). In this case, the definable closure $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(N)$ of a model $\\mathcal{N}$ of $T$ equals the field theoretic inseparable closure. Hence, for any element in $\\operatorname{dcl}_{0}(N)$, a certain $p$-power lies in $N$, so Property ( $\\#$ ) holds.\n\nMoreover, if $T_{0}$ is a reduct of $T$, Property ( $\\#$ ) is clearly satisfied.\nUsing Remark 1.1 (4), Blossier and Martin-Pizarro showed the following:\nFact 1.3. ([3, Remarque 1.7]) Given a simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $T_{0}^{\\forall} \\subset T$ and such that Property ( $\\#$ ) holds, types in $T_{0}$ over $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nTo prove this fact, stability of $T_{0}$ and elimination of imaginaries are crucial since they yield that types in $T_{0}$ over real $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-algebraically closed sets are stationary. In the particular case that $T_{0} \\subset T$, every $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed set $A$ is also $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-algebraically closed (see Remark 1.1 (5)) and thus the fact follows immediately.\n\nRemark 1.4. The following condition (which was first considered by Lascar for models in $[16$, Section 3.1$])$ is equivalent to the stationarity of the type $\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(B / A)$ :\n\nFor every set $C \\supset A$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-elementary maps $f: B \\rightarrow B^{\\prime}$ and $g: C \\rightarrow C^{\\prime}$ such that $f \\upharpoonright_{A}=g \\upharpoonright_{A}$ and $B \\perp^{0}{ }_{A} C$ as well as $B^{\\prime} \\perp^{0}{ }_{f(A)} C^{\\prime}$, the map $f \\cup g: B \\cup C \\rightarrow B^{\\prime} \\cup C^{\\prime}$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-elementary.\n\nBlossier, Martin-Pizarro and Wagner showed in [4, Lemme 2.1] for the case of $T_{0}$ being a reduct of $T$ that non-forking independence in $T$ implies independence in $T_{0}$. With our additional Property ( $\\#$ ), their proof can be easily adapted and yields the following:\n\nFact 1.5. ([4, Lemme 2.1]) Let $T$ be a simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory with $T_{0}^{\\forall} \\subset T$ and such that Property ( $\\#$ ) is satisfied. For all $A=\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$ algebraically closed and $B$ and $C$ arbitrary subsets holds\n\n$$\nB \\perp_{A}^{\\mathcal{L}} C \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B \\perp_{A}^{0} C .\n$$\n\nTo state the other assumptions we need to fix a suitable class of substructures.\nDefinition 1.6. A class $\\mathcal{K}$ of $\\mathcal{L}$-substructures of $\\mathcal{M}$ is called strong if the following property holds: Every $\\mathcal{L}$-isomorphism $f: A \\rightarrow A^{\\prime}$ with $A$ and $A^{\\prime}$ in $\\mathcal{K}$ is elementary (i.e. $A \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=} A^{\\prime}$ ).\n\nThe elements of $\\mathcal{K}$ are called strong substructures.\n\nIn other words, any two substructures from $\\mathcal{K}$ having the same quantifier free $\\mathcal{L}$-type have the same $\\mathcal{L}$-type. If $T$ has quantifier elimination, the class of all substructures is strong. We will discuss in Section 2 other examples of theories, without quantifier elimination, which admit a suitable class of strong substructures.\nRemark 1.7. Suppose that $A$ is a strong substructure of $\\mathcal{M}$ and $f: A \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}$ an embedding with $f(A)$ also strong. Since $f$ is an elementary map, the set $A$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically (or definably) closed if and only if the same holds for $f(A)$.\nDefinition 1.8. The simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ is controlled by the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (which has elimination of imaginaries and quantifiers) with respect to the strong class $\\mathcal{K}$ if the following conditions hold:\n(a) We have $\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\subset \\mathcal{L}$ and $T_{0}^{\\varphi} \\subset T$.\n(b) The theory $T$ satisfies Property $(\\#)$.\n(c) The class $\\mathcal{K}$ contains all $\\mathcal{L}$-definably closed sets.\n(d) For strong subsets $B$ and $C$ such that $A=B \\cap C$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed and $B \\perp_{\\mathcal{L}} C$, (the universe of) the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generated substructure $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}$ coincides with the $\\mathcal{L}$-generated substructure $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ and is strong.\n(e) For $A, B$ and $C$ as in (d), whenever $f:\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}$ is an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-embedding whose restrictions $\\left.f\\right|_{B}$ and $\\left.f\\right|_{C}$ are $\\mathcal{L}$-embeddings, if $f(B), f(C)$ and $f(A)$ are strong with $f(B) \\perp_{\\mathcal{L}_{f(A)}} \\mathcal{L}_{f(C)} f(C)$, then $f$ is an $\\mathcal{L}$-embedding.\nExample 1.9. In the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{R\\}$ consisting of a binary relation symbol, consider the theory $T$ of the random graph (with $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$ the empty language and $T_{0}$ the theory of an infinite set). By quantifier elimination, the class of all substructures is strong and Property $(\\#)$ holds trivially. Moreover, (d) of Definition 1.8 is satisfied since $\\mathcal{L}$ is purely relational.\n\nHowever, types over real algebraically closed sets in $T$ are not stationary: The independence $\\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}$ is given by purely algebraic independence, but the relations between elements of $B$ and $C$ are not determined by the relations within $B$ and $C$. Indeed, by this reasoning (e) of Definition 1.8 is not satisfied.\n\nTheorem 1.10. If the simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ is controlled by the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (see Definition 1.8), then types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nIn particular, types over models of $T$ are stationary and thus $T$ is stable.\nProof. Let $A=\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)$ be a real algebraically closed set and $\\bar{b}$ a tuple in $M$. In order to show that the type $\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\bar{b} / A)$ is stationary, choose $\\bar{b}^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{b}^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=} A \\bar{b}$ and suppose that for some $C \\supset A$ both $\\bar{b} \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{A} C$ and $\\bar{b}^{\\prime} \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{A} C$. We want to conclude $\\bar{b} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=} \\bar{b}^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe may assume that $C$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-definably closed. Set $B=\\operatorname{dcl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\bar{b} A)$ and $B^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{dcl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(\\bar{b}^{\\prime} A)$. From the independence and the $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closedness of $A$ we get\n\n$$\nB \\cap C=A=B^{\\prime} \\cap C\n$$\n\nBy Fact 1.5, we obtain from Property $(\\#)$ the independences $B \\perp_{A}^{0} C$ and $B^{\\prime} \\perp_{A}^{0} C$. The assumption $B \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=}_{A} B^{\\prime}$ yields an $\\mathcal{L}$-Isomorphism $g: B \\rightarrow B^{\\prime}$ fixing $A$. This map $g$ is\n\nin particular an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-Isomorphism and thus an elementary map by quantifier elimination of $T_{0}$.\n\nAs the type $\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(B / A)$ is stationary by Fact 1.3 , we can amalgamate $g$ with $\\operatorname{id}_{C}$ to an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-elementary map $g \\cup \\mathrm{id}_{C}$ from $B \\cup C$ to $B^{\\prime} \\cup C$ (see Remark 1.4). By elementarity, the map $g \\cup \\mathrm{id}_{C}$ extends to an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-isomorphism $f:\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0} \\rightarrow\\left\\langle B^{\\prime}, C\\right\\rangle_{0}$ fixing $C$.\n\nNote that by (d) of Definition 1.8 (using (c)), the substructures $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}$ and $\\left\\langle B^{\\prime}, C\\right\\rangle_{0}$ coincide with the $\\mathcal{L}$-generated ones. Hence, by (e) the map $f$ is an $\\mathcal{L}$-embedding of $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ into $\\mathcal{M}$ with image $\\left\\langle B^{\\prime}, C\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$. Since the $\\mathcal{L}$-substructures $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ and $\\left\\langle B^{\\prime}, C\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ are in the controlling class $\\mathcal{K}$ by (d), the embedding $f$ witnesses that\n\n$$\n\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=}\\left\\langle B^{\\prime}, C\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\bar{b} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=} \\bar{b}^{\\prime}$ as desired.\nNote that if (d) and (e) of Definition 1.8 hold for a certain subclass of algebraically closed substructures $A$, the above proof yields stationarity of types over such sets.",

      "text": "# 2. EXAMPLES \n\nIn this section we will discuss how Theorem 1.10 applies to some classical theories.\nBeautiful pairs. Given a stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$, Poizat considered a proper pair $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime} \\prec \\mathcal{M}$ of models of $T_{0}$, with $M^{\\prime} \\subsetneq M$, in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\cup\\{P\\}$. Such a pair is called $\\kappa$-beautiful (in the terminology of [1]) if $\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}$ is $\\kappa$-saturated and every $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-type over $B M^{\\prime}$, with $B$ a subset of $M$ of size less than $\\kappa$, is realized in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nPoizat proved in [23] that any two $\\left|T_{0}\\right|^{+}$-beautiful pairs are elementary equivalent. Hence, the common theory $T_{0} P$ of such beautiful pairs is complete. If $T_{0}$ does not have the finite cover property, every $\\left|T_{0}\\right|^{+}$-saturated model is a beautiful pair. Moreover, the theory $T_{0} P$ is again stable and without the finite cover property.\n\nWe now assume that $T_{0}$ has elimination of quantifiers as well as elimination of imaginaries but not the finite cover property ( nfcp ). We denote a sufficiently saturated model of $T$ by $(\\mathcal{M}, P(M))$.\n\nFact 2.1. [1, Lemma 3.8] The class $\\mathcal{K}$ of $\\mathcal{L}$-substructures $A$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ with $A \\perp^{0}{ }_{P(A)} P(M)$ is strong. (These strong substructures were called $P$-independent in [1].)\n\nIn [1, Proposition 7.3] Ben-Yaacov, Pillay and Vassiliev gave the following characterization of independence: For strong substructures $A, B$ and $C$ such that $A \\subset B \\cap C$ we have\n\n$$\nB \\perp_{A}^{\\mathcal{L}} C \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad B \\underset{A \\cup P(M)}{ } C \\cup P(M) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B \\perp_{A}^{0} C\n$$\n\nLemma 2.2. The theory $T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs is controlled by $T_{0}$ with respect to the class $\\mathcal{K}$ introduced in Fact 2.1.\n\nProof. We check all the conditions of Definition 1.8. Part (a) is obvious and Property ( $\\pm$ ) holds for the theory $T_{0} P$ by Remark 1.2. Moreover, definably closed subsets are strong by [1, Remark 7.2 (i)].\n\nSince $\\mathcal{L} \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_{0}$ does not contain any new function symbols, it suffices to show for (d) that $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}$ is strong whenever the strong substructures $B$ and $C$ are independent over their intersection. A verbatim adaptation of [2, Lemme 1.2] yields from ( $\\star$ ) that\n\n$$\nB \\cup C \\underset{P(B) \\cup P(C)}{\\perp^{0}} P(M)\n$$\n\nso $\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}$ is strong. Moreover, the above $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-independence implies that\n\n$$\nP\\left(\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}\\right)=P(M) \\cap\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}=\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(P(B), P(C)) \\cap\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}\n$$\n\nsince the right to left inclusion holds by $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-algebraically closedness of $P(M)$.\nIn order to verify (e), we consider strong substructures $B$ and $C$ with $B \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{B C \\mathcal{C}} B$ such that $f(B)$ and $f(C)$ are also strong with $f(B) \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{f(B) \\cap f(C)} f(C)$ where $f$ is an $\\mathcal{L}_{0^{-}}$ embedding $f:\\langle B, C\\rangle_{0}=\\langle B, C\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}$ as in the statement. To show that $f$ is an $\\mathcal{L}$-embedding, it suffices to prove that $f$ respects the predicate $P$. This follows from $(\\diamond)$ (applied to $B$ and $C$ as well as $f(B)$ and $f(C)$ ) since the restrictions $\\left.f\\right|_{B}$ and $\\left.f\\right|_{C}$ witness that $f(P(B))=P(f(B))$ and $f(P(C))=P(f(C))$.\n\nTheorem 1.10 immediately yields:\nCorollary 2.3. In the theory $T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs of $T_{0}$, types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nIn the case of beautiful pairs, our proof of stationarity resonates with the ideas of [1, Proposition 7.5 (c)].\n\nSeparably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection. Recall that a field $K$ is separably closed if $K$ has no proper separable algebraic extensions. We will restrict our attention to fields of prime characteristic $p$. The linear dimension $\\left[K: K^{p}\\right]$ of $K$ over the subfield of $p$-powers is always of the form $p^{e}$ for some natural number $e$ or infinite. The number $e$ resp. $\\infty$ is called the degree of imperfection. Ershov showed in [13] that the class of separably closed fields of characteristic $p$ and fixed degree of imperfection, axiomatized in the ring language, yields a complete stable theory.\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the theory $T=S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\left\\{0,1,+,-, \\cdot,{ }^{-1}\\right\\}$. Note that the function symbol ${ }^{-1}$ in the language ensures that every substructure is a subfield. The theory contains the universal part of the theory $T_{0}=A C F_{p}$ of algebraically closed fields in the language $\\mathcal{L}_{0}=\\mathcal{L}$. Consider a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$.\n\nRecall that an extension $L / K$ of fields is separable if $K$ is linearly disjoint from the subfield of $p$-powers $L^{p}$ over $K^{p}$, denoted by $K \\underset{K^{p}}{\\perp^{l d}} L^{p}$.\nRemark 2.4. The class $\\mathcal{K}$ of $\\mathcal{L}$-substructures $A$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ such that the field extension $M / A$ is separable is strong.\n\nIndeed, the proof of completeness by Ershov in [13] yields a description of types: Given $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ separably closed fields both of characteristic $p$ and the same degree of imperfection and $k_{i} \\subset K_{i}$ subfields such that the extension $K_{i} / k_{i}$ is separable, then $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ have the same type if they are isomorphic as fields (c.f. [26, Theorem p.717]).\n\nThe non-forking independence in separably closed fields was studied by Srour. His result [26, Theorem 13] implies the following characterization for $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ : Given $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ strong subfields such that $k_{0}=k_{1} \\cap k_{2}$ is relatively algebraically closed in $M$,\n\n$$\nk_{1} \\underset{k_{0}}{ } \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{k_{2}} \\Leftrightarrow k_{1} \\underset{k_{0}}{ } k_{2} \\text { and } M /\\left\\langle k_{1}, k_{2}\\right\\rangle_{0} \\text { is separable. }\n$$\n\nRemark 2.5. The theory $T=S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ is controlled by $T_{0}=A C F_{p}$ with respect to $\\mathcal{K}$.\nIndeed, all Conditions of Definition 1.8 are satisfied: Property (\\$) holds by Remark 1.2 and definably closed sets are strong by [26, Lemma 0]. Since $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0}$, (d) follows directly from the characterization of independence in $(\\star \\star)$. Part (e) is again immediate as $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0}$.\n\nCorollary 2.6. In the theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection, types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nIn [15, Proposition 2.2.2.] Krupi\u0144ski showed that the theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ satisfies a weak version of elimination of imaginaries. It already follows implicitly from his result (using [8, Proposition 3.9]) that types over real algebraically closed subsets in $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ are stationary. Our approach however yields a more direct proof.\n\nRemark 2.7. There are two more classical examples to which our results apply: The theory $D C F_{0}$ of differentially closed fields in characteristic 0 in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\cup\\{D\\}$ and the theory $S C F_{p}^{e}$ of separably closed fields of characteristic $p$ and finite degree of imperfection $e$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\cup\\left\\{\\left(c_{i}\\right)_{i<e},\\left(\\lambda_{r}\\right)_{r<p^{e}}\\right\\}$ with constants for a $p$-basis. In both cases, the class of all substructures is strong by quantifier elimination. The other properties are easily verified.\n\nWe do not claim that the stationarity of types over algebraically closed sets is new in these cases, since both theories have elimination of imaginaries.",

      "text": "# 3. DEFINABLE HULLS IN STABLE GROUPS \n\n3.1. General results. In this subsection, we will present some results of Wagner on groups and their subgroups in stable theories. We work in a sufficiently saturated model of a stable theory (with elimination of imaginaries). The results presented below remain valid for type-definable stable groups but for the sake of the presentation, we will assume that ambient model is the universe of a group $(G, \\cdot)$. Moreover, we identify a formula with the corresponding definable subset.\n\nRecall that a definable subset $\\varphi(x, \\bar{a})$ is generic in the stable group $G$ if $G$ is covered by finitely many bi-translates of the form $g^{-1} \\cdot \\varphi(x, \\bar{a}) \\cdot h^{-1}$ with $g$ and $h$ elements of $G$. Since the order property does not hold in stable theories, we always have that either a definable subset or its complement is generic in $G$. This yields the existence of generic types of $G$,\n\ni.e. types that only contain generic formulae. Note that the type $p=\\operatorname{tp}(g / A)$ is generic if $(\\circ)$ for every $h$ in $G$ independent from $g$ the product $g \\cdot h$ is independent from $h$.\n\nThe connected component of $G$, denoted by $G^{0}$, is the intersection of all definable subgroups of finite index. The (left-) stabilizer of a stationary type $p=\\operatorname{tp}(g / A)$ is the set\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(p)=\\{h \\in G \\mid h \\cdot \\mathfrak{p}=\\mathfrak{p}\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{p}$ is the unique global non-forking extension of $p$ and $g \\cdot \\mathfrak{p}$ is given by the natural action of $G$ on the space of types induced by left translation. Using the definability of types in stable theories, the stabilizer of $p$ can be written as the intersection of the definable subgroups\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(p, \\varphi)=\\{g \\in G \\mid \\models \\forall \\bar{z}\\left(d_{p} \\varphi(g x, \\bar{z}) \\leftrightarrow d_{p} \\varphi(x, \\bar{z})\\right)\\}\n$$\n\nA type is generic in $G$ if and only if its stabilizer equals $G^{0}$. We refer the reader to Poizat's volume on stable groups [24] for proofs and details.\nRemark 3.1. In Section 4 we will also consider generic types and stabilizers for groups definable in simple theories. In this case, there is no notion of generic formula but a type is called generic if it satisfies the condition in (o). Since types are not necessarily stationary, the left-stabilizer $\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(p)$ of a type $p$ is defined as the subgroup generated by the set\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{St}(p)=\\{h \\in G \\mid \\exists g \\models p \\text { with } g \\underset{A}{\\perp} h \\text { such that } h \\cdot g \\models p\\}\n$$\n\nRight-stabilizers are defined analogously. More details and proofs can be found in [7].\nWagner showed in [27] that the notions for stable groups extend to non-definable subgroups of $G$.\nDefinition 3.2. ([28, Definitions 1.1.2, 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3]) Let $H$ be a (possibly nondefinable) subgroup of the stable group $(G, \\cdot)$.\n(1) A definable subset $\\varphi(x, \\bar{a})$ of $G$ is called generic for $H$ if $H$ is covered by finitely many bitranslates of $\\varphi(x, \\bar{a})$ by elements from $H$; that is, there are elements $g_{1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ and $h_{1}, \\ldots, h_{n}$ of $H$ such that for every $h$ in $H$ holds $\\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \\varphi\\left(g_{i} \\cdot h \\cdot h_{i}, \\bar{a}\\right)$.\n(2) A type $p$ in $S_{1}(A)$ with $A \\supset H$ is generic for $H$ if all its formulae are generic for $H$.\n(3) The definable hull of $H$ (in $G$ ), denoted $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)$, is the intersection of all definable subgroups (with parameters) of $G$ containing $H$.\n\nAs in the case of stable groups, generic types for $H$ always exist and a definable set is generic for $H$ if and only if $H$ is covered by left translates.\n\nConsider the subspace $S_{1}^{H}(A)$ which consists of the types in $S_{1}(A)$ that are finitely satisfiable in $H$. By coheirness, each type in $S_{1}^{H}(A)$ does not fork over $H$ and its restriction to $H$ is stationary. Every generic type for $H$ lies in $S_{1}^{H}(A)$, since we considered translates by elements from $H$ in the definition of genericity for $H$ in $G$.\nFact 3.3. ([27, Lemma 25, Lemma 26, Remark 27 and Lemma 28])\n(1) The groups $\\mathrm{dc}_{G}(H)$ and $\\mathrm{dc}_{G}(H)^{0}$ are type-definable over $H$, and hence do not depend on the ambient model.\n\n(2) A type $p$ in $S_{1}^{H}(A)$ is generic for $H$ if and only if $\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(p)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)^{0}$. In particular, every type that is generic for $H$ in $G$ is also generic in the typedefinable group $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)$.\n\nThe first part follows from the Baldwin-Saxl condition for definable groups in stable theories. For the second part, Wagner uses that a definable subgroup $H^{\\prime}$ contains $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)^{0}$ if and only if the index $\\left[H: H \\cap H^{\\prime}\\right]$ is finite. The general structure of proofs is as in the definable case.\n\nBefore exploring how Wagner's results can be used in the setting of the criterion given in the next section, we first introduce the following notion:\n\nDefinition 3.4. Consider two stable groups $\\left(G_{2}, \\cdot\\right) \\subset\\left(G_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$. We say that $G_{2}$ is principal in $G_{1}$ if they have the same connected components, i.e. $G_{1}^{0}=G_{2}^{0}$.\n\nIn his lecture notes [7], Casanovas refers to this notion as being generic since it is equivalent to the partial type defining $G_{2}$ being generic in $G_{1}$ by part (ii) of the next remark.\n\nRemark 3.5. Let $\\left(G_{2}, \\cdot\\right) \\subset\\left(G_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ be two stable groups, both defined over $A$. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) The group $G_{2}$ is principal in $G_{1}$.\n(ii) Every generic type of $G_{2}$ (over $A$ ) is also a generic type of $G_{1}$.\n(iii) There is some element $g$ of $G_{2}$ such that $\\operatorname{tp}(g / A)$ is generic in $G_{1}$.\n\nThe equivalences follow from basic facts about connected components. We will give a short proof for the sake of completeness.\n\nProof. $(i) \\Rightarrow(i i)$ : Take a generic type $p$ of $G_{2}$, so its stabilizer $\\operatorname{Stab}_{G_{2}}(p)$ equals $G_{2}^{0}=G_{1}^{0}$ by assumption. Since $G_{1}$ is a supergroup of $G_{2}$, we have $\\operatorname{Stab}_{G_{1}}(p) \\supset \\operatorname{Stab}_{G_{2}}(p)=G_{1}^{0}$ which implies that $p$ is generic in $G_{1}$.\n(ii) $\\Rightarrow$ (iii): This implication is trivial.\n(iii) $\\Rightarrow(i)$ : We may assume that $A=\\operatorname{acl}(A)$. First note that $G_{2}^{0} \\subset G_{1}^{0} \\cap G_{2}$ since $G_{2}$ is a subgroup of $G_{1}$. Let $g$ be as in the assumption of (iii) and take $g_{1} \\equiv_{A} g$ with $g_{1} \\downarrow_{A} g$. Since $G_{2}$ is definable over $A$, the type $\\operatorname{tp}(g / A)$ determines a coset of the connected component $G_{2}^{0}$. In particular, the product $g_{1}^{-1} \\cdot g$ lies in $G_{2}^{0}$. By the independence $g_{1} \\downarrow_{A} g$ and genericity of $g$ in $G_{1}$ we also get that $g_{1}^{-1} \\cdot g$ is generic in $G_{1}$. Hence, the group $G_{2}^{0}$ contains a generic element of $G_{1}$ which implies that $G_{1}^{0} \\subset G_{2}^{0}$.\n\nWe use the remark as follows:\nCorollary 3.6. Let $G$ and $H$ be as in Definition 3.2. If the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)$ is principal in $G$, then for every $A \\supset H$ there exists a type $p$ in $S_{1}^{H}(A)$ which is generic in $G$.\n\nProof. Choose $p$ to be a generic type for $H$ over $A$, then $p$ is generic in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H)$ by Fact 3.3 (2) and thus in $G$ by Remark 3.5.\n\n3.2. Back to our Setting. We return to the assumptions of Section 1 and fix a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ which eliminates imaginaries and quantifiers. As in Section 3.1, we assume that $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ is the universe of a group $(G, \\cdot)$. In addition, we now consider a simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\subset \\mathcal{L}$ such that $T_{0}^{\\varphi} \\subset T$ (see Remark 1.1).\n\nInside $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$, we fix a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ and work either in $\\mathcal{M}$ or $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$. Furthermore, let $\\mathcal{N}$ be a small elementary substructure of $\\mathcal{M}$ and $H$ an $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable subset of $M$. We now suppose that $(H, \\cdot)$ is a group in $\\mathcal{M}$ (i.e. closed under $\\cdot$ and inverses).\n\nIn particular, both the $N$-points $(H(N), \\cdot)$ and the $M$-points $(H(M), \\cdot)$ form (possibly non-definable) subgroups of $(G, \\cdot)$.\nRemark 3.7. In the just described setting, the definable hulls of $H(M)$ and $H(N)$ in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ coincide, that is $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(M))=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(N))$.\nProof. Since $H(N) \\subset H(M)$, we have $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(N)) \\subset \\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(M))$ as type-definable sets.\nOn the other hand, if $\\psi(x)$ is an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}(N)$-formula such that $H(N) \\subset \\psi\\left(M_{0}\\right)$, then (by quantifier elimination of $T_{0}$ ) $\\mathcal{N} \\models \\forall x(H(x) \\rightarrow \\psi(x))$. Since $\\mathcal{N} \\prec \\mathcal{M}$ we thus have that $H(M) \\subset \\psi\\left(M_{0}\\right)$, so $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(M)) \\subset \\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(N))$ by Fact 3.3 (1).\n\nWarning: Since $(H, \\cdot)$ is an $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable group in the simple theory $T$, we now have two different notions of genericity for elements in $H$. A type is said to be ( $\\mathcal{L}$-)generic in $H$ if it is generic in the simple theory $T$ and generic for $H(M)$ as in Definition 3.2 if we view $(H(M), \\cdot)$ as a subgroup of $(G, \\cdot)$.\n\nHowever, these notions are related if $T$ is stable:\nRemark 3.8. Let $(G, \\cdot)$ and $(H, \\cdot)$ be as above and suppose that $T$ is stable. An element $g$ of $H(M)$ is generic for $H(M)$ (working in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ ) if it is $\\mathcal{L}$-generic in $H$ over $N$ (working in $\\mathcal{M})$.\n\nIn particular, such an element $g$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H(M))$ by Fact 3.3 (2).\nProof. First work in $\\mathcal{M}$. Since $T$ is stable and $\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)$ is generic in $H$, we find for every formula $\\varphi(x)$ in $\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)$ elements $g_{1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ and $h_{1}, \\ldots, h_{n}$ of $H(M)$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \\varphi\\left(g_{i} \\cdot h \\cdot h_{i}\\right)$ for every element $h$ of $H(M)$.\n\nIf $\\varphi$ is a quantifier-free $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-formula, we then also have $\\mathcal{M}_{0} \\models \\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \\varphi\\left(g_{i} \\cdot h \\cdot h_{i}\\right)$ since $\\mathcal{M}$ is a substructure of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$. In particular, this is true for all formulas in $\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(g / N)$ by quantifier elimination of $T_{0}$. Hence, working in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$, the type $\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(g / N)$ is generic for $H(M)$.\n\nWe will now consider the definable hulls in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of two different subsets of $\\mathcal{M}$, one being contained in the other.\n\nLemma 3.9. Given two $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable sets $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ such that $\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ and $\\left(H_{2}, \\cdot\\right)$ are groups and $\\left(H_{2}, \\cdot\\right) \\subset\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$, the following two conditions are equivalent:\n(i) The definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$.\n(ii) There exists an element $h$ of $H_{2}(M)$ that is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$. Working in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$, there exists an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-Type $p$ that is finitely satisfiable in $H_{2}(N)$ and generic in\n\n$\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ by Remark 3.6 applied to $H_{2}(N)$ as a subgroup of $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$. By quantifier elimination of $T_{0}$, the $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-type $p$ yields a partial $\\mathcal{L}$-type over $N$ in $\\mathcal{M}$ which is still finitely satisfiable in $H_{2}(N)$. This means that the partial type $p \\cup\\left\\{H_{2}(x)\\right\\}$ over $N$ is consistent in $\\mathcal{M}$ and thus realized by an element $h$. Hence, we have found an element as in (ii).\n\nOn the other hand, an element $h$ as in (ii) lies in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(M)\\right)$ which by Remark 3.7 equals $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$. Remark 3.5 yields that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$.",

IMagINARIES \n\nRecall that an $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ has geometric elimination of imaginaries if every imaginary $\\alpha$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-interalgebraic with a real tuple $\\bar{a}$. The theory has weak elimination of imaginaries if additionally $\\alpha$ is definable over $\\bar{a}$. If $T$ has weak elimination of imaginaries, then $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{c g}(A)=\\operatorname{dcl}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{c g}\\left(\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(A)\\right)$ for every real set $A$, so types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary. By [8, Proposition 3.4], a stable theory has weak elimination of imaginaries if it has geometric elimination of imaginaries and types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nDelon showed in [11, p. 36] that the theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ does not have elimination of imaginaries. Her proof easily generalizes to show that geometric elimination also fails. A similar proof was given by Messmer and Wood [19, Remark 4.3] to show that elimination of imaginaries fails in the theory $D C F_{p}$ of differentially closed fields of positive characteristic. Pillay and Vassiliev showed in [22, Lemma 3.3] with a different proof that whenever the stable nfcp theory $T_{0}$ has elimination of imaginaries, the theory $T=T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs of $T_{0}$ has geometric elimination of imaginaries if and only if no infinite group is definable in $T_{0}$. In particular, the theory of proper pairs of algebraically closed fields does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries.\n\nIn this section, we present a criterion for a theory not to have geometric elimination of imaginaries that extracts the essences of Delon's proof as well as Messmers's and Wood's proof and which applies to all examples mentioned above.\n\nWe work in the setting of Lemma 3.9 in the previous Subsection 3.2: Let $T_{0}$ be a stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory (with elimination of imaginaries and quantifiers) and $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ a sufficiently saturated model. Consider a (simple) $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ such that $T_{0}^{\\vee} \\subset T$ and choose a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ inside $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$.\n\nWe again suppose that there are an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group $(G, \\cdot)$ in $M_{0}$ as well as $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subsets $H_{2} \\subset H_{1}$ of $M$ such that $\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ and $\\left(H_{2}, \\cdot\\right)$ are groups in $\\mathcal{M}$; all $G, H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ being defined over a small elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nThe first lemma we present is somewhat technical but contains the common idea of the different applications.\n\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that in the setting just described the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) For tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ from $M$ holds $\\bar{a} \\perp_{N}^{\\mathcal{L}} \\bar{b} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\bar{a} \\perp_{N}^{0} \\bar{b}$.\n(ii) There exists an element $h$ of $H_{2}(M)$ that is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$.\n(iii) There exists an element $g$ of $H_{1}(M)$ with $g \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{N} h$ such that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$ as well as $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g \\cdot h, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g \\cdot h, N)$.\n\nIf the canonical parameter of the coset $g \\cdot H_{2}$ of $H_{2}$ in $H_{1}$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-interalgebraic over $N$ with a real tuple, then the coset is $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable. Moreover, we then have that the right-stabilizer $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right)$ is contained in $H_{2}$.\n\nNote that if we further assume that $T$ is stable and $H_{2} \\subset \\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right)$, the conclusion of Lemma 4.1 that $g \\cdot H_{2}$ is $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable yields $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right)=H_{2}$. By [21, Lemma 4.4] we then have that $H_{2}$ is connected and that $\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)$ is the generic type of $g \\cdot H_{2}$.\n\nProof. Given $g$ and $h$ as in (ii) and (iii), let $\\alpha$ be the canonical parameter of the coset $g \\cdot H_{2}=g \\cdot h \\cdot H_{2}$. Suppose that $\\alpha$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-interalgebraic over $N$ with the real tuple $\\bar{a}$.\n\nBy Condition (i), the $\\mathcal{L}$-independence implies that $g \\perp_{N}^{0} h$. Working now in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$, observe that $g$ and $h$ are both in $H_{1}(M) \\subset \\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(M)\\right)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ by Remark 3.7. Thus, genericity of $h$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ yields that\n\n$$\ng \\cdot h \\underset{N}{\\perp_{N}^{0}} g\n$$\n\nConsidering $\\mathcal{M}$ again, note that $\\alpha$ is $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable over any element of the coset because $H_{2}$ is $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable. Thus, the tuple $\\bar{a}$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraic both over $N, g$ and $N, g \\cdot h$.\n\nCondition (iii) and the independence in $(\\star)$ now yield that\n\n$$\n\\bar{a} \\in \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N) \\cap \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g \\cdot h, N) \\cap M \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(N) \\cap M=N\n$$\n\nHence, the imaginary $\\alpha$ lies in $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}^{e q}(N)=N^{e q}$ (since $N$ is a model of $T$ ). In particular, the coset $g \\cdot H_{2}$ is $N$-definable.\n\nFor the moreover part note that it is enough to check that $\\operatorname{St}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right) \\subset H_{2}$ where $\\operatorname{St}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right)=\\left\\{h^{\\prime} \\in H_{1} \\mid \\exists g^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=}_{N} g\\right.$ with $\\left.g^{\\prime} \\perp_{\\mathcal{L}}^{\\mathcal{L}} h^{\\prime}\\right.$ and $\\left.g^{\\prime} \\cdot h^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=}_{N} g\\right\\}$. Let thus $h^{\\prime}$ be in $\\operatorname{St}_{H_{1}}^{r}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g / N)\\right)$, witnessed by $g^{\\prime} \\stackrel{\\mathcal{L}}{=}_{N} g$. Since $g \\cdot H_{2}$ is $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable, we have that $g^{\\prime} \\cdot H_{2}=g \\cdot H_{2}=g^{\\prime} \\cdot h^{\\prime} \\cdot H_{2}$. By left-cancellation this implies that $h^{\\prime}$ is in $H_{2}$.\n\nRemark 4.2. Some of the conditions in Lemma 4.1 have already appeared in a previous context in this paper:\n\n- As a model of $T$, the set $N$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed. Thus Property ( $\\#$ ) introduced in Section 1 yields by Fact 1.5 that Condition (i) holds. The Property ( $\\#$ ) will be satisfied in all our examples.\n- Since $T$ is controlled by $T_{0}$, the second part of Condition (iii) is equivalent by Remark $1.1(4)$ to $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N)=\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N) \\cap M$ and $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g \\cdot h, N)=\\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g \\cdot h, N) \\cap M$.\n\nIn order to show the failure of elimination of imaginaries, we first give a criterion for the case that $T$ is stable:\nProposition 4.3. Consider a stable $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $T_{0}^{\\text {st }} \\subset T$ for the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (see Section 1). Inside a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of $T_{0}$ choose $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ also sufficiently saturated.\n\nSuppose that there is an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group $(G, \\cdot)$ in $M_{0}$ and an $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subset $H_{1}$ of $M$ such that $\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ is a group in $\\mathcal{M}$; both $G$ and $H_{1}$ being defined over a small elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$. Assume further that:\n(1) For tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ from $M$ holds $\\bar{a} \\perp_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathcal{L}} \\bar{b} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\bar{a} \\perp_{\\mathcal{N}}^{0} \\bar{b}$.\n(2) There exists a type $p$ over $N$ of an element of $H_{1}$ such that for every realization $g$ of $p$ holds $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$.\n(3) The right stabilizer $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(p)$ contains a proper (infinite) $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable subgroup $H_{2}$ such that the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ (c.f. Definition 3.4), that is $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)^{0}=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)^{0}$.\n\nThen, the theory $T$ does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries, even after adding constants for the model $\\mathcal{N}$ to the language.\n\nProof. By Lemma 3.9, the second part of Condition (3) yields an element $h$ of $H_{2}(M)$ that is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$. Let $g$ in $H_{1}$ be a realization of $p$ with $g \\perp_{N}^{\\mathcal{L}} h$. Since $T$ is stable and $H_{2} \\subset \\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(p)$, it follows that $g \\cdot h$ is a realization of $p$ and in particular that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g \\cdot h, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g \\cdot h, N)$. Hence, all conditions of Lemma 4.1 are satisfied.\n\nSuppose for a contradiction that the canonical parameter of the coset $g \\cdot H_{2}$ is interalgebraic over $N$ with a real tuple. Lemma 4.1 then yields that $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(g / N)=\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(p)$ is contained in $H_{2}$, which contradicts Condition (3).\n\nIf the group $H_{1}$ in Proposition 4.3 is connected and $p$ a generic type of $H_{1}$, the subgroup $H_{2}$ in Condition (3) is simply an infinite index subgroup of $H_{1}$. This observation yields the following criterion for simple theories.\n\nProposition 4.4. Consider a simple $\\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ with $T_{0}^{\\forall} \\subset T$ for the stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (see Section 1). Inside a sufficiently saturated model $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ of $T_{0}$ choose $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ also sufficiently saturated.\n\nSuppose that there is an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group $(G, \\cdot)$ in $M_{0}$ and an $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subset $H_{1}$ of $M$ such that $\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ is a group in $\\mathcal{M}$; both $G$ and $H_{1}$ being defined over a small elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$. Assume further that:\n(1) For tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ from $M$ holds $\\bar{a} \\perp_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathcal{L}} \\bar{b} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\bar{a} \\perp_{\\mathcal{N}}^{0} \\bar{b}$.\n(2') For every $\\mathcal{L}$-generic $g$ in $G(M)$ over $N$ we have that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$.\n(3') There is an infinite $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable subgroup $H_{2}$ of $H_{1}$ of infinite index such that the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ (c.f. Definition 3.4), that is $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)^{0}=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)^{0}$.\n\nThen, the theory $T$ does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries, even after adding constants for the model $\\mathcal{N}$ to the language.\n\nProof. By Lemma 3.9 there exists an element $h$ of $H_{2}(M)$ that is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$. Work in $\\mathcal{M}$ and choose an element $g$ of $H_{1}$ that is $\\mathcal{L}$-generic over $N h$. In particular, $g \\perp_{\\mathcal{N}}^{\\mathcal{L}} h$ and thus $g \\cdot h$ is also generic in $H_{1}$ over $N$. Condition (2') yields that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$ as well as $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g \\cdot h, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g \\cdot h, N)$\n\nWe will again show that the canonical parameter of the coset $g \\cdot H_{2}$ in $H_{1}$ cannot be geometrically eliminated: Otherwise, by Lemma 4.1, we have that $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(g / N) \\subset H_{2}$. As\n\n$g$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-generic in $H_{1}$, this stabilizer equals the connected component $H_{1}^{0}$ which contradicts that $H_{2}$ has infinite index in $H_{1}$.\nRemark 4.5. Most parts of the proofs of the two previous criteria were carried out in the stable theory $T_{0}$. The stability or simplicity of $T$ was mainly used to choose an appropriate element $g$. Indeed, suppose that $T$ is an arbitrary $\\mathcal{L}$-theory controlled by $T_{0}$ such that Condition (3') of Proposition 4.4 holds. Assuming moreover that $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}(g, N) \\subset \\operatorname{acl}_{0}(g, N)$ for every $g$ in $H_{1}$ and that there exists an independence relation $\\perp^{*}$ in $T$ satisfying full existence with $\\perp^{*} \\Rightarrow \\perp^{0}$ over $N$ (instead of (1)), the proof of Lemma 4.1 yields that all cosets of $H_{2}$ are $N$-definable which is a contradiction by a straightforward compactness argument.\n\nIn particular, the criterion applies to some non-simple theories; for example d'Elb\u00e9e's $N S O P_{1}$-theory $A C F G_{p}$ presented in [10, p.16], the model companion of the theory of algebraically closed fields in positive characteristic with a predicate for an additive subgroup.\n\nIn the proofs of Proposition 4.3 and 4.4 we only used that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)^{0}=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)^{0}$ to find an element $h$ in $H_{2}$ such that for $g$ in $H_{1}$ (generic or realizing the type $p$ ) with $g \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{N} h$ holds $g \\perp^{0}{ }_{N} g \\cdot h$. We will now see that in the case of $g$ being generic in $H_{1}$ and $T$ stable, the above gives an equivalent condition. In order to do so, we need to recall a result of Ziegler, originally stated for abelian groups in [33]. For the purpose of this note, we will use a generalized reformulation given by Blossier, Martin-Pizarro and Wagner in $[5]$.\nFact 4.6. (c.f. [5, Lemme 1.2]) Let $(G, \\cdot)$ be a type-definable group in a stable theory and suppose there are elements $g$ and $h$ of $G$ such that $g, h$ and $g \\cdot h$ are pairwise independent over a set $A$. Then $h$ is generic in the coset $\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(\\operatorname{stp}(h / A)) \\cdot h$ and moreover $g \\cdot \\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(\\operatorname{stp}(h / A)) \\cdot g^{-1}=\\operatorname{Stab}_{G}(\\operatorname{stp}(g / A))$.\nLemma 4.7. Suppose that $T, T_{0},(G, \\cdot)$ and $\\left(H_{1}, \\cdot\\right)$ are as in Proposition 4.3 and let $\\left(H_{2}, \\cdot\\right)$ be an $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable subgroup of $H_{1}$. Moreover suppose that Property ( $\\left.\\approx^{\\star}\\right)$ (c.f. Section 1) holds. The following are equivalent:\n(i) The definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)$ is principal in the definable hull $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ (see Condition (3') of Proposition 4.3).\n(ii) There exist elements $h$ in $H_{2}$ and $g$ in $H_{1}$ such that $g$ is $\\mathcal{L}$-generic in $H_{1}$ over $N$ with $g \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{N} h$ and $g \\perp^{0}{ }_{N} g \\cdot h$.\nProof. First note that Property ( $\\left.\\approx^{\\star}\\right)$ yields Condition (1) of Proposition 4.3 (by Fact 1.5). The proof of Lemma 4.1 (using Lemma 3.9) then shows that (i) implies (ii).\n\nOn the other hand suppose that (ii) holds. Let $h$ in $H_{2}$ and $g$ in $H_{1}$ generic over $N, h$ be as in the assumption. Since $g \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{N} h$, we obtain $g \\cdot h \\perp^{\\mathcal{L}}{ }_{N} h$ by genericity of $g$. As Condition (1) holds, the $\\mathcal{L}$-independences imply that\n\n$$\ng \\perp_{N}^{0} h \\quad \\text { and } \\quad g \\cdot h \\perp_{N}^{0} h\n$$\n\nFrom our assumption, it follows that $g, h$ and $g \\cdot h$ are pairwise $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-independent elements of $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(M)\\right)=: \\tilde{G}$ (for simplicity of notation).\n\nRecall that all $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-types are stationary over $N$ by Fact 1.3. By Fact 4.6, the type $\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(h / N)$ is hence generic in a coset of its stabilizer and the latter is a conjugate of $\\operatorname{Stab}_{\\tilde{G}}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(g / N)\\right)$. By Remark 3.8, the element $g$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\tilde{G}$ and thus $\\operatorname{Stab}_{\\tilde{G}}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(g / N)\\right)=\\tilde{G}^{0}$. Since the connected component is a normal subgroup of $\\tilde{G}$, we have $\\operatorname{Stab}_{\\tilde{G}}\\left(\\operatorname{tp}_{0}(h / N)\\right)=\\tilde{G}^{0}$.\n\nIn particular, the element $h$ of $H_{2}(M)$ is $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-generic over $N$ in $\\tilde{G}=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(M)\\right)$. By Lemma 3.9 this is equivalent to (i) (using that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(M)\\right)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ by Remark 3.7).\n4.1. Examples. Since Lemma 4.1 was inspired by Delon's proof for separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection, the criterion in Proposition 4.3 or 4.4 can easily be applied to this theory. Moreover, these propositions yield a new proof of non-elimination for beautiful pairs of theories with a definable groups.\n\nCorollary 4.8. The following theories do not have geometric elimination of imaginaries even after adding constants for a small submodel to the language:\na) The theory $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection.\nb) The theory $T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs of a stable $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-theory $T_{0}$ (with elimination of quantifiers and imaginaries) where $T_{0}$ does not have the finite cover property and an infinite group is definable in $T_{0}$.\n\nIn particular the theories $A C F_{p} P, D C F_{0} P$ and $S C F_{p}^{e} P$ of beautiful pairs of algebraically closed fields, differential closed fields in characteristic 0 resp. separably closed fields of finite degree of imperfection do not have geometric elimination of imaginaries; yet types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary.\n\nProof. The desired statement follows from Proposition 4.4 after checking that all conditions hold. (We could also use Proposition 4.3, but since our group $H_{1}$ is connected in both cases, this amounts to checking the same conditions.)\na) As in Section 2, we consider $T=S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\left\\{0,1,+,-,-,^{-1}\\right\\}$ and $T_{0}=A C F_{p}$ with $\\mathcal{L}_{0}=\\mathcal{L}$. Given models $\\mathcal{M}_{0} \\models T_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ as in Proposition 4.4, we put $G=\\left(M_{0},+\\right)$ the additive group of the algebraically closed field, and $H_{1}=(M,+)$ the additive group of $M$ itself.\n(1): This follows immediately from the characterization of independence given by Srour in [26] (see Section 2).\n(2'): Note that an element of $M$ is additively generic over $N$ if it does not lie in the field $M^{p} \\cdot N$. In particular, the extension $M / N(g)$ of fields is separable which by the characterization of algebraic closure in separably closed fields yields Condition (2').\n(3'): Set $H_{2}=M^{P}$ the subfield of $p$-powers which is by definition a subgroup of infinite index. Since $A C F_{p}$ is strongly minimal and $H_{2}(N)$ and $H_{1}(N)$ are infinite subgroups of $\\left(M_{0},+\\right)$, it follows that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)=\\left(M_{0},+\\right)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$.\nb) Let $T_{0}$ be a stable nfcp theory and consider the theory $T=T_{0} P$ of beautiful pairs of $T_{0}$ as in Section 2 in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}_{0} \\cup\\{P\\}$. Choose $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ sufficiently saturated, then by definition $\\mathcal{M} \\models T_{0}$ (so we can put $\\mathcal{M}_{0}=\\mathcal{M}$ ). By assumption, there exist an $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$-definable group $(G, \\cdot)$ in $T_{0}$ which we may assume to be defined over $P(M)$ by\n\nsaturation of the predicate. We choose a small elementary substructure $\\mathcal{N}$ containing the necessary parameters and will now show that $T$ does not eliminate imaginaries in $\\mathcal{L}(N)$. For simplicity we assume again that $G=M_{0}$. Put $H_{1}=G$ (since $M_{0}=M$ ).\n(1): This is immediate from the characterization of independence in [1] (see Section 2).\n(2'): By the characterization of independence, the element $g$ of $H_{1}$ is generic in $T=T_{0} P$ over $N$ if and only if it is generic in $T_{0}$ over $N, P(M)$. In particular, for $g$ generic in $H_{1}$ over $N$ holds\n\n$$\ng \\underset{P(N)}{\\perp^{0}} N, P(M)\n$$\n\nwhich implies that the substructure $\\langle g, N\\rangle_{\\mathcal{L}}$ is $P$-independent. This yields Condition (2') by the characterization of the algebraic closure in [22, Lemma 2.6].\n(3'): Let $H_{2}=G(M) \\cap P(M)$ be the $\\mathcal{L}(N)$-definable subgroup of $P$-points of $G$. Note that the index is infinite by saturation. Moreover, since $H_{1}(M)=G$, we immediately have $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(M)\\right)=G$ by Remark 3.7.\n\nSimilarly $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}(H_{2}(N))=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(M)\\right)$. Now, the subgroup $H_{2}(M)$ is a subset of $P(M)$. By Fact 3.3 (1), we have that $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(M)\\right)$ is given by the $M$-points of $\\operatorname{dc}_{G(P(M))}\\left(H_{2}(M)\\right)$ and hence equals $G$ as $H_{2}(M)=G(P(M))$. Thus Condition (3') holds.\n\nNote that the result for $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ answers negatively Yoneda's question in [32, Question 3.1 (4)] whether $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ has geometric elimination of imaginaries in the language of fields.\n\nWe will now present an application of Proposition 4.3 with a non-generic type $p$ in Condition (2): A straightforward adaption of the proof of Messmer and Wood [19, Remark 4.3] yields the failure of non-elimination in a broader class of differential fields.\n\nA differential field $K$ of positive characteristic $p$ is separably differentially closed if $K$ is existentially closed in all separable differential extensions. The differential degree of imperfection is the cardinality of a $p$-basis of $C_{K}$ over $K^{p}$. Ino and Le\u00f3n Sanchez introduced the theory $S D C F_{p, e}$ of separably differentially closed fields of fixed differential degree of imperfection $e$ in $\\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ in [17] and showed completeness and stability. The case $e=0$ yields the theory $D C F_{p}$ which was already studied by Wood in [29, 30, 31] and Shelah in [25] as the characteristic $p$ analogue of $D C F_{0}$.\n\nWe consider $T=S D C F_{p, e}$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{0,1,+,-, \\cdot,^{-1}, D\\}$ where $D$ is a unary function symbol interpreted as the derivation. Note that for every $e$, the theory $T$ contains the universal part of the theory $T_{0}=A C F_{p}$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}_{0}$ of fields.\n\nFact 4.9. Let $K \\models T$ and let $k_{0}$ be a differential subfield such that the extension of fields $K / k_{0}$ is separable, then $\\operatorname{acl}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\left(k_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{acl}_{0}\\left(k_{0}\\right) \\cap K$.\n\nFor $e=\\infty$ this follows directly from [17, Lemma 4.8] (using [17, Lemma 3.8]). The same works for $e$ finite since $T$ can be viewed by the quantifier elimination result in [14, Section 6.1] as the model completion of an almost derivation-like theory (c.f. [17, Remark 3.10]).\n\nLemma 4.10. For every $e$ in $\\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$, the theory $S D C F_{p, e}$ does not have geometric elimination of imaginaries even after adding constants for a small submodel to the language.\n\nProof. As above let $T$ be the theory $S D C F_{p, e}$ and $T_{0}=A C F_{p}$. Given models $\\mathcal{M}_{0} \\models T_{0}$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ as in Proposition 4.3, we put $G=\\left(M_{0} \\backslash\\{0\\}, \\cdot\\right)$ the multiplicative group of the algebraically closed field and $H_{1}=(M \\backslash\\{0\\}, \\cdot)$ the multiplicative group of $M$. We are done by Proposition 4.3 after checking that the conditions hold.\n(1): This condition follows from Fact 1.5 since Property ( $\\#$ ) is satisfied in every theory of fields (see Remark 1.2).\n(2): Let $p$ be the type of an element $g$ with $D(g)=g$ and such that $g$ does not lie in the field $C_{M} \\cdot N$ (i.e. $g$ is $p$-independent over $N$ ). Note that these conditions define a complete type by the quantifier elimination results of Ino and Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez [14, Theorem 6.3 and 6.6]. For any realization $g$ of $p$, the field $N(g)$ is by definition a differential subfield of $M$ with $M / N(g)$ separable. We hence obtain Condition (2) from Fact 4.9 .\n(3): An easy computation shows that $\\operatorname{Stab}_{H_{1}}^{r}(p)=C_{M} \\backslash\\{0\\}$. We thus put $H_{2}=M^{p^{2}} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ which is for all $e$ a proper subgroup (since $M^{p} \\subset C_{M}$ ). As in Corollary 4.8 we have $\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{2}(N)\\right)=\\left(M_{0} \\backslash\\{0\\}, \\cdot\\right)=\\operatorname{dc}_{G}\\left(H_{1}(N)\\right)$ by strongly minimality of $A C F_{p}$.\nFor the case $e=\\infty$ we could have alternatively done the same proof as for $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ (but with $H_{1}=C_{M}$ instead of $M$ ).\nRemark 4.11. In fact, our proof of stationarity over real algebraically closed sets from Theorem 1.10 also applies to $S D C F_{p, \\infty}$. Similar to the case of $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$, an $\\mathcal{L}$-substructure $A$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ is strong if the field extension $M / A$ is separable. Using the characterization of independence given by Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez and Mohamed in [17] with respect to independence in $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$, the other properties also follow.\n\nActually, an inspection of the proof of [17, Theorem 2.14] shows that stationarity transfers from $S C F_{p}^{\\infty}$ to $S D C F_{p, \\infty}$ over arbitrary $\\mathcal{L}$-algebraically closed sets (and not just models). Hence, types over real algebraically closed sets in $S D C F_{p, \\infty}$ are stationary.",
