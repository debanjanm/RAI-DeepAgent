InTRODUCTION\n\nThe Yamabe flow is a fundamental and highly effective tool for analyzing the structure of manifolds. The study of the Yamabe flow has developed rapidly in the last decades and has become a central area in geometry (cf. [2], [3], [6], [8], [11], [17], [19]). To analyze the Yamabe flow, and more generally, geometric flows, it is important to study singularity models. Yamabe solitons are special solutions to the Yamabe flow and are expected to serve as singularity models (cf. [8]). From this perspective, Yamabe solitons have also been studied extensively over the last few decades (cf. [4], [5], [9], [13], [14]).\n\nAn $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is called a gradient Yamabe soliton if there exists a smooth function $F$ on $M$ and a constant $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\nabla \\nabla F=(R-\\lambda) g\n$$\n\nwhere, $\\nabla \\nabla F$ is the Hessian of $F$ and $R$ denotes the scalar curvature of $(M, g)$. A gradient Yamabe soliton is represented as $\\left(M^{n}, g, F, \\lambda\\right)$. If $F$ is constant, then the gradient Yamabe soliton is called trivial. If $\\lambda>0, \\lambda=0$, or $\\lambda<0$, then the Yamabe soliton is called shrinking, steady, or expanding.\n\nIt is well known that there exist no nontrivial compact gradient Yamabe solitons (cf. [11]). One of the main problems in the study of Yamabe solitons is determining whether complete gradient Yamabe solitons are rotationally symmetric. In particular, the Yamabe soliton version of Perelman's conjecture, which states that \"any nontrivial complete steady gradient Yamabe soliton with positive scalar curvature is rotationally symmetric,\" has stimulated significant interest in this problem. Partial answers have been obtained under the assumption of local conformal flatness (cf. [4], [9]).

[5]). Here, Ric is the Ricci tensor of $M$. Finally, the author resolved the conjecture (cf. [13]). Furthermore, the author also proved the rotational symmetry of the complete shrinking gradient Yamabe solitons under $R>\\lambda$, and showed that this assumption is optimal. Therefore, the remaining problem involves expanding solitons. However, the study of expanding solitons has been regarded as difficult so far. In fact, even in low-dimensional cases, expanding gradient Yamabe solitons exhibit richer geometry than steady or shrinking solitons (cf. [1], [14]), making it difficult to obtain rigidity results. To overcome this difficulty, we reduce the problem to the existence and nonexistence of solutions of a certain ODE, using the warped product structure provided by Tashiro's theorem (cf. [18], see also [12]), and then analyze it rigorously.\n\nTheorem 1.1 ([18], [12]). Let $\\left(M^{n}, g, F, \\varphi\\right)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which satisfies\n\n$$\n\\varphi g=\\nabla \\nabla F\n$$\n\nfor smooth functions $F$ and $\\varphi$ on $M$. Then $\\left(M^{n}, g, F, \\varphi\\right)$ is either\n(1) compact and rotationally symmetric, or\n(2) rotationally symmetric and equal to the warped product\n\n$$\n\\left([0, \\infty), d r^{2}\\right) \\times_{|\\nabla F|}\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}, \\bar{g}_{S}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere, $\\bar{g}_{S}$ is the round metric on $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, or\n(3) the warped product\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbb{R}, d r^{2}\\right) \\times_{|\\nabla F|}\\left(N^{n-1}, \\bar{g}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn Theorem 1.1, if $\\varphi=R-\\lambda$, then $\\left(M^{n}, g, F, \\lambda\\right)$ is a gradient Yamabe soliton. Tashiro's theorem is really powerful for studying complete gradient Yamabe solitons. In fact, by the proof of Theorem 1.1 (see [12]), it is easy to see that if $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla F, \\nabla F) \\geq 0$ and $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla F, \\nabla F)>$ 0 holds at least at one point, then any such complete Riemannian manifold $(M, g, F, \\varphi)$ with a non-constant function $F$ is rotationally symmetric. Therefore, in the study of the rotational symmetry of complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons, imposing conditions on the scalar curvature is of fundamental importance. To analyze the scalar curvature in cases (2) and (3) of Theorem 1.1, the following equations, derived from the structure of the warped product, are used.\n\n$$\n|\\nabla F|^{2} R=\\bar{R}-(n-1)(n-2)(R-\\lambda)^{2}-2(n-1) g(\\nabla F, \\nabla R)\n$$\n\nHere, we note that $F$ depends only on $r$ and $F^{\\prime}(r)>0$ (cf. [18], see also [12]). Set $\\rho=F^{\\prime}$. Then we have\n\n$$\n2(n-1) \\rho \\rho^{\\prime \\prime}+(n-1)(n-2) \\rho^{\\prime 2}+\\rho^{2}\\left(\\rho^{\\prime}+\\lambda\\right)=\\bar{R}\n$$\n\nHence, the scalar curvature $\\bar{R}$ of $N$ is constant. Differentiating both sides of (1.1),\n\n$$\n2(n-1)^{2} \\rho^{\\prime} \\rho^{\\prime \\prime}+2(n-1) \\rho \\rho^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}+2 \\rho \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho^{\\prime}+\\lambda\\right)+\\rho^{2} \\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0\n$$\n\nNote that, since low dimensional complete gradient solitons have already been classified (cf. $[1,14])$, we focus on the case $n=\\operatorname{dim} M \\geq 3$ in this paper.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. EXAMPLES, TRIVIALITY AND ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY \n\nTo study rotational symmetry of complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons, we first note that there exist nontrivial examples when $R=\\lambda$ (cf. [14]).\nExample. Let $\\left(N^{n-1}, \\bar{g}\\right)$ be an $(n-1)$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold with constant negative scalar curvature $\\bar{R}$. Then, for any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R},(M, g, F, \\lambda)=\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times N^{n-1}, d r^{2}+\\right.$ $\\left.\\frac{\\bar{R}}{\\lambda} \\bar{g}, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{R}}{\\lambda}} r+\\alpha, \\lambda\\right)$ is an $n$-dimensional complete expanding gradient Yamabe soliton with $R=\\lambda$.\n\nIn particular, $\\left(M^{3}, g, F, \\lambda\\right)=\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{H}^{2}, d r^{2}+\\frac{\\bar{R}}{\\lambda} \\bar{g}_{H}, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{R}}{\\lambda}} r+\\alpha, \\lambda\\right)$ is a 3-dimensional complete expanding gradient Yamabe soliton with $R=\\lambda$, where $\\left(\\mathbb{H}^{2}, \\bar{g}_{H}\\right)$ is a hyperbolic surface.\n\nTherefore, imposing conditions on the scalar curvature is crucial and fundamental for achieving rotational symmetry in complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons. In particular, the problem reduces to the cases $R>\\lambda$ or $R<\\lambda$.\n\nInterestingly, the following triviality result for expanding, steady, and shrinking solitons can be obtained for any $\\varepsilon>0$ provided that $R<\\lambda-\\varepsilon$.\nProposition 2.1. If $R<\\lambda-\\varepsilon$ for some $\\varepsilon>0$, then there exists no nontrivial complete gradient Yamabe solitons.\n\nProof. If $M$ is compact, it is trivial. Hence, we consider the other cases. If $R<\\lambda-\\varepsilon$, then one has that the positive smooth function $\\rho$ satisfies $\\rho^{\\prime}<-\\varepsilon$. Therefore, we have a contradiction.\n\nOn the other hand, if $R>\\lambda+\\varepsilon$, then the soliton is rotationally symmetric.\nProposition 2.2. Let $(M, g, F, \\lambda)$ be a nontrivial complete expanding gradient Yamabe soliton.

Any nontrivial complete expanding gradient Yamabe soliton with positive scalar curvature is rotationally symmetric.\n\nThis generalizes Theorem 1.3 in [9], Corollary 3.3 in [5] and Corollary 1.6 in [4].

By (1.1), we have $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)<0$. Hence, there exists no point $r_{-1} \\in\\left(-\\infty, r_{1}\\right)$ such that $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(r_{-1}\\right)=0$. In fact, if there exists such a point, then by the claim, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}\\left(r_{-1}\\right)>0$ and the function $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is weakly monotone increasing on $\\left(r_{-1},+\\infty\\right)$. By the same reason, it cannot happen that $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ at some point on $\\left(-\\infty, r_{1}\\right)$. Therefore, we have $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\left(-\\infty, r_{2}\\right)$ for some $r_{2}\\left(>r_{1}\\right)$. However, since $\\rho>0, \\rho^{\\prime}>0$ and $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\left(-\\infty, r_{2}\\right)$, we have a contradiction. Hence, such a point $r_{1}$ does not exist, and one has $\\rho^{\\prime}>-\\lambda$ or $\\rho^{\\prime}<-\\lambda$ on $\\mathbb{R}$. By Proposition 2.2, the first case cannot happen. Therefore, $\\lambda<R<0$.\n\nClaim 2 shows that for each critical point $r_{0}$ of $\\rho^{\\prime}$, the function $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is weakly monotone increasing on $\\left(r_{0},+\\infty\\right)$. Assume that $\\rho^{\\prime}$ has a critical point $r_{0}$, and furthermore, if there exists an interval on which $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is decreasing, then without loss of generality, we may assume that it is $\\left(-\\infty, r_{0}\\right)$. However, by the same argument as before, we have a contradiction. Therefore, $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is weakly monotone increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. If there exists no critical point of $\\rho^{\\prime}$, we have $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ or $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\mathbb{R}$. However, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ cannot happen. Hence, one has $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$.\n\nTherefore, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime} \\geq 0$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ and there exists no open interval on which $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0$. Set $s=-r$ as in the proof of Claim 1. Since $\\rho>0$ and $\\dot{\\rho}<0$, we have $\\rho \\searrow c(\\geq 0)$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $\\dot{\\rho} \\nearrow 0$ as $s \\nearrow+\\infty$.\n\nCase $1 c>0$. By (4.1), $\\ddot{\\rho}$ need to converse to some constant $C(\\geq 0)$. If $C>0$, since $\\dot{\\rho}<0$, we have a contradiction. If $C=0$, we have $\\lambda c^{2}=\\bar{R}$.\n\nCase $2 c=0$. By (4.1) again, since $\\ddot{\\rho} \\geq 0, \\bar{R}$ must be zero.\nTherefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}=\\lambda \\lim _{r \\rightarrow-\\infty} \\rho^{2}(r)\n$$\n\nand $F^{\\prime}(r)>\\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar{R}}{\\lambda}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n1.
