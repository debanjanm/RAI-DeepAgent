{"title": "Proof of the Stokes conjecture for compressible gravity water waves", "sections": [{"section_id": 0, "text": "#### Abstract\n\nIn 1880, Stokes [Mathematical and Physical Papers, Vol I, 1880] examined an incompressible irrotational periodic traveling water wave under the influence of gravity and conjectured the existence of an extreme wave with a corner of $120^{\\circ}$ at the crest. The first rigorous proof of the conjecture was given by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland [Acta Math., 148, 1982], as well as by Plotnikov independently [Dinamika Sploshn. Sredy., 57, 1982] via the Nekrasov integral equation. In the early 2010s, Weiss and V\u0103rv\u0103ruc\u0103 [Acta Math., 206(2), 2011] revisited the conjecture by applying a new geometric method, which provided an affirmative answer to the conjecture without requiring structural assumptions such as the isolation of the stagnation points, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface that were necessary in the previous works.\n\nThe main purpose of this paper is to establish the validity of the Stokes conjecture in the context of compressible gravity water waves. More precisely, we prove that a sharp crest forms near each stagnation point of a compressible gravity water wave with an included angle of $120^{\\circ}$, which gives a first proof to the compressible counterpart of the classical conjecture by Stokes in 1880.\n\nThe central aspect of our approach is the discovery of a new monotonicity formula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoullitype. Another observation is the introduction of a new nonlinear frequency formula, along with a compensated compactness argument for the compressible Euler system. The developed monotonicity formula enables us to do blow-up analysis at each stagnation point and helps us obtain the singular profile of the free surface near each stagnation point. The use of these two new mathematical tools, along with a compensated compactness argument for compressible Euler system, helps us establish the validity of the Stokes conjecture for compressible gravity water wave.\n\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ School of Mathematical Sciences,Shenzhen University,China\n    ${ }^{2}$ College of Mathematics, Sichuan University, Sichuan,China\n    E-mail addresses: dulili@scu.edu.cn, cl_yang@hotmail.com.\n    2020 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Stokes studied the free interface of an incompressible inviscid fluid in two dimensions under the influence of gravity, traveling in permanent form with a constant velocity. He was uncertain about shape profile of the wave at the crest and made the following conjecture in his paper [56, pp.225-228].\n... After careful consideration I feel satisfied that there is no such earlier limit, but that we may actually approach as near\n\nas we please to the form in which the curvature at the vertex becomes infinite, and the vertex becomes a multiple point where the two branches with which alone we are concerned enclose an angle of $120^{\\circ} \\ldots$\nThe formation of a $120^{\\circ}$ corner at the crests of the interface between air and water has famously been referred to as the Stokes conjecture. The incompressible case of the conjecture was proven in [6] and [52, 53] when assuming the isolation of stagnation points, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface, and later proven in [60] without assuming the above structural assumptions. The aim of this paper is to give an affirmative answer to the following question:\nQ: Does the Stokes conjecture hold for compressible gravity water waves? We will first formulate the problem and present the main results of the paper. The related results in the literature will be discussed in detail later.\n1.1. Two dimensional compressible gravity water waves. The compressible water wave problem in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is described as follows (see [45, 47, Sect.1] for models in dimensions $n \\geqslant 2$ ). Let $\\mathcal{D}(t):=\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: x_{2} \\leqslant S\\left(t, x_{1}\\right)\\right\\}$ represent the domain occupied by the fluid at the fixed time $t$, where $S$ denotes the interface between the fluid and the air. The boundary $\\partial \\mathcal{D}(t):=$ $\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right): x_{2}=S\\left(t, x_{1}\\right)\\right\\}$ of $\\mathcal{D}(t)$ moves with the velocity of the fluid. The motion of the fluid is then described by the Euler equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\partial_{t} v+(v \\cdot \\nabla) v=-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p-g \\mathbf{e}_{2} & \\text { in } \\mathcal{D} \\\\ \\partial_{t} \\rho+(v \\cdot \\nabla) \\rho+\\rho \\operatorname{div} v=0 & \\text { in } \\mathcal{D}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ represents the velocity, $p$ the pressure, $\\mathbf{e}_{2}=(0,1)^{\\top}, \\rho$ the fluid density and $g>0$ the gravitation constant. Here in (1.1), $\\mathcal{D}:=\\cup_{t \\in[0, T]}\\{t\\} \\times$ $\\mathcal{D}(t)$. The equation of the state is given by\n\n$$\np\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)=0, \\quad p=p(\\rho), \\quad p^{\\prime}(\\rho)>0 \\text { for } \\rho \\geqslant \\bar{\\rho}_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\rho}_{0}:=\\left.\\rho\\right|_{\\partial \\mathcal{D}}$ is a nonnegative constant, which is in the case of liquid (as opposed to the gas case). It should be noted that water satisfies (1.2) (cf. [44, pp.283]).\n\nThe sound speed $c(\\rho)$ of the flow and the Mach number are given by\n\n$$\nc(\\rho)=\\sqrt{p^{\\prime}(\\rho)} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad M=\\frac{q}{c(\\rho)}\n$$\n\nrespectively. Here $q=\\sqrt{u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}}$ denotes the flow speed. We further assume that the flow is irrotational,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{curl} v=0\n$$\n\nIn this paper, we confine ourselves to traveling-wave solutions of (1.1), where there exist $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}, c_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\tilde{v}$ and $\\tilde{\\rho}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}=D+c_{0} t(1,0) \\quad \\text { for all } t \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nv\\left(t, x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)=\\tilde{v}\\left(x_{1}-c_{0} t, x_{2}\\right)+c_{0}(1,0)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(t, x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)=\\tilde{\\rho}\\left(x_{1}-c_{0} t, x_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{D}(t)$. By taking away the tildes above the variables $(\\tilde{v}, \\tilde{\\rho})$ for the sake of the notation, we obtain the corresponding stationary system\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}(v \\cdot \\nabla) v=-\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p-g \\mathbf{e}_{2} & \\text { in } D \\\\ \\rho \\operatorname{div} v+(v \\cdot \\nabla) \\rho=0 & \\text { in } D \\\\ \\operatorname{curl} v=0 & \\text { in } D\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe denote the boundary that is free and in contact with the air by $\\partial_{a} D$. Then\n\n$$\n\\rho=\\bar{\\rho}_{0} \\quad \\text { on } \\partial_{a} D\n$$\n\nBesides, the following slip boundary condition is also achieved on $\\partial_{a} D$. That is,\n\n$$\nv \\cdot \\nu=0 \\quad \\text { on } \\partial_{a} D\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu$ is the outer normal vector on $\\partial_{a} D$. It follows from the first equation in (1.3) that the following so called Bernoulli law holds.\n\n$$\n\\frac{q^{2}}{2}+h(\\rho)+g x_{2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2} \\quad \\text { in } D\n$$\n\nwhere $h(\\rho):=\\int_{\\bar{\\rho}_{0}}^{\\rho} \\frac{p^{\\prime}(s)}{s} d s$ is the enthalpy of the flow. It can be seen that $h^{\\prime}(\\rho)>0$ and $\\left.h\\right|_{\\partial_{a} D}=0$ thanks to (1.4). Therefore, equation (1.5) on the free surface is expressed as\n\n$$\nq^{2}=p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)-2 g x_{2} \\quad \\text { on } \\partial_{a} D\n$$\n\nFurthermore, we impose the following natural conditions on the pressure $p(\\rho)$,\n\n$$\n2 p^{\\prime}(\\rho)+\\rho p^{\\prime \\prime}(\\rho)>0 \\quad \\text { for all } \\rho \\geqslant \\bar{\\rho}_{0}\n$$\n\nNote that (1.7) implies that the function $s \\mapsto\\left(\\frac{p^{\\prime}(s)}{2}+h(s)\\right)$ is nonnegative and nondecreasing. Therefore, it follows from (1.5) that for every fixed $x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in D$ there exists a unique $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ and $\\rho_{\\max , x_{2}}$ so that,\n\n$$\n\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)}{2}+h\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)+g x_{2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nh\\left(\\rho_{\\max , x_{2}}\\right)+g x_{2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2}\n$$\n\nBy introducing $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ into (1.5) gives a unique local critical speed $q_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ at the point $x \\in D$, and we say that the fluid is subsonic locally at the point $x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in D$ if and only if the speed $q(x)<q_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$. Additionally, it is easy to deduce from (1.8) and (1.9) that $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}<\\rho_{\\max , x_{2}}$ for every $x \\in D$.\n\nLet us note that a significant distinction between critical variables defined above and that in the classical compressible hydrodynamics (cf. [8, pp.7]) is that, in the absence of external body forces (e.g. the gravity), the critical (maximal) variables are independent of the vertical coordinates and remain a constant value throughout the entire flow region $D$. In contrast, the critical momentum $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}} q_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ varies at each specific point $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in D$ within the water phase.\n1.2. A quasilinear free boundary problem. In this subsection, we will apply the derived quantities $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ and $\\rho_{\\max , x_{2}}$ to formulate the problem as a one-phase quasilinear free boundary problem. Based on the continuity equation, the so-called Stokes stream function $\\psi\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)$ can be introduced so that $\\nabla \\psi=\\left(-\\rho v_{2}, \\rho v_{1}\\right)$. Suppose now that $\\psi>0$ in $D$ and we extend $\\psi$ by the value of 0 to the region so that the fluid domain $D$ can be identified with the set $\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right): \\psi\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)>0\\right\\}$, denoted as $\\{\\psi>0\\}$. In terms of $\\psi,(1.5)$ and (1.6) give\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}}{2 \\rho^{2}}+h(\\rho)+g x_{2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2} & \\text { in }\\{\\psi>0\\} \\\\\n|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2}\\left(p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)-2 g x_{2}\\right) & \\text { on } \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nRegarding the first equation in (1.10) as\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\rho ; x_{2}\\right)-t=0\n$$\n\nwhere $t:=|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{F}\\left(\\rho ; x_{2}\\right):=2 \\rho^{2}\\left(\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2}-g x_{2}-h(\\rho)\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows from (1.8) and a direct calculation that\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\rho} \\mathscr{F}\\left(\\rho ; x_{2}\\right)=2 \\rho\\left[p^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)+2 h\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)-\\left(p^{\\prime}(\\rho)+2 h(\\rho)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThus, $\\partial_{\\rho} \\mathscr{F}<0$ whenever $\\rho>\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$. By the inverse function theorem, the density $\\rho$ can be expressed as a continuously differentiable function with respect to $|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}$ and $x_{2}$, so that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)}{\\partial\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}\\right)}=\\frac{1}{2 \\rho\\left[p^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)+2 h\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)-\\left(p^{\\prime}(\\rho)+2 h(\\rho)\\right)\\right]}<0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)}{\\partial x_{2}}=\\frac{\\rho g}{\\left[p^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)+2 h\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)-\\left(p^{\\prime}(\\rho)+2 h(\\rho)\\right)\\right]}<0\n$$\n\nwhenever $\\rho>\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$. Recalling the last equation in (1.3) and the definition of the $\\psi$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi}{\\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)}\\right)=0 \\quad \\text { in }\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nThis, together with the second equation in (1.10), gives the following free boundary problem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi}{\\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)}\\right)=0 & \\text { in } \\Omega \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\} \\\\ |\\nabla \\psi|^{2}=2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right) & \\text { on } \\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{2}^{\\text {st }}:=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2 g}$ and $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is some bounded domain which satisfies $\\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{2}=x_{2}^{\\text {st }}\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n1.3. Subsonic state near the stagnation points. In this subsection, we analyze the state of the flow near the stagnation points of a compressible gravity water wave. A stagnation point is a point at which the relative velocity vector is the zero vector. In other words, if we denote the stagnation point as $x^{\\text {st }}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\text {st }}, x_{2}^{\\text {st }}\\right)$, then $\\left|\\nabla \\psi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}\\right)\\right|=0$. In this paper, we focus on the stagnation points located on the free boundary. Thanks to (1.4), we have that $\\left.h\\right|_{\\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}}=0$. Thus we infer from (1.8) that\n\n$$\n\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)}{2}+g x_{2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2} \\quad \\text { on } \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nIf now $x^{\\circ}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}, x_{2}^{\\circ}\\right) \\in \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ is a sonic free boundary point, we can deduce from $\\rho=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}$ on $\\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$, equation (1.6), as well as $q^{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)=$ $c^{2}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)=p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)$ that $x_{2}^{\\circ}=0$. This indicates that the sonic free boundary points are necessarily located on the line $\\left\\{x_{2}=0\\right\\}$. Besides, equation (1.14) implies that $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}^{\\circ}}<\\bar{\\rho}_{0}$ for $x_{2}^{\\circ}>0$. Since $x_{2}^{\\text {st }}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2 g}>0$, we expect that the flow is subsonic at the stagnation point. However, it should be noted that the equation (1.14) does not define $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}}$, so we need first to define the number $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}}$. Differentiating (1.14) with respect to $x_{2}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{p^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right)}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}}{\\partial x_{2}}+g=0 \\quad \\text { on } \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nThe assumption (1.7) gives $p^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}\\right) \\geqslant 0$, and this together with (1.15), gives $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}<0$. We see that the function $x_{2} \\mapsto \\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ satisfies the following two properties:\n(1) $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, 0}=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}$ for $x^{\\circ}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}, 0\\right) \\in \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$.\n\n(2) $\\frac{\\partial \\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}}{\\partial x_{2}}<0$ for all $x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$.\n\nThe second property implies that the number $\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}}=\\inf _{0 \\leqslant x_{2} \\leqslant x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ is well-defined and achieves its minimum at $x_{2}=x_{2}^{\\text {st }}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right)=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}>\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}}\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that (1.16) implies that the flow is subsonic at the stagnation point. We next claim that if the flow is subsonic at a free boundary point, then there exists a small neighborhood so that the flow remains uniformly subsonic in that neighborhood.\nLemma 1.1. Let $x^{\\circ}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}, x_{2}^{\\circ}\\right) \\in \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ be a subsonic free boundary point, then there exists a small ball $B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$ so that $\\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)>\\rho_{\\mathrm{cr}, x_{2}}$ for all $x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right) \\in B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nThe proof will be given in Appendix A.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2. Main results and overview of the approach \n\nOur main purpose in this paper is to investigate the singular shape of the free surface near the stagnation points of a compressible gravity water wave. Our first result focuses on the case when $\\{\\psi=0\\}$ consists of only a finite number of connected components.\n\nTheorem A. Let $\\psi$ be a subsonic weak solution of\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi}{\\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)}\\right)=0 & \\text { in } \\Omega \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\} \\\\ |\\nabla \\psi|^{2}=2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right) & \\text { on } \\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{2}^{\\text {st }}:=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2 g}$ and $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a bounded domain so that $\\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{2}=\\right.$ $\\left.x_{2}^{\\text {st }}\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing$. Suppose that\n\n$$\n|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} \\leqslant 2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { in } \\Omega \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nand assume additionally that $\\{\\psi=0\\}$ has locally only finite many connected components. Then the set $S$ of stagnation points is locally in $\\Omega$ a finite set. At each stagnation point $x^{\\text {st }}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\text {st }}, x_{2}^{\\text {st }}\\right)$ the scaled solution $\\psi_{r}(x):=$ $\\frac{\\psi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}+r x\\right)}{r^{3 / 2}}$ converges strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$ and locally uniformly on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to the Stokes corner asymptotics. That is,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\psi_{r}(x) & \\rightarrow \\psi_{0}(R, \\theta) \\\\\n& \\equiv \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\bar{\\rho}_{0} \\sqrt{2 g} R^{3 / 2} \\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\min \\left\\{\\max \\left\\{\\theta,-\\frac{5 \\pi}{6}\\right\\},-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right\\}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, where $x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)=(R \\cos \\theta, R \\sin \\theta)$. Moreover, in an open neighborhood of $x^{\\text {st }}$ the topological free boundary $\\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ is the union of two $C^{1}$-graphs with right and left tangents at $x^{\\text {st }}$.\n\nRemark 2.1. The limit function $\\psi_{0}(R, \\theta)$ is a piecewise function given by (see Figure 1)\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1.

Weak solutions of the quasilinear elliptic free boundary problems were first investigated by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman [3], who studied non-negative solutions $\\psi \\in C^{0}(\\Omega)$ that solve a quasilinear elliptic equation in $\\Omega \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}$, as well as exhibit a non-degeneracy property at each point on $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$. They proved that the free boundary has locally finite $\\mathcal{H}^{1}$ measure and that the free boundary is smooth outside stagnation points. Prior to this work, studies have been conducted on weak solutions of quasilinear free boundary problems involving various operators, including the $p$-Laplacian [22], and an interesting non-homogeneous operator which behaves differently when the gradient is close to zero or infinite [49]. These results conclude that the free boundary is smooth when $|\\nabla \\psi| \\geqslant c_{0}>0$ on $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$. However, there is a certain loss of regularity in the free boundary when the gradient is zero on it. In fact, according to Hopf's boundary point lemma, at any regular free boundary point, one has $|\\nabla \\psi|=-\\psi_{\\nu}>0$, where $\\nu$ is the outward normal. Therefore, if the free boundary touches a point $x^{\\text {st }}$ where the gradient vanishes, then $x^{\\text {st }}$ cannot be a regular point. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on the free boundary near degenerate points (where gradients vanish) for quasilinear free boundary problems.\n\nLet us remark that the growth assumption\n\n$$\n|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} \\leqslant 2 \\hat{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { in } \\Omega \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nis imposed (not same but a similar version) on the study of Stokes conjecture for incompressible flows [60], and it is also assumed when investigating\n\nstagnation points for incompressible rotational water waves [61]. For compressible flows, (2.1) states that the density $\\rho$ of the fluid reaches its minimum value near the stagnation points on the free surface. Indeed, let us consider a small neighborhood $B$ of $x^{\\text {st }}$, and let $x \\in B \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}$ be a point that is close to $x^{\\text {st }}$. Since the flow is uniformly subsonic in $B$, we can infer that $t \\mapsto \\rho(t ; \\cdot)$ strictly decreases in $\\tilde{B} \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}$. This, combined with (2.1) gives that\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right) \\geqslant \\rho\\left(2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g\\left(x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right) ; x_{2}\\right)=\\bar{\\rho}_{0} \\quad \\text { in } \\tilde{B} \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}\n$$\n\nIn this way, we see that\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\tilde{B} \\cap\\{\\psi>0\\}} \\rho\\left(|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} ; x_{2}\\right)=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\n$$\n\nWe note that (2.2) has been validated in the context of compressible flows under certain physical boundary conditions $[5,17,18]$.\n\nIn this paper, we also consider the case when $\\{\\psi=0\\}$ consists of an infinite number of connected components.\n\nTheorem B.

Moreover, At each point $x^{\\text {st }}=\\left(x_{1}^{\\text {st }}, x_{2}^{\\text {st }}\\right)$ of $S \\backslash \\Sigma$, the rescaled function $\\psi_{r}(x):=\\frac{\\psi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}+r x\\right)}{r^{3 / 2}}$ converges strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$ and locally uniformly on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to the Stokes corner asymptotics.

Figure 1].\n\nNote that Theorem A and Theorem B not only recover the results in [60, Theorem A and Theorem B], but also extend the scenario from incompressible irrotational gravity flows to compressible irrotational ones. It is worth noting that when the free boundary is assumed to have a simple topological structure (for instance, being a continuous injective curve), its asymptotic behavior at the stagnation points can be explicitly graphed.\nTheorem C.

Suppose that $C_{0}=2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g$ in (2.3), then the case (1B) is excluded.\n(3). Suppose additionally that $\\{\\psi=0\\}$ has locally finite many connected components, then the case (1C) is excluded. And the set of stagnation points is locally in $\\Omega$ a finite set, and at each stagnation point $x^{\\text {st }}$ only the case (1A) holds.\n\nLet us remark that the cusp asymptotics (please see Figure 3) have two possibilities since it is unknown beforehand whether it points in the $x_{1}$ or $-x_{1}$ direction. The profiles of Stokes corner flow and horizontal flatness are symmetric. The cusp singularity and the horizontal flat singularity, which are not suggested by physical intuition, should also be noted. For incompressible gravity water waves, the cusp singularity is excluded when the flow is irrotational, regardless of whether it is two or three-dimensional axisymmetric flows [60,62]. The exclusion of it relies on the strong Bernstein estimates (see [60, Lemma 4.4] and [62, Remark 3.5]) for gravity water waves. In the context of compressible flows, the assumption (2.3) for $C_{0}=2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g$ is somewhat equivalent to the strong Bernstein estimates.\n\nThe analysis of the horizontal flat singularity is also not an easy task, relying on both our monotonicity formula and a new frequency formula for the compressible problems. The study of the frequency formula was dated back to the analysis of $Q$-valued harmonic functions [1]. Some recent developments have extended the classical formula from the Laplacian equations to include elliptic equations with more general semilinearities $[60,61,62,27,32]$. In this paper, we extend it to the quasilinear problem. With the aid of the new frequency formula and by employing the compensated compactness argument for compressible Euler flows, we will demonstrate that a horizontal flat singularity is impossible in the case of a finite number of air components.\n2.1. State of art. In this subsection, we provide an overview of the state of the art of the approach taken in this paper. Firstly, it is noteworthy that the quasilinear problem (1.13) has a variational structure, see [3, 5]. This means that the solutions of (1.13) can be found as minimizers of the corresponding energy functional. However, we are interested in solutions that are not minimizers of the energy functional. This is because both absolute minimizers and viscosity solutions are unsuitable for investigating singularities in Bernoulli problems since they would lead to the flat solution, e.g. [7, 39]. We also address that for solutions that are not minimizers, common properties such as non-degeneracy are not expected at all. In this paper, we focus on a broader class of solutions known as subsonic variational solutions, which are suitable for studying singularities in water wave problems [66]. They are defined in our context to solve the equation in terms of the first domain variation (see Definition 4.6), while also incorporating additional information such as nonnegativity and the uniform subsonic condition. In order to study the singular asymptotics at the stagnation points, our intention is to classify each subsonic variational solutions that remains invariant under the scaling of the equation. Here, we encounter our first obstacle, which\n\nis the absence of a Weiss-type monotonicity formula for the quasilinear elliptic equations. The Weiss-type monotonicity formula, first developed by Weiss in $[64,65]$, gave the following deep observation: for two-dimensional irrotational water wave problem, if $\\psi$ is a variational solution of\n\n$$\nJ(\\psi ; \\Omega):=\\int_{\\Omega}|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}+x_{2} \\chi_{\\{\\psi>0\\}} d x\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi_{\\{\\psi>0\\}}=1$ when $x \\in\\{\\psi>0\\}$ and 0 otherwise. Then at each stagnation point $x^{\\text {st }} \\in \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ (in the sense that $\\left|\\nabla \\psi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}\\right)\\right|=0$ ) the function\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}, \\psi ; r\\right):=r^{-3} J\\left(\\psi ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right)\\right)-r^{-4} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right)} u^{2} d S\n$$\n\nis increasing in $r$, see [60, Theorem 3.5, Boundary case]. Moreover, we have that $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}, \\psi ; r\\right)$ is constant if and only if $\\psi$ is a homogeneous solution of degree $3 / 2$. Indeed, let us consider the following rescaling at any stagnation point $x^{\\text {st }}$\n\n$$\n\\psi_{m}(x)=\\frac{\\psi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}+r_{m} x\\right)}{r_{m}^{3 / 2}} \\quad \\text { for } r_{m}>0\n$$\n\nIt is easy to check that\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(0, \\psi_{m} ; r\\right)=\\Phi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}, \\psi ; r r_{m}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, if $\\psi_{m} \\rightarrow \\psi_{0}$ strongly in $W_{\\text {loc }}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$ as $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(0, \\psi_{0} ; r\\right)=\\Phi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}} ; \\psi ; 0\\right), \\quad \\text { for any } r>0\n$$\n\nOn the one hand, the existence of $\\Phi\\left(0, \\psi_{0} ; r\\right)$ is due to the monotonicity of $\\Phi(\\cdot, \\cdot ; r)$ with respect to $r$. On the other hand, (2.5) allows us to classify variational solutions that are homogeneous functions of degree $3 / 2$. In our context, however, the governing equation for compressible irrotational flows is a quasilinear equation and the energy $J(\\psi ; \\Omega)$ takes the form (please refer to $\\S 4$ for the derivation)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ(\\psi ; \\Omega) & =\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\left|\\nabla \\psi\\right|^{2}}{2 \\rho_{0}^{2} g}} \\frac{d \\tau}{\\rho\\left(2 \\rho_{0}^{2} g \\tau ; x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right)} d x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\Omega} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\left|\\nabla \\psi\\right|^{2}}{2 \\rho_{0}^{2} g}}\\left[\\frac{x_{2}}{\\rho_{0}}+\\int_{0}^{x_{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho\\left(2 \\rho_{0}^{2} g \\tau ; x_{2}^{\\mathrm{st}}-x_{2}\\right)}\\right) \\tau d \\tau\\right] \\chi_{\\{\\psi>0\\}} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{2}^{\\text {st }}:=\\frac{\\rho^{\\prime}\\left(\\rho_{0}\\right)}{2 g}$. The variational structure in this setting is not invariant under the $3 / 2$-homogeneous rescaling (2.4) due to the non-homogeneity\n\nof the governing operator. This lack of rescaling invariance makes it difficult to obtain any information from compactness arguments, such as (2.5). However, in this paper, we observe that\n(1) The energy given in (2.6) consists of a homogeneous part $J_{\\text {Hom }}(\\psi ; \\Omega)$ (the precise definition can be found in Remark 4.12, see (4.18)), which possesses a similar rescaling invariant property as the incompressible case.\n(2) The difference between (2.6) and $J_{\\text {Hom }}(\\psi ; \\Omega)$ is small near the stagnation points. In particular, if we introduce the blow-up sequence (2.4) into this difference, we prove that this difference tends to zero as $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$.\n\nThese two observations are the highlight of this work. Another Gordian knot is that, unlike the incompressible problems, we currently do not know what kind of energy should be subtracted from (2.6), so that $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}, u ; r\\right)$, which is defined as their difference, becomes monotone. Various energies tried by the authors turned out not to work due to the presence of nonintegrable additional terms in the monotone quantity $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\Phi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}, u ; r\\right)$. The most significant and original contribution in this work is that\n\n- The energy $r^{-3} J\\left(\\psi ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\text {st }}\\right)\\right)$ where $J$ is defined in (2.6) becomes monotone when subtracting the Weiss-type boundary adjusted $L^{2}$ energy $r^{-4} \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\text {st }}\\right)} \\psi^{2} d S$.\n\nThis is because that we have encountered a difference in density between the flow region and that on the free boundary. This difference provides an additional decay that helps us overcome the non-integrable terms in $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}, \\psi ; r\\right)$. Based on these new findings, we successfully establish our first new result: a Weiss-type monotonicity formula for $J(\\psi ; \\Omega)$ near the stagnation points (presented in Proposition 4.10).\n\nLet us remark that the robust structure underlying the Euler system notably facilitates our establishment of the first monotonicity formula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoulli-type. To the authors' current knowledge, there is no general method for constructing monotonicity formulae for nonlinear free boundary problems, see [54]. However, we believe that our method can be developed to construct monotonicity formulae for general quasilinear problems of the Bernoulli-type and we leave it to the future work.\n\nIt should also be noted that unlike the incompressible problem, the derivative of $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\text {st }}, u ; r\\right)$ with respect to $r$ is non-negative. Our formula for compressible flows has some additional terms that naturally account for the density variation within the fluid region, see for instance (4.15) and (4.16)\n\nin Proposition 4.10. These additional terms introduces new difficulties in obtaining the limit $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}, u ; 0^{+}\\right)$as well as the homogeneity of blow-up $u_{0}$. We have conducted a thorough analysis of these additional terms and demonstrated that they are integrable under the growth condition of solutions (presented in Lemma 5.1). Let us also remark that the developed monotonicity formula opens up the toolbox of blow-up techniques, with which to pry the geometry of the singular profile near the stagnation points. In this way, we classify each subsonic variational solution of the form (2.4) (presented in Lemma 5.1) using our new monotonicity formula. Furthermore, we prove that our subsonic variational solutions converge to the variational solutions defined in [60, Definition 3.1] (presented in Lemma 5.4). Lastly, we calculate the corresponding PDE for the blow-up $\\psi_{0}(x)$ to derive all possible singular asymptotics near the stagnation points in two dimensions (presented in Proposition 5.5).\n\nAt this stage, we classify each stagnation point (see Definition 6.1) as either non-degenerate stagnation points or degenerate stagnation points. This classification mainly depends on whether the blow-up $\\psi_{0}$ is trivial and degenerate or not, as defined in $\\S 7$ (cf. equation (6.1)). At each non-degenerate stagnation point, we prove in Lemma 6.4 that the only possible asymptotic profile is the Stokes corner flow. Moreover, we prove in Proposition 6.5 that the non-degenerate stagnation point is isolated.\n\nIn the penultimate section (\u00a7 7) of the paper, our objective is to exclude singular asymptotics that are not suggested by physical intuition. These asymptotics occur at degenerate stagnation points, and examples of such singular asymptotics include the \"cusp\" and \"horizontal flatness\", as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 in Theorem C. Note that in these cases, we all have that the blow-up $\\psi_{0} \\equiv 0$, which implies that the decay rate of the solutions at the degenerate stagnation points is strictly higher than $\\mid x-$ $\\left.x^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right|^{3 / 2}$. The only difference between two types of degenerate stagnation points is highlighted by their corresponding \"weighted densities\". More precisely, the cusp singularity corresponds to a \"weighted density\" of value 0 , while the horizontal flat singularity occurs when the weighted density takes on the value $\\frac{2}{3 \\rho_{0}}$ (presented in Proposition 5.5).\n\nInspired by [60, Lemma 4.4], we exclude the cusp singularity by imposing a strong Bernstein estimate in the fluid region (as presented in Lemma 7.2).\n\nThe exclusion of the horizontal flat singularity remains to be addressed. In this case, the situation is more akin to analyze those degenerate free boundary points with the highest density, see [67] for a similar case.\n\nIn particular, we study the rescaled solutions of the new form\n\n$$\n\\psi_{r}(x):=\\frac{\\psi\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}+r x\\right)}{\\sqrt{r^{-3} \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right)} \\psi^{2} d S}}\n$$\n\nWe aim to study the limit of $\\psi_{r}$ as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$. To do so, we first construct a new frequency formula (presented in Theorem 7.7) to examine the compactness of $\\psi_{r}$. We apply our frequency formula to prove that $\\psi_{r}$ is bounded in $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ (presented in Proposition 7.12). This allows $\\psi_{r}$ to have weak a limit $\\psi_{0}$ in the space $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$. However, in order to pass to the limit in the domain variation formula for $\\psi_{r}$, we need the strong convergence. Here we encounter our another obstacle: how to improve the weak convergence of $\\psi_{r}$ to strong convergence? In the case of incompressible flows, the concentration compactness method is applied [34], which relies on the structure of incompressible Euler equations and achieves convergence of the non-linear quadratic terms $\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\left(u_{1}^{\\mathrm{m}}, u_{2}^{\\mathrm{m}}\\right) \\otimes\\left(u_{1}^{\\mathrm{m}}, u_{2}^{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)\\right)$ in the sense of distributions as $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$. To preserve such property in compressible flows, we adopt the ideas of compensated compactness for the compressible Euler system [15]. The elegant mathematical theory of compensated compactness method was developed by Murat [51] and Tartar [57] in 1970s to solve nonlinear partial differential equations. This compactness argument helps us to avoid possible concentration issues that can lead to the failure of strong convergence. The strong convergence of $\\psi_{r}$ to $\\psi_{0}$ in $W^{1,2}$ gives us the governing equation of $\\psi_{0}$. Thus, in turn, suggests that if the air region consists of only a finite number of components, then the horizontal flatness is impossible (as presented in Theorem 8.2).\n2.2. History and background. Euler equations involving a free boundary have been studied by many authors. The first breakthrough in the global well-posedness for the incompressible and irrotational problem with prescribed general data is due to Wu [68, 69]. The local well-posedness for the free boundary compressible gas model was obtained in [20, 21, 41, 42, 48]. The local well-posedness for the free boundary compressible liquid model with a bounded fluid domain is obtained in [19, 25, 38, 44, 46]. We also refer to [59] for an existence result when the fluid domain in unbounded.\n\nThe research on subsonic flows also has a long history. The global wellposedness of steady subsonic potential flows past a given two-dimensional body was established by Bers [8] in 1954. Later in 1957, Finn and Gilbarg [35] obtained the far fields behavior for a subsonic flow past a profile. The studies related to the three-dimensional flows were due to Finn and Gilbarg [36] and Dong [26]. Concerning the supersonic flow past bodies, Chen, Xin and Yin the global existence for supersonic flow past a perturbed\n\ncone in [16]. Xin et al established the existence and nonexistence of transonic shock in [73]. Chen and his co-authors [15] further extended the study to subsonic-soinc flows using the compensated compactness method. The approach was later generalized to higher dimensional subsonic-sonic flows [13]. The well-posedness of compressible flow in general nozzles has been established in a series of works by Xin and his collaborators [70, 71, 72, 73, 74]. The existence and uniqueness of subsonic irrotational flows in a finitely long nozzle with variable end pressure were studied in [28], we also refer to [63] for subsonic-sonic flows in a convergent nozzle. If the readers are interested on this topic, we recommend referring to the research on subsonic-sonic potential flows in higher dimensions [30], and also [29] when the vorticity is taken into consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, we focus on the singular profile of the one-phase Bernoulli problem from the point view of Calculus of Variations. The onephase Bernoulli problems were first investigated by Alt and Caffarelli in their seminal paper [2]. They studied the minimization problem $\\int|\\nabla \\psi|^{2} d x+$ $|\\{\\psi>0\\}| \\rightarrow \\min$ and proved the existence of weak solutions in the sense of distributions. They also established the regularity of the free boundary $\\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ up to a set of vanishing $\\mathcal{H}^{1}$-dimensional. The method was further developed to the two-phase case [4], and additional research on Bernoulli problems in higher dimensions can be found in [12]. The class of solutions closest to minimizers is viscosity solutions, as they possess inherit stability. The viscosity approach to classical one-phase Bernoulli problems was later developed in a series of seminal works [9, 10, 11]. The approach was later generalized by De Silva [23] through the introduction of a new partial boundary Harnack. Neither absolute minimizers nor viscosity solutions are suitable for application to water waves as they would result in trivial flat waves. A better option would be variational solutions. The investigation of variational solutions was initiated by Weiss [64], who studied the size and the structure of the free boundary in Bernoulli problems at which no outer normal exists.\n\nTo conclude this section, we briefly introduce the Stokes conjecture for incompressible extreme waves (i.e., the water wave with stagnation points). The starting point of the proof of the conjecture was in 1992, where Nekrasov applied a hodograph transformation to formulate the problem as an integral equation for a function $\\theta_{\\nu}(s)$, which represents the angle between the tangent to the free boundary and the horizontal line.\n\n$$\n\\theta_{\\nu}(s)=\\frac{1}{3 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\sin \\theta_{\\nu}(t)}{\\nu^{-1}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\sin \\theta_{\\nu}(u) d u} \\log \\left|\\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2}(s+t)}{\\sin \\frac{1}{2}(s-t)}\\right| d t, \\quad s \\in[0, \\pi]\n$$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is a parameter that depends on the period of the wave and the wave speed. The first existence result for solutions of Nekrasov's integral equation with $\\nu>0$ is due to Krasovski [43]. Later, Toland [58] and McLeod [50] proved that if the limit of $\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\theta_{0}(s)$ exists, it must be $\\pi / 6$. The existence of the limit was independently proven by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland [6], as well as Plotnikov [52]. The convexity of the Stokes waves was proved by Plotnikov and Toland in their work [55].\n\nWe emphasize that the proofs mentioned above rely on certain structural assumptions, including isolated stagnation points, as well as symmetry and monotonicity of the free surface. However, in a notable breakthrough over the past decade, V\u00e1rv\u00e1ruc\u00e1 and Weiss revisited this conjecture from a geometric point of view and successfully established its validity without requiring any structural assumptions regarding isolated singularities, symmetry, or monotonicity of the free surface. The new geometric approach developed by V\u00e1rv\u00e1ruc\u00e1 and Weiss employs a purely variational method to analyze singularities in one-phase Bernoulli problems. One of the key aspects of their theory is the use of a monotonicity formula and a frequency formula at stagnation points. By imposing suitable growth conditions on solutions, they applied the monotonicity formula to demonstrate that the sequence of approximating solutions uniformly converges to a homogeneous harmonic function of degree $3 / 2$. They work on original variables and their approach is very close to Stokes origin idea: approximating the stream function by homogeneous functions. However, it should be noted that the absence of structure gives rise to other types of singular profiles at the stagnation points, such as a \"cusp\" and a \"horizontal flatness\". The novelty in their work lies in the introduction of powerful tools such as monotonicity formula and frequency formula to properly deal with these singularities. Their work presents a general approach that can be applied in various contexts, including rotational incompressible waves [61], axisymmetric gravity flows without vorticity [62], as well as axisymmetric inviscid flows with vorticity [27, 32].", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-0.jpeg":

Here $\\Omega$ is a bounded domain\n\nin $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which has a non-empty intersection with the hyperplane $\\left\\{y_{n}=y_{n}^{\\text {st }}\\right\\}$. $\\bar{\\rho}_{0}$ is the constant density on the free boundary $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{\\psi>0\\}$ and\n\n$$\ny_{n}^{\\text {st }}:=\\frac{p^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{\\rho}_{0}\\right)}{2 g}>0\n$$\n\nIntroduce a set of new coordinates as $x^{\\prime}=y^{\\prime}$ and $x_{n}=y_{n}^{\\text {st }}-y_{n}$. For $y_{n} \\leqslant y_{n}^{\\text {st }}$ we consider the scaled functions\n\n$$\nu\\left(x^{\\prime}, x_{n}\\right)=\\frac{\\psi\\left(x^{\\prime}, y_{n}^{\\text {st }}-x_{n}\\right)}{\\bar{\\rho}_{0}(2 g)^{1 / 2}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad H\\left(t ; x_{n}\\right)=\\rho\\left(2 \\bar{\\rho}_{0}^{2} g t ; y_{n}^{\\text {st }}-x_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the new frame $x=\\left(x^{\\prime}, x_{n}\\right)$, we have by a direct calculation that (3.1) becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u(x)}{H\\left(|\\nabla u(x)|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)=0 & \\text { in } \\tilde{\\Omega} \\cap\\{u>0\\} \\\\ |\\nabla u(x)|^{2}=x_{n} & \\text { on } \\tilde{\\Omega} \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIt should be noted that the stagnation points are now located on the line $\\left\\{x_{n}=0\\right\\}$ and $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ is a bounded domain so that $\\tilde{\\Omega} \\cap\\left\\{x_{n}=0\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing$. We then summarize some fundamental properties that will be frequently used throughout the rest of the paper.\n\nLemma 3.1. Let $x^{\\circ} \\in \\partial\\{u>0\\}$ be a point with $x_{n}^{\\circ}=0$, let $\\delta_{0}:=$ $\\operatorname{dist}\\left(x^{\\circ}, \\partial \\Omega\\right) / 2$, and let $H_{0}:=H(0 ; 0)=\\bar{\\rho}_{0}>0$. Then\n(1) The first equation in (3.4) is uniformly elliptic in $B_{\\delta_{0}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right) \\cap\\{u>0\\}$.

Let us now fix some notations that are used throughout the paper. Given any set $A$ we denote by $\\chi_{A}$ the characteristic function of $A$. For any sets $A$ and $B$, we denote by $A \\triangle B$ the set $(A \\backslash B) \\cup(B \\backslash A)$. We denote by $a^{ \\pm}=\\max \\{ \\pm a, 0\\}$ for any real number $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $a=a^{+}-a^{-}$and $|a|=a^{+}+a^{-}$. The Euclidean inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is denoted by $x \\cdot y$, and the ball of center $x^{\\circ}$ and radius of $r$ is denoted by $B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$. We use the notation $B_{r}:=B_{r}(0)$ for simplicity. We use the notation $L u$ to represent\n\n$$\nL u:=\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nAdditionally, we define the positive number\n\n$$\n\\delta_{0}:=\\frac{\\operatorname{dist}\\left(x^{\\circ}, \\partial \\Omega\\right)}{2}>0, \\quad \\text { for } x^{\\circ} \\in \\Omega\n$$\n\nConstants denoted by $e$ or $\\mathscr{C}$ are called universal if they depend on the dimensions $n, g, H_{0}$. For $H(t ; s)$ defined in (3.3), we define\n\n$$\nF(t ; s):=\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{H(\\tau ; s)} d \\tau, \\quad \\text { for } t, s \\geqslant 0\n$$\n\nTo denote partial derivatives, we employ the notation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{1} F(t ; s):=\\frac{\\partial F(t ; s)}{\\partial t}=\\frac{1}{H(t ; s)}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\partial_{2} F(t ; s):=\\frac{\\partial F(t ; s)}{\\partial s}=-\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\partial_{2} H(\\tau ; s)}{H^{2}(\\tau ; s)} d \\tau\n$$\n\nDefine $\\Lambda(t ; s)=2 t \\partial_{1} F(t ; s)-F(t ; s)$ and set $\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right):=\\Lambda\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)$. In this fashion, we have by a simple calculation that\n\n$$\n\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right)=\\frac{x_{n}}{H_{0}}+\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) \\tau d \\tau\n$$\n\nHere we used the fact that $H\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)=H_{0}$. It can be easily checked from (3.9) that $\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ is a non-negative function that satisfies $\\lambda(0)=0$. We denote by $\\mathcal{L}^{n}$ the $n$ dimensional Lebesgue measure and by $\\mathcal{H}^{k}$ the $k$ dimensional Hausdorff measure for $k \\geqslant 1$. Specifically, we use the notation $d S=d \\mathcal{H}^{1}$. By $\\nu$ we will refer to the outer normal on a given surface. Functions of bounded variations are denoted by $\\mathrm{BV}(\\Omega), \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The total variation measure is represented by $|\\nabla f|$, which can be found in [33].\n\nNote that for a smooth open set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n},\\left|\\nabla \\chi_{E}\\right|$ coincides with the surface measure on $\\partial E$. Lastly, we will say that $f(r)=o(g(r))$ as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$if $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\frac{|f(r)|}{|g(r)|}=0$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. Variational Solutions and Weiss-type monotonicity formula \n\nIn this section, we consider solutions $u$, in a sense to be specified later, of the problem (3.4). It should be noted that in the incompressible case, $H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\equiv H_{0}$, and the first equation in (3.4) reduces to the Laplace equation. Let us now introduce our notion of a subsonic variational solution of (3.4).\n\nDefinition 4.1 (Subsonic variational solution). Let $\\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{n}=0\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing$. The function $u \\in W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}(\\Omega)$ is called a subsonic variational solution of (3.4), provided that\n(1) (Non-negativity) $u \\geqslant 0$ in $\\Omega$, and $u \\equiv 0$ in $\\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{n} \\leqslant 0\\right\\}$.\n(2) (Regularity) $u \\in C^{0}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{2}(\\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\})$.\n(3) (Subsonic condition).

The first variation with respect to domain variations of the functional\n\n$$\nJ_{F}(v ; \\Omega):=\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(F\\left(|\\nabla v|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)+\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\chi_{\\{v>0\\}}\\right) d x\n$$\n\nvanishes at $v=u$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =-\\left.\\frac{d}{d \\varepsilon} J_{F}(u(x+\\varepsilon \\phi(x)) ; \\Omega)\\right|_{\\varepsilon=0} \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)+\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right) \\operatorname{div} \\phi d x \\\\\n& -2 \\int_{\\Omega} \\partial_{1} F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\nabla u D \\phi \\nabla u d x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}+\\partial_{2} F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)\\right) \\phi_{n} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor any $\\phi=\\left(\\phi_{1}, \\ldots, \\phi_{n}\\right) \\in C_{0}^{1}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$.\nThere are several comments on subsonic variational solutions.\nRemark 4.2. The regularity assumption $u \\in C^{0}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{2}(\\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\})$ can not be deduced from other assumptions stated in Definition 4.1 using regularity theory. Moreover, additional regularity results concerning the free boundary, such as finite perimeter, are also not required in our definition.\n\nRemark 4.3. Let $x^{\\circ} \\in \\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$ with $x_{n}^{\\circ}=0$, let $B_{\\delta_{0}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$ be a ball with its center at $x^{\\circ}$ and let $u$ be a subsonic variational solution in $B_{\\delta_{0}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$. Then we may infer from Lemma 1.1 that there exists $B_{\\delta_{0} / 2}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right) \\subset B_{\\delta_{0}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$ so that the third requirement (4.1) is automatically satisfied in $B_{\\delta_{0}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nRemark 4.4. The first domain variation formula (4.3) is motivated by the standard Noether equation in the calculus of variation, see [37, Chapter 3.1]. When $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\} \\in C^{2, \\alpha}$ and $u \\in C^{2, \\alpha}, u$ is a classical solution to (3.1). Integrating by parts in $\\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =\\int_{\\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\}} \\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)(\\nabla u \\cdot \\phi) d x \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}}\\left(\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right)-\\Lambda\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)\\right)(\\phi \\cdot \\nu) d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu$ is the normal vector to $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$. The proof of the formulae (4.3) and (4.4) can be found in Appendix B. It follows from (4.4) that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)=0 \\quad \\text { in } \\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\Lambda\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)=\\Lambda\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right) \\quad \\text { on } \\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}\n$$\n\nGiven that $\\Lambda\\left(0 ; x_{n}\\right)=0$ and $\\partial_{1} \\Lambda \\geqslant c>0$ for each fixed $x_{n}$, we can deduce that $t \\mapsto \\Lambda(t ; \\cdot)$ is a strictly increasing function. Consequently, one has $|\\nabla u|^{2}=x_{n}$ on $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$.\n\nRemark 4.5. The fact that $u$ is non-negative and continuous in $\\Omega$, as well as $L u=0$ in $\\Omega \\cap\\{u>0\\}$, implies that $L u$ is a non-negative Radon measure supported on $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$. Indeed, for any non-negative functions $\\xi(x) \\in$ $C_{0}^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$, let\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{k}(x):=\\xi(x)(1-h(k u))\n$$\n\nwhere $h(s):=\\max (\\min (2-s, 1), 0)$. Then\n\n$$\n0=-\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi_{k}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d x \\leqslant-\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\nabla u \\nabla \\xi(1-h(k u))}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d x\n$$\n\nThen letting $k \\rightarrow+\\infty$, we obtain that $L u$ is a non-negative Radon measure supported on $\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$.\n\nWe will also introduce subsonic weak solutions of (3.1).\nDefinition 4.6 (Subsonic weak solutions). We say that $u \\in W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}(\\Omega)$ is a subsonic weak solution of (3.4) if the following are satisfied:\n(1) $u$ is a subsonic variational solution of (3.4).\n\n(2) The topological free boundary $\\partial\\{u>0\\} \\cap \\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{n}>\\tau\\right\\}$ can be locally decomposed into an $(n-1)$-dimensional $C^{2, n}$ surface, relative open to $\\partial\\{u>0\\}$ and denoted by $\\partial_{\\text {red }}\\{u>0\\}$, and a singular set of vanishing $(n-1)$-Hausdorff dimension.\n\nRemark 4.7. For any subsonic weak solution of (3.4), for each $x^{\\circ} \\in \\Omega \\cap\\left\\{x_{n}>\\right.$ $\\tau\\}$ of $\\partial_{\\text {red }}\\{u>0\\}$, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $x^{\\circ}$ so that $u \\in C^{1}(V \\cap \\overline{\\{u>0\\}})$ satisfies\n\n$$\n|\\nabla u(x)|^{2}=x_{n} \\quad \\text { on } V \\cap \\partial_{\\operatorname{red}}\\{u>0\\}\n$$\n\nLemma 4.8. Let $u$ be a subsonic weak solution of (3.4) which satisfies\n\n$$\n|\\nabla u|^{2} \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} x_{n}^{+} \\quad \\text { locally in } \\Omega\n$$\n\nThen $u$ is a subsonic variational solution of (3.4). Moreover, $\\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}$ is locally a function of bounded variation in $\\{u>0\\}$, and the total variation measure $\\left|\\nabla \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right|$ satisfies\n\n$$\nr^{1 / 2-n} \\int_{B_{r}(y)} \\sqrt{x_{n}}\\left|\\nabla \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right| d x \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}_{0}\n$$\n\nfor all $B_{r}(y) \\subset \\subset \\Omega$ such that $y_{n}=0$.\nThe proof of this Lemma will be given in Appendix C.\n4.1. Two preparatory identities. In this subsection, we introduce two identities that will serve as preliminary tools for the monotonicity formula. The first one is a Poho\u017eaev-type identity for quasilinear problem, while the second one is an energy identity. We present them in the following lemma.\n\nLemma 4.9.

Define for a.e. $r \\in\\left(0, \\delta_{0}\\right)$, where $\\delta_{0}$ is defined in (3.8), the functions\n\n$$\nU\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=r^{-n-1} \\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)+\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}} d x\n$$\n\n$$\nW\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=r^{-n-2} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=U\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)-\\frac{3}{2} W\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)\n$$\n\nThen for any $0<\\sigma_{1}<\\sigma_{2}<\\delta_{0}, \\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)$ satisfies the formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; \\sigma_{2}\\right)-\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; \\sigma_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\sigma_{1}}^{\\sigma_{2}} r^{-n-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{2}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\left(\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu-\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{u}{r}\\right)^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} d r \\\\\n& +\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\int_{\\sigma_{1}}^{\\sigma_{2}} r^{-n-2} K_{i}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{1}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}[ & \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left(\\frac{x_{n}}{H_{0}}-\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\right) \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right] d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}[ & \\partial_{2} F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\left(x_{n}\\right)-\\frac{1}{H_{0}}\\right) \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right] x_{n} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nK_{3}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=3 \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H_{0}}\\right) u \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nK_{4}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right):=\\frac{9}{2 r} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{0}}-\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) u^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\n$$\n\nRemark 4.11. It follows from (4.2) and (4.9) that\n\n$$\nU\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)=r^{-n-1} J_{F}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFormula (4.10) is the notable Weiss boundary-adjusted $L^{2}$ energy for the quasilinear problem (3.1). The idea of subtracting the adjusted $L^{2}$ energy from the total energy originated from [65], who was the first to investigate the one-homogeneous stable cones for the classical Alt-Caffarelli functional via the monotonicity formula. Our developed formula is inspired by Weiss's idea and can be seen as variations of monotonicity formulas.\n\nRemark 4.12. It follows from (4.13) and a direct calculation and (3.9) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{1}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) & =\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\int_{0}^{|\\nabla u|^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) \\tau d \\tau d x \\\\\n& -\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}\\left[\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) \\tau d \\tau\\right] \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn fact, $K_{1}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)$ is the difference between two energies, $J_{H}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)$ and $J_{F}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)$, where $J_{H}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)$ is given by\n\n$$\nJ_{H}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right):=\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}+\\frac{x_{n}}{H\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)} \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}} d x\n$$\n\nHere, we used the fact that $H\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)=H_{0}$. Moreover, let us remark that $J_{H}$ can be viewed as the part of $J_{F}$ that possesses the homogeneity property, as we have already mentioned in the introduction. To illustrate this, let $u \\in W^{1,2}\\left(B_{r}\\right)$ and let us consider the rescaling\n\n$$\nu_{R}(x):=\\frac{u(R x)}{R^{3 / 2}} \\quad \\text { in } B_{r / R}, \\quad R>0\n$$\n\nIn this fashion, we see that\n\n$$\nJ_{H}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\right)=R^{n+1} \\int_{B_{r / R}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla u_{R}\\right|^{2}}{H_{R}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{R}\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}+\\frac{x_{n}}{H_{R}\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)} \\chi_{\\left\\{u_{R}>0\\right\\}} d x\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{R}(t ; s):=H(R t ; R s)$. Define\n\n$$\nJ_{H_{R}}\\left(v ; B_{r / R}\\right):=\\int_{B_{r / R}} \\frac{|\\nabla v|^{2}}{H_{R}\\left(|\\nabla v|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}+\\frac{x_{n}}{H_{R}\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)} \\chi_{\\{v>0\\}} d x\n$$\n\nand in this way, we see that\n\n$$\nr^{-n-1} J_{H}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\right)=(r / R)^{-n-1} J_{H_{R}}\\left(u_{R} ; B_{r / R}\\right) \\quad \\text { for any } R>0\n$$\n\nThus, if $u$ is a subsonic variational solution with respect to $J_{H}$ on $B_{r}$ then $u_{R}$ is a subsonic variational solution with respect to $J_{H_{R}}$ on $B_{r / R}$. However, the energy $J_{F}$ in (4.2) does not satisfy the scaling property (4.21).\n\nRemark 4.13. We explain in this remark the reason why the scaling property (4.21) is crucial in this context. Let $u_{R}(x):=\\frac{u(R x)}{R^{3 / 2}}$ be the rescaling defined in (4.19) and assume that $u_{R}$ converges strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ to a function $u_{0}$, using the fact that $(t ; s) \\mapsto H(t ; s)$ is continuous, we see by passing to the limit as $R \\rightarrow 0$ in (4.20) that\n\n$$\nJ_{H_{0}}(v):=\\frac{1}{H_{0}}\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}\\left|\\nabla u_{0}\\right|^{2}+x_{n} \\chi_{\\left\\{u_{0}>0\\right\\}} d x\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, it is expected that $u_{0}$ is a variational solution with respect to $J_{H_{0}}$. In fact, thanks to the decomposition of $J_{F}$ introduced in the previous Remark, we prove in Lemma 5.1 that the blow-up limit $u_{0}$ is a variational solution in the sense of [60, Definition 3.1].\n\nRemark 4.14. It follows from Lemma 3.1 that\n\n$$\n\\partial_{1} H\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)=-\\partial_{2} H\\left(x_{n} ; x_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, a direct calculation gives that\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{\\prime}\\left(x_{n}\\right)=\\frac{1}{H_{0}}-\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n}}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) d \\tau\n$$\n\nThis, together with (4.14), gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nK_{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) & =\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\int_{0}^{|\\nabla u|^{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) x_{n} d \\tau d x \\\\\n& -\\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)}\\left[\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n}}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) x_{n} d \\tau\\right] \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemark 4.15. It should be noted that for incompressible water wave, due to the nature of incompressibility, one has\n\n$$\nF\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\equiv \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2}}{H_{0}}, \\quad \\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\equiv \\frac{x_{n}}{H_{0}}\n$$\n\nThis implies that all of additional terms $K_{i}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)$ defined in (4.13), (4.14), (4.15), and (4.16) for $i=1, \\ldots, 4$ vanish in the incompressible case. In this case Proposition 4.10 reduces to Theorem 3.5 in [60, Boundary case], for $H_{0}=1$.\n\nProof. Our starting point is an application of the identity (4.8) we derived in Lemma 4.9 for subsonic variational solutions of (3.1). By setting $x_{n}^{\\circ}=0$ in the identity (4.6), applying (4.7) and using (4.13) and (4.14), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (n+1) J_{F}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)-r J_{F}\\left(u ; \\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =3 \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& -2 r \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{(\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu)^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& -K_{1}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)-K_{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA direct calculation gives that for a.e. $r \\in\\left(0, \\delta_{0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} U\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) & =-(n+1) r^{-n-2} J_{F}\\left(u ; B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& +r^{-n-1} J_{F}\\left(u ; \\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} U\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) & =2 r^{-n-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{(\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu)^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& -3 r^{-n-2} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& +r^{-n-2} K_{1}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)+r^{-n-2} K_{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, since $H_{0}$ is a constant, we can proceed a similar calculation as in [60, equation (3.9)] and we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} W\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)=\\frac{r^{-n-3}}{H_{0}}[ & 2 r \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} u \\nabla u \\cdot \\nu d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& \\left.-3 \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} u^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt follows from (4.23) and (4.24) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) & =2 r^{-n-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{\\left(\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu-\\frac{3 \\mathfrak{a}}{2} \\mathfrak{r}\\right)^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\\\\n& +r^{-n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} K_{i}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen (4.12) follows immediately after integrating (4.25) from $\\sigma_{1}$ to $\\sigma_{2}$ with respect to $r$.\n\nRemark 4.16. It follows from (4.23) that the additional terms $K_{1}(r)$ and $K_{2}(r)$ arise completely from calculating the derivatives of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} U(r)$. However, $K_{3}(r)$ and $K_{4}(r)$ are not, they are neither from derivatives of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} U(r)$ nor $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} W(r)$, see (4.23) and (4.24). This is different from the monotonicity formula in the previous works (cf. [27, 31, 32, 61, 62]) and introduces new difficulties. In these mentioned works, any additional terms (if exist) in the monotonicity formula come entirely from the derivatives of $U(r)$ or $W(r)$. In the upcoming $\\S 5$, we will present some results based on our monotonicity formula developed in Proposition 4.10. These results include the existence of the limit $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; 0^{+}\\right)$and the blow-up $u_{0}$ of the sequence $\\frac{u\\left(x^{\\circ}+r x\\right)}{r^{3 / 2}}$ as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 5. STOKES CORNER ASYMPTOTICS AT THE STAGNATION POINTS \n\nIn this section, we investigate the possible shape profile of the free surface near the stagnation points by applying the monotonicity formula we derived in Proposition 4.10.\n\nLemma 5.1.

Then $u_{m}$ converges to $u_{0}$ strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$.\n\nRemark 5.2. Note that the growth assumption (5.1) implies that\n\n$$\nu(x) \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}\\left(x_{n}^{+}\\right)^{3 / 2}\n$$\n\nin the case $x_{n}^{\\circ}=0$ and for some universal constant $\\mathscr{C}$.\n\nProof. We assume $x^{\\circ}=0$ and write $\\Phi(u ; r):=\\Phi(0, u ; r)$ when there is no ambiguity.\n(1). To prove existence and the finiteness of the limit $\\Phi\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right)$, we begin by estimating the additional terms $K_{i}(u ; r):=K_{i}(0, u ; r)$ defined in equations (4.13), (4.14), (4.15) and (4.16). It follows from the bounds (3.5), (3.6) and (3.7) derived in Lemma 3.1 and a direct calculation that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n}}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(\\tau ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} \\quad \\text { in } B_{r}\n$$\n\nThis, together with (4.17) and the growth condition (5.1), gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|K_{1}(u ; r)\\right| & \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} \\int_{B_{r}}\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\left|\\nabla u\\right|^{2}} \\tau d \\tau\\right)+\\left(\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} \\tau d \\tau\\right) d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r^{n+2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA similar argument for (4.22) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|K_{2}(u ; r)\\right| & \\leqslant \\int_{B_{r}}\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\left|\\nabla u\\right|^{2}} x_{n} d \\tau\\right)+\\left(\\int_{0}^{x_{n}} x_{n} d \\tau\\right) d x \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r^{n+2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we used the following fact: $\\left|x_{n}\\right| \\leqslant r$ in $B_{r}$ since $x_{n}^{\\circ}=0$. We next estimate $K_{3}(u ; r)$ as well as $K_{4}(u ; r)$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H_{0}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H(0 ; 0)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H\\left(0 ; x_{n}\\right)}+\\frac{1}{H\\left(0 ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H(0 ; 0)} \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{d \\theta}\\left(\\frac{1}{H(\\theta|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n})}\\right) d \\theta+\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{d}{d s}\\left(\\frac{1}{H\\left(0 ; s x_{n}\\right)}\\right) d s \\\\\n& =-\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial_{1} H(\\theta|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n})}{H^{2}(\\theta|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n})} d \\theta \\cdot|\\nabla u|^{2}-\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\partial_{2} H\\left(0 ; s x_{n}\\right)}{H^{2}\\left(0 ; s x_{n}\\right)} d s \\cdot x_{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying (3.5), (3.6), (3.7) and (5.1) once again, one has\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}-\\frac{1}{H_{0}}\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r \\quad \\text { in } B_{r}\n$$\n\nThis, together with (4.15) and (4.16), gives\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{3}(u ; r)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r \\int_{\\partial B_{r}}|u||\\nabla u| d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r^{n+2}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left|K_{4}(u ; r)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}} u^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r^{n+2}\n$$\n\nCollecting estimates in (5.4), (5.5), (5.7) and (5.8) together, we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\left|r^{-n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} K_{i}(u ; r)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}\n$$\n\nThis implies that the function $r \\mapsto \\Phi(u ; r)$ has a right limit $\\Phi\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right)$. We now claim that the limit is finite. It follows from the definition of $F\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)$ and (5.1) that\n\n$$\nF\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right) \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lambda\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\leqslant\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{0}}+\\mathscr{C}\\right) r \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} r\n$$\n\nThus, we obtain the boundedness of $U(u ; r)$ in terms of $H_{0}$ and $\\mathscr{C}$.\n\n$$\n|U(u ; r)| \\leqslant \\mathcal{L}^{n}\\left(B_{1}\\right)\\left(\\mathscr{C}+\\frac{1}{H_{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen the finiteness of $\\Phi\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right)$follows immediately from\n\n$$\nW(u ; r) \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\\left(\\partial B_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $u(0)=0$ and\n\n$$\nH_{0} r^{3} W(u ; r) \\rightarrow u(0) \\quad \\text { as } r \\rightarrow 0^{+}\n$$\n\n(2). For any $0<\\sigma_{1}<\\sigma_{2}<+\\infty$ and any vanishing sequence $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, we integrate $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\Phi(u ; r)$ from $r_{m} \\sigma_{1}$ to $r_{m} \\sigma_{2}$ and we obtain by rescaling that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2 \\int_{B_{\\sigma_{2}} \\backslash B_{\\sigma_{1}}}|x|^{-n-3} \\frac{1}{H_{m}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\left(\\nabla u_{m} \\cdot x-\\frac{3}{2} u_{m}\\right)^{2} d x \\\\\n& =\\Phi\\left(u ; r_{m} \\sigma_{2}\\right)-\\Phi\\left(u ; r_{m} \\sigma_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& -\\int_{r_{m} \\sigma_{1}}^{r_{m} \\sigma_{2}} r^{-n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} K_{i}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right) d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{m}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right):=H\\left(r_{m}\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; r_{m} x_{n}\\right)$.

Moreover, it follows from the fact $\\lim _{m} H_{m}=H_{0}$ that $H_{m} \\geqslant e H_{0}$ for $m$ large enough and $e>0$ universal.

This is equivalent to say that $u_{0}$ is a homogeneous function of degree $3 / 2$.\n(3). Let $u_{m}$ be defined in (5.2).

(1) Without loss of generality we assume that $x^{\\circ}=0$, let $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$ be a vanishing sequence as $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$ and let $u_{m}$ be the blow up sequence defined in (5.2). We denote $\\Phi(u ; r):=\\Phi(0, u ; r)$ for simplicity.

Thanks to (5.4), we have that $\\left|K_{1}\\left(u ; r r_{m}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}\\left(r r_{m}\\right)^{n+2}$.

Let $u_{m}$ be the blow-up sequence defined in equation (5.2), then (5.1) implies for each vanishing sequence $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$we can find a subsequence (still denoted $r_{m}$ ) along which $u_{m} \\rightarrow u_{0}$ locally uniformly and weakly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ to some function $u_{0}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow[0,+\\infty), u_{0} \\equiv 0$ on $\\left\\{x_{n} \\leqslant 0\\right\\}$. It follows from Lemma 5.1 that $u_{m}$ converges to $u_{0}$ strongly in $W_{\\text {loc }}^{1,3}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ and that $u_{0}$ is harmonic in $\\left\\{u_{0}>0\\right\\}$.

We can now compute all the possible profiles of the free surface at the stagnation points with the aid of Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.4.\n\nProposition 5.5 (two-dimensional case).

Let $u_{m}$ be the blow-up sequence defined in equation (5.2), where $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$as $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$, then $u_{m}$ converges to a blow-up $u_{0}$ strongly in $W_{\\text {loc }}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$. Moreover,equation (5.14) implies that $u_{0}$ is a homogeneous solution to\n\n$$\n0=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{0}\\right|^{2} \\operatorname{div} \\phi-2 \\nabla u_{0} D \\phi \\nabla u_{0}\\right) d x+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}\\left(x_{2} \\chi_{0}+\\chi_{0} \\phi_{2}\\right) d x\n$$\n\nfor any $\\phi \\in C_{0}^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$. Here, $\\chi_{0}$ is the strong $L^{1}$ limit of $\\chi_{m}:=\\chi_{\\left\\{u_{m}>0\\right\\}}$ along a subsequence. Then the argument reduces to [60, Proposition 4.7,\n\nBoundary case]. To conclude the proof, we calculate explicitly the weighted density $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; 0^{+}\\right)$at $x^{\\circ}$. In the case $u_{0} \\neq 0$, we have that $\\chi_{m} \\rightarrow \\chi_{0}=$ $\\chi_{\\{x: \\pi / 6<\\theta<5 \\pi / 6\\}}$, and therefore, we deduce from Lemma 5.4 (1) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; 0^{+}\\right) & =\\frac{1}{H_{0}} \\int_{B_{1}} x_{2}^{+} \\chi_{\\{x: \\pi / 6<\\theta<5 \\pi / 6\\}} d x \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{H_{0}} \\int_{0}^{1} \\rho^{2} d \\rho \\int_{\\pi / 6}^{5 \\pi / 6} \\sin \\theta d \\theta \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 H_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn the case when $u_{0}=0$, there are two possibilities, either $\\chi_{m} \\rightarrow \\chi_{0}=0$ or $\\chi_{m} \\rightarrow \\chi_{0}=\\chi_{\\{x: 0<\\theta<\\pi\\}}$.

Based on the results we have deduced in Proposition 5.5, we classify each stagnation point into two categories. We refer to the first category as degenerate stagnation points, while the second category consists of non-degenerate stagnation points. The precise definition will be given in Definition 6.1. Roughly speaking, a stagnation point is considered degenerate if the blow-up $u_{0}$ at this point is identically zero. Otherwise, we regard it as a non-degenerate stagnation point.\n\nRemark 5.7. It should be noted that at the degenerate stagnation points $x^{\\circ}$, the analysis above suggests that $u_{m}(x):=\\frac{u\\left(x^{\\circ}+r_{m} x\\right)}{r_{m}^{\\alpha}} \\rightarrow u_{0} \\neq 0$ for some $\\alpha>\\frac{3}{2}$. However, it is a priori unknown whether $u$ decays like a polynomial at $x^{\\circ}$ or not. Therefore, there is a possibility that $u_{m} \\rightarrow 0$ for any $\\alpha>0$. In the forthcoming section, we will give an explicit answer that even at the degeneracy stagnation points, the solution $u$ decays like a polynomial.\n\nRemark 5.8. In the rest of the paper, we will refer to the value $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 H_{0}}$ as the Stokes density, the value 0 as the trivial density, and the value $\\frac{2}{3 H_{0}}$ as the horizontal flat density.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 6.

Recall that Lu is a nonnegative Radon measure.\nProof. Assume that $x^{\\circ}=0$, the value of $\\Phi\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right)$and the uniqueness of the blow-up follows directly from the second statement Proposition 5.5, and (1) is proved. It follows from (5.12) and (5.13) in Remark 5.3 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0<\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 H_{0}} & =\\widetilde{\\Phi}\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\widetilde{\\Phi}(u ; 1) \\\\\n& =U(u ; 1)-\\frac{3}{2} W(u ; 1)+\\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\left|t^{-n-2} K_{i}(u ; t)\\right| d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used (4.11) in the last equality. Thanks to (5.4), (5.5), (5.7) and (5.8), one has $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} t^{-n-2}\\left|K_{i}(u ; t)\\right| \\leqslant \\mathscr{C}$. Thus, by setting $e_{0}:=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 H_{0}}$, we deduce from $W(u ; 1) \\geqslant 0$, the growth condition (5.1) that\n\n$$\ne_{0} \\leqslant\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{0}}+\\mathscr{C}\\right) \\int_{B_{1}} x_{2}^{+} \\chi_{\\{u>0\\}} d x\n$$\n\nThen (6.2) follows by rescaling.\nFor any arbitrary vanishing sequence $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, let us consider $u_{m}$ given in (5.2).

The second measure estimate (6.4) follows.\nWe now prove that all non-degenerate stagnation points are isolated.\nProposition 6.5 (Isolatedness of the non-degenerate stagnation points).

Suppose that $x^{\\circ} \\in S^{u}$ is a non-degenerate stagnation point. Then in some open neighborhood, $x^{\\circ}$ is the only nondegenerate stagnation point.\n\nProof. Suppose towards a contradiction that there exists a sequence $x^{m}$ of non-degenerate points converging to $x^{\\circ}$, with $x^{m} \\neq x^{\\circ}$ for all $m$. Let $r_{m}:=$ $\\left|x^{m}-x^{\\circ}\\right|$, and assume without loss of generality that $\\left(x^{m}-x^{\\circ}\\right) / r_{m} \\rightarrow z \\in$ $\\{(-1,0),(1,0)\\}$. Let us consider the blow-up sequence $u_{m}$ defined in (5.2). Since $x^{m}$ is a non-degenerate stagnation point for $u$, we have that the point $z$ is a non-degenerate stagnation point for $u_{m}$, and therefore Lemma 6.4 implies that\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left(z, u_{m} ; 0^{+}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3 H_{0}}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 5.1 (2) and Proposition 5.5 (2), the sequence $u_{m}$ converges strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ to the homogeneous solution\n\n$$\nu_{0}(R, \\theta)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} R^{3 / 2} \\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\min \\left\\{\\max \\left\\{\\theta, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right\\}, \\frac{5 \\pi}{6}\\right\\}-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhile $\\chi_{m}:=\\chi_{\\left\\{u_{m}>0\\right\\}}$ converges to $\\chi_{\\left\\{u_{0}>0\\right\\}}$ strongly in $L_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$.

Let us remark that\n(1) In two dimensions the set of stagnation points $S^{u}$ can be decomposed into a countable set of \"Stokes points\" with asymptotics as in Lemma 6.4, accumulating (if at all) only at \"degenerate stagnation points\", and a set of \"degenerate stagnation points\" will be analyzed in the following section.\n(2) In higher dimensions $n \\geqslant 3$, one can follow a similar argument as in [61, Lemma 5.7] to conclude that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of all non-degenerate stagnation points is less than or equal to $n-2$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 7. Degenerate Stagnation Points \n\nIn this section, we analyze the degenerate stagnation points, in which case the blow-up $u_{0}$ is identically zero in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In general, this implies that the decay rate of the solution is strictly higher than $\\left|x-x^{\\circ}\\right|^{3 / 2}$ near each degenerate stagnation points $x^{\\circ}$ (cf. (6.1)). The analysis of the degenerate stagnation points in this section exclude the possibility of cusp-type and horizontal flat-type singularities, thus proving the Stokes conjecture.\n7.1. Cusp points.

In this subsection, we focus on those stagnation points with the trivial density $\\Phi\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; 0^{+}\\right)=0$.

The idea of the proof is borrowed from [60, Lemma 4.4], which mainly depends on the inequality $L u \\geqslant \\sqrt{x_{2}} \\mathcal{H}^{1} \\ll \\partial_{\\text {red } $\\{u>0\\}$ and the fact that one can locate a non-empty portion of $\\partial_{\\text {red }}\\{u>0\\}$.

The statements (1) and (2) follow from the definition in (7.17), (7.18) and Lemma 7.6 (2) directly.\n(3). Assume that $x^{\\circ}=0$ and let us consider the following two possibilities.\n\nCase I. If $N(u ; r) \\geqslant \\frac{5}{2}$. Then $N(u ; r)-\\frac{5}{2} \\geqslant 1$. It follows from $|\\nabla u|^{2} \\leqslant x_{n}^{+}$ that $K_{4}(u ; r) \\geqslant 0$, thus,\n\n$$\n\\frac{K_{4}(u ; r)}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}^{2}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}} \\leqslant \\frac{K_{4}(u ; r)}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}^{2}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}\\left[N(u ; r)-\\frac{5}{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe frequency formula in (7.19) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(N(r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\geqslant-\\beta\\left(N(r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some $\\beta>0$. It follows that\n\n$$\nr \\mapsto e^{\\beta r}\\left(N(r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { is nondecreasing on }\\left(0, r_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, if we set $g(r):=e^{\\beta r}\\left(N(r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$, we have that $g(r) \\leqslant g\\left(r_{0}\\right):=c_{0}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\left|K_{3}(u ; r)\\right|}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}\\left(N(u ; r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\geqslant-\\frac{\\left|K_{3}(u ; r)\\right|}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}\\left(N(u ; r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\frac{\\left|K_{3}(u ; r)\\right|}{\\left(\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\\right) e^{\\beta r}} e^{\\beta r}\\left(N(r)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\geqslant-\\frac{\\mathscr{C}\\left|K_{4}(u ; r)\\right|}{\\left(\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\\right) e^{\\beta r}} c_{0} \\geqslant-\\mathscr{C}\n$$\n\nwhere we used $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}}\\left(K_{3}(u ; r)+K_{4}(u ; r)\\right)=0$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|K_{4}(u ; r)\\right| & =\\left|\\frac{9}{2 r} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}}\\left(\\frac{1}{H_{0}}-\\frac{1}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right) u^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\mathscr{C} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, in this case we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} N(u ; r) \\geqslant \\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(r)-\\mathscr{C}\n$$\n\nSince by the first part (1), $N(u ; r)$ is bounded below as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, the integrability of $r \\mapsto \\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(u ; r)$ follows immediately.\n\nCase II.

By the first statement, $r \\mapsto N\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)$ is bounded below as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$. We also deduce from (3) that $N(r)$ has a limit as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, and that $N\\left(0^{+}\\right) \\geqslant \\frac{3}{2}$, thus proving this statement.\n(5). Along with a similar argument as (3) and we omit it here.\n\nCorollary 7.9.

Moreover, since $r \\mapsto \\frac{1}{r} V^{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; r\\right)$ is integrable on $\\left(0, r_{0}\\right)$, we can deduce that $\\widetilde{N}\\left(x^{\\circ}, u ; 0^{+}\\right)=N\\left(x, u ; 0^{+}\\right)$for all $x$. Here the existence of the limit follows from Proposition 7.8 (3).

The rest of the proof follows as in Lemma 7.6 (3).\n(3). It is a consequence of the part (2) that $r \\mapsto r^{-n-2 N_{0}} H_{0} \\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} u^{2} d x$ is non-decreasing on $\\left(0, r_{0}\\right)$ and therefore, for each $\\alpha \\in\\left[0, N_{0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\nr^{-n-2 \\alpha} \\int_{B_{r}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} u^{2} d x \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\text { as } r \\rightarrow 0^{+}\n$$\n\nThis implies (3) of the lemma.\n7.4. The frequency sequence. The frequency formula allows us passing to blow-up limits. We consider the following blow-up sequence\n\n$$\nv_{m}(x):=\\frac{u\\left(x^{\\circ}+r_{m} x\\right)}{\\sqrt{r_{m}^{1-n} \\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}}\n$$\n\nOur first observation related to $v_{m}$ is concluded in the following lemma.\nLemma 7.11.

Assume without loss of generality that $0 \\in \\Sigma^{u}$. It follows by rescaling that for every $0<\\sigma_{1}<\\sigma_{2}<\\infty$ and for all $r_{m}<\\delta_{0}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\sigma_{1}}^{\\sigma_{2}} \\frac{2}{r} \\frac{H_{0}}{\\left(\\left|\\nabla u\\left(r_{m} x\\right)\\right|^{2} ; r_{m} x_{n}\\right)} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}} v_{m}^{2} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} d r \\\\\n& \\leqslant N\\left(u ; r_{m} \\sigma_{2}\\right)-N\\left(u ; r_{m} \\sigma_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& +\\int_{r_{m} \\sigma_{1}}^{r_{m} \\sigma_{2}}\\left(\\mathscr{C}_{1}+\\mathscr{C}_{2} \\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(u ; r)\\right) d r \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$, as a consequence of Proposition 7.8 (3) and (4). Observe now that for all $r \\in\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right) \\subset(0,1)$ and all $m$ as above, we can deduce from Lemma 7.6 (3) that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{v_{m}^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}=\\frac{\\int_{\\partial B_{r r_{m}}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}=\\frac{\\left(r r_{m}\\right)^{n+2} W\\left(u ; r r_{m}\\right)}{r_{m}^{n+2} W\\left(u ; r_{m}\\right)} \\leqslant r^{n+2}\n$$\n\nas $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$.

Since $|x| \\in\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)$, we obtain (7.26).\nAs a direct application of Lemma 7.11, we have\nProposition 7.12.

(1). Let $x^{\\circ}=0$ and let us define\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(u ; r)=\\frac{r \\int_{B_{r}} \\frac{x_{n}^{4}}{H_{0}}\\left(1-\\chi_{\\{u>0\\}}\\right) d x}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}(u ; r):=\\frac{e(u ; r)}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}\n$$\n\nwhere $e(u ; r)$ is given in (7.5). Then it follows the definition of $V(u ; r)(7.18)$ that $V(u ; r)=\\widetilde{V}(u ; r)+\\mathcal{V}(u ; r)$. Moreover, we infer from the proof of Lemma 7.6 (2) that $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\frac{\\mathcal{V}(u ; r)}{\\widetilde{V}(u ; r)}=0$ (cf. (7.8), (7.14) and (7.15)). Since\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(u ; r) & =\\frac{1}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r)+\\frac{1}{r} \\mathcal{V}^{2}(u ; r)+\\frac{2}{r} \\widetilde{V}(r) \\mathcal{V}(u ; r) \\\\\n& \\geqslant \\frac{1}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r)+\\frac{2}{r} \\widetilde{V}(u ; r) \\mathcal{V}(u ; r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand it follows from $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\frac{\\widetilde{V}(u ; r) \\mathcal{V}(u ; r)}{\\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r)}=0$ that there exists $r_{0} \\in\\left(0, \\delta_{0}\\right)$ sufficiently small so that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(u ; r) \\geqslant \\frac{1}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r)+\\frac{2}{r} \\widetilde{V}(u ; r) \\mathcal{V}(r) \\geqslant \\frac{c}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r)\n$$\n\nThen the integrability of $r \\mapsto \\frac{1}{r} V^{2}(u ; r) \\in L^{1}\\left(0, r_{0}\\right)$ implies the integrability of $r \\mapsto \\frac{1}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(u ; r) \\in L^{1}\\left(0, r_{0}\\right)$.\n\nSuppose now a contradiction that (1) is not true. Let $s_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$be a sequence such that $\\widetilde{V}\\left(s_{m}\\right)$ is bounded away from 0 . Due to the integrability of $r \\mapsto \\frac{2}{r} \\widetilde{V}^{2}(r)$ we have that\n\n$$\n\\min _{r \\in\\left[s_{m}, s_{2 m}\\right]} \\widetilde{V}(r) \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\text { as } m \\rightarrow+\\infty\n$$\n\nLet $t_{m} \\in\\left[s_{m}, s_{2 m}\\right]$ be such that $\\widetilde{V}\\left(t_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ as $m \\rightarrow+\\infty$. For the choice $r_{m}:=t_{m}$ for each $m$, the sequence $v_{m}$ defined in (7.25) satisfies (7.26). The fact that $\\widetilde{V}\\left(r_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ implies $\\mathcal{V}\\left(r_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ and thus $V\\left(r_{m}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$, this further gives that $D\\left(r_{m}\\right)$ is bounded since $N\\left(0^{+}\\right)$has a right limit. Observe now that\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{r_{m}}} \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2}}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d x=r_{m}^{n} \\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla u\\left(r_{m} x\\right)\\right|^{2}}{H\\left(\\left|\\nabla u\\left(r_{m} x\\right)\\right|^{2} ; r_{m} x_{n}\\right)} d x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& =r_{m}^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla v_{m}\\right|^{2}}{H\\left(r_{m}\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; r_{m} x_{n}\\right)} d x \\\\\n& =r_{m}^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1} \\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla v_{m}\\right|^{2}}{H_{m}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nit follows from (7.17) and (7.25) that\n\n$$\nD\\left(u ; r_{m}\\right)=\\frac{r_{m} \\int_{B_{r_{m}}} \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2} d x}{H\\left(|\\nabla u|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}}{\\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}=\\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\left|\\nabla v_{m}\\right|^{2}}{H_{m}\\left(\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)} d x\n$$\n\nThis combined with the boundedness of $D\\left(u ; r_{m}\\right)$ and $H_{m} \\geqslant H_{0}$ for all $m$ that $v_{m}$ is bounded in $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$. Let $v_{0}$ be any weak limit of $v_{m}$ along a subsequence. Note that by the compact embedding $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1}\\right) \\hookrightarrow L^{2}\\left(\\partial B_{1}\\right)$, $\\left\\|v_{0}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\partial B_{1}\\right)}=1$, since this is true for $v_{m}$ for all $m$. It then follows from (7.26) that $v_{0}$ is a homogeneous function of degree $N\\left(u ; 0^{+}\\right)$.

It follows indeed that $\\widetilde{V}(u ; r) \\rightarrow 0$ as $r \\rightarrow 0^{+}$, it then follows from $\\mathcal{V}(u ; r)=o(\\widetilde{V}(u ; r))$ that $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\mathcal{V}(r)=0$. This gives $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0^{+}} V(r)=0$ and $D(r) \\rightarrow N\\left(0^{+}\\right)$.\n(2). Let $r_{m}$ be any sequence be such that $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$. In view of (7.29), we know that the boundedness of $v_{m}$ is equivalent to the boundedness of $D\\left(u ; r_{m}\\right)$.\n(3). Let $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$be such that $v_{m}$ converges weakly to $v_{0}$ along a subsequence. Let us now recall (7.26).

This concludes the proof since $\\int_{\\partial B_{1}} \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{H_{0}}=1$ is a direct consequence of $\\int_{\\partial B_{1}} \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{H_{0}} d \\mathcal{H}^{n-1}=1$.\n7.5. Compensated compactness. In this subsection we will apply a compensated compactness result which allows us to preserve subsonic variational solutions in the blow-up limit at degenerate stagnation points and exclude the concentration. To this end, we combine the compensated compactness result in $[13,15]$ with information we gained by our frequency formula. More precisely, we use the compensated compactness to prove the weak convergence of the nonlinear, quadratic terms $\\rho_{m} u_{1, m} \\cdot \\nabla u_{1, m}$ appeared in Euler system. Additionally, we obtain strong convergence of blow-up sequence which is necessary to prove our main result.\n\nProposition 7.13. Let $u$ be a subsonic variational solution of (3.4) for $n=2$, let $x^{\\circ} \\in \\Sigma^{u}$ and suppose that $u$ satisfies the growth condition\n\n$$\n|\\nabla u|^{2} \\leqslant x_{2}^{+} \\quad \\text { locally in } \\Omega\n$$\n\nLet $r_{m} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$be such that the sequence $v_{m}$ defined in (7.25) converges weakly to $v_{0}$ in $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$. Then $v_{m}$ converges to $v_{0}$ strongly in $W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,2}\\left(B_{1} \\backslash\\{0\\}\\right)$, and $v_{0}$ satisfies $v_{0} \\frac{\\Delta v_{0}}{H_{0}}=0$ in the sense of Radon measures on $B_{1}$.\n\nProof. Notice first that\n\n$$\nv_{m}(x)=\\frac{u\\left(x^{\\circ}+r_{m} x\\right)}{\\sqrt{r_{m}^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r_{m}}\\left(x^{\\circ}\\right)} \\frac{u^{2}}{H_{0}} d S}}=\\frac{r_{m}^{3 / 2} u_{m}(x)}{\\sqrt{\\int_{\\partial B_{1}} \\frac{u^{2}\\left(x^{\\circ}+r_{m} x\\right)}{H_{0}} d S}}=\\frac{u_{m}(x)}{\\sqrt{\\int_{\\partial B_{1}} \\frac{u_{m}^{2}}{H_{0}} d S}}\n$$\n\nGiven that $u_{m}$ satisfies $\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u_{m}}{H_{m}}\\right)=0$ in $\\left\\{u_{m}>0\\right\\}$ where\n\n$$\nH_{m}:=H\\left(r_{m}\\left|\\nabla u_{m}\\right|^{2} ; r_{m} x_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwe can deduce that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla v_{m}}{H_{m}}\\right)=0 \\quad \\text { in }\\left\\{v_{m}>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to the fact that $\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla u}{H\\left(\\left|\\nabla u\\right|^{2} ; x_{n}\\right)}\\right)$ is a non-negative Radon measure on $B_{1}$, we have that for arbitrary $0<\\varrho<\\sigma<1$\n\n$$\n\\left(\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla v_{m}}{H_{m}}\\right)\\right)\\left(B_{(\\sigma+1) / 2}\\right) \\leqslant C_{1} \\quad \\text { for all } m\n$$\n\nand that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}\\left(\\frac{\\nabla v_{m}}{H_{m}}\\right) \\geqslant 0 \\quad \\text { on } B_{1}\n$$\n\nThat is, take any non-negative $\\eta \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\nabla v_{m} \\nabla \\eta}{H_{m}} d x \\leqslant 0, \\quad \\text { for all } m\n$$\n\nIt is easy to verify that $H_{m} \\rightarrow H_{0}$ strongly in $L^{2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$. Thus, since $\\nabla v_{m} \\rightarrow$ $\\nabla v_{0}$ weakly in $L^{2}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\nabla v_{0} \\nabla \\eta}{H_{0}} d x=\\lim _{m \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\int_{B_{1}} \\frac{\\nabla v_{m} \\nabla \\eta}{H_{m}} d x \\leqslant 0\n$$\n\nThis implies that $\\frac{\\Delta v_{0}}{H_{0}}$ is a non-negative Radon measure supported on $B_{1}$, since $v_{0}$ is continuous in $B_{1}$, we deduce that $v_{0} \\frac{\\Delta v_{0}}{H_{0}}$ is well defined as a non-negative Radon measure on $B_{1}$. Note that it is at present not clear that $v_{m} \\rightarrow v_{0}$ strongly in $W^{1,2}\\left(B_{\\sigma_{2}} \\backslash B_{\\sigma_{1}}\\right)$. In order to improve that weak convergence to the strong convergence, we actually need to pass any PDE for $v_{m}$ so that we can \"shield\" the PDE from the failure of strong convergence. Here we will employ the method of \"compensated compactness framework\". We now state them for the sake of completeness.

The first rigorous\nproof of the conjecture was given by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland, as well as by\nPlotnikov independently via the Nekrasov integral equation. In the early 2010s,\nWeiss and Varvarucva revisited the conjecture by applying a new geometric\nmethod, which provided an affirmative answer to the conjecture without\nrequiring structural assumptions such as the isolation of the stagnation\npoints, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface that were\nnecessary in the previous works.\n  The main purpose of this paper is to establish the validity of the Stokes\nconjecture in the context of compressible gravity water waves. More precisely,\nwe prove that a sharp crest forms near each stagnation point of a compressible\ngravity water wave with an included angle of $120^{\\circ}$, which gives a first\nproof to the compressible counterpart of the classical conjecture by Stokes in\n1880.\n  The central aspect of our approach is the discovery of a new monotonicity\nformula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoulli-type. Another\nobservation is the introduction of a new nonlinear frequency formula, along\nwith a compensated compactness argument for the compressible Euler system. The\ndeveloped monotonicity formula enables us to do blow-up analysis at each\nstagnation point and helps us obtain the singular profile of the free surface\nnear each stagnation points. The degenerate stagnation points can be further\nanalyzed with the help of the compensated compactness argument using the\nfrequency formula.", "updated": "2025-04-21T07:30:34Z", "published": "2024-10-05T14:50:35Z"}
