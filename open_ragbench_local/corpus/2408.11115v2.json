InTRODUCTION\n\nIn [3], Chan-Huang-Lee prove a quantitative version of short-time Ricci flow existence, with scale-invariant estimates on the solution, starting from a metric $g$ that has effective uniform bounds on the negative part of the scalar curvature, volume ratios up to a fixed scale, and local $\\bar{\\nu}$-entropy, assuming that the local scale-invariant integral curvature (so-called \"curvature concentration\") is uniformly dependently small. Although it is not necessary to assume that $g$ has uniformly bounded sectional curvature, the authors of [3] do impose that it should enjoy an ineffective lower Ricci bound. To summarize precisely, the initial metric $g$ should satisfy\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathcal{R}_{g} \\geq-\\lambda \\\\\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r) \\leq \\mathfrak{v}_{0} r^{n} \\text { for all } x \\in M, r \\in(0,1] \\\\\n\\dot{\\nu}\\left(B_{g}(x, 1), g, \\tau\\right) \\geq-A \\text { for all } x \\in M \\\\\n\\left(\\int_{B_{g}(x, 1)}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g}^{\\frac{n}{g}} d V_{g}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\leq \\sigma \\text { for all } x \\in M, \\text { and } \\\\\n\\inf _{x \\in M} \\operatorname{Rc}_{g}(x)>-\\infty\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}, \\tau, A$ can be prescribed arbitrarily, but $\\sigma$ depends on these choices. We direct the reader to [12] for the definition and properties of the localized $\\nu$ - and $\\bar{\\nu}$-functionals. The ineffective lower Ricci bound in (1) is expected not to be necessary as it is only ever used to construct a smooth distance-like function on $M$, which in turn facilitates the approximation of the possibly unbounded curvature metric $g$ by a sequence of bounded curvature metrics satisfying the local assumptions (1) (with possibly different constants). As commented on in [3], this assumption may be weakened to a condition on how quickly $\\mathrm{Rc}_{g}^{-}$grows at spatial infinity, though we do not pursue this here. Rather, the purpose of this work is to show that the scalar curvature bound assumption in (1) is redundant in the sense that the required smallness of $\\sigma$ and the estimates of the solution need not depend on $\\lambda$. We prove the following.\n\nTheorem 1.1. For all $n \\geq 4, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}>0$, there are $C_{0}, \\sigma, T>0$ depending only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ such that the following holds. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a complete noncompact manifold (not necessarily bounded curvature) such that for some $\\varepsilon \\leq \\sigma$ and all $x \\in M$, the metric $g$ satisfies:\n(i) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r) \\leq \\mathfrak{v}_{0} r^{n}$ for all $r \\leq 1$;\n(ii) $\\bar{\\nu}\\left(B_{g}(x, 1), g, \\tau\\right) \\geq-A$;\n(iii) $\\left(\\int_{B_{g}(x, 1)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g}^{\\frac{\\delta}{g}} d V_{g}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{\\sigma}} \\leq \\varepsilon$; and\n(iv) $\\inf _{x \\in M} \\operatorname{Rc}_{g}(x)>-\\infty$.\n\nThen there exists a complete Ricci flow $g(t)$ on $M \\times[0, T]$ with $g(0)=g$ such that for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times(0, T]$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g(t)}(x) \\leq C_{0} \\varepsilon t^{-1} \\\\\n\\ln _{g(t)}(x) \\geq C_{0}^{-1} \\sqrt{t}, \\text { and } \\\\\n\\left(\\int_{B_{g(0)}\\left(x, \\frac{1}{16}\\right)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g(t)}^{\\frac{g}{g}} d V_{g(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{\\sigma}} \\leq C_{0} \\varepsilon\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nBefore we provide the applications of Theorem 1.1, we first make some remarks regarding its hypotheses and statement.\n\n- We have already mentioned above that the ineffective lower Ricci bound (iv) is likely a redundant hypothesis as it is only used to construct a distance-like function on $(M, g)$ satisfying some desired properties. Of particular note here, we suggest that the upper volume bound assumption (i) (here and throughout the paper) should also be redundant. Some evidence for this is discussed after Question 1 below. On the other hand, the $C^{0}$-control in the form of a $\\bar{\\nu}$-functional bound (ii) and the proportional smallness of the curvature concentration (iii) are a somewhat natural pairing from a Ricci flow point of view (see [9] and the references within for more discussion on this).\n- The choice of $r=\\frac{1}{16}$ in the curvature concentration in (2) is for convenience, not necessity; any $r<1$ would work with appropriate modification. Also, by applying the Shrinking Balls Lemma [11], the domain in the integral could be replaced with the ball of radius $r$ with respect to $g(t)$ after possibly shrinking $T$ further.\n- The constants $C_{0}, \\sigma, T$ in Theorem 1.1 can be explicitly bounded in terms of $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$, though we do not pursue this here because our methods for bounding these variables would be far from sharp. For example, suppose $\\tau=1$ and $\\mathfrak{v}_{0}=2 \\omega_{n}$, just for simplicity. Then, since the local curvature concentration ought to be preserved by the flow (up to a dimensional constant perhaps), we can compute that an optimal bound on $\\sigma$, from the parabolic point of view at least, should be\n\n$$\n\\sigma \\geq \\frac{1}{C(n) e^{\\frac{2 \\beta}{n}}}\n$$\n\nThis expected bound on $\\sigma$ comes from the equivalence between the $\\bar{\\nu}$-functional and an $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequality, and the relationship between this Sobolev inequality and the curvature concentration via H\u00f6lder's inequality. The reason why we would be unable to achieve a bound of the form (3) with our current machinery is due to the fact that there is not a known sharp relationship between volume ratios and $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequalities in spaces with possibly negative Ricci curvature. We direct the reader to sections 1 and 2 of [9] for more related discussion.\n\nWe also give two applications of our short-time existence theorem. The first of which can be viewed either (a) as a Ricci flow smoothing result for measure spaces $(M, \\mu)$ that are measure-space limits of a sequence of smooth manifolds $\\left(M_{i}, g_{i}\\right)$ satisfying Theorem 1.1, or (b) as a Gromov-Hausdorff compactness result for the family of metrics satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1. One important thing to point out about Theorem 1.2 is that the only $L^{\\infty}$ assumption on the curvature is that each $g_{i}$ satisfies some uniform lower Ricci bound, but that bound need not be the same for each $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nTheorem 1.2. For any $n \\geq 4, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}>0$, let $\\left(M_{i}^{n}, g_{i}, p_{i}\\right)$ be any sequence of complete pointed Riemannian manifolds (not necessarily bounded curvature) each satisfying hypotheses (i) - (iv). Then there exists a smooth pointed manifold $\\left(M_{\\infty}, x_{\\infty}\\right)$ endowed with a complete distance metric $d_{0}$ (which generates the same topology as the smooth structure of $M_{\\infty}$ ) and a Radon measure $\\mu$ such that, up to a subsequence,\n\n$$\n\\left(M_{i}, d_{g_{i}}, \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}}, p_{i}\\right) \\longrightarrow\\left(M_{\\infty}, d_{0}, \\mu, x_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the convergence is as pointed metric measure spaces (as described precisely below). Moreover, there exists a complete Ricci flow $g(t)$ on $M_{\\infty} \\times\\left(0, T\\left(n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}\\right)\\right]$ satisfying the estimates (2) which emerges from $\\left(M_{\\infty}, \\mu\\right)$ in the weak sense, i.e., that for any precompact Borel set $E \\subset M_{\\infty}$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}(E)=\\mu(E)\n$$\n\nThe notion in which the convergence (4) holds is as follows. There is some subsequence $\\left\\{i_{k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of $\\mathbb{N}$, an exhausting sequence $\\Omega_{k} \\subset M_{\\infty}$ of open sets, and functions $F_{k}: \\Omega_{k} \\rightarrow M_{i_{k}}$ (each of which are diffeomorphisms onto their images) with $F_{k}\\left(x_{\\infty}\\right)=p_{i_{k}}$ which satisfy\n\n$$\n\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{F_{k}^{*} g_{i_{k}}}(E)=\\mu(E)\n$$\n\nfor any precompact Borel set $E \\subset M_{\\infty}$, and\n\n$$\n\\left(M_{i_{k}}, d_{g_{i_{k}}}, p_{i_{k}}\\right) \\xrightarrow{\\text { pointed Gromov-Hausdorff }}\\left(M_{\\infty}, d_{0}, x_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the $F_{k}$ 's may serve as the approximating functions.\nRemark 1.3. Although the convergence of the distance function $d_{g(t)}$ back to the 'time 0 ' data $d_{0}$ is not guaranteed by Theorem 1.2, it is certainly expected that this is also true. The shortfall here is due to the fact our version of the Expanding Balls Lemma (Lemma 2.3) does not give a continuous rate of expansion at the initial time. See also Question 2 below.\n\nThe second application we present is for manifolds $(M, g)$ that satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 on all scales, thus allowing us to apply the theorem to increasingly extreme blow-downs to obtain long-time Ricci flow existence with the scale invariant properties (2) holding for all times. This allows us to conclude topological rigidity and global volume bounds on the initial manifold.\n\nTheorem 1.4. For all $n \\geq 4, A, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}>0$, there exists $\\sigma>0$ depending on $n, A, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ such that the following holds. For any $\\varepsilon \\leq \\sigma$, we denote $\\mathcal{M}_{\\varepsilon}$ to be the family of complete noncompact (not necessarily bounded curvature) Riemannian manifolds $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ satisfying:\n(i) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r) \\leq \\mathfrak{v}_{0} r^{n}$ for all $x \\in M, r>0$;\n(ii) $\\bar{\\nu}(M, g) \\geq-A$;\n(iii) $\\left(\\int_{M}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g}^{\\frac{\\pi}{g}} d V_{g}\\right)^{\\frac{\\pi}{g}} \\leq \\varepsilon$; and\n\n(iv) $\\inf _{x \\in M} \\operatorname{Rc}_{g}(x)>-\\infty$.\n\nThen each of the following rigidity properties holds:\n(a) If $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\sigma}$, then $M^{n}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and if $n \\neq 4$ then the homeomorphism can be taken to be a diffeomorphism.\n(b) For any $(M, g) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\sigma}$, the volume growth of $(M, g)$ at infinity is at least that of Euclidean space, uniformly with respect to the base point. More precisely,\n\n$$\n\\liminf _{r \\rightarrow \\infty, x \\in M} \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r)}{r^{n}} \\geq \\omega_{n}\n$$\n\n(c) By restricting $\\varepsilon$ smaller, we may assume that all volume ratios are uniformly close (from below) to that of Euclidean space, uniformly with respect to the manifold, base point, and scale. More precisely,\n\n$$\n\\liminf _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\left\\{\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r)}{r^{n}} \\text { where }(M, g) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\varepsilon}, x \\in M, r>0\\right\\} \\geq \\omega_{n}\n$$\n\nIn addition to the obvious question of whether the ineffective lower Ricci bound assumption (iv) can be removed from Theorem 1.4, we also present two additional questions.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the upper bound on volume ratios assumption (i) also redundant in the statement of Theorem 1.4?\n\nFor example, if $g$ is assumed to have bounded curvature, then conclusions (b) and (c) are still true even with assumption (i) removed, which follows from their methods of proof and the main result of [4]. Moreover, the main result of [4] includes a topological rigidity statement stronger than conclusion (a), assuming an additional mild hypothesis on the curvature but without the volume bound assumption. The primary issue that we face without the bounded curvature assumption is that our method to show that the curvature concentration remains bounded along the flow uses the Expanding Balls Lemma 2.3 (EBL), which seems to require an a priori upper bound on volume ratios.\n\nOur other question is also related to an issue with EBL. Specifically, if we had a version of this lemma that gave a continuous rate of expansion akin to that of the Shrinking Balls Lemma (instead of simply the conclusion that $B_{g(0)}(x, 1) \\subset B_{g(t)}(x, R)$ ), then we would be able to prove that the analogous almost-Euclidean upper bound conclusions of (b) and (c) would also be true. In other words, we would have an affirmative answer to the following.\n\nQuestion 2: With the same notation of $\\mathcal{M}_{\\varepsilon}$ from Theorem 1.4, is it true that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{r \\rightarrow \\infty, x \\in M} \\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r)}{r^{n}} \\leq \\omega_{n}\n$$\n\nfor any $(M, g) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\sigma}$ and that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0}\\left\\{\\frac{\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}(x, r)}{r^{n}} \\text { where }(M, g) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\varepsilon}, x \\in M, r>0\\right\\} \\leq \\omega_{n} ?\n$$\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we prove a modified version of the Expanding Balls Lemma, which substitutes the bound on the scalar curvature for a bound on the curvature concentration along the flow. In section 3, we prove Theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, each in their own subsection. Some of these proofs are similar to the methods in [2], [3], [4], [9], in which case we will only describe the necessary changes in this setting.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Modified distance distortion \n\nFirst, we recall the well-known Shrinking Balls Lemma due to Simon-Topping, which dictates how quickly distances can contract under Ricci flows with scale-invariant curvature bounds:\n\n$$\n\\sup _{y \\in B_{g(0)}(x, r)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g(t)}(y) \\leq c_{0} / t \\Longrightarrow B_{g(t)}\\left(x, r-\\beta \\sqrt{c_{0} t}\\right) \\subset B_{g(0)}(x, r)\n$$\n\nHere $\\beta=\\beta(n)$ is a dimensional constant, which is now fixed notation in the remainder of the paper. We direct the reader to [11, Corollary 3.3] for a precise statement.\n\nObtaining control on how quickly distances can expand under the flow usually requires control on the negative part of the Ricci or scalar curvature along the flow. In our setting, however, we are able to substitute this $L^{\\infty}$ curvature assumption for control on the local curvature concentration along the flow. We begin with an elementary lemma that allows us to control the rate at which volumes are perturbed, which will be useful in its own right.\n\nLemma 2.1 (Volume Perturbation). For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, v, \\sigma, r>0$, and any pointed (not assumed complete) Ricci flow $\\left(M^{n}, g(t), x_{0}\\right), t \\in[a, b]$ for some $a<b$, let $\\Omega \\subset \\subset M$ be any precompact set satisfying:\n(a) $B_{g(t)}\\left(x_{0}, r\\right) \\subset \\Omega$ for each $t \\in[a, b]$;\n(b) $\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{g(t)}\\right|^{\\frac{n}{2}} d V_{g(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\leq \\sigma$ for all $t \\in[a, b]$;\n(c) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} B_{g(t)}\\left(x_{0}, r\\right) \\geq v r^{n}$ for all $t \\in[a, b]$.\n\nThen whenever $a \\leq s \\leq t \\leq b$, there holds\n\n$$\ne^{-\\sigma v^{-\\frac{2}{n}} r^{-2}(t-s)} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(s)} \\Omega \\leq \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} \\Omega \\leq e^{\\sigma v^{-\\frac{2}{n}} r^{-2}(t-s)} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(s)} \\Omega\n$$\n\nRemark 2.2. Our most common application of Lemma 2.1 will be with $a=s=0$ and $\\Omega=B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2 r\\right)$. In this setting, if we further assume that the flow enjoys an $\\alpha / t$ curvature bound, then we can see (by SBL) that condition (a) can be replaced by the assumption that $B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2 r\\right) \\subset \\Omega$ as long as we also restrict $b \\leq \\frac{r^{2}}{\\beta^{2} \\alpha}$.\n\nProof of Lemma 2.1. By the evolution of the volume form $\\partial_{t} d V_{g(t)}=-\\mathcal{R}_{g(t)} d V_{g(t)}$, the assumed smallness of integral scalar curvature (b) and the lower bound of volumes at time $t$ in (c), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}(\\Omega) & \\leq\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{g(t)}\\right|^{\\frac{n}{2}} d V_{g(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}}\\left[\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}(\\Omega)\\right]^{\\frac{n-2}{n}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\sigma\\left[\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} B_{g(t)}\\left(x_{0}, r\\right)\\right]^{-\\frac{2}{n}} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}(\\Omega) \\\\\n& \\leq \\sigma\\left(v r^{n}\\right)^{-\\frac{2}{n}} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}(\\Omega)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore by comparison, we obtain $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} \\Omega \\leq e^{\\sigma v^{-\\frac{2}{n}} r^{-2}(t-s)} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(s)} \\Omega$ for any $0 \\leq s \\leq t \\leq$ $T$. The other inequality follows from an identical argument.\n\nThis volume perturbation estimate allows us to remove the assumption of a lower bound on scalar curvature in the version of EBL from [9].\n\nLemma 2.3 (Expanding Balls). For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $\\alpha, v, \\sigma>0$, there exists $\\widehat{T}(n, \\alpha, v, \\sigma)>$ 0 such that the following holds. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g(t), x_{0}\\right), t \\in[0, T]$ be a pointed Ricci flow (not assumed complete) such that for some $V>0$ there holds:\n\n(a) $B_{g(t)}\\left(x_{0}, 2^{n+2} V v^{-1}\\right) \\subset \\subset M$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$;\n(b) $\\left(\\int_{B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2\\right)}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{g(t)}\\right|^{\\frac{2}{n}} d V_{g(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\leq \\sigma$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$;\n(c) $\\sup _{x \\in B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2\\right)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g(t)}(x) \\leq \\alpha t^{-1}$ for all $t \\in(0, T]$;\n(d) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(0)} B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2\\right) \\leq V$; and\n(e) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} B_{g(t)}(x, r) \\geq v r^{n}$ whenever $x \\in B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 1\\right), r \\in\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$, and $t \\in(0, T]$.\n\nThen for all $t \\in[0, \\min \\{T, \\widehat{T}\\}]$, we have $B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 1\\right) \\subset B_{g(t)}\\left(x_{0}, 2^{n+2} V v^{-1}\\right)$.\nProof. The proof is nearly identical to the argument in [9]. The only changes are as follows. First, the maximal time interval in our setting will be\n\n$$\n\\widehat{T}=\\min \\left\\{\\frac{v^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\log 2}{\\sigma}, \\frac{1}{4 \\beta^{2} \\alpha}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNow the only setting in which the lower bound of scalar curvature was used in [9, Theorem 3.2] was to obtain the volume control\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2\\right)\\right) \\leq 2 \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(0)}\\left(B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 2\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $t \\in[0, \\min \\{T, \\widehat{T}\\}]$. For us, this implication follows immediately from Lemma 2.1 by our restrictions on the size of $\\widehat{T}$ and Remark 2.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. Proof of results\n### 3.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1.\n\nWe claim that it suffices to show that the theorem holds for complete bounded curvature metrics, albeit for slightly different scales (cf. Claim 3.1). The reason why this is sufficient is as follows. We know by [3, Theorem 2.1] that there exists a smooth proper function $\\rho: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ which, for some constant $C$ depending on the metric $g$, satisfies the following conditions uniformly for all $x \\in M$ :\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nC^{-1} d_{g}\\left(x_{0}, x\\right)-C \\leq \\rho(x) \\leq d_{g}\\left(x_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n\\left|\\nabla \\rho(x)\\right|_{g}^{2}+\\left|\\Delta^{g} \\rho(x)\\right| \\leq C ; \\text { and } \\\\\n\\int_{B_{g}(x, 1)}\\left|\\nabla^{2} \\rho\\right|_{g}^{n} d V_{g} \\leq C\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe emphasize again here that the ineffective lower Ricci curvature bound (iv) is only used to show that (5) holds. Once we know that (5) holds, by the proof of [3, Theorem 1.1], we can say that there exists a sequence of exhausting precompact open sets $U_{j} \\subset M$ and complete bounded curvature metrics $g_{j}$ on $U_{j}$ that satisfy all the following:\n\n- For any compact $\\Omega \\subset M, g_{j}=g$ on $\\Omega$ for all $j$ sufficiently large;\n- $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{j}} B_{g_{j}}(x, r) \\leq 2 \\mathfrak{n}_{0} r^{n}$ for all $r \\leq 1 / 2$;\n- $\\bar{\\nu}\\left(B_{g_{j}}(x, 1 / 2), g_{j}, \\tau\\right) \\geq-\\tilde{A}(n, A, \\tau)$; and\n- $\\left(\\int_{B_{g_{j}}(x, 1)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{\\tilde{g}_{j}}^{\\frac{2}{n}} d V_{g_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\leq 4 \\varepsilon$.\n\nDefine the sequence of blown-up metrics $\\tilde{g}_{j}=16^{2} g_{j}$, which (in particular) satisfies each of the following conditions uniformly with respect to $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $x \\in U_{j}$ :\n(I) $\\operatorname{Vol}_{\\tilde{g}_{j}} B_{\\tilde{g}_{j}}(x, r) \\leq 2 \\mathfrak{n}_{0} r^{n}$ for all $r \\leq 8$;\n(II) $\\bar{\\nu}\\left(B_{\\tilde{g}_{j}}(x, 4), \\tilde{g}_{j}, \\tau\\right) \\geq-\\tilde{A}$; and\n(III) $\\left(\\int_{B_{g_{j}}(x, 4)}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{\\tilde{g}_{j}}^{\\frac{2}{n}} d V_{\\tilde{g}_{j}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{n}} \\leq 4 \\varepsilon$.\n\nNow we claim that the $\\tilde{g}_{j}$ satisfy a slightly modified version of Theorem 1.1.\nClaim 3.1. There exists $\\widetilde{T}, C_{0}, \\sigma$ depending only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ such that the complete bounded curvature Ricci flow $\\tilde{g}_{j}(t)$ with $\\tilde{g}_{j}(0)=\\tilde{g}_{j}$ exists at least until time $\\widetilde{T}$ and satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{\\tilde{g}_{j}(t)}(x) \\leq C_{0} \\varepsilon t^{-1} \\\\\n\\left.\\inf _{\\tilde{g}_{j}(t)}(x) \\geq C_{0}^{-1} \\sqrt{t}, \\text { and } \\\\\n\\left(\\int_{B_{\\tilde{g}_{j}(0)}(x, \\frac{\\tau}{4})}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{\\tilde{g}_{j}(t)}^{\\frac{\\tau}{2}} d V_{\\tilde{g}_{j}(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\tau}{2}} \\leq C_{0} \\varepsilon\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nuniformly for all $(x, t) \\in U_{j} \\times[0, \\widetilde{T}]$, assuming that $\\varepsilon \\leq \\sigma$.\nTo prove the theorem (assuming the claim is true), we briefly sketch the argument of the proof of [3, Theorem 1.1]. Apply the claim to each $\\tilde{g}_{j}$ and scale back down to obtain a sequence of flows $g_{j}(t)$ on $U_{j} \\times[0, T]$, where $T=\\frac{\\widetilde{T}}{16 \\tau}$, and each $g_{j}(t)$ satisfies the estimates (2). Since $g_{j}=g$ on any compact set as $j \\rightarrow \\infty$, we can say by [5, Corollary 3.2] and Shi's modified interior estimates [6, Theorem 14.16] that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{j \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{\\Omega \\times[0, T]}\\left|\\nabla^{k} \\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g_{j}(t)} \\leq C(n, k, \\Omega, g)\n$$\n\nfor any $k \\geq 0$ and any compact $\\Omega \\subset M$. Then we may apply the Arzel\u00e1-Ascoli Theorem and a diagonal argument on a countable covering of coordinate charts to conclude that some subsequence of the $g_{j}(t)$ converges in $C_{\\text {loc }}^{\\infty}(M \\times[0, T])$ to a Ricci flow $g(t)$ on $M \\times[0, T]$ with $g(0)=g$. Moreover, $g(t)$ satisfies (2) because each $g_{j}(t)$ does, and is thus also a complete flow by SBL. Therefore it suffices to prove the claim.\n\nProof of claim. This argument is only a mild modification of [2, Theorem 1.2] and [9, Theorem 4.2]. We will follow the proof given in [9], using the same notation. For brevity, we will suppress the dependence on $j$ by denoting $g(t)=\\tilde{g}_{j}(t), t \\in[0, T]$ to be the unique bounded curvature Ricci flow emanating from $\\tilde{g}_{j}$. Let us begin by recalling the outline of the proof from [9]. There the author defines some constants $\\widetilde{T}, \\Lambda$ depending only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ (there, the values of $\\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ and $\\tau$ were fixed as $2 \\omega_{n}$ and 2 respectively), and then defines $T^{\\prime}>0$ to be the maximal time in $[0, \\min \\{T, \\widetilde{T}\\}]$ for which\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{g(t)}(x, 1)}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g(t)}^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} d V_{g(t)} \\leq \\Lambda \\varepsilon^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\n$$\n\nuniformly for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, T^{\\prime}\\right]$. Then the proof is split into three steps which we now briefly describe.\n(Step 1) For any $\\alpha>0$, let $T_{1}$ denote the largest time in which $|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g(t)} \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{t}$, which is necessarily positive because the flow $g(t)$ is of bounded curvature. Then this step shows the flow enjoys a local $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequality, and thus also a uniform lower bound on volume ratios up to a fixed scale, for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, \\min \\left\\{T^{\\prime}, T_{1}\\right\\}\\right]$ where the constants are uniform with respect to the choice of $(x, t)$.\n(Step 2) This step shows that the $T_{1}$ from Step 1 can actually be taken to only depend on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ as long as $\\Lambda$ is sufficiently large (depending only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ ). Thus we assume that $\\widetilde{T} \\leq T_{1}$. Note that in [9], their choice of $\\alpha$ was fixed while ours should depend on $\\varepsilon$.\n(Step 3) By Steps 1 and 2, we see that the desired conclusions of the theorem hold on the interval $\\left[0, T^{\\prime}\\right]$. Thus in this step it is shown that in fact $T^{\\prime}$ can be taken to be uniformly bounded from below, only depending on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$. This is the\n\nstep in which EBL is used to say that there must exist some $r_{0}>0$ such that $B_{g(0)}\\left(x, r_{0}\\right) \\subset B_{g(t)}(x, 1)$ for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times[0, \\widetilde{T}]$. This containment allows one to leverage the evolution of the curvature concentration against the known volume bounds at time $t=0$ to derive a contradiction if $\\Lambda$ is large enough and $T^{\\prime}<\\widetilde{T}$.\nWe now describe the necessary changes to the proofs of each of these three steps in our setting. For clarity of the proof, instead of defining the constants $\\widetilde{T}, \\Lambda, \\sigma$ ahead of time, we will simply start with them all being equal to 1 and adjust them as we go only ever depending on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$. Our first significant change is in the definition of $T^{\\prime}$. Rather than using the definition in (6), we define $T^{\\prime}$ to be the maximal time in $[0, \\min \\{T, \\widetilde{T}\\}]$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{g(0)}\\left(x, \\frac{\\tau}{4}\\right)}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g(t)}^{\\frac{n}{n}} d V_{g(t)} \\leq \\Lambda \\varepsilon^{\\frac{n}{2}}\n$$\n\nuniformly for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, T^{\\prime}\\right]$. This subtle change of the domain being defined with respect to $g(0)$ rather than $g(t)$ allows for the application of our version of EBL (Lemma 2.3). Despite this change, we can still say that $T^{\\prime}>0$ because $g(t)$ is a bounded curvature flow (this argument follows by a slight modification of [9, Lemma 4.1]). Thus by restricting $\\widetilde{T}$ and $\\sigma$ sufficiently small, Step 1 of the proof in [9] then follows synonymously. In particular, we obtain a uniform local $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequality along the flow:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{B_{g(t)}(x, 1)} u^{\\frac{2 n}{n-2}} d V_{g(t)}\\right)^{\\frac{n-2}{n}} \\leq C_{S}(n, A, \\tau) \\int_{B_{g(t)}(x, 1)}\\left|\\nabla^{g(t)} u\\right|_{g(t)}^{2}+u^{2} d V_{g(t)}\n$$\n\nfor all $u \\in W_{0}^{1,2}\\left(B_{g(t)}(x, 1)\\right)$ and all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, \\min \\left\\{T^{\\prime}, T_{1}\\right\\}\\right]$. It is well known that an $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequality also implies a lower bound on volume ratios (for convenience, the reader can look to Lemma 2.1 of the same paper [9]):\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} B_{g(t)}(x, r) \\geq \\tilde{v}\\left(n, C_{S}\\right) r^{n} \\text { for all }(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, \\min \\left\\{T^{\\prime}, T_{1}\\right\\}\\right], r \\in(0,1]\n$$\n\nRecall that in (8) and (9), $T_{1}$ is the largest time in which the flow $g(t)$ enjoys an $\\alpha / t$ curvature bound, with $\\alpha=C_{0} \\varepsilon$ (here $C_{0}$ will be defined later in terms of $\\Lambda$ ). Since $g(t)$ is a bounded curvature flow, we know that $T_{1}>0$, though a priori it appears to depend on the flow. In Step 2, however, we show that $T_{1}$ can be assumed to be at least as large as $T^{\\prime}$ whenever $\\widetilde{T}$ and $\\sigma$ are chosen small enough. It is necessary in this step to diverge from the limiting contradiction argument presented in [9]. Instead, we utilize a more classical argument, in which we argue by contradiction by assuming that $T_{1}<T^{\\prime}$. By the maximality of $T_{1}$, the flow certainly does enjoy an $\\alpha / t$ curvature bound on $\\left[0, T_{1}\\right]$, and thus condition (7) implies (6) on this interval by SBL, assuming $\\widetilde{T}$ is small enough. At this point, we may directly apply [2, Proposition 2.1] to derive a contradiction if $\\sigma$ is chosen small enough. Note that this argument (and constants thereof) is independent of the exact choice of $\\varepsilon \\leq \\sigma$.\n\nIt remains to show that Step 3 goes through as well. By taking $\\widetilde{T}$ and $\\sigma$ small enough, we may still arrive at the conclusion that\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{g(t)}(x, 1 / 4)}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g(t)}^{\\frac{n}{n}} d V_{g(t)} \\leq 4 \\cdot(4 \\varepsilon)^{\\frac{n}{2}}\n$$\n\nholds uniformly for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, T^{\\prime}\\right]$. Now by our modified assumption on the smallness of the local curvature concentration in (7), our assumed initial volume upper bound (I), and our lower bound on volume ratios along the flow in (9), we can say by our version of EBL\n\n(Lemma 2.3) that if $\\widetilde{T}$ is small enough, then there is some $r_{0}\\left(n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}\\right)>0$ such that for all $(x, t) \\in M \\times\\left[0, T^{\\prime}\\right]$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{g(0)}\\left(x, r_{0}\\right)}|\\operatorname{Rm}|_{g(t)}^{\\frac{\\alpha}{n}} d V_{g(t)} \\leq 4 \\cdot(4 \\varepsilon)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\n$$\n\nNow the remainder of Step 3 follows verbatim to [9] because by (I) and (9) we have a uniform doubling estimate on scales less than 4 :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(0)} B_{g(0)}(x, 2 r) \\leq 2^{3 n+1} \\mathfrak{v}_{0} \\tilde{v}^{-1} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(0)} B_{g(0)}(x, r) \\leq\\left(2^{3 n+1} \\mathfrak{v}_{0} \\tilde{v}^{-1}\\right) \\mathfrak{v}_{0} r^{n} \\text { for all } r \\in(0,4]\n$$\n\nThus we obtain a contradiction if $\\Lambda$ is large enough and if $T^{\\prime}$ is assumed to be strictly less than $\\min \\{T, \\widetilde{T}\\}$. The constant $C_{0}$ can therefore be taken to be $\\Lambda^{\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}$.

Existence and properties of $d_{0}$.\n\nTo show that this family of Ricci flows $g_{i}(t)$ are regular enough to extract a GromovHausdorff limiting distance metric at time zero, we will use the following claim, which says that the conclusion of [7, Theorem 2.4] holds in this setting, i.e., that the flows $g_{i}(t)$ are uniformly (with respect to $i$ ) locally bi-H\u00f6lder.\n\nClaim 3.2.

This implies that $d_{0}$ generates the same topology as $M_{\\infty}$. The fact that $\\left(M_{\\infty}, d_{0}\\right)$ is a complete metric space follows from (13) by an argument that we now sketch. If $\\left(M_{\\infty}, d_{0}\\right)$ were not complete then we could choose some continuous rectifiable curve $\\gamma:[0,1) \\rightarrow M_{\\infty}$, i.e., Length $_{d_{0}}(\\gamma)<\\infty$, but with the property that $\\lim _{s \\uparrow 1} \\gamma(s) \\notin M_{\\infty}$.

Thus $\\left(M_{\\infty}, d_{0}\\right)$ is a complete metric space. The claim about the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence with the $F_{i}$ being the approximating functions is straightforward from (12). So it suffices to prove the claim.\n\nProof of Claim 3.2. We will prove the inequalities in (11) individually. In what follows, we let $C$ denote any large constant depending only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}, \\alpha$ (recall that $\\alpha=C_{0} \\sigma$ also depends only on $n, A, \\tau, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ ) and may vary line-by-line, and we will also drop the subscripts $i$ for brevity. The RHS is identical to the proof of the analogous inequality in property (iv) of [3, Theorem 5.1], so we only give a sketch. By the $\\alpha / t$ curvature bound and SBL we obtain, for $0<s \\leq t \\leq T$,\n\n$$\nd_{g(0)}(x, y) \\leq d_{g(s)}(x, y)+C \\sqrt{s} \\leq\\binom{t}{s}^{(n-1) \\alpha} d_{g(t)}(x, y)+C \\sqrt{s}\n$$\n\nIf $d_{g(t)}(x, y)>1$ then the RHS of (11) is obvious, so assume $d_{g(t)}(x, y) \\leq 1$ and define $s \\in(0, t]$ by\n\n$$\ns=t d_{g(t)}^{\\frac{1}{1+2(n-1) \\alpha}}(x, y)\n$$\n\nThen the RHS of (11) follows by plugging (15) directly into (14) and simplifying using the assumptions that $t \\leq 1$.\n\nNow we prove the LHS.

Thus we have proved that (18) holds. Moreover, using a similar (albeit less involved) approach to the proof of (18), we also obtain\n\n$$\n\\liminf _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}(\\Omega)=\\limsup _{r \\rightarrow 0} \\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}\\left(\\Omega \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, r\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nNot only can we say from (18) and (24) that the limits $\\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}(\\Omega)$ and $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}$ exist, but we also can say that for any $\\varepsilon>0$, we can take $r>0$ small enough so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|\\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}(\\Omega)-\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} \\Omega\\right| \\leq\\left|\\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}(\\Omega)-\\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}\\left(\\Omega \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, r\\right)\\right)\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\lim _{i \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}\\left(\\Omega \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, r\\right)\\right)-\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(\\Omega \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, r\\right)\\right)\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(\\Omega \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, r\\right)\\right)-\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} \\Omega\\right| \\leq \\varepsilon+0+\\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\nWe are now ready to formally define the measure $\\mu$. For the sake of brevity, let us write $\\mathcal{A}_{j}$ to denote the $j^{\\prime}$ th annulus centered at $x_{\\infty}$ with respect to the metric $d_{0}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{j}:=B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, j\\right) \\backslash B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{\\infty}, j-1\\right)\n$$\n\nAlso we write $\\operatorname{Borel}(\\Omega)$ to denote the $\\sigma$-algebra of all Borel subset of $\\Omega$ and recall a basic measure theory fact that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Borel}\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right)=\\left\\{E \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}: E \\subset \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(M_{\\infty}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThus for each $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we define $\\mu_{j}: \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by\n\n$$\n\\mu_{j}(E)=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} E \\quad\\left(\\text { or equivalently, } \\mu_{j}(E)=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Vol}_{g_{i}} F_{i}(E)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is a well-defined function by Claim 3.7. Additionally, by an elementary measure theory argument (see [10] for instance), we may conclude that each $\\mu_{j}$ is countably additive, or equivalently in this setting, that each tuple $\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{j}, \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right), \\mu_{j}\\right)$ is in fact a measure space. Now for any $E \\in \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(M_{\\infty}\\right)$, we define\n\n$$\n\\mu(E):=\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\mu_{j}\\left(E \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis can be seen to define a measure on $M_{\\infty}$ because if $E=\\cup_{k=1}^{\\infty} E_{k}$ for some pairwise disjoint sequence of Borel sets $E_{k}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mu(E)=\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\mu_{j}\\left(E \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right)=\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mu_{j}\\left(E_{k} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\mu_{j}\\left(E_{k} \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mu\\left(E_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere we have applied Tonelli's Theorem and the countable additivity of each $\\mu_{j}$. Finally, to show that $\\mu$ is Radon, we must show that it is outer and inner regular, i.e., that\n\n$$\n\\mu(E)=\\sup \\{\\mu(K): K \\subset E \\text { is compact }\\}=\\inf \\{\\mu(U): U \\supset E \\text { is open }\\}\n$$\n\nfor any $E \\in \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(M_{\\infty}\\right)$. Since the proof of inner regularity is very similar to that of the outer regularity, we will only show the latter. To that end, fix some $E \\in \\operatorname{Borel}\\left(M_{\\infty}\\right)$ and $\\varepsilon>0$. Just as in the proof of (18) in Claim 3.7, for each $j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we can find some $x_{j} \\in M_{\\infty}$ and $r_{j}>0$ such that $B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{j}, r_{j}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{A}_{j}$ and that\n\n$$\n\\mu\\left(B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{j}, r_{j}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2^{j+2}}\n$$\n\nWrite $B_{j}=\\left(E \\cap \\mathcal{A}_{j}\\right) \\cup B_{d_{0}}\\left(x_{j}, r_{j}\\right)$, which is precompact in $M_{\\infty}$, so we may choose a finite sequence of points $\\left\\{y_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{N} \\subset M_{\\infty}$ such that\n\n$$\nB_{j} \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^{N} B_{d_{0}}\\left(y_{k}, \\frac{1}{100}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow choose $t_{j}^{\\prime}>0$ small enough such that whenever $t \\in\\left(0, t_{j}^{\\prime}\\right]$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mu_{j}\\left(B_{j}\\right)-\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(B_{j}\\right)\\right|<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2^{j+2}}\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}$ is a Riemannian measure (and subsequently, Radon), we may choose some precompact open set $U_{j, t} \\subset M_{\\infty}$, containing $B_{j}$, that satisfies\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(U_{j, t}\\right)-\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)}\\left(B_{j}\\right)<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2^{j+2}}\n$$\n\nMoreover by intersecting $U_{j, t}$ with the finite open cover from (27), we may assume\n\n$$\nU_{j, t} \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^{N} B_{d_{0}}\\left(g_{k}, \\frac{1}{100}\\right)\n$$\n\nImportantly, here $N$ is independent of $t \\in\\left(0, t_{j}^{\\prime}\\right]$.

Because the assumptions of the theorem are scale-invariant, we may apply Theorem 1.1 to successively extreme blowdowns $R^{-2} g$, which (after scaling back) gives a family of Ricci flows $g_{R}(t)$ on $M \\times\\left[0, T R^{2}\\right]$, for $R$ arbitrarily large.

Moreover, by the proof of Theorem 1.1, we can also conclude that we have a global $L^{2}$-Sobolev inequality and a uniform lower bound on all volume ratios along the flow. More precisely, we know that (8) holds for the metrics $R^{-2} g$.

Conclusion (a) holds.\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of [3, Theorem 1.2]. First note that since assumption (i) as well as each of the conclusions in (31) and (33) are scale-invariant, the flows $g_{R}(t)=$ $R^{-2} g\\left(R^{2} t\\right)$ satisfy these conclusions as well. Lemma 2.3 then implies that whenever $t \\in$ $\\left[0, \\widehat{T}\\left(n, C_{0} \\sigma, \\widehat{v}, C_{0} \\sigma\\right)\\right]$, we have\n\n$$\nB_{g_{R}(0)}\\left(x_{0}, 1\\right) \\subset B_{g_{R}(t)}\\left(x_{0}, 2^{2 n+2} \\mathfrak{v}_{0} \\hat{v}^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nFix some $T>\\widehat{T}$ large enough so that $C_{0}^{-1} \\sqrt{T} \\geq 2^{2 n+3} \\mathfrak{v}_{0} \\hat{v}^{-1}$, then shrink $\\sigma$ accordingly so that for any Ricci flow $h(t), t \\in[0, T]$ satisfying (31) (in particular, the $g_{R}(t)$ ),\n\n$$\nd_{h(T)}\\left(x_{0}, \\cdot\\right) \\leq 2 d_{h(\\widehat{T})}\\left(x_{0}, \\cdot\\right)\n$$\n\nScaling back, we can say that $B_{g(0)}\\left(x_{0}, R\\right)$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for all $R>0$. The fact that $M$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ follows by [1], and the homeomorphism can be taken to be a diffeomorphism when $n \\neq 4$ because $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ is only Euclidean space with exotic differential structures.\n\nProposition 3.9.

We may now consider $\\sigma$ to be fixed. Then by the smallness of the global curvature concentration in (31) and the\n\nSobolev inequality (32), we may apply [4, Theorem 1.2] to the bounded curvature metric $g(1)$ to conclude faster than $1 / t$ curvature decay:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} t \\sup _{x \\in M}\\left|\\operatorname{Rm}\\right|_{g(t)}(x)=0\n$$\n\nNow we argue by contradiction by assuming there is some $\\varepsilon>0$ and sequences $x_{j} \\in M$ and $R_{j} \\rightarrow \\infty$ with\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g} B_{g}\\left(x_{j}, R_{j}\\right)<(1-\\varepsilon) \\omega_{n} R_{j}^{n}\n$$\n\nConsider the blowdown pointed flows $\\left(M, g_{j}(t), x_{j}\\right), t \\in(0,1]$, where $g_{j}(t)=R_{j}^{-2} g\\left(R_{j}^{2} t\\right)$.

Furthermore, by nature of the uniform faster than $1 / t$ curvature decay (34) and uniform lower bound on volume ratios (33), we can see that this flow must be isometric to the static flow on flat Euclidean space.

For any $\\delta>0$, we can take $\\varepsilon$ small enough (depending only on $\\delta, n, A, \\mathfrak{v}_{0}$ ), so that for any $(M, g) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{\\varepsilon}$ and associated long-time Ricci flow $g(t)$ as given above, there holds\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}_{g(t)} B_{g(t)}(x, \\sqrt{t}) \\geq(1-\\delta) \\omega_{n} t^{\\frac{n}{\\delta}}\n$$\n\nfor all $(x, t) \\in M \\times(0, \\infty)$.\nProof of Claim. Since the hypotheses and conclusion of the claim are invariant under scaling, it suffices to prove (37) holds only for some short time interval $t \\in\\left[0, T_{1}\\right]$. Then since we are working locally, we may assume that the flow we are working on is actually complete with\n\nbounded curvature and satisfying the estimates (2). This assumption is validated by the fact that our (possibly initially unbounded curvature) Ricci flow is obtained by a smooth local limit of such flows (recall the proof of Theorem 1.1). The proof is then identical to the beginning of the proof of $[2$, Theorem 4.2].\n\nThe remainder of the proof is similar to the proof of part (b) with the notable difference being that instead of choosing a time $t_{\\varepsilon}$ sufficiently small depending on $\\delta$, we take $\\varepsilon$ small instead. Thus for some given $\\delta>0$, let $\\varepsilon_{\\delta / 2}$ be as given in Claim 3.12. Again by the invariance under scaling, we may assume that $r=1$. First assume that $\\varepsilon$ is small enough so that\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\leq \\min \\left\\{\\varepsilon_{\\delta / 2}, \\frac{1}{4 \\beta^{2} C_{0}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen writing $t_{\\varepsilon}=\\left(1-\\beta \\sqrt{C_{0} \\varepsilon}\\right)^{2}<1$, we apply Lemma 2.1, together with SBL and Claim 3.12 to see that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(1-\\delta / 2) \\omega_{n} t_{\\varepsilon}^{\\frac{\\delta}{2}} & \\leq \\operatorname{Vol}_{g\\left(t_{\\varepsilon}\\right)} B_{g\\left(t_{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\\left(x, \\sqrt{t_{\\varepsilon}}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq \\operatorname{Vol}_{g\\left(t_{\\varepsilon}\\right)} B_{g(0)}(x, 1) \\\\\n& \\leq \\exp \\left(4 n C_{0} \\varepsilon \\tilde{v}^{-\\frac{\\delta}{n}} t_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\operatorname{Vol}_{g(0)} B_{g(0)}(x, 1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen the result follows if we further shrink $\\varepsilon$ if necessary to ensure that\n\n$$\n(1-\\delta / 2)\\left(1-\\beta \\sqrt{C_{0} \\varepsilon}\\right)^{n} \\exp \\left(-4 n C_{0} \\varepsilon \\tilde{v}^{-\\frac{\\delta}{n}}\\right) \\geq 1-\\delta\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n1.
