InTRODUCTION\n\nLet $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a proper holomorphic submersion from a complex $(n+1)$-dimensional manifold to a unit disk in $\\mathbb{C}$, such that the fibers $X_{t}:=\\pi^{-1}(t)$ over $\\Delta$ are compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds. We call such a morphism a smooth family of compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds. There are several long-standing conjectures on the deformation limits of the compact complex manifolds in Fujiki class $\\mathcal{C}$, K\u00e4hler, Moishezon and projective manifolds, respectively, within a smooth family. More precisely, if any $X_{t}(t \\neq 0)$ is in Fujiki class $\\mathcal{C}$ (or K\u00e4hler), then $X_{0}$ is in Fujiki class $\\mathcal{C}$; if any $X_{t}(t \\neq 0)$ is Moishezon (or projective), then $X_{0}$ is Moishezon. A compact complex manifold is Moishezon (or in Fujiki class $\\mathcal{C}$ ) if it is bimeromorphic to a projective (or K\u00e4hler) manifold. Equivalently, a compact complex manifold is Moishezon if and only if its algebraic dimension is its complex dimension. The algebraic dimension $a(X)$ of a compact complex manifold $X$ is its transcendental degree of the field of meromorphic functions on $X$ over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAccording to Kodaira's classification of surfaces (e.g., [Si83, Bu99, Lm99]), every compact complex surface with the even first Betti number is K\u00e4hler. So Ehresmann's theorem [Em47] and the deformation invariance of Hodge numbers imply that the limit surface $X_{0}$ of the compact complex surfaces in Fujiki class $\\mathcal{C}$ (or equivalently K\u00e4hler surfaces) is K\u00e4hler, while [Po13, Corollary 1.3] proves the deformation limit of Moishezon (or equivalently projective) surfaces to be projective.\n\nIn the higher-dimensional setting, Hironaka's counterexample [Hi62] demonstrates that even if all fibers $X_{t}$ are projective for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$, the central fiber $X_{0}$ need not necessarily be projective or K\u00e4hler.\nD. Popovici [Po13] proved that if all fibers $X_{t}$ are projective for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$ and the central fiber $X_{0}$ either satisfies the deformation invariance of the Hodge number $h^{0,1}$ or admits a strongly Gauduchon metric, then $X_{0}$ is Moishezon. A Hermitian metric $\\omega$ on a compact complex $n$ dimensional manifold is called a strongly Gauduchon metric [Po13] (or simply a Gauduchon metric) if $\\partial \\omega^{n-1}$ is $\\bar{\\partial}$-exact (or equivalently, $\\bar{\\partial}$-closed). The existence of Gauduchon metrics on any compact complex manifold was established in [Ga77]. Moreover, if $X$ satisfies the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma, then every Gauduchon metric on $X$ is automatically strongly Gauduchon. Here the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma refers to: for every pure-type $d$-closed form on a complex manifold, the properties of $d$-exactness, $\\partial$-exactness, $\\bar{\\partial}$-exactness and $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-exactness are equivalent.\nD. Barlet [Ba15] further extended these results, showing that if all fibers $X_{t}$ are Moishezon for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$ and $X_{0}$ satisfies either of the aforementioned conditions, then $X_{0}$ remains Moishezon. More recently, S. Rao-I-H. Tsai [RT21] proved that if the family contains uncountably many Moishezon fibers, then any fiber satisfying either of these conditions must also be Moishezon.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Date: March 25, 2025.\n    2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Koll\u00e1r [Ko22a] proposed a conjecture in the case of flat families, asserting that if all fibers $X_{t}$ are Moishezon for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$ and the central fiber $X_{0}$ is irreducible with rational singularities in a proper flat morphism over $\\Delta$, then $X_{0}$ is Moishezon. A brief review of progress on this topic, along with a collection of further stimulating open questions, can be found in [Ko22a, Section 1].\n\nAs for the general case, we prove the following.\nTheorem 1.1. Assume that there exist uncountably many Moishezon fibers in a smooth family over $\\Delta$. Then all fibers of this family are Moishezon.\n\nTheorem 1.1 is proposed as [RT21, Conjecture 1.6] and is actually a direct corollary of Theorem 1.2 and Rao-Tsai's above result.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Assume that the fiber $X_{t}$ is Moishezon for each $t \\in \\Delta^{*}:=\\Delta \\backslash\\{0\\}$. Then the central fiber $X_{0}$ is Moishezon.\n\nNow, let us outline our approach to proving Theorem 1.2. First, using Kodaira-Spencer and Bott-Chern theories, we construct a smooth complex vector bundle $J$ over $\\Delta$, such that its fiber $J(0)$ over $0 \\in \\Delta$ is the Bott-Chern cohomology group $H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{0}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$ of $X_{0}$, possibly after shrinking the base $\\Delta$. Next, applying the Oka-Grauert principle, we construct a smooth complex subbundle $F \\subset J$ such that the restriction $\\left.F\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$ is the smooth complex vector bundle formed by $\\bigcup_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}} H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$. Here and henceforth, we identify the Bott-Chern cohomology class with its harmonic form representative with respect to the Bott-Chern Laplacian operator.\n\nSecond, according to [Ba15, Theorem 1.0.2] (or Remark 2.10), the Moishezonness property of $X_{t}$ for any $t \\neq 0$ gives rise to a good filling $\\mathcal{F}$ of relative $(n-1)$-cycles over $\\Delta^{*}$. We then construct a constant section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ of the constant sheaf $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$, defined by the fundamental classes of $(n-1)$-cycles parameterized by the good filling $\\mathcal{F}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$. This section is also a smooth section of $\\left.F\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$, and can be extended over $\\Delta$ as a constant section of the constant sheaf $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nMoreover, the canonical morphism from the Bott-Chern cohomology to the de Rham cohomology induces a corresponding morphism from the smooth complex vector bundle $F$ to the smooth complex vector bundle associated with the constant sheaf $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$. As a result, we extend the section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ to the entire disk as a global section of $\\mathcal{F}$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the sheaf of smooth sections of $F$.\n\nThus, we can control the volumes of these cycles by integrating the section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ wedged with a smooth family of Gauduchon metrics over $X_{t}$ for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$, owing to our construction $F \\subset J$. Consequently, Bishop's sequence theorem [Bi64] (or Proposition 2.7) for analytic sets implies that the closure of $\\mathcal{F}$ in $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta)$ gives rise to the good filling over the whole of $\\Delta$. Finally, we apply Barlet's theory of relative codimension 1 cycle spaces [Ba15, Lemma 2.2.3] (or Lemma 2.12) to establish the semi-continuity of the algebraic dimension in the smooth family of compact complex manifolds, thereby proving Theorem 1.2.\n\nOur proof relies heavily on Barlet's theory of relative codimension 1 cycle spaces. The main difference between our proof and those of Popovici and Barlet lies in our use of the Steinness of the bases $\\Delta$ and $\\Delta^{*}$ to construct the smooth complex vector bundle $F$ via the Oka-Grauert principle. Furthermore, we extend the constant section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ of the constant sheaf $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$ to the entire $\\Delta$, thereby realizing its extension as a smooth section of $F$.\n\nAs several applications of Theorem 1.1 to a smooth family $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ with uncountably many Moishezon fibers, we prove that $\\pi$ satisfies the deformation invariance of plurigenera and also the property that the restriction of\n\n$$\n\\mu: \\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta) \\rightarrow \\Delta\n$$\n\nto each irreducible component of the relative $(n-1)$-cycle space $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta)$ is proper over $\\Delta$. In particular, if there are uncountably many projective fibers in $\\pi, \\pi$ is pseudo-projective and thus the projective locus of $\\pi$ is either at most a union of countably many points or a Zariski dense open subset of $\\Delta$.\n\nFinally, using our approach, one can refine Barlet's upper semi-continuity [Ba15, Theorem 1.0.3] of algebraic dimensions under the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma by removing the assumption on the deformation\n\ninvariance of Hodge number of type $(0,1)$ there. It is a standard result that a compact K\u00e4hler or Moishezon manifold satisfies the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma. Theorem 1.3 can be regarded as a generalization of Theorem 1.1. A. Fujiki-M. Pontecorvo's example in [FP10, Theorem 1.1] shows that this does not hold in general.\n\nTheorem 1.3. Assume that the fiber $X_{t}$ satisfies the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma for each $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$ and that $a:=$ $\\inf _{t \\in \\Delta^{*}} a\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ of the algebraic dimensions $a\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ or (equivalently) there are uncountably many fibers of algebraic dimension a. Then $a\\left(X_{t}\\right) \\geq a$ for all $t \\in \\Delta$.\n\nIn fact, a compact complex manifold that satisfies the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma possesses many desirable properties, such as the deformation invariance of all types of Hodge numbers and Bott-Chern numbers, the canonical isomorphism from Bott-Chern cohomology to Dolbeault cohomology, the existence of a strongly Gauduchon metric, and the Hodge decomposition. A nice reference on these is [BHPV04, \u00a7 I.12-13]. Building on these properties and the approach to proving Theorem 1.2, we can obtain a ( $\\Delta$-proper) good filling for $\\pi$, which is the closure of a ( $\\Delta^{*}$-proper) good filling for the restricted family $\\tilde{\\pi}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$. It is important to note that the general fiber of $\\tilde{\\pi}$ has algebraic dimension $a$ in the context of Theorem 1.3.\n\nThroughout this paper, we use the following notations and conventions:\n(1) $\\pi: \\mathrm{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ denotes a smooth family of compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds over the unit disk in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n(2) $f: \\mathrm{X} \\rightarrow B$ denotes a smooth family of complex manifolds over an arbitrary-dimensional base $B$.\n(3) All complex manifolds are assumed to be connected.\n(4) The notation $h^{i}(X, L)$, for any non-negative integer $i$, represents $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{i}(X, L)$, where $L$ is a holomorphic line bundle over a compact complex manifold $X$.\n(5) The term general points of a complex space refers to points outside a thin subset of $\\Delta$.\n\nAcknowledgment: The authors would like to express their gratitude to Professor D.

Preliminaries: constant sheaves and Barlet's CYcLe spaces \n\nWe begin by presenting the preliminaries on constant sheaves, the Oka-Grauert principle, BottChern operator theory and Barlet's theory of relative codimension-1 cycle spaces, which will important role in the proof of Theorem 1.2.\n2.1. Constant sheaves and trivial bundles. Two nice references on local systems are [Di04, ES10]. Let $X$ be a complex manifold and $E$ a smooth complex vector bundle of rank $r$ over $X$. A flat structure in $E$ is given by an open cover $\\left\\{U_{i}, s_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ with local frame fields such that the transition functions $g_{i j}$ are all constant matrices in $G L(r ; \\mathbb{C})$ with $s_{j}=s_{i} g_{i j}$. A vector bundle $E$ with a flat structure is said to be flat.\n\nDenote by $\\bmod \\left(\\mathbb{C}_{X}\\right)$ the abelian category of sheaves of $\\mathbb{C}_{X}$-module over $X$, where $\\mathbb{C}_{X}$ is the constant sheaf on $X$. A $\\mathbb{C}_{X}$-local system on $X$ is a sheaf $\\mathcal{L} \\in \\bmod \\left(\\mathbb{C}_{X}\\right)$ which is locally constant, i.e., there is an open cover $\\left\\{U_{i}\\right\\}$ of $X$ and a family of $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces $V_{i}$ such that $\\left.\\mathcal{L}\\right|_{U_{i}} \\cong \\mathcal{V}_{i}$, the constant sheaf on $U_{i}$ associated to $V_{i}$. When $X$ is connected, the family $\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ can be replaced by\n\na single $\\mathbb{C}$-vector space. A trivial local system is also called a constant local system or constant sheaf (i.e., one in which the covering can be chosen as $\\{X\\}$ ).\n\nRemark 2.1. By [Ga94, Proposition 1.4.5] there is a bijective correspondence between local systems on $X$ up to isomorphism and flat bundles on $X$ up to isomorphism, which are frequently used in the context.\n\nLemma 2.2 ([ES10, Proposition 1.5]). Let $M$ be a connected, simply connected, locally path connected and locally simply connected topological space. Then a local system $\\mathcal{L}$ on $M$ is isomorphic to a constant sheaf $L_{M}$.\n\nThe following two theorems indicate that any smooth complex or holomorphic vector bundle over $\\Delta$ or $\\Delta^{*}$ is a (holomorphic) trivial vector bundle.\n\nTheorem 2.3 ([Lt90, Corollary 3.3]). Let $X$ be a (connected) Stein analytic space. Then:\n(i) If $E$ and $F$ are holomorphic vector bundles over $X$ which are continuously isomorphic, then $E$ and $F$ are also holomorphically isomorphic.\n(ii) Each continuous complex vector bundle over $X$ carries a uniquely determined structure of a holomorphic vector bundle.\n\nThis theorem is a corollary of Grauert's theorem [Lt90, Theorem 3.2] and gives the Oka-Grauert principle, i.e., it is not necessary to distinguish between holomorphic and topological complex vector bundles on a Stein analytic space.\n\nTheorem 2.4 ([Lt90, Theorem 3.5]). Every holomorphic vector bundle over an open Riemann surface is holomorphically trivial.\n\nJust as [Lt90, Notes 3.6] indicates, Theorem 2.4 was obtained by H. R\u00f6hrl [Ro57]. R\u00f6hrl gives a direct proof as well as topological arguments which reduce Theorem 2.4 to Theorem 2.3.(i).\n2.2. Cohomologies of complex manifolds. The Bott-Chern cohomology of a complex manifold $X$ is defined by\n\n$$\nH_{B C}^{\\bullet \\bullet}(X, \\mathbb{C}):=\\frac{\\operatorname{ker} \\partial \\cap \\operatorname{ker} \\bar{\\partial}}{\\operatorname{im} \\partial \\bar{\\partial}}\n$$\n\nThe Aeppli cohomology of $X$ is defined by\n\n$$\nH_{A}^{\\bullet \\bullet}(X, \\mathbb{C}):=\\frac{\\operatorname{ker} \\partial \\bar{\\partial}}{\\operatorname{im} \\partial+\\operatorname{im} \\bar{\\partial}}\n$$\n\nAll the vector spaces in the formulae are the complex vector spaces of pure-type complex differential forms. Their classes are written as $\\{\\cdot\\}_{B C}$ and $\\{\\cdot\\}_{A}$, respectively.\n\nIn some sense, the Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies are dual to each other by:\nLemma 2.5 (e.g. [Sw07, Lemma 2.5]). Let $X$ be a compact complex n-dimensional manifold. For any $(p, q) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{2}$, the wedge $\\wedge$-operator induces a non-degeneration pairing\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_{B C}^{p, q}(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\times H_{A}^{n-p, n-q}(X, \\mathbb{C}) & \\xrightarrow{\\wedge} H_{A}^{n, n}(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\xrightarrow{l_{X}} \\mathbb{C} \\\\\n\\left(\\{\\alpha\\}_{B C},\\{\\beta\\}_{A}\\right) & \\longmapsto \\int_{X} \\alpha \\wedge \\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFix a Hermitian metric on $X$ and define the Bott-Chern Laplacian operator\n\n$$\n\\square_{B C}:=(\\partial \\bar{\\partial})(\\partial \\bar{\\partial})^{*}+(\\partial \\bar{\\partial})^{*}(\\partial \\bar{\\partial})+(\\bar{\\partial}^{*} \\partial)\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{*} \\partial\\right)^{*}+\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{*} \\partial\\right)^{*}\\left(\\bar{\\partial}^{*} \\partial\\right)+\\bar{\\partial}^{*} \\bar{\\partial}+\\partial^{*} \\partial\n$$\n\nwhich is a self-adjoint elliptic differential operator. Then the Hodge decomposition and isomorphism hold.\n\nProposition 2.6. Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold endowed with a Hermitian metric. Then for any non-negative integers $p, q$, there exists an orthogonal decomposition\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}^{p, q}(X)=\\operatorname{ker} \\square_{B C} \\oplus \\operatorname{im} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\oplus\\left(\\operatorname{im} \\partial^{*}+\\operatorname{im} \\bar{\\partial}^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nand an isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{B C}^{\\bullet \\bullet}(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\operatorname{ker} \\square_{B C}\n$$\n\nProof. For a proof, we refer to [Sw07, Theorem 2.2].\n2.3. Barlet's theory of cycle spaces. We refer to [BM19] for a systematic study on Barlet's theory of cycle spaces. The Barlet space of a reduced complex space parametrizes linear combinations with positive integer coefficients of irreducible compact analytic sets, all of the same dimension (these are called cycles). It is the analytic counterpart of the Chow scheme. D. Lieberman [Lb78] should be the first one to have noticed the 'compactness of the Chow scheme' in the K\u00e4hler context, and its strong implications in K\u00e4hler geometry (for the structure of automorphism groups first), which is the origin of the later developments ${ }^{1}$.\n2.3.1. Absolute case. In this subsection, let $X$ always be a compact complex $n$-dimensional manifold. For any nonnegative integer $k \\leq n$, a $k$-cycle in $X$ is a formal linear combination\n\n$$\nZ:=\\sum_{i \\in I} k_{i} Z_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is a finite set, $k_{i}$ are nonzero positive integers and $\\left(Z_{i}\\right)_{i \\in I}$ are pairwise distinct complex $k$-dimensional irreducible analytic subsets of $X$. By Poincar\u00e9 duality there exists an isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\gamma: H_{2 k}(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H^{2 n-2 k}(X, \\mathbb{Z})\n$$\n\nassociating the homology class $[Z] \\in H_{2 k}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ to a cohomology class $\\left[\\eta_{Z}\\right] \\in H^{2 n-2 k}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of a $d$-closed $(2 n-2 k)$-form $\\eta_{Z}$ such that for any $d$-closed $2 k$-form $\\alpha$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\int_{Z} \\alpha=\\int_{X} \\alpha \\wedge \\eta_{Z}\n$$\n\nThen we call the class $\\left[\\eta_{Z}\\right]$ the fundamental class of $Z$. If $X$ is projective or Moishezon, then the fundamental class $\\left[\\eta_{Z}\\right]$ of a $k$-cycle $Z$ belongs in the Dolbeault cohomology $H^{n-k, n-k}(X, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe support $|Z|$ of the cycle $Z$ is the analytic subset\n\n$$\n|Z|:=\\bigcup_{i \\in I} Z_{i}\n$$\n\nA cycle $Z$ is called compact if $|Z|$ is compact. Let $\\mathcal{C}_{k}(X)$ be the set of all compact $k$-cycles of $X$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(X)=\\bigcup_{0 \\leq k \\leq n} \\mathcal{C}_{k}(X)\n$$\n\nFor any compact irreducible analytic subset $\\mathcal{A}$ of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(X)$ there exists a meromorphic map\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{A}}: X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}_{a-1}(\\mathcal{A})\n$$\n\nfrom the generic point $x$ of $X$ to the set\n\n$$\n\\left\\{T \\in \\mathcal{C}_{a-1}(\\mathcal{A}): \\text { there exists } t \\in|T| \\text { s.t., } x \\in|t|\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $a \\geq 1$ is the complex dimension of $\\mathcal{A}$. The map $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is said to be the Kodaira map of $\\mathcal{A}$, introduced by F. Campana in [Ca80]. The algebraic dimension of $X$ is $\\max _{\\Gamma} \\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{K}_{\\Gamma}(X)$, where $\\Gamma$ is any irreducible component in $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(X)$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ We thank F. Campana for pointing this out to us.\n\n2.3.2. Relative case. Let\n\n$$\nf: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow B\n$$\n\nbe a smooth family of compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds with $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} B=s$. There is a relative $k$-cycle space $\\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X} / B) \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X})$ such that the image $f(|Z|)$ for any $Z \\in \\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X} / B)$ is a point in $B$ for $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. And the set $\\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X} / B)$ is a closed analytic subset of $\\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X})$. Denote by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}(\\mathcal{X} / B):=\\bigcup_{0 \\leq k \\leq n} \\mathcal{C}_{k}(\\mathcal{X} / B)\n$$\n\nthe relative Barlet space of $\\mathcal{X}$ over $B$. By the definition of relative cycle space, there is a canonical morphism\n\n$$\n\\mu: \\mathcal{C}(\\mathcal{X} / B) \\rightarrow B\n$$\n\nBishop's sequence theorem of analytic sets plays an important role in proving the properness of the morphism $\\mu$.\n\nProposition 2.7 ([Bi64, Theorem 1]). Let $\\left(Z_{m}\\right)_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of pure $n$-dimensional analytic subsets in an open subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, converging to a set $Z$ of $U$ in the sense of Hausdorff in $U$. If the volume of $Z_{m}$ is finite and bounded by some constant, then $Z$ is an analytic subset of $U$ of pure dimension $n$.\n\nRecall that a real smooth $(2 n-2)$-form $\\omega$ on an $n$-dimensional compact complex manifold $X$ is called a strongly Gauduchon form if it is $d$-closed, and the $(n-1, n-1)$-part of $\\omega$ is positive. A smooth $B$-relative $(2 n-2)$-form on $\\mathcal{X}$ is called a relative strongly Gauduchon form for the smooth family $f$ if it induces a strongly Gauduchon form on each fiber of $f$.\n\nRemark 2.8. [Po13, Proposition 4.2] tells us that a compact complex manifold is strongly Gauduchon if and only if it has a strongly Gauduchon form. And Barlet [Ba15] observes that if every fiber of a smooth family of compact complex manifolds is a strongly Gauduchon manifold, then there exists a relative strongly Gauduchon form for the smooth family. In fact, it is a consequence of the deformation openness of the strongly Gauduchon manifold and the partition of unity of the base.\n\nLemma 2.9 ([Ba15, Proposition 3.0.6]). Let $f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow B$ admit a relative strongly Gauduchon form. Then the restriction of\n\n$$\n\\mu: \\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / B) \\rightarrow B\n$$\n\nto each irreducible component of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / B)$ is proper over $B$.\nLet $\\mathcal{T}$ be an irreducible $B$-proper analytic subset of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / B)$ and set $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{T}=t$. If the analytic set $\\mathcal{T}$ satisfies the conditions\n(i) the second projection from the graph $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{T}} \\subset \\mathcal{T} \\times_{B} \\mathcal{X}$ which is the tautological family parameterized by $\\mathcal{T}$ to $\\mathcal{X}$ is surjective;\n(ii) the general member is irreducible for any tautological family parameterized by $\\mathcal{T}$, then the set $\\mathcal{T}$ is said to be a good filling for the family $f$.\n\nRemark 2.10. In the proof of [Ba15, Theorem 1.0.2], Barlet shows the existence of the good filling for a smooth family $\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow B$ if the restriction of the morphism $\\mu: \\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / B) \\rightarrow B$ to each irreducible component of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / B)$ is proper over $B$.\n\nBarlet [Ba15] introduces the relative Kodaira map $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{T} / B}$. For each good filling $\\mathcal{T}$ we can define a proper $B$-modification $\\alpha_{\\mathcal{T}}: \\mathcal{X}_{\\mathcal{T}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}$ and a holomorphic $B$-map\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{T} / B}: \\mathcal{X}_{\\mathcal{T}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}_{t-s-1}(\\mathcal{T} / B)\n$$\n\nobtained by composition of the \"fiber-map\" of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{T}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}$ and the $B$-relative direct-image map of relative $(t-s-1)$-cycles via the $B$-map $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{T}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nRemark 2.11. [Ba15, Lemma 2.2.2] shows that if $\\mathcal{T}$ is a (B-proper) good filling for $f$, then the map $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{T} / B}$ is proper and the image $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{T}}$ of $\\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{T} / B}$ is proper over $B$.

By the Oka-Grauert principle, we obtain a subbundle $F \\subset J$ whose restriction $\\left.F\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$ is formed by the fibers $H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$ for $t \\neq 0$, identifying Bott-Chern cohomology classes with their harmonic representatives.\n\nNext, applying [Ba15, Theorem 1.0.2] (or Remark 2.10), the Moishezon property of $X_{t}$ for $t \\neq 0$ yields a good filling $\\mathcal{T}$ of relative $(n-1)$-cycles over $\\Delta^{*}$, defining a constant section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ of the constant sheaf $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$. This extends smoothly over $\\Delta$ as a section of $\\mathcal{F}$, the sheaf of smooth sections of $F$, via the morphism from Bott-Chern to de Rham cohomology.\n\nIntegrating $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}$ against a family of Gauduchon metrics allows volume control, ensuring that Bishop's theorem [Bi64] (or Proposition 2.7) extends $\\mathcal{T}$ (over $\\Delta^{*}$ ) to a good filling over all of $\\Delta$. Finally, Barlet's theory of relative cycle spaces [Ba15, Lemma 2.2.3] (or Lemma 2.12) establishes the semi-continuity of the algebraic dimension, completing the proof of Theorem 1.2.\n3.1. Construction via Bott-Chern and Kodaira-Spencer theories. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family of compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds in this subsection. Let\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}=\\wedge^{p} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,0} \\otimes \\wedge^{q} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{0,1}\n$$\n\nbe the $\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}$-sheaf of smooth relative $(p, q)$-differential forms on $\\mathcal{X}$, where\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,0}:=\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}}^{1,0} / \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta}^{1,0}, \\quad \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{0,1}:=\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}}^{0,1} / \\pi^{*} \\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta}^{0,1}\n$$\n\nKodaira-Spencer [KS60, (27)] defined two differential operators\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial}: \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q+1}, \\quad \\partial: \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p+1, q}\n$$\n\nsuch that the restrictions satisfy $\\imath_{t}^{*} \\circ \\bar{\\partial}=\\bar{\\partial}_{t} \\circ \\imath_{t}^{*}$ and $\\imath_{t}^{*} \\circ \\partial=\\partial_{t} \\circ \\imath_{t}^{*}$, where\n\n$$\n\\imath_{t}: X_{t} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{X}\n$$\n\nis the natural holomorphic embedding, $\\bar{\\partial}_{t}$ and $\\partial_{t}$ are the ordinary differential operators on $X_{t}$.\nConsider the complex\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\bullet}(1,1): 0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{0,0} \\xrightarrow{\\partial \\bar{\\partial}_{t}} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,1} \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,2} \\oplus \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{2,1} \\longrightarrow \\cdots\n$$\n\n(c.f. [YY23, Proposition 2.1] for example). Put\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}:=R^{1} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{L}^{\\bullet}(1,1)\n$$\n\nWe need Lemma 3.1 to show the base change and get $\\widehat{\\mathcal{G}}_{t}=H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$.\n\nLemma 3.1. There holds $\\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}\\right)=\\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{X_{t}}^{p, q}\\right)$ for any $t \\in \\Delta$.\nProof. By definition, we have $\\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}\\right) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}_{t}}^{p, q}\\right)$. The converse follows from [RYY19, Lemma 2.1] and we give a different proof here. As Ehresmann's theorem implies that $\\mathcal{X}$ is diffeomorphic to $X_{t} \\times \\Delta$, there exists a smooth projection\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}: \\mathcal{X} \\cong X_{t} \\times \\Delta \\rightarrow X_{t}\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1} \\circ t_{t}=\\operatorname{Id}_{X_{t}}\n$$\n\n(e.g., [Vo02, Remark 9.4]).

Let\n\n$$\nP^{p, q}: \\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p+q}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nP_{t}^{p, q}: \\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}_{t}}^{p+q}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}_{t}}^{p, q}\\right)\n$$\n\nbe two projections, and then the smooth complex differential form $P^{p, q} \\pi_{1}^{*} \\alpha \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}\\right)$. Obviously, (3.1) gives\n\n$$\n\\left.\\left.\\left.\\left(P^{p, q} \\pi_{1}^{*} \\alpha\\right)\\right|_{X_{t}}=P_{t}^{p, q}\\left(\\left.\\left(\\pi_{1}^{*} \\alpha\\right)\\right|_{X_{t}}\\right)=P_{t}^{p, q}(\\alpha)=\\alpha\\right.\n$$\n\nand then $\\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X}_{t}}^{p, q}\\right) \\subseteq \\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, q}\\right)$.\nLet\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}^{\\bullet}(p): 0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, 0} \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, 1} \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{p, 2} \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\cdots\n$$\n\nbe the relative Dolbeault complex.\nThe morphism $\\rho^{\\bullet}: \\mathcal{L}^{\\bullet}(1,1) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}^{\\bullet}(1)$ in the abelian category of complexes of sheaves of $\\bmod \\left(\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}\\right)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{0,0} \\xrightarrow{\\partial \\partial} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,1} \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,2} \\oplus \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{2,1} \\longrightarrow \\cdots \\\\\n& \\text { o } \\downarrow \\quad \\xrightarrow{1 d} \\downarrow \\quad \\downarrow \\\\\n& 0 \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,0} \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,1} \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta}^{1,2} \\longrightarrow \\cdots\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ninduces a morphism\n\n$$\n\\rho: \\widehat{\\mathcal{S}} \\rightarrow R^{1} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{D}^{\\bullet}(1)\n$$\n\nin $\\bmod \\left(\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}\\right)$.\nIn what follows, we do not distinguish between $\\Delta$ and $\\Delta_{\\epsilon}(0<\\epsilon \\ll 1)$ or similarly $\\Delta^{*}$ and $\\Delta_{\\epsilon}^{*}$ in many places.\n\nWe shall use the Kodaira-Spencer's proof of upper semi-continuity to construct a smooth complex vector bundle over $\\Delta$. As in [KS60, Part I], let $\\square_{B C, t}$ be the family of Bott-Chern Laplacian elliptic operators which act on $\\Gamma\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{A}_{X_{t}}^{1,1}\\right)$ for any $t \\in \\Delta$ and $\\lambda_{h}(t)$ the corresponding eigenvalues with\n\n$$\n0 \\leq \\lambda_{1}(t) \\leq \\lambda_{2}(t) \\leq \\cdots \\leq \\lambda_{h}(t) \\leq \\cdots\n$$\n\nAnd the function $t \\mapsto \\lambda_{h}(t)$ is continuous over $\\Delta$. Suppose $0=\\lambda_{1}(0)=\\cdots=\\lambda_{h_{0}}(0)<\\lambda_{h_{0}+1}(0)$. Let $D:=D_{\\epsilon}$ be an $\\epsilon$-disc in $\\mathbb{C}$ with $0<\\epsilon<\\lambda_{h_{0}+1}(0)$. Therefore, the boundary $C$ of $D$ does not meet any value of $\\lambda_{h}(0)$ for $h \\geq 1$. Denote by $\\mathbf{F}_{t}(C)$ the linear subspace of eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{h}(t) \\in D$ for $h=1, \\cdots, h_{0}$. Then by [KS60, Proposition 2, Lemma 7], after shrinking $\\Delta$ small enough, one knows that\n\n$$\nJ:=\\bigcup_{t \\in \\Delta} \\mathbf{F}_{t}(C)\n$$\n\nforms a smooth complex vector bundle on $\\Delta$. Let $\\mathcal{J}$ be the smooth locally free sheaf associated with $J$.\n\nLet $\\widehat{G}:=\\cup_{t \\in \\Delta} \\widehat{0}_{t}$ be the disjoint union of the stalks of $\\widehat{0}$. It is a topological space as explained in $[\\mathrm{Br} 97, \\S 1$ of Chapter I]. The definition of Bott-Chern cohomology implies\n\n$$\n\\widehat{G}=\\bigcup_{t \\in \\Delta} \\mathbf{F}_{t} \\subset J\n$$\n\nas sets, where $\\mathbf{F}_{t}$ is a linear subspace of eigenfuntions corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. Here and henceforth, we identify the Bott-Chern cohomology class with its harmonic form representative with respect to the Bott-Chern Laplacian operator by [KS60, Proposition 7] (or Proposition 2.6 here), similarly to the identification of the Dolbeault cohomology class with its harmonic form representative with respect to the $\\bar{\\partial}$-Laplacian operator as in Voisin's proof of Kodaira-Spencer's local stability of K\u00e4hler structures [Vo02, \u00a7 9.3.3].\n3.2. Proofs of Theorems 1.2 and 1.1. Throughout this subsection, let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family of compact complex $n$-dimensional manifolds with all fibers $X_{t}$ for $t \\neq 0$ being Moishezon.\n\nNow we come to:\nProof of Theorem 1.2. The proof is divided into four steps.\nStep (I). By the Oka-Grauert principle, we obtain a subbundle $F \\subset J$ whose restriction $\\left.F\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$ is formed by the fibers $H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$ for $t \\neq 0$, identifying cohomology classes with their harmonic representatives.\n\nAs $X_{t}$ are Moishezon manifolds for all $t \\neq 0$, the Bott-Chern number $k:=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$ is independent of $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$, and thus $\\left.\\widehat{G}\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}:=\\cup_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}} \\widehat{0}_{t}$ forms a smooth complex vector bundle over $\\Delta^{*}$ with rank $k$ by [KS60, Theorem 9]. Moreover, since $\\Delta^{*}$ is a Stein domain, $\\left.\\widehat{G}\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$ is a trivial vector bundle by Theorems 2.3 and 2.4. So we have the isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\Delta^{*}}: \\left.\\widehat{G}\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{k} \\times \\Delta^{*}\n$$\n\nSimilarly for the smooth complex vector bundle $J$ with rank $m:=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{0}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$, as $\\Delta$ is a Stein domain, there exists an isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\psi: J \\cong \\mathbb{C}^{m} \\times \\Delta\n$$\n\nBecause $\\left.\\widehat{G}\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}} \\subset\\left.J\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}$ as smooth complex vector bundles, one has the canonical commutative diagram\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nDefine $F$ by $\\psi^{-1}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{k} \\times \\Delta\\right)$. Then\n\n$$\n\\left.F\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}=\\psi^{-1}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{k} \\times \\Delta^{*}\\right)=\\psi_{\\Delta^{*}}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{k} \\times \\Delta^{*}\\right)=\\phi_{\\Delta^{*}}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^{k} \\times \\Delta^{*}\\right)=\\left.\\widehat{G}\\right|_{\\Delta^{*}}\n$$\n\nSo $F$ is the desired smooth complex subbundle of $J$.\nStep (II). Construct a constant section of $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$ given by the fundamental classes of $(n-1)$-cycles parameterized by a good filling.\n\nSince all fibers $X_{t}$ for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$ are Moishezon and thus satisfy the $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}$-lemma, there exists a strongly Gauduchon form on each fiber $X_{t}$ for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$. So there is a relative strongly Gauduchon form for the family\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\pi}:=\\left.\\pi\\right|_{\\mathcal{X}^{*}}: \\mathcal{X}^{*}:=\\pi^{-1}\\left(\\Delta^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Delta^{*}\n$$\n\nfrom Remark 2.8. Then the restriction of the holomorphic morphism\n\n$$\n\\mu: \\mathcal{C}_{n-1}\\left(\\mathcal{X}^{*} / \\Delta^{*}\\right) \\rightarrow \\Delta^{*}\n$$\n\nto each irreducible component of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}\\left(\\mathcal{X}^{*} / \\Delta^{*}\\right)$ is proper by Lemma 2.9. Thanks to the proof of [Ba15, Theorem 1.0.2], we can obtain a ( $\\Delta^{*}$-proper) good filling $\\mathcal{F}$ for the family $\\tilde{\\pi}$ such that $\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathcal{F}}(t)$ is the algebraic dimension $a\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ of $X_{t}$ for the general $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$.\n\nDenote by $\\alpha$ the fundamental class of the relative $(n-1)$-cycles in the family which are parameterized by the good filling $\\mathcal{F}$. By the Hodge decomposition theorem due to the Moishezonness property of the fibers over $\\Delta^{*}$, the fundamental class $\\alpha \\in H^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right) \\cap H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ for any $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$. In fact, $\\left[Z_{t}\\right]$ is the integration current on the fiber $X_{t}$ of a member $Z_{t}$ of the family $\\mathcal{F}$ in the fiber $X_{t}$ for $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$. Then as the discussion in [DP04, \u00a75], there is a commutative diagram\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nwhere $p$ is the map from $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}\\left(\\mathcal{X}^{*} / \\Delta^{*}\\right)$ to $R^{2} \\tilde{\\pi}_{*} \\mathbb{Z}_{\\mathcal{X}^{*}}$. Since the map $p$ is continuous and $R^{2} \\tilde{\\pi}_{*} \\mathbb{Z}_{\\mathcal{X}^{*}}$ is discrete, the cohomology classes induced by the analytic cycles $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\} \\in H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ remain the same $\\alpha$ for all $t \\in \\Delta^{*}$. Then we can obtain a family $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ of flat classes in $H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ and then regard $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ as a constant section of $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$.\nStep (III). Extend the section $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ over the whole disk to become that of $\\mathcal{F}$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the sheaf of smooth sections of $F$.\n\nBecause $\\Delta$ is a contractible space, the local system $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$ is thus a constant sheaf by Lemma 2.2. Denote by $R$ the smooth complex vector bundle formed by $\\cup_{t \\in \\Delta} H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$, which is also the trivial vector bundle associated to the constant sheaf $\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}}:=R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathbb{C}$. By the Moishezonness property of the fibers over $\\Delta^{*}$ and the canonical morphism from the Bott-Chern cohomology group to the de Rham cohomology group, there exists a canonical morphism\n\n$$\n\\phi: F \\rightarrow R\n$$\n\nwhich is an injection when restricted on $\\Delta^{*}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{R}$ be the associated sheaf of smooth sections to $R$. As $\\Delta$ is an open Riemann surface, $F$ is a trivial vector bundle by by Theorems 2.3 and 2.4. So we can obtain a constant sheaf $\\widehat{\\mathcal{F}}$ from $\\mathcal{F}$. Then there hold\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{F} & =\\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta} \\\\\n\\mathcal{R} & =\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta} \\\\\nj^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} & \\hookrightarrow j^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathcal{R}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $j: \\Delta^{*} \\hookrightarrow \\Delta$ is the natural inclusion. Since $j_{*}$ is a left exact functor, they satisfy\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\phi}: \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\cong j_{*} j^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\hookrightarrow j_{*} j^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} \\cong \\widehat{\\mathcal{R}}\n$$\n\nAs $\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}}$ gives a constant section of $\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}}$ over $\\Delta^{*}$ as shown in Step (II), one can canonically extend it across the origin 0 , and denote by $\\hat{s}$ the extended section over $\\Delta$. Then we have the sequence of smooth sheaves\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta} \\xrightarrow{\\hat{s}} \\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta} \\xrightarrow{\\widehat{\\phi}}\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right) /\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right) \\longrightarrow 0\n$$\n\nwhere the first morphism is induced by tensor product with the section $\\hat{s}$ and the second morphism is induced by $\\widehat{\\phi}$.\n\nBecause the morphism $\\widehat{\\phi}$ in (3.2) is an injection, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right) /\\left(\\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right) \\cong(\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} / \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\n$$\n\nwhere the quotient $\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} / \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}}$ is also a constant sheaf over $\\Delta$. So the image\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\phi} \\circ \\hat{s} \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\Delta,(\\widehat{\\mathcal{R}} / \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right) \\cong \\Gamma\\left(\\Delta, \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{\\otimes(d-k)}\n$$\n\nwith $d:=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$, is a smooth section. By the Moishezonness property of the fibers over $\\Delta^{*}$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\left[Z_{t}\\right]\\right\\}_{t \\in \\Delta^{*}} \\in \\Gamma\\left(\\Delta^{*}, \\mathcal{F}\\right)=\\Gamma\\left(\\Delta^{*}, \\widehat{\\mathcal{F}} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{C}_{\\Delta}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\Delta}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich means that $\\widehat{\\phi} \\circ \\hat{s}$ is zero over $\\Delta^{*}, \\hat{s}$ is actually a smooth section in $\\Gamma(\\Delta, \\mathcal{F})$.\nStep (IV). Control the volumes of the cycles and prove the central fiber to be Moishezon.\nWithout loss of generality, we denote by $\\Delta$ the $e$-disk $\\Delta_{\\epsilon}$. As the construction of $\\mathcal{F}$ tells us that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a subsheaf of the smooth locally free sheaf $\\mathcal{F}$, one has $\\hat{s} \\in \\Gamma(\\Delta, \\mathcal{F}) \\subset \\Gamma(\\Delta, \\mathcal{F})$. Then there is a relative $d$-closed smooth (1,1)-form $\\Omega$ on $\\mathcal{X}$ such that $\\left\\{\\left.\\Omega\\right|_{X_{t}}\\right\\}_{B C}=\\hat{s}_{t}$ in $H_{B C}^{1,1}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{C}\\right)$ for any $t \\in \\Delta$. By [Ga77] one obtains a smooth family of Gauduchon metrics $\\omega_{t}$ of positive definite (1,1)-forms on the fibers $X_{t}$ for all $t \\in \\Delta$. Therefore, there exists a positive constant number $C$ such that for any $t \\in \\Delta \\backslash\\{0\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{Z_{t}} \\omega_{t}^{n-1}=\\left(\\hat{s}_{t},\\left\\{\\omega_{t}^{n-1}\\right\\}_{A}\\right)=\\int_{X_{t}} \\Omega\\left\\|_{X_{t}} \\wedge \\omega_{t}^{n-1} \\leq C\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the non-degenerate pairing in Lemma 2.5 .\nDenote by $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}$ the closure of $\\mathcal{F}$ in $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta)$. By Proposition 2.7 and (3.3), $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}$ is an irreducible component of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta)$ which is proper over $\\Delta$. Lemma 2.12 implies the semi-continuity of the dimensions of the fibers of the projection $\\mathcal{F}_{\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}} \\rightarrow \\Delta$, and thus for any $t \\in \\Delta, a\\left(X_{t}\\right) \\geq n$, or equivalently, $a\\left(X_{t}\\right)=n$. Hence, the central fiber $X_{0}$ is Moishezon.\nRemark 3.2. For a smooth family with general projective fibers, we might also use the same method as above to control the mass of a family of positive forms in [Po13] and thus obtain an integral K\u00e4hler current on the central fiber along the approach in [Po13], to prove the central fiber to be Moishezon. In this way, we only need to consider a sequence of points in $\\Delta^{*}$ that converges to the origin and control the mass of positive forms over this sequence of points. Then the proof would rely much on [Po08].\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Rao-Tsai [RT21] prove that if there exist uncountably many Moishezon fibers in a smooth family over the unit disk in $\\mathbb{C}$, then any fiber satisfying the deformation invariance for the Hodge number of type $(0,1)$ or admitting a strongly Gauduchon metric is still Moishezon. Moreover, Grauert's upper semi-continuity theorem tells us that a general fiber in a smooth family indeed satisfies the deformation invariance for Hodge number of any type (e.g., [LRT24, Corollary 2.10]). So, any general fiber is Moishezon and Theorem 1.2 thus concludes the proof.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-0.jpeg":

{"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4. Applications to Moishezon families \n\nWe give several applications of Theorem 1.1 to deformation invariance of plurigenera, structure of family, projective locus and cycle space theory.\n\nBy Theorem 1.1 and the bimeromorphic embedding proved in [RT21, RT22], a smooth family with uncountably many Moishezon fibers is Moishezon, i.e., bimeromorphic to a projective family over the unit disk.\n4.1. Deformation invariance of plurigenera. The first application to generically fiberwise Moishezon family is deformation invariance of plurigenera. For any positive integer $m$, the $m$ genus $P_{m}(X)$ of a compact complex manifold $X$ is defined by\n\n$$\nP_{m}(X):=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{0}\\left(X, K_{X}^{\\otimes m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{X}$ is the canonical line bundle of $X$. It is a bimeromorphic invariant and the $m$-genus of an arbitrary compact complex variety is thus defined as the $m$-genus of its arbitrary non-singular model. Similarly, a compact complex variety $M$ is of general type if the Kodaira-Iitaka dimension\n\nof the canonical line bundle of its arbitrary non-singular model is just the complex dimension of $M$.\n\nProposition 4.1 ([RT22, Main Theorem 1.2]). Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a family such that any of the the following conditions holds:\n(i) the family $\\pi$ is smooth and any fiber $X_{t}$ for $t \\in \\Delta$ is Moishezon.\n(ii) each (not necessarily projective) compact variety $X_{t}$ at $t \\in \\Delta$ has only canonical singularities and uncountably many fibers therein being of general type.\nThen the $m$-genus $P_{m}\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ for each positive integer $m$ is independent of $t \\in \\Delta$.\nCorollary 4.2. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family with uncountably many Moishezon fibers. Then the $m$-genus $P_{m}\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ is independent of $t \\in \\Delta$ for any positive integer $m$.\nProof. This is a direct corollary of Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 4.1.\nRemark 4.3. The (possibly incomplete) introduction on the progress of the deformation invariance of plurigenera can be found in [RT22, Introduction].\n4.2. Pseudo-projective families and projective loci. [RT22, Definition 4.28] introduces a new notion that a family $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ is called pseudo-projective if there exists a bimeromorphic morphism\n\n$$\n\\tau: \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}\n$$\n\nover $\\Delta$ where $\\rho: \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ is a projective family with $\\mathcal{Y}$ being a complex manifold, such that $\\tau$ induces a biholomorphism from $\\rho^{-1}(U)$ to $\\pi^{-1}(U)$ for some dense Zariski open subset $U$ of $\\Delta$.\n\nAs the second application, one has:\nCorollary 4.4. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family with uncountably many projective fibers. Then $\\pi$ is pseudo-projective.\nProof. The proof is implicitly contained in [RT22, Lemma 4.25, Remark 4.26]. In fact, all fibers are Moishezon by Theorem 1.1 and according to the argument in Corollary 4.5 below or [RT21, RT22], it is not difficult to find a (global) line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ on $\\mathcal{X}$ such that its restriction to any general fiber $X_{t_{0}}$ is very ample and $h^{0}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{L}\\left.\\right|_{X_{t}}\\right)$ is constant for any $t \\in \\Delta$ sufficiently close to $t_{0}$. Then by (the proof of) [RT22, Theorem 1.8], the global line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ induces a bimeromorphic map $\\Phi$ from $\\mathcal{X}$ to a subvariety $\\mathcal{W}$ of $\\mathbb{P}^{m} \\times \\Delta$ over $\\Delta$ for some positive integer $m$, which implies that $\\Phi$ is biholomorphic on $\\mathcal{X} \\backslash \\mathcal{S}$ for some proper subvariety $\\mathcal{S}$ of $\\mathcal{X}$. So $R:=\\pi(\\mathcal{S})$ is a proper analytic subset of $\\Delta$ since the restriction $\\Phi_{t_{0}}: X_{t_{0}} \\rightarrow W_{t_{0}}$ to the fiber of $\\mathcal{W}$ over $t_{0}$ is biholomorphic. So $\\Phi$ is biholomorphic at least on $\\mathcal{X} \\backslash \\mathcal{S}$ by the definition of $\\mathcal{S}$, and thus, $\\mathcal{W}$ is smooth outside $\\pi_{\\mathcal{W}}^{-1}(R)$ for $\\pi_{\\mathcal{W}}: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ since $\\mathcal{X}$ is smooth. Conversely, $\\mathcal{W}$ is bimeromorphic to $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\pi_{\\mathcal{W}}: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ is a projective morphism. By Remmert's elimination of indeterminacy [Re57] and Hironaka's Chow lemma [Hi75, Corollaries 1 and 2], one modifies $\\mathcal{W}$ as a complex manifold $\\mathcal{Y}$ such that the composition $\\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}$ over $\\Delta$ is a bimeromorphic morphism with $\\mathcal{Y} \\backslash \\pi_{\\mathcal{Y}}^{-1}(R) \\cong \\mathcal{W} \\backslash \\pi_{\\mathcal{W}}^{-1}(R)$ as $\\mathcal{W} \\backslash \\pi_{\\mathcal{W}}^{-1}(R) \\cong \\mathcal{X} \\backslash \\mathcal{S}$. Hence, $\\pi_{\\mathcal{Y}}: \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ is the desired projective morphism, and the morphism $\\pi$ is pseudo-projective.\nCorollary 4.5. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family. Define the projective locus of $\\pi$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(\\pi):=\\left\\{t \\in \\Delta: X_{t} \\text { is projective }\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen $\\mathcal{P}(\\pi)$ is either at most a union of countably many points or a Zariski dense open subset of $\\Delta$.\n\nIt seems not difficult to generalize Corollary 4.5 to a proper morphism of complex analytic spaces as in [Ko22b, Section 5], where a complete reference list on projective loci is given.\nProof. This follows directly from Corollary 4.4. For reader's convenience, we give a more elementary proof here, also to provide more details of proving Corollary 4.4. Assume that there are uncountably many projective fibers in $\\pi$.\nStep (I). Construct a global line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ over $\\mathcal{X}$ such that $\\left.\\mathcal{L}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}$ is ample for some $t_{0} \\in \\Delta$.\n\nBy the exponential sequence, one has the commutative diagram of exact sequences\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nfor any $t \\in \\Delta$. Applying the Leray spectral sequence to $\\pi$ for the sheaf $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}$, one obtains the exact sequence\n\n$$\nH^{1}\\left(\\Delta, R^{1} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right) \\longrightarrow H^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right) \\longrightarrow H^{0}\\left(\\Delta, R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right) \\longrightarrow 0\n$$\n\nSince $\\Delta$ is a holomorphic domain, the cohomology $H^{1}\\left(\\Delta, R^{1} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right)$ vanishes and thus\n\n$$\nH^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right) \\cong H^{0}\\left(\\Delta, R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet $c:=c_{1}(A)$ be the first Chern class of an ample line bundle $A$ on some fiber $X_{t}$, and denote by $c \\in H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$ the element in $H^{2}(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathbb{Z})$. The composed morphism\n\n$$\nH^{2}(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\subset H^{2}(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathbb{C}) \\rightarrow H^{0}\\left(\\Delta, R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right)\n$$\n\ninduces a section $s_{c} \\in H^{0}\\left(\\Delta, R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right)$. Since any fiber $X_{t}$ is Moishezon for $t \\in \\Delta$, the $(0,2)$-type Hodge number $h^{0,2}\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ is constant on $\\Delta$. So $R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}$ is locally free over $\\Delta$ by Grauert's continuity theorem and the map\n\n$$\nR^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}(t):=\\left(R^{2} \\pi_{*} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathfrak{X}}\\right)_{t} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}(t) \\rightarrow H^{2}\\left(X_{t}, \\mathcal{O}_{X_{t}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis bijective for each $t \\in \\Delta$ by Grauert's base change theorem. Thus, the zero locus $Z_{c}$ of $s_{c}$ is an analytic subset of $\\Delta$. Since there is an uncountable subset $T \\subseteq \\Delta$ such that all the fibers $X_{t}$ for $t \\in T$ are projective, one has\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{c} Z_{c} \\supseteq T\n$$\n\nwhere the union takes over all integral classes $c_{1}\\left(L_{t}\\right) \\in H^{2}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of an ample line bundle $L_{t}$ on any fiber $X_{t}(t \\in T)$. Here $X$ is the underlying differentiable manifold of the family's fibers. Since a countable union of proper analytic subsets is still countable, there is an analytic $Z_{c}=\\Delta$, and thus there exists a global line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ over $\\mathcal{X}$ such that $\\left.\\mathcal{L}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}$ is an ample line bundle for some $t_{0} \\in \\Delta$ by the Nakai-Moishezon criterion of ampleness.\nStep (II). Apply the Zariski openness of the ampleness of a line bundle over the total space due to Grothendieck [Gr61, TH\u00c9OR\u00c8ME 2.1] to conclude the proof.\n\nFor reader's convenience, we give a proof here. Let $m$ be a sufficiently large integer such that $\\left.\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}$ is very ample and\n\n$$\nh^{i}\\left(X_{t_{0}},\\left.\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nfor $i>0$. Here $\\mathcal{L}$ is the global line bundle over $\\mathcal{X}$ constructed in Step (I). Set\n\n$$\nA_{i}=\\left\\{t \\in \\Delta: h^{i}\\left(X_{t},\\left.\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{t}}\\right) \\geq 1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nBy Grauert's upper semi-continuity theorem, we know that $A_{i}$ is a proper analytic subset of $\\Delta$ for each $i \\geq 1$. Then\n\n$$\nU^{\\prime}:=\\Delta \\backslash \\bigcup_{i \\geq 1} A_{i}\n$$\n\nis a Zariski open set in $\\Delta$ which contains $t_{0}$. By Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension $h^{0}\\left(X_{s},\\left.\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{s}}\\right)$ is invariant for $s \\in U^{\\prime}$. The sheaf $\\mathcal{F}$ is locally free on a neighborhood of $t_{0}$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\left(t_{0}\\right) \\cong H^{0}\\left(X_{t_{0}},\\left.\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom the local freeness of $\\mathcal{F}$, we have the exact sequence\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F} \\otimes \\mathcal{J}_{t_{0}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F} \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_{t_{0}} \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{I}_{t_{0}}$ is the ideal sheaf over $t_{0}$. Thus, the morphism $H^{0}(\\Delta, \\mathcal{F}) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ is surjective, since $\\Delta$ is a holomorphic domain.\n\nSet $N=\\operatorname{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{0}\\left(X_{t_{0}}, \\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m} \\mid X_{t_{0}}\\right)$. Suppose that $\\sigma_{1}, \\cdots, \\sigma_{N} \\in H^{0}\\left(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right) \\cong H^{0}(\\Delta, \\mathcal{F})$ are global sections such that $\\left\\{\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}$ generate $\\mathcal{F}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$, i.e., the vector space $H^{0}\\left(X_{t_{0}}, \\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m} \\mid X_{t_{0}}\\right)$ is spanned by the sections $\\left.\\sigma_{i}\\right|_{X_{t_{0}}}$. Let\n\n$$\n\\phi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\widetilde{\\mathbb{P}}:=\\mathbb{P}^{N} \\times \\Delta\n$$\n\nbe the meromorphic map induced by $\\left\\{\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}$. The restriction $\\phi_{s}: X_{s} \\rightarrow \\widetilde{\\mathbb{P}}_{s}$ is defined by the complete linear system $\\left|\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m}\\right|_{X_{s}} \\mid$ for each $s \\in U^{\\prime}$. Thus, $\\phi_{t_{0}}$ is an embedding.\n\nDenote by $Z_{1}$ the common zeros of $\\left\\{\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}$ and let $Z_{2}$ be the zero loci of\n\n$$\n\\left\\{d\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{j_{k}}}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{j_{n}}}{\\sigma_{i}}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $1 \\leq i, j_{k} \\leq N, j_{k} \\neq i$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. These are two analytic subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$ and let $Z=Z_{1} \\cup Z_{2}$. Since $\\pi$ is proper, the image $\\pi(Z)$ is an analytic subset of $\\Delta$. But $t_{0} \\notin \\pi(Z)$, and $\\pi(Z)$ is thus a discrete set of points in $\\Delta$. Let $U:=\\Delta \\backslash \\pi(Z)$. Then $\\phi_{s}$ is a holomorphic morphism and locally embedding for any $s \\in U$. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}^{\\otimes m} \\mid X_{s} \\cong \\phi_{s}^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{O}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbb{P}}_{s}}(1)\\right)$ are ample for all $s \\in U$.\n4.3. Barlet's theory of relative codimension 1 cycle-space. As the final (and direct) application of Theorem 1.1, one has:\n\nCorollary 4.6. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\Delta$ be a smooth family with uncountably many Moishezon fibers. Then the restriction of\n\n$$\n\\mu: \\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta) \\rightarrow \\Delta\n$$\n\nto each irreducible component of $\\mathcal{C}_{n-1}(\\mathcal{X} / \\Delta)$ is proper over $\\Delta$.\nProof.
