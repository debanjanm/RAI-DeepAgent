In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional L\u00e9vy process-based renewal risk model with heterogeneous insurance claims, where every dimension indicates a business line of an insurer. We use the systemic expected shortfall (SES) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) defined with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) target level as the measurement of systemic risks. Assuming that all the claim sizes are pairwise asymptotically independent (PAI), we derive asymptotic formulas for the tail probabilities of discounted aggregate claims and total loss, which holds uniformly for all time horizons. We further obtain the asymptotics of the above systemic risk measures. The main technical issues involve the treatment of uniform convergence in the dynamic time setting. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo numerical study and verify that our asymptotics are accurate and convenient in computation.\n\n\nKeywords: Systemic expected shortfall (SES), Marginal expected shortfall (MES), Asymptotics, Dependence, Uniform convergence", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nSystemic risk is becoming increasingly crucial in the insurance industry, which is now deeply interconnected with banking, securities, real estate, and the Internet, among other sectors. Large insurance companies often operate across multiple business lines associated with these industries. A simultaneous occurrence of significant incidents across one or more lines can trigger systemic risk. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, American International Group (AIG) was rapidly impacted by failures in both the real estate and financial markets.\n\nMoreover, heterogeneous claims within a single business line can further enlarge systemic risks. For example, in a business line of traffic accident insurance, a car accident may lead\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *School of Big Data and Statistics, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, 230601, China.

Additionally, the increasing complexity of financial products and services, along with advancements in FinTech and InsurTech, presents serious challenges for identifying and managing these risks for both insurance practitioners and institutional regulators. Therefore, effective systemic risk management in the insurance industry requires more refined models and sophisticated approaches.\n\nIn the recent literature, several risk measures have been introduced quantifying the interaction of an individual loss to the counterparts' and the system's losses or the exogenous effects. These include capital shortfall in Acharya et al. (2012), CoVaR in Tobias and Brunnermeier (2016), scenario-based risk measures in Wang and Ziegel (2021), generalized risk measures in Fadina et al. (2024), and VaR-based and expectile-based systemic risk measures in Geng et al. (2024). Among them, systemic expected shortfall (SES) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) as systemic risk measures are introduced to measure an economic agent's risk when the whole system is undercapitalized (see Acharya et al. (2017) and Chen and Liu (2022)). The feature of SES and MES is that the risk faced by one agent is quantified by the expectation of the exceeding loss variable of an individual target level, conditional on the catastrophic event that the system loss exceeds a total target level. They are defined in various ways in the literature because different target levels are adopted. In this paper, we use the definitions in Asimit et al. (2011) and Jaun\u00e9 and \u0160iaulys (2022), where the individual and total target levels are both Value-at-Risk (VaR). Formally, for $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, let $Z_{k}$ be the individual risk of the $k$-th economic agent, and let $S:=\\sum_{i=1}^{d} Z_{i}$ be the aggregate risk. We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}(S):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(Z_{k}-\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}\\left(Z_{k}\\right)\\right)^{+} \\mid S>\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}(S)\\right] \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}(S):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_{k} \\mid S>\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}(S)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}(X):=F_{X}^{\\leftarrow}(q)=\\inf \\left\\{y \\in \\mathbf{R}: F_{X}(y) \\geq q\\right\\}, 0<q<1\n$$\n\nis the quantile function of a random variable $X$ with distribution $F_{X}$. Hence, the target levels (i.e., $\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}\\left(Z_{k}\\right)$ and $\\left.\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}(S)\\right)$ are nonlinear functions of the probability level $q$, different from many articles (e.g. Li (2022)).\n\nIn this paper, we specify the individual and aggregate risks by a $d$-dimensional L\u00e9vy process-based renewal model with heterogeneous claims. Suppose for $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, non-negative random variables $X_{k i}, i=1,2, \\cdots$ and $Y_{k j}, j=1,2, \\cdots$ denote two heterogeneous claim sizes of the $k$ th business line respectively, while their corresponding arrival times, $0 \\leq \\tau_{k 1} \\leq \\tau_{k 2} \\leq \\cdots$ and $0 \\leq \\eta_{k 1} \\leq \\eta_{k 2} \\leq \\cdots$, constitute several renewal processes denoted by $N_{t}^{k}$ and $M_{t}^{k}(t \\geq 0)$, namely, $N_{t}^{k}=\\sup \\left\\{m \\in \\mathbf{N} \\cup\\{0\\}: \\tau_{k m} \\leq t\\right\\}, M_{t}^{k}=\\sup \\left\\{n \\in \\mathbf{N} \\cup\\{0\\}: \\eta_{k n} \\leq t\\right\\}$. Assume $\\tau_{k 0}=\\eta_{k 0}=0$ for convenience in notation. The insurer's stochastic discount factor process is expressed as a geometric L\u00e9vy process $e^{-R_{t}}(t \\geq 0)$, where $R_{t}$ is a L\u00e9vy process. For the dependence structure, assume all the claim sizes, $X_{k i}, i=1,2, \\cdots, Y_{l j}, j=1,2, \\cdots, 1 \\leq$ $l, k \\leq d$ are pairwise asymptotically independent (abbreviated as PAI; defined in Section 2). Meanwhile, suppose $\\left\\{X_{k i}, Y_{l j}, 1 \\leq l, k \\leq d, i, j=1,2, \\cdots\\right\\}, N_{t}^{k}, M_{t}^{k}, 1 \\leq k \\leq d$, and $e^{-R_{t}}$ are all mutually independent. Then, the stochastic present value of aggregate claims is described\n\nas:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{t} & :=\\sum_{k=1}^{d}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}^{k}} X_{k i} e^{-R_{\\tau_{k i}}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{M_{t}^{k}} Y_{k j} e^{-R_{\\eta_{k j}}}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{k=1}^{d}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} X_{k i} e^{-R_{\\tau_{k i}}} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{k i} \\leq t\\right\\}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} Y_{k j} e^{-R_{\\eta_{k j}}} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\eta_{k j} \\leq t\\right\\}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, if we use constants $c_{k} \\geq 0$ to denote the premium rate of the $k$-th business line, the stochastic present value of the $k$-th business line's loss and that of the total loss are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nZ_{t}^{k}:=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}^{k}} X_{k i} e^{-R_{\\tau_{k i}}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{M_{t}^{k}} Y_{k j} e^{-R_{\\eta_{k j}}}-c_{k} \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-R_{s}} \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\nD_{t}:=\\sum_{k=1}^{d} Z_{t}^{k}=S_{t}-\\sum_{k=1}^{d} c_{k} \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-R_{s}} \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThen, as we mentioned above, SES and MES can be employed to assess the individual risk (particularly, the insurer's loss in a particular business line) within the framework of a systemic crisis. More precisely, we study the systemic risk of each business line via\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathrm{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(Z_{t}^{k}-\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}\\left(Z_{t}^{k}\\right)\\right)^{+} \\mid D_{t}>\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}\\left(D_{t}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_{t}^{k} \\mid D_{t}>\\operatorname{VaR}_{q}\\left(D_{t}\\right)\\right], \\quad 1 \\leq k \\leq d, 0<q<1, t \\geq 0\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nActually, the renewal claim model has been well studied in different aspects. For example, Tang (2007) obtains the explicit asymptotic expression of the tail probability of discounted aggregate claims for a one-dimensional case, or more precisely, when the company has only one business line. Then Tang et al. (2010) extend this result to a L\u00e9vy process-based case. Li (2012) considers a time-dependent one-dimensional case. Li (2022) considers a multidimensional case. As for the case that one business line contains two different kinds of claims, there are also many explorations. To the best of our knowledge, it is first taken into account by Yuen et al. (2005). Then in several works, such as Li (2013) and Yang and Li (2019), the one-dimensional case has been discussed and they call this case \"by-claim\" or \"delayed claim\". Also note that most of the above literature focuses on the ruin probabilities of their renewal models, while Li (2022) goes further to quantify a corresponding systemic risk measure.\n\nThis paper considers a more general multi-dimensional L\u00e9vy process-based renewal model with heterogeneous claims. Then, we quantify the systemic risk of each business line with the assistance of two risk measures $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$. The main contributions of this paper are as follows.\n(a) We develop a multi-dimensional renewal insurance model to accommodate a more general setting involving two heterogeneous claims per business line. We provide an asymptotic\n\nexpression of the ruin probability of the discounted aggregate claims. In our model, the setting of heterogeneous claims is different from \"by-claim\" or \"delayed claim\" structures studied in Li (2013) and Yang and Li (2019), because the latter structures require a chronological order between claims. In fact, following similar proof steps, our model with two heterogeneous claims can be extended to include three or more claims per business line. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic expressions of systemic risk in the renewal insurance model. While Li (2022) applies a systemic risk measure with linear target levels to assess the renewal model, our approach follows the spirit of the risk measures proposed by Acharya et al. (2017), incorporating value-at-risk (VaR) target levels into SES and MES to more accurately evaluate the risk.\n(b) We provide a technical extension on the issue of uniform convergence in the asymptotic analysis of systemic risk. Unlike static models focusing on random variables with pre-assumed dependence structures (see, e.g., Chen and Liu (2022)), this paper incorporates dynamic settings into the systemic risk measures. This requires further consideration on the uniformity of asymptotic properties over the whole time scale, which will be discussed in Section 4 in detail.\n\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides some preliminaries on notations and basic notions of regularly varying distributions, L\u00e9vy processes, and asymptotic independence. Section 3 derives our main results. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of the main results. Section 5 conducts numerical studies to validate the accuracy of our results.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Preliminaries \n\nThroughout this paper, all limiting formulas either contain $x$ or contain $q$, and these two cases are mutually exclusive. In the followings, all limit relationships refer to $x \\uparrow \\infty$ if the formulas contain $x$, and refer to $q \\uparrow 1$ if the formulas contain $q$, unless stated otherwise. For two positive functions $f(\\cdot)$ and $g(\\cdot)$, write $f(x)=O(g(x))$ if $\\lim \\sup f(x) / g(x)<\\infty$; write $f(x)=o(g(x))$ if $\\lim f(x) / g(x)=0$; write $f(x) \\lesssim g(x)$ if $\\lim \\sup f(x) / g(x) \\leq 1$; write $f(x) \\gtrsim g(x)$ if $\\lim \\inf f(x) / g(x) \\geq 1$; write $f(x) \\sim g(x)$ if $\\lim f(x) / g(x)=1$; we say $f$ and $g$ are weakly equivalent, denoted by $f(x) \\asymp g(x)$, if both $f(x)=O(g(x))$ and $g(x)=O(f(x))$. Furthermore, for two positive bivariate functions $f(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $g(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, we say that the asymptotic relation $f(x, t) \\sim g(x, t)$ holds uniformly over all $t$ in a nonempty set $\\Delta$ if\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{t \\in \\Delta}\\left|\\frac{f(x, t)}{g(x, t)}-1\\right|=0\n$$\n\nAlso, we define $f(x, t) \\lesssim g(x, t)$ uniformly for all $t \\in \\Delta$ as\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{t \\in \\Delta} \\frac{f(x, t)}{g(x, t)} \\leq 1\n$$\n\nIt is easy to see that $f(x, t) \\sim g(x, t)$ uniformly for all $t \\in \\Delta$ when $f(x, t) \\lesssim g(x, t)$ and $g(x, t) \\lesssim f(x, t)$ both hold uniformly for $t \\in \\Delta$. As usual, for a random variable $X$, write $X^{+}=\\max \\{X, 0\\}$. The indicator function of an event $A$ is denoted by $\\mathbb{1}_{A}$. For any distribution function $F$, denote its tail by $\\bar{F}(x)=1-F(x)$. For two real numbers $a$ and $b$, write $a \\vee b=$ $\\max \\{a, b\\}$, and $a \\wedge b=\\min \\{a, b\\}$.\n\nIn this paper, a specific class of distributions is concerned. We say a distribution function $F$ has a regular-varying tail, if there is a fixed constant $0<\\alpha<\\infty$ such that for any $y>0$,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\bar{F}(y x)}{\\bar{F}(x)}=y^{-\\alpha}\n$$\n\nwhich is further denoted by $\\bar{F} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{V}_{-\\alpha}$. By Theorem 1.5.6 of Bingham et al. (1989), if $\\bar{F} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{V}_{-\\alpha}$, then for any $\\varepsilon>0$, for any $b>1$, there is some $x_{0}>0$ such that Potter's bounds\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{b}\\left(\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^{-\\alpha-\\varepsilon} \\wedge\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^{-\\alpha+\\varepsilon}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\bar{F}(y)}{\\bar{F}(x)} \\leq b\\left(\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^{-\\alpha-\\varepsilon} \\vee\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^{-\\alpha+\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\nhold for any $x, y \\geq x_{0}$. This implies for any $\\beta>\\alpha$,\n\n$$\nx^{-\\beta}=o(\\bar{F}(x))\n$$\n\nIn this paper, the L\u00e9vy process $R_{t}$ is assumed to be right-continuous with a left limit and suppose $\\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{1}\\right]>0$. Then $\\mathbb{E}\\left[R_{t}\\right]$ tends to $\\infty$ as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. The Laplace exponent is defined by\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\alpha):=\\log \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\alpha R_{1}}\\right]\n$$\n\nfor $\\alpha \\in \\mathbf{R}$. If $\\phi(\\alpha)$ is finite, then $\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\alpha R_{t}}\\right]=e^{t \\phi(\\alpha)}<\\infty$; see Tang et al.

According to Proposition 2.1 of Li (2022), if further $\\bar{F}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{V}_{-\\alpha}, i=1,2$, and $\\bar{F}_{1}(x) \\asymp \\overline{F_{2}}(x)$, asymptotic independence (AI) of $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z_{1}>x, Z_{2}>x\\right)}{\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z_{1}>x\\right)}=0\n$$\n\nNote that asymptotic independence is one of practical dependence structures. For instance, two independent random variables are naturally asymptotically independent, and it can be depicted by certain copulas such as Gauss copula; see McNeil et al. (2015). Some useful general asymptotic properties are discussed in papers like Chen and Yuen (2009). Further, a series of random variables $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, \\cdots$ are said to be pairwise asymptotically independent (PAI) if each two of them are asymptotically independent.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Main results \n\nWe formally present our first result. We give the asymptotic expressions of the ruin probabilities of the stochastic present value of the aggregate claims $S_{t}$ and that of the total loss $D_{t}$ under the proposed model above.\n\nTheorem 3.1 Consider the d-dimensional renewal model with heterogeneous claims introduced in Section 1. Further assume for $1 \\leq l, k \\leq d, X_{k 1}, X_{k 2}, \\cdots$ are commonly distributed by $F_{k}$, while $Y_{l 1}, Y_{l 2}, \\cdots$ are commonly distributed by $G_{l}$, and $\\overline{F_{k}}, \\overline{G_{l}} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{V}_{-\\alpha}$ for some $0<\\alpha<\\infty$. Also assume that $X_{k 1}, Y_{k 1}, X_{k 2}, Y_{k 2} \\cdots$ are mutually weakly equivalent, namely, for any $1 \\leq p \\leq q \\leq d, \\overline{F_{p}}(x) \\asymp \\overline{F_{q}}(x), \\overline{G_{p}}(x) \\asymp \\overline{G_{q}}(x), \\overline{F_{p}}(x) \\asymp \\overline{G_{q}}(x)$. For the Laplace exponent of the L\u00e9vy process $R_{t}$, suppose there is some $\\alpha^{*}>\\alpha$ such that $\\phi\\left(\\alpha^{*}\\right)<0$.

Indeed, by H\u00f6lder's inequality, for any $0<v<1$, for any $\\alpha, \\beta$ such that $\\phi(\\alpha)$ and $\\phi(\\beta)$ are finite, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi(v \\alpha+(1-v) \\beta) & =\\log \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-(v \\alpha+(1-v) \\beta) R_{t}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\log \\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\alpha R_{t}}\\right]\\right)^{v}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\beta R_{t}}\\right]\\right)^{1-v} \\\\\n& =v \\log \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\alpha R_{t}}\\right]+(1-v) \\log \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\beta R_{t}}\\right] \\\\\n& =v \\phi(\\alpha)+(1-v) \\phi(\\beta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, since $\\phi(0)=0, \\phi\\left(\\alpha^{*}\\right)<0$, we have for any $p \\in\\left(0, \\alpha^{*}\\right], \\phi(p)<0$, and thus $\\phi(\\alpha)<0$ as well.\n\nNote that the \" 0 -\" in the integral sign means approaching 0 from the left of 0 . It is set to avoid that the right-hand side of the asymptotic relation in (3.5) equals to 0 when $t=0$ (if $0 \\in \\Lambda$ ). Also note that for any $t \\in \\Lambda$, for all $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, we have\n\n$$\n0<\\int_{0-}^{t} e^{s \\phi(\\alpha)} \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\tau_{k i} \\in \\mathrm{~d} s\\right)<\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\tau_{k i} \\leq t\\right) \\leq 1\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0<\\int_{0-}^{t} e^{s \\phi(\\alpha)} \\mathrm{d} \\lambda_{s}^{k} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\tau_{k i} \\phi(\\alpha)}\\right] & =\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\sum_{p=1}^{i}\\left(\\tau_{k p}-\\tau_{k(p-1)}\\right) \\phi(\\alpha)}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\tau_{k 1} \\phi(\\alpha)}\\right]\\right)^{i}=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\tau_{k 1} \\phi(\\alpha)}\\right]}{1-\\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{\\tau_{k 1} \\phi(\\alpha)}\\right]}<\\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAlso, $0<\\int_{0-}^{t} e^{s \\phi(\\alpha)} \\mathrm{d} \\xi_{s}^{k}<\\infty$ for all $1 \\leq k \\leq d$. These conclusions will be very useful in the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n\nFrom the right-hand side of the asymptotic expression (3.6), we can see the ingredients that involve $t$ and those that involve claim sizes $\\left(\\overline{F_{k}}(x), \\overline{G_{k}}(x)\\right)$ are separated, and the latter ones indicate the decay rates, while the former ones act as the \"weight\" of each corresponding claim.\n\nNow, we formally present our second main result. We give the asymptotic expressions of the systemic risk of each business line under the proposed model. They are quantified by $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$.\n\nTheorem 3.2 Under the setting in Theorem 3.1, suppose further there is a distribution function $F$ such that for all $1 \\leq k \\leq d, \\overline{F_{k}}(x) \\sim a_{k} \\bar{F}(x), \\overline{G_{k}}(x) \\sim b_{k} \\bar{F}(x)$ for some $a_{k}, b_{k}>0$. Further, we require $\\alpha>1$. Then for any fixed $T \\in \\Lambda$, as $q \\uparrow 1$, it holds uniformly for all\n\n$t \\in \\Lambda^{T}$ that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right) \\sim \\frac{l_{k}(t)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)}\\left(\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}-\\left(l_{k}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}+\\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}}{\\alpha-1}\\right) F^{\\leftarrow}(q) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right) \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} \\frac{l_{k}(t)}{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{1-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}} F^{\\leftarrow}(q)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $l_{k}(t):=a_{k} \\int_{0-}^{t} e^{s \\phi(\\alpha)} \\mathrm{d} \\lambda_{s}^{k}+b_{k} \\int_{0-}^{t} e^{s \\phi(\\alpha)} \\mathrm{d} \\xi_{s}^{k}, 1 \\leq k \\leq d$.\nFrom the right-hand side of (3.7) and (3.8), it is easy to see that the quantile function of $F$ is the main asymptotic term of $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$, while other information such as, each business line's asymptotic claim-size ratios to $F$ (i.e. $a_{k}, b_{k}$ ), the financial uncertainty, and claim frequency, only contribute to the coefficients of the formulas. To further explore properties of these coefficients, fix some $t \\in \\Lambda^{T}$ and assume $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)$ is fixed. For a certain $1 \\leq k \\leq d$, define $\\rho_{k}:=\\frac{l_{k}(t)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)}$. In other words, $0<\\rho_{k}<1$ indicates the proportion of the combined information of the $k$-th business line's claim-size ratios, financial uncertainty and claim frequency in that combined information of the entire entity. Further, define $h_{\\mathrm{SES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right):=$ $\\rho_{k}\\left(1-\\rho_{k}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}+\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\right), h_{\\mathrm{MES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right):=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} \\rho_{k}$. Then (3.7) and (3.8) can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right) \\sim \\rho_{k}\\left(1-\\rho_{k}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}+\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} F^{\\leftarrow}(q)=h_{\\mathrm{SES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right) \\times\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} F^{\\leftarrow}(q) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right) \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} \\rho_{k}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} F^{\\leftarrow}(q)=h_{\\mathrm{MES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right) \\times\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d} l_{i}(t)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} F^{\\leftarrow}(q)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} h_{\\mathrm{SES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}=-\\frac{\\alpha+1}{\\alpha} \\rho_{k}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1}, \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{~d} h_{\\mathrm{MES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1}\n$$\n\nObviously, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} h_{\\text {MES }}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}>0$ for all $0<\\rho_{k}<1 ; \\frac{\\mathrm{d} h_{\\text {SES }}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}$ is decreasing in $\\rho_{k}$, and $\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d} h_{\\text {SES }}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}\\right|_{\\rho_{k}=0}=$ $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1}>\\left.0, \\frac{\\mathrm{~d} h_{\\mathrm{SES}}\\left(\\rho_{k}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d} \\rho_{k}}\\right|_{\\rho_{k}=1}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}>0$.

This conclusion aligns with anticipations: as the $k$-th business line's proportion of claim-size ratios, financial uncertainty, and claim frequency within the entire entity increases, the asymptotic expressions for $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ also increase, indicating a corresponding rise in the expected systemic risk for that business line.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 Proof of main results \n\nBefore the proofs are stated, some remarks are worth noting. If the asymptotic relations are considered only at each time point, which transfers the corresponding stochastic processes into certain random variables, the proof will be much easier. Actually, the one-dimensional case of (3.5) at a fixed time point is just a simple corollary of Theorem 3.3 in Chen and Yuen (2009). The key difficulty is how to deal with uniform convergence. To address this issue, we split the complicated probabilities or expectations into simple components, and deal with each component individually. For each component, we isolate the ingredients that involve $t$ and demonstrate that the remaining parts of the variables converge independently of $t$. In the proof of Theorem 3.2, we employ a useful proposition (Proposition 0.5 of Resnick (2008)), which demonstrates that, a regularly varying function can automatically hold the regularvarying property uniformly on some intervals. This property, together with the classic \" $\\varepsilon-\\delta$ \" definition of convergence which transfers asymptotic relations into inequalities, allows us to address uniform asymptotic relations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "### 4.1 On Theorem 3.1\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 3.1, we mainly refer to the methods of proving Theorem 3.1 in Tang et al.

We mainly refer to the methods used by Yang et al. (2015) and Chen and Liu (2022). We apply the Monte Carlo method to simulate the probabilities or expectations in the left-hand sides of the asymptotic formulas stated in our two main theorems, and directly calculate the values of the right parts of these equations. Then, we do a comparison between them.\n\nFirst, we set $t=1$. We generate $N=5 \\times 10^{5}$ random variables with a common distribution $D_{t}$ (as defined in Section 1), and count the numbers $l$ of these variables whose values exceed a certain value $x>0$, and then $\\mathbb{P}\\left(D_{t}>x\\right)$ can be approximated by $l / N$. To specify the setting of $D_{t}$, we assume the insurer has two business lines and their corresponding claim sizes $X_{1 i}, Y_{1 j}, X_{2 i}, Y_{2 j}, i, j=1,2, \\cdots$ follow respectively Pareto distributions with a common parameter $\\alpha>1$ and four different parameters $\\gamma_{p}, p=1,2,3,4$ :\n\n$$\nF_{p}(x)=1-\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{p}}{\\gamma_{p}+x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, x \\geq 0\n$$\n\nClearly, $\\overline{F_{p}} \\in \\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{V}_{-\\alpha}, p=1,2,3,4$, and $\\overline{F_{p}}(x) \\sim\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{p}}{\\gamma_{q}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\overline{F_{q}}(x), 1 \\leq p \\leq q \\leq 4$. In the meantime, we simplify our model by reducing the L\u00e9vy process $R_{t}, t \\geq 0$ to a linear process $\\delta t$, where $\\delta>0$ is a positive constant. Also, let all the four renewal processes $N_{t}^{p}, p=1,2,3,4$ be a homogeneous Poisson process with corresponding intensity parameters $\\lambda_{p}, p=1,2,3,4$. Especially, generate four Poisson random variables $n_{p}, p=1,2,3,4$ with $\\lambda_{p}, p=1,2,3,4$ and let $d=n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}+n_{4}$. Then the corresponding arrival times are determined by generating $n_{p}$ uniform random variables on $[0, \\lambda]$ respectively for $p=1,2,3,4$. The dependence structure of claim sizes $X_{1 i}, Y_{1 j}, X_{2 i}, Y_{2 j}, i, j=1,2, \\cdots$ is characterized by a Frank Copula\n\n$$\nC(u)=-\\frac{1}{\\Theta} \\ln \\left(1-\\left(1-e^{-\\Theta}\\right)^{d+1} \\prod_{i=1}^{d}\\left(1-e^{-\\Theta u_{i}}\\right)\\right), u_{i} \\in[0,1] \\text { for } i=1, \\cdots, d\n$$\n\nand then these claim sizes are guaranteed to be PAI. Then, to give an appropriate estimate of $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right), k=1,2$, we let $Z_{t}^{k i}, k=1,2, i=1, \\cdots, N$ and $D_{t}^{i}, i=1, \\cdots, N$ denote the $N$ experimental results of the stochastic present values of two business lines' losses and the total loss, respectively. Let $Z_{t}^{k(1)} \\leq Z_{t}^{k(2)} \\leq \\cdots \\leq Z_{t}^{k(N)}, k=1,2$ and $D_{t}^{(1)} \\leq D_{t}^{(2)} \\leq$ $\\cdots \\leq D_{t}^{(N)}$ be the corresponding order statistics. Then the empirical estimates of $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right), k=1,2$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\widehat{\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(Z_{t}^{k i}-Z_{t}^{k(\\lfloor N q\\rfloor)}\\right)^{+} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{D_{t}^{i}>D_{t}^{\\left(\\lfloor N q\\rfloor\\right)}\\right\\}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{D_{t}^{i}>D_{t}^{\\left(\\left\\lfloor N q_{i}\\right\\rfloor\\right)}\\right\\}}}, \\\\\n& \\widehat{\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Z_{t}^{k i} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{D_{t}^{i}>D_{t}^{\\left(\\left\\lfloor N q_{i}\\right\\rfloor\\right)}\\right.}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{D_{t}^{i}>D_{t}^{\\left(\\left\\lfloor N q_{i}\\right\\rfloor\\right)}\\right\\}} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn our experiment, we take $\\alpha=1.2, \\delta=0.4,\\left(\\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2}, \\gamma_{3}, \\gamma_{4}\\right)=(2,4,3,4),\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\lambda_{3}, \\lambda_{4}\\right)=$ $(0.4,0.7,0.5,0.7)$, and the premium rates of the two business lines $c_{1}, c_{2}$ are both set 5 . For the simulation of Theorem 3.1, we take $x=50,5 \\times 10^{2}, 5 \\times 10^{3}, 5 \\times 10^{4}$ to illustrate the trend $x \\uparrow \\infty$; for the simulation of Theorem 3.2, we take several $q$ equidistantly from 0.9900 to 0.9990 to illustrate the trend $q \\uparrow 1$. The empirical and theoretical values of $\\mathbb{P}\\left(D_{t}>x\\right)$ are listed in Table 1; those of $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ are listed in Figure 1.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: The empirical and theoretical values of $\\mathbb{P}\\left(D_{t}>x\\right)$ w.r.t. $x$\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: the empirical and theoretical values of $\\operatorname{SES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{MES}_{q, k}\\left(D_{t}\\right)$ w.r.t. $q$\n\nIt is easy to see from the data that as $x$ approaches $\\infty$ and $q$ approaches 1 , the ratios of the empirical values to the theoretical values calculated from the formulas in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 approach 1 , indicating high accuracy of the main results.\n\nAcknowledgements.

In this\npaper, we propose a multi-dimensional L/'{e}vy process-based renewal risk model\nwith heterogeneous insurance claims, where every dimension indicates a business\nline of an insurer. We use the systemic expected shortfall (SES) and marginal\nexpected shortfall (MES) defined with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) target level as the\nmeasurement of systemic risks. Assuming that all the claim sizes are pairwise\nasymptotically independent (PAI), we derive asymptotic formulas for the tail\nprobabilities of discounted aggregate claims and total loss, which holds\nuniformly for all time horizons. We further obtain the asymptotics of the above\nsystemic risk measures. The main technical issues involve the treatment of\nuniform convergence in the dynamic time setting. Finally, we conduct a Monte\nCarlo numerical study and verify that our asymptotics are accurate and\nconvenient in computation.", "updated": "2024-09-30T19:04:25Z", "published": "2024-09-30T19:04:25Z"}
