Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow H^{+}$defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category Vec of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)-(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category sVec of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i). In the case where char $k=p>0$, there are shown weaker properties of ordinary Hopf algebras and of Hopf algebras in sVec or in the ind-completion $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$ of the Verlinde category.\n\n\nKey Words: Commutative Hopf algebra, Smooth, Equivariantly smooth, Locally complete intersection, Hochschild cohomology, Andr\u00e9-Quillen (co)homology\n\nMathematics Subject Classification (2010): 16T05, 14L15",

      "text": "## 1. Introduction: background and main theorems\n\nThis paper discusses smoothness of commutative Hopf algebras not necessarily of finite type, which include commutative Hopf-algebra objects in general categories with appropriate properties. We thus say \"of finite type\" for \"finitely generated\". We have three main theorems which are explicitly formulated in the following subsections.\n1.1. Smoothness of ordinary Hopf algebras. Let us work over an arbitrary field $k$, and vector spaces, linear maps and tensor products mean those over $k$. Algebras and Hopf algebras, which indicate those over $k$, are supposed to be commutative unless otherwise stated.\n\nAn algebra is said to be smooth (over $k$ ) [30, Section 9.3.1], if given an algebra $R$ and a nilpotent ideal $I$ of $R$, every algebra map $f: A \\rightarrow R / I$ can lift to some algebra map $g: A \\rightarrow R$, i.e., the $g$, composed with the natural projection $R \\rightarrow R / I$, turns into $f$. It is known that in the case where $A$ is Noetherian, the condition is equivalent to saying that $A$ is geometrically regular, i.e., it remains regular after base extension to the algebraic closure of $k$. The definition above is suited when we discuss, as we will do, smoothness of algebras not necessarily of finite type. As another advantage the definition, which concerns algebras in the symmetric monoidal category Vec of vector spaces, can directly extend to those in general categories with appropriate properties. For example, given a Hopf algebra $H$, we can (and we do) discuss smoothness of $H$-comodule algebras, i.e., algebras in the symmetric monoidal category of (right or left) $H$-comodules. We say that an $H$ comodule algebra $A$ is $H$-smooth (or equivariantly smooth, without referring to the\n\nHopf algebra) if given an $H$-comodule algebra and a nilpotent $H$-costable ideal $I$ of $R$, every $H$-colinear algebra map $A \\rightarrow R / I$ can lift to such a map $A \\rightarrow R$. Here and in what follows, comodules are meant to be right comodules unless otherwise stated. Our interest is in the case where $A$ is $H$, itself.\n\nLet $H$ be a Hopf algebra. Let $H^{+}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\varepsilon_{H}: H \\rightarrow k\\right)$ denote the augmentation ideal, and let $S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$denote the 2 nd symmetric power of the $H$-module $H^{+}$. Let us consider the conditions:\n(a) $H$ is smooth,\n(b) $H$ is $H$-smooth,\n(c) $H$ is $Q$-smooth for every quotient Hopf algebra $Q$ of $H$ such that $H$ is coflat as a $Q$-comodule, i.e., the co-tensor product $H \\square_{Q}$ (see (2.11)) is exact as a functor,\n(d) the $H$-linear map\n\n$$\n\\mu_{H}: S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow H^{+}\n$$\n\nwhich is induced by the product $H^{+} \\otimes_{H} H^{+} \\rightarrow H^{+}, a \\otimes_{H} b \\mapsto a b$ is injective,\n(e) $H$ is geometrically reduced, i.e., it remains reduced after the base extension to the algebraic closure of $k$,\nand in addition, in case char $k=p>0$,\n(f) the Frobenius map\n\n$$\nF_{H}: k^{1 / p} \\otimes H \\rightarrow H, \\quad F_{H}\\left(a^{1 / p} \\otimes h\\right)=a h^{p}\n$$\n\nis injective, where $k^{1 / p} \\otimes$ presents the base extension along the isomorphism $k \\rightarrow k^{1 / p}, a \\mapsto a^{1 / p}$ of fields.\n\nRemark 1.1. Recall that the Hopf algebras form a category anti-isomorphic to the category of affine group schemes. Let $\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$ be the affine group scheme corresponding to $H$.\n(1) Condition (a) is restated so that\n(a) Given an algebra $R$ and a nilpotent ideal $I$ of $R$, the group map\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{G}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{G}(R / I)\n$$\n\nassociated with the projection $R \\rightarrow R / I$ is surjective.\n(2) A right (resp., left) $H$-comodule algebra is identified with a left (resp., right) $\\mathfrak{G}$-equivariant algebra. A right $H$-comodule (or left $\\mathfrak{G}$-equivariant) algebra turns into a left (resp., right) one by twisting the coaction through the antipode of $H$ (resp., the action through the inverse of $\\mathfrak{G}$ ), and vise versa. Under the resulting one-to-one correspondence, $H$ corresponds to $H$, itself. Therefore, as for (b), $H$ is $H$-smooth as a right $H$-comodule algebra if and only if it is so as a left $H$-comodule algebra.\n(3) By a similar reason, as for (c), $H$ is coflat as a right $Q$-comodule if and only if it is so as a left $Q$-comodule. Recall that every closed subgroup scheme $\\mathfrak{S}$ of $\\mathfrak{G}$ is uniquely in the form $\\mathfrak{S}=\\operatorname{Spec} Q$, where $Q$ is a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$. It is known (see [25, p.452], [8, Theorem 2 and the following Remark]) that the equivalent coflatness conditions above are equivalent to saying that the quotient sheaf $\\mathfrak{G} / \\mathfrak{S}$ in the fpqc topology is an affine scheme; see also Remark 2.8 below.\n\nThe first main theorem is the following.\nTheorem 1.2. We have the following:\n\n(1) If char $k=0$, every Hopf algebra $H$ satisfies Conditions (a)-(e) above.\n(2) If char $k>0$, the Conditions (a)-(f) are equivalent to each other.\n\nSuppose char $k=0$. It is well known that every Hopf algebra satisfies (e), and in addition, (a) at least when it is of finite type; see Section 3.1.\n\nSuppose char $k=p>0$. Then there exist many Hopf algebras that do not satisfy the conditions; in particular, there are known simple examples of Hopf algebras which are reduced, but not geometrically reduced, see [27, Remark 39.8.5], for example. It is proved by Takeuchi [26, Proposition 1.9] that (f) $\\Rightarrow$ (a) $\\Rightarrow$ (d), and these conditions are equivalent to each other in case $H$ is of finite type. Likely, it has been long unknown whether they are equivalent in general. It is also proved by [26, Corollary 1.6] that every Hopf algebra that satisfies (f) has a certain stronger smoothness property; the result will be proved by Theorem 1.4 (2) below in a generalized situation, see Section 1.4.\n\nTheorem 1.2 will be proved in Section 3. It is after we prove the equivalence of Conditions (a)-(d) for Hopf algebras in a general category with appropriate properties; more details will be found in the following subsection.\n1.2. Smoothness of Hopf algebras in categories. Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be a symmetric monoidal category satisfying the assumptions:\n(I) $\\mathscr{C}$ is, as a category, semisimple abelian, i.e., abelian and every object is a coproduct of simple objects, and\n(II) the tensor-product functor is bi-additive, which is then necessarily exact by (I).\n\nThe category Vec of vector spaces is an obvious example of $\\mathscr{C}$. Conditions (a)(d) concerning Hopf algebras in Vec make sense more generally for those Hopf algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$ which are commutative by assumption; this will be verified in detail in the paragraph following Proposition 2.7. The second main theorem is the following.\n\nTheorem 1.3. For a Hopf algebra $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, Conditions (a)-(d) are equivalent to each other.\n\nThis will be proved in the following Section 2. One will see that among the conditions, a key is (b), the equivariant smoothness; the background of the notion will be seen in the following subsection. Important is the fact that Condition (b) is equivalent to saying that for every object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology (constructed in $\\mathscr{C}$ ) of $H$ with coefficients in $X$ vanishes,\n\n$$\nH_{x}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $X$ is regarded as a trivial $H$-module through the counit of $H$.\nAs was mentioned above, we will prove the first main theorem, Theorem 1.2, after proving (and by using) the second one, Theorem 1.3. A point to prove Part 2 (the positive characteristic case) of Theorem 1.2 is to show that the above cohomologyvanishing condition for finite-type (ordinary) Hopf algebras implies the same condition for Hopf algebras in general. This will be shown by proving that the restriction map for symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomologies (constructed in Vec)\n\n$$\n\\text { res : } H_{x}^{2}(H, k) \\rightarrow H_{x}^{2}(J, k)\n$$\n\nis surjective, where $H$ is an ordinary Hopf algebra, and $J$ is a Hopf subalgebra of $H$; see Proposition 3.3. The proof depends on the fact that the 2 nd cohomology\n\nin question is naturally isomorphic to the 1st Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology, and uses some results on the latter cohomology that include substantial ones by Avramov [2].\n1.3. Background around the equivariant smoothness. The notion of $H$-crossed products, where $H$ is a not necessary commutative ordinary Hopf algebra, was introduced by Blattner et al. [4]; it generalizes group crossed products, for which $H$ is a group algebra as a special case. To be more explicit, an $H$-crossed product, $R \\rtimes_{\\sigma} H$, over a (not necessarily commutative) algebra $R$ is constructed on the $H$-comodule $R \\otimes H$, subject to an action (in a weak sense) by $H$ on $R$ and a Hopf 2-cocycle $\\sigma: H \\otimes H \\rightarrow R$. As was shown by Doi et al. [9], the $H$-crossed products are intrinsically characterized as $H$-cleft extensions, i.e., $H$-comodule algebras with invertible (with respect to the convolution-product) $H$-colinear map from $H$. The second-named author [12] pointed out (in fact, in the dual situation) that if the $R$ has an augmentation $R \\rightarrow k$ with square-zero kernel, the augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $R$ are classified by the 2 nd Hochschild cohomologies. As a result it was essentially proved by [12, Theorem 4.1] (see also [16, Theorem 1.2, Proposition 1.10]) that if $H$ is smooth, then it is $H$-smooth in the present words; the converse holds, as well, but this is rather easy, as will be seen in Proposition 2.9 (modified into the non-commutative situation); see also [17, Proposition 3.19]. The last mentioned result of [12] was re-proved by Ardizonni et al. [1, Theorem 5.9 a)] based on categorical observation using the notion of (co)separability. We reach cohomologies directly (not through augmented cleft extensions), and deduce a key implication, (a) $\\Rightarrow(\\mathrm{d})$, of Theorem 1.3 from an isomorphism of the relevant cohomologies; see Proposition 2.5.\n\nNevertheless, it is a useful method of computing 2nd Hochschild cohomologies of a Hopf algebra $H$ to classify the corresponding augmented $H$-cleft extensions, as was shown in [14] in the case where $H$ is the quantized universal enveloping algebra. In the present situation in which the relevant (Hopf) algebras are supposed to be commutative, we discuss, as was mentioned above, the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology $H_{2}^{2}(H, k)$ with coefficients in the trivial $H$-module $k$, which is precisely in one-to-one correspondence with the set of the isomorphism classes of all (commutative) augmented $H$-cleft extension over the algebra $k[T] /\\left(T^{2}\\right)$ of dual numbers. This is the topic of Section 4. Section 4.1 reviews the above-mentioned one-to-one correspondence. It is applied, in the following two subsections, to compute $H_{2}^{2}(H, k)$ of some examples of Hopf algebras $H$ in positive characteristic. In Section 4.2, $H$ is supposed to be the Hopf algebra given in [26, Example 1.7] which is generated by an $\\infty$-sequence of primitive elements. In Section $4.3, H$ is supposed to be a finite-type group algebra, and the surjectivity of the restriction map (1.2) for such an $H$ is verified by explicit computation.\n1.4. Stronger smoothness properties. Beside the obvious Vec, the category $\\mathscr{C}$ discussed in Section 1.2 has as examples,\n\n$$\n\\text { sVec } \\text { and } \\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}\n$$\n\nwhich denote the category of super-vector spaces and the ind-completion of the Verlinde category $\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}$ in positive characteristic $p$ (see [21], [28]), respectively. These categories and the associated tensor-product functors are $k$-linear, where $k$ denotes the base field. Both naturally include Vec as a symmetric monoidal full\n\nsubcategory. Recently, they are attracting attention due to the following remarkable results which assume that $k$ is algebraically closed: in case char $k=0$, Deligne [6] proved that every $k$-linear artinian rigid symmetric monoidal category $\\mathscr{T}$, such that (i) the tensor-product functor is $k$-bilinear, (ii) the unit object is simple, and (iii) $\\mathscr{T}$ has moderate growth, has a fiber functor into the category svec of finitedimensional super-vector spaces, whence it is equivalent to the category of comodules in svec over some Hopf algebra in sVec; in case char $k=p>0$, Coulembier et al. [5] proved that the analogous conclusion in which svec is replaced by $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}$ holds, if (and only if) (iv) $\\mathscr{T}$ is Frobenius and exact, in addition. Here are remarks: sVec is the ind-completion svec ${ }^{\\text {ind }}$ of svec; Condition (iv) is necessarily satisfied if $\\mathscr{T}$ is semisimple.\n\nWe will show that Hopf algebras, which are commutative by assumption, in these categories have some properties stronger than smoothness. The familiar words \"(Hopf) superalgebras\" meaning (Hopf) algebras in sVec will not be used in this paper. Algebras of sVec in char $k=2$ are supposed to satisfy the assumption that every even element is central and every odd element is square-zero, which is stronger than the (super-)commutativity. For $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$, we assume that $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$. Since $\\mathrm{Ver}_{2}^{\\text {ind }}=\\mathrm{Vec}$ and $\\mathrm{Ver}_{3}^{\\text {ind }}=\\mathrm{sVec}$, as is shown in [21, Example 3.2], we assume $p \\geq 5$, in addition. Then, $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$ includes properly sVec as a symmetric monoidal full subcategory.\n\nThe third main theorem is the following.\nTheorem 1.4. We have the following.\n(1) Assume char $k=0$. Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra in sVec. Given an algebra $R$ in sVec and its nil ideal I, i.e., an ideal consisting of nilpotent elements, every algebra morphism $H \\rightarrow R / I$ can lift to some algebra morphism $H \\rightarrow$ $R$.\n(2) Assume char $k=p>0$, and let us work in sVec or $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$. Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra in the category, such that the naturally associated, ordinary quotient Hopf algebra $\\bar{H}$ (see (5.1), (5.5)) is smooth. Given an algebra $R$ and a bounded nil ideal I of $R$, every algebra morphism $H \\rightarrow R / I$ can lift to some algebra morphism $H \\rightarrow R$.\n\nThe conclusions above are restated so that the group map $\\mathfrak{G}(R) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{G}(R / I)$ analogous to (1.1) is surjective, where $\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$ denotes the affine group scheme corresponding to $H$, i.e., the group-valued functor which is defined on the category of algebras in the respective category, and is represented by $H$.\n\nAs for Part 2, an ideal $I$ is said to be bounded nil, if there is an integer $n>0$ satisfying the condition: $X^{n}=0$ for every simple sub-object $X$ of $I$. In sVec in arbitrary characteristic, an ideal $I$ of an algebra $R$ is (bounded) nil if and only if in the even component $R_{0}$ of $R$, which is an ordinary algebra, the ideal $I_{0}$ of $R_{0}$ is (bounded) nil. In $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$, the situation is the same; see the third paragraph of Section 3.2.\n\nThese situations, combined with the tensor product decomposition of a Hopf algebra in the category (see (5.2), (5.6)), allow us reduce the proof of Theorem 1.4 to the case where the category is Vec. The proof will be given in Section 5. Crucial for the proof of Part 2 is Takeuchi's result [26, Corollary 1.6] which was referred to in Section 1.1 and is now explicitly stated: an ordinary Hopf algebra in positive characteristic which satisfies Condition (f) has the stronger smoothness property\n\nwhich is an obvious analogue in Vec of the one stated in Part 2. Example 1.7 of [26], which was also referred to before, shows that Part 2 cannot be strengthen with \"bounded nil\" relaxed to \"nil\" as in Part 1; see the first paragraph of Section 4.2.\n\nThe same idea as proving Part 1 will be used in the Appendix, to give a simple proof of the known result that in Vec, every torsor under an affine group scheme over an algebraically closed field is trivial. Recently, Wibmer [31] gave an elementary proof to it, but ours would be simpler. We remark that the result holds more generally in sVec and in $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\mathrm{ind}}$; see Remark A.2.\n\nRemark 1.5. We do not know whether the equivariant analogue of Theorem 1.4, which replaces \"algebras\" with \" $H$-comodule algebras\", is true. One sees from the proof of Proposition 2.9 that the analogue is a stronger statement, i.e., it implies the theorem.",

      "text": "# 2. Proof of Theorem 1.3 \n\nTo prove Theorem 1.3, we let $\\mathscr{C}$ be a symmetric monoidal category such that (I) $\\mathscr{C}$ is semisimple abelian, and (II) the tensor-product functor is bi-additive, as in Section 1.2. Concerning (I), what is actually needed in this section is the property of $\\mathscr{C}$ that it is split, i.e., every short exact sequence is split; indeed, this property is weaker than the semisimplicity. The tensor product, the unit object and the symmetry of $\\mathscr{C}$ will be denoted by $\\otimes, \\mathbf{I}$ and\n\n$$\nc_{X, Y}: X \\otimes Y \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} Y \\otimes X, \\quad X, Y \\in \\mathscr{C}\n$$\n\nrespectively. The unit or associativity constraints, when they are recognized from the context, are presented as identity morphisms.\n\nIn what follows, all (Hopf) algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$ are supposed to be commutative, unless otherwise stated. Let $A$ be an algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$; the product and the unit will be denoted by $m_{A}: A \\otimes A \\rightarrow A$ and $u_{A}: \\mathbf{1} \\rightarrow A$, respectively. By an $A$-module we mean a left $A$-module $M$ in $\\mathscr{C}$. It is naturally identified with a right $A$-module so that\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\ncommutes; here and in what follows, $a_{M}$ (resp., $a_{M}^{\\prime}$ ) denotes the left (resp., right) $A$-action on $M$. In addition, $M$ is regarded as an $(A, A)$-bimodule with the special property that the left and the right $A$-actions are identified as above.\n\nA square-zero extension of $A$ is an algebra $E$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, equipped with an algebra morphism $p: E \\rightarrow A$, which is epic as a morphism of $\\mathscr{C}$, and is such that the kernel $\\operatorname{Ker} p$ is square-zero, $(\\operatorname{Ker} p)^{2}=0$. The last condition ensures that $\\operatorname{Ker} p$ naturally turns into an $A$-module through $p$. Two square-zero extensions, $(E, p)$ and $\\left(E^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right)$, of $A$ are said to be isomorphic, if there is an algebra isomorphism $E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$ compatible with $p$ and $p^{\\prime}$.\n\nGiven an $A$-module $M$, a Hochschild extension of $A$ by $M$ is a short exact sequence\n\n$$\n\\langle E\\rangle: 0 \\rightarrow M \\xrightarrow{i} E \\xrightarrow{p} A \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nin $\\mathscr{C}$ such that $(E, p)$ is a square-zero extension of $A$, and the isomorphism $i: M \\rightarrow$ Ker $p$ is $A$-linear. An equivalence $\\langle E\\rangle \\rightarrow\\left\\langle E^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle$ between two Hochschild extensions of $A$ by $M$ is an algebra morphism (necessarily, isomorphism) $E \\rightarrow E^{\\prime}$ between the middle terms which induces the identity morphisms of $A$ and of $M$.\n\nBy using the splitting property of $\\mathscr{C}$ we see that the set\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ext}(A, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}\n$$\n\nof all equivalence classes of the Hochschild extensions of $A$ by $M$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology group\n\n$$\nH_{*}^{2}(A, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}\n$$\n\nwhich is constructed in an obvious manner, generalizing the familiar one in the case where $\\mathscr{C}=\\mathrm{Vec}$. Moreover, $\\langle E\\rangle \\mapsto(E, p)$ gives rise to a bijection from $\\operatorname{Ext}(A, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ to the set of all isomorphism classes of the square-zero extensions of $A$ with kernel isomorphic to $M$. The zero cohomology class in $H_{*}^{2}(H, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ corresponds to the equivalence class of the Hochschild extensions $\\langle E\\rangle$, and also to the isomorphism class of the square-zero extensions $(E, p)$, such that the cokernel $p: E \\rightarrow A$ splits as an algebra morphism of $\\mathscr{C}$.\n\nLet $\\langle E\\rangle$ be a Hochschild extension such as in (2.1). Choosing a section $j: A \\rightarrow$ $E$ of $p$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, we have $M \\oplus \\operatorname{Im} j=E$, whence $E$ is thus identified, as an object of $\\mathscr{C}$, with $M \\oplus A$ through $j$, so that\n\n$$\nE=M \\oplus A\n$$\n\nThe one-to-one correspondence above is such as follows: the unit $u_{E}: \\mathbf{1} \\rightarrow E$ and the product $m_{E}: E \\otimes E \\rightarrow E$ are given uniquely by a symmetric Hochschild 2-cocycle $s: A \\otimes A \\rightarrow M$ so that\n\n$$\nu_{E}=\\left(-s \\circ\\left(u_{A} \\otimes u_{A}\\right), u_{A}\\right), \\quad m_{E}= \\begin{cases}\\left(s, m_{A}\\right) & \\text { on } A \\otimes A \\\\ \\left(a_{M}, 0\\right) & \\text { on } A \\otimes M \\\\ \\left(a_{M}^{\\prime}, 0\\right) & \\text { on } M \\otimes A \\\\ 0 & \\text { on } M \\otimes M\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet $H$ be a Hopf algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$. The coproduct and the counit will be denoted by $\\Delta_{H}: H \\rightarrow H \\otimes H$ and $\\varepsilon_{H}: H \\rightarrow \\mathbf{1}$, respectively. We have the category $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ of right $H$-comodules in $\\mathscr{C}$, which naturally turns into an abelian symmetric monoidal category with respect to the tensor product $\\otimes$ and the unit object $\\mathbf{1}$, just as in the familiar case where $\\mathscr{C}=\\mathrm{Vec}$ or sVec. Due to the splitting property of $\\mathscr{C}$ and the exactness of $\\otimes H$, a sequence of morphisms in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ is exact if and only if it is so, regarded as a sequence of morphisms in $\\mathscr{C}$. Algebras in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, which are supposed to be commutative, are called $H$-comodule algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$. An obvious example of such algebras is $H=\\left(H, \\Delta_{H}\\right)$. One can define square-zero extensions and Hochschild extensions in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, just as those in $\\mathscr{C}$. Our interest concentrates in such square-zero extensions of $H$ and Hochschild extensions with cokernel $H$.\n\nLet $(E, p)$ be a square-zero extension of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. As was seen above for squarezero extensions in $\\mathscr{C}$, the kernel $\\operatorname{Ker} p$ of $p$ is naturally regarded as an $H$-module in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. Here one sees that the category\n\n$$\n{ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}={ }_{H}\\left(\\mathscr{C}^{H}\\right)\n$$\n\nof $H$-modules in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ is abelian. In view of [22, Section 4.1], one may call an object of ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$ an $H$-Hopf module in $\\mathscr{C}$. Given an object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, regard it as a trivial $H$ module and $H$-comodule in $\\mathscr{C}$; thus, $H$ acts by $\\varepsilon_{H} \\otimes \\mathrm{id}_{X}: H \\otimes X \\rightarrow \\mathbf{1} \\otimes X=X$, and coacts by $\\operatorname{id}_{X} \\otimes u_{H}: X=X \\otimes \\mathbf{1} \\rightarrow X \\otimes H$. One sees that the tensor product\n\n$$\nX \\otimes H\n$$\n\nof $H$-modules and $H$-comodules in $\\mathscr{C}$ is an object of ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$.\nLemma 2.1. $X \\mapsto X \\otimes H$ gives rise to an equivalence $\\mathscr{C} \\approx{ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$ of abelian categories.\n\nThis is a standard result, which can be proved essentially in the same way as proving the Hopf-module Theorem [22, Theorem 4.1.1] in Vec.\n\nLemma 2.2. $X \\mapsto X \\otimes H$ gives an additive functor $\\mathscr{C} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{C}^{H}$ right adjoint to the forgetful functor $\\mathscr{C}^{H} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{C}$.\n\nThis is also a standard result. Indeed, let $N=\\left(N, \\rho_{N}\\right)$ be an object of $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. To every morphism $f: N \\rightarrow X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, assign its $H$-colinear extension given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{f}: N \\xrightarrow{\\rho_{N}} N \\otimes H \\xrightarrow{f \\otimes \\mathrm{id}_{H}} X \\otimes H .\n$$\n\nThe assignment $f \\mapsto \\tilde{f}$ gives a natural isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{C}(N, X) \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} \\mathscr{C}^{H}(N, X \\otimes H)\n$$\n\nof abelian groups, whose inverse assigns to every morphism $N \\rightarrow X \\otimes H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, its composition with $\\operatorname{id}_{X} \\otimes \\varepsilon_{H}: X \\otimes H \\rightarrow X \\otimes \\mathbf{1}=X$. The result is restated by the lemma above.\n\nThe corollary below now follows since $\\mathscr{C}$ is split, whence every object of $\\mathscr{C}$ is injective.\n\nCorollary 2.3. Every object of ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$, which is necessarily isomorphic to $X \\otimes H$ (see (2.5)) for some object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, is injective, regarded as an object of $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$.\n\nFix an object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, which gives rise to the object $X \\otimes H$ of ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$ as in (2.5).\nProposition 2.4. We have the following.\n(1) Every Hochschild extension\n\n$$\n\\langle E\\rangle: 0 \\rightarrow X \\otimes H \\xrightarrow{i} E \\xrightarrow{p} H \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nof $H$ by $X \\otimes H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ splits in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$.\n(2) The set\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ext}(H, X \\otimes H)_{\\mathscr{C}^{H}}\n$$\n\nof all equivalence classes of the Hochschild extensions of $H$ by $X \\otimes H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ is in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology\n\n$$\nH_{s}^{2}(H, X \\otimes H)_{\\mathscr{C}^{H}}\n$$\n\nconstructed in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. The set is also in one-to-one correspondence, through $\\langle E\\rangle \\mapsto(E, p)$, with the set of all isomorphism classes of the square-zero extensions of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ with kernel isomorphic to $X \\otimes H$.\n\nProof. (1) This is a direct consequence of Corollary 2.3.\n(2) By Part 1 every Hochschild extensions of $H$ by $X \\otimes H$ splits as a short exact sequence in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, whence it can be described, just as the $E$ in (2.3) is done by (2.4), by a symmetric Hochschild 2-cocycle $H \\otimes H \\rightarrow X \\otimes H$; see (2.9) below. The standard argument which connects the equivalence of extensions with the cohomologous relation proves the first assertion. The second is easy to see.\n\nProposition 2.5. We have a natural isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{x}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}} \\stackrel{\\simeq}{\\longrightarrow} H_{x}^{2}(H, X \\otimes H)_{\\mathscr{C}^{H}}\n$$\n\nof abelian groups between the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomologies.\nBefore proving this we make some remarks. First, notice $\\operatorname{Im}\\left(u_{H}\\right) \\oplus H^{+}=H$, where $H^{+}=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\varepsilon_{H}: H \\rightarrow \\mathbf{1}\\right)$ denotes the augmentation ideal of $H$. Therefore, we have the canonical identification\n\n$$\nH^{+}=\\operatorname{Coker}\\left(u_{H}: \\mathbf{1} \\rightarrow H\\right)\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\operatorname{Coker}\\left(u_{H}\\right)$ is a quotient object of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. We regard $H^{+}$as an object of $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ through the identification above.\n\nSecond, given a Hochschild extension $\\langle E\\rangle$ of $H$ by $X$ (resp., by $X \\otimes H$ ) in $\\mathscr{C}$ (resp., in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ ), we can and we do choose a section $j$ of $E \\rightarrow H$ so as to be unitpreserving, $j \\circ u_{H}=u_{E}$, by replacing it with $j+\\left(u_{E}-j \\circ u_{H}\\right) \\circ \\varepsilon_{H}$. Therefore, we have $u_{E}=\\left(0, u_{H}\\right)$ in the associated coproduct $E=X \\oplus H$ (resp., $E=(X \\otimes H) \\oplus H$ ) such as the one in (2.3); cf. (2.4). Accordingly, we suppose that the cochains for computing the relevant symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomologies are normalized; they thus have some tensor powers of $H^{+}$as their domains. In addition, for the symmetry condition of the 2-cochains we use the 2 nd symmetric power $S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$ of $H^{+}\\left(=\\operatorname{Coker}\\left(u_{H}\\right)\\right)$ in $\\mathscr{C}$ (resp., in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ ). Explicitly, the 2 nd cohomologies in question are obtained as the cohomologies at the middle terms of the horizontal (so-called normalized Hochschild) complexes below.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nHere the vertical arrows indicate the natural isomorphisms such as in (2.7).\nProof of Proposition 2.5. It remains to prove commutativity of the diagram above. But this can be verified directly. Indeed, one may replace the $S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$at the middle terms with $\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes 2}$, so that the resulting complexes are semi-cosimplicial. One then has only to verify the commutativity for the relevant coface operators, not for the coboundary operators such as $\\delta^{i}$ above. Let $i \\in\\{1,2\\}$. A point of the verification is to use the fact that the face operators\n\n$$\nd_{q}: H \\otimes\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes i+1)} \\otimes H \\rightarrow H \\otimes\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes i} \\otimes H, \\quad 0 \\leq q \\leq i+1\n$$\n\nwhich induce the coface operators (of the two complexes) are morphisms in the category ${ }_{H}\\left(\\mathscr{C}^{H}\\right)_{H}$ of $(H, H)$-bimodules in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$.\n\nRemark 2.6. By Lemma 2.1 and Propositions 2.4 and 2.5 we have a natural one-to-one correspondence between the following two sets:\n\n- all isomorphism classes of the square-zero extensions $(E, p)$ of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}$ such that the kernel Ker $p$ of $p: E \\rightarrow H$ is a trivial $H$-module;\n- all isomorphism classes of the square-zero extensions of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$.\n\nTo present the correspondence explicitly, suppose that we are given $(E, p)$ from the first set. We may suppose $E=X \\oplus H$ with $X$ a trivial $H$-module, and $p$ : $X \\oplus H \\rightarrow H$ is the projection. In addition, the product $m_{E}$ of $E=X \\oplus H$ is such as in (2.4) with obvious modifications, where in particular, the symmetric Hochschild 2-cocycle $s$ is now supposed to be normalized, and thus the unit is $u_{E}=\\left(0, u_{H}\\right)$. The corresponding square-zero extension of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ is $\\widetilde{E}=\\widetilde{X} \\oplus H$ together with the projection to $H$, where $\\widetilde{X}=X \\otimes H$ as in (2.5), and the structure of $\\widetilde{E}$ is given by\n\n$$\nu_{\\widetilde{E}}=\\left(0, u_{H}\\right), \\quad m_{\\widetilde{E}}= \\begin{cases}\\left(\\widetilde{s}, m_{H}\\right) & \\text { on } H \\otimes H \\\\ \\left(\\left(\\operatorname{id}_{X} \\otimes m_{H}\\right) \\circ\\left(c_{H, X} \\otimes \\operatorname{id}_{H}\\right), 0\\right) & \\text { on } H \\otimes \\widetilde{X} \\\\ \\left(\\operatorname{id}_{X} \\otimes m_{H}, 0\\right) & \\text { on } \\widetilde{X} \\otimes H \\\\ 0 & \\text { on } \\widetilde{X} \\otimes \\widetilde{X}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{s}: H \\otimes H \\rightarrow \\widetilde{X}=X \\otimes H$ denotes the $H$-colinear extension of $s$; see (2.6). The original $(E, p)$ is recovered from $\\widetilde{E}$ by dividing it by the ideal $X \\otimes H^{+}(\\subset \\widetilde{X})$.\n\nWe wish to present $H_{s}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ in a simple form. Let $m_{H^{+}}: H^{+} \\otimes H^{+} \\rightarrow H^{+}$ denote the restricted product on $H^{+}$. Let\n\n$$\n\\delta_{1}: S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow H^{+}\n$$\n\ndenote the morphism of $\\mathscr{C}$ induced by $m_{H^{+}}$, and let\n\n$$\n\\delta_{2}:\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes 3} \\rightarrow\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes 2} \\rightarrow S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)\n$$\n\ndenote the composition of $\\operatorname{id}_{H^{+}} \\otimes m_{H^{+}}-m_{H^{+}} \\otimes \\operatorname{id}_{H^{+}}$with the canonical $\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{\\otimes 2} \\rightarrow$ $S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$. Regard $H^{+}$naturally as an object of the symmetric monoidal category ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}$ of $H$-modules in $\\mathscr{C}$, whose tensor product and unit object are now supposed to be $\\otimes_{H}$ and $H$, respectively, and construct the 2 nd symmetric power $S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$of it; this, constructed in ${ }_{H} \\mathscr{C}$, should be distinguished from the one $S^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)$constructed in $\\mathscr{C}$, before. Notice that this is, in fact, the cokernel $\\operatorname{Coker}\\left(\\delta_{2}\\right)$ of $\\delta_{2}$. Let\n\n$$\n\\mu_{H}: S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow H^{+}\n$$\n\ndenote the morphism of $\\mathscr{C}$ induced by $\\delta_{1}$, and thus by $m_{H^{+}}$, too.\nProposition 2.7. We have the following.\n(1) The coboundary operators $\\delta^{i}$ of the upper horizontal complex in (2.8) for computing $H_{s}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ are induced by $\\delta_{i}$ so that\n\n$$\n\\delta^{i}=\\mathscr{C}\\left(\\delta_{i}, X\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $i=1,2$.\n(2) We have an isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{s}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}} \\simeq \\mathscr{C}\\left(\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mu_{H}\\right), X\\right)\n$$\n\nof abelian groups, which is natural in $X$.\nProof. Part 1 is easily verified by using the fact that $X$ is trivial. The result for $\\delta^{2}$, combined with the splitting property of $\\mathscr{C}$, shows that the object of 2-cocycles is naturally isomorphic to $\\mathscr{C}\\left(S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right), X\\right)$. This, combined with the result for $\\delta^{1}$ in Part 1, implies Part 2.\n\nRecall from the Introduction the conditions (a)-(d) for Hopf algebras in Vec, ignoring (e) and (f). The conditions (a)-(d) make sense for Hopf algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$, more generally. Indeed, the definition of (equivariant) smoothness is directly generalized. The morphism $\\mu_{H}$ is already given in the generalized situation. For (c) some comments should be made. Due to the properties (I)-(II) of $\\mathscr{C}$, given a Hopf algebra $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, a Hopf ideal of $H$ and thus a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$ are defined in an obvious manner. Suppose that $Q$ is a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$. Then $H$ is naturally regarded as a $Q$-comodule on both sides. Given a right $Q$-comodule $V=\\left(V, \\rho_{V}\\right)$ and a left $Q$-comodule $W=\\left(W, \\lambda_{W}\\right)$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, the co-tensor product $V \\square_{Q} W$ is defined by the following equalizer diagram\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow V \\square_{Q} W \\rightarrow V \\otimes W \\rightrightarrows(V \\otimes Q) \\otimes W(=V \\otimes(Q \\otimes W))\n$$\n\nin $\\mathscr{C}$, where the paired arrows indicate $\\rho_{V} \\otimes \\mathrm{id}_{W}$ and $\\operatorname{id}_{V} \\otimes \\lambda_{W}$. Indeed, this defines a functor, $V \\square_{Q}:{ }^{Q} \\mathscr{C} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{C}$ (resp., $\\square_{Q} W: \\mathscr{C}^{Q} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{C}$ ), which is seen to be left exact. If it is exact, we say that $V$ (resp., $W$ ) is coflat. A right $Q$-comodule is regarded, with the coaction twisted by the antipode of $Q$, as a left $Q$-comodule, and vice versa. The thus twisted left $Q$-comodule $H$ is isomorphic to the natural left $Q$-comodule $H$ through the antipode $\\mathcal{S}_{H}$ of $H$. Therefore, the co-tensor-product functors $H \\square_{Q}$ and $\\square_{Q} H$ are identified through the natural isomorphisms induced from $\\left(\\operatorname{id}_{W} \\otimes \\mathcal{S}_{H}\\right) \\circ c_{H, W}: H \\otimes W \\xrightarrow{\\circ} W \\otimes H$. As a conclusion, $H$ is coflat as a right $Q$-comodule if and only if it is so as a left $Q$-comodule.\n\nRemark 2.8. The above definitions of the co-tensor product and the coflatness (for $Q$ ) are valid for any coalgebra in $\\mathscr{C}$. Let $C$ be such a coalgebra. A $C$-comodule $V=\\left(V, \\rho_{V}\\right)$, say on the right, is coflat if it is injective, as is seen from the canonical isomorphism $(V \\otimes C) \\square_{C} W=V \\otimes W$, where $W$ is a left $C$-comodule, and the fact that $\\rho_{V}$ splits $C$-colinearly provided $V$ is injective. The converse holds when $\\mathscr{C}=\\mathrm{Vec}, \\mathrm{sVec}$ or $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$; see (1.3). Indeed, the proof of the well-known result [24, Proposition A.2.1] in the case where $\\mathscr{C}=\\mathrm{Vec}$ works in the other cases, as well. For one verifies the following properties in those cases: (i) every $C$-comodule is ind-finite (for so is $C$ ), and (ii) we have a natural isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{C}^{C}(V, W) \\simeq V \\square_{C} W^{*}\n$$\n\nwhere $W$ is supposed to have finite length, so that the dual object $W^{*}$ is naturally a left $C$-comodule.\n\nWe make some additional remarks before the proof of Theorem 1.3. The category of algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$ has pull-backs. Indeed, the pull-back $L \\times_{S} R$ of two algebra morphisms $L \\rightarrow S \\leftarrow R$ in $\\mathscr{C}$ is, as an object of $\\mathscr{C}$, the pull-back of those regarded as morphisms of $\\mathscr{C}$, and is equipped with the component-wise algebra structure. Given an algebra $R$ in $\\mathscr{C}$ with a square-zero ideal $I$ and an algebra morphism $f: H \\rightarrow R / I$, the pull-back $T:=H \\times_{R / I} R$ actually constitutes the diagram\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nOne sees that $(T, \\varpi)$ is a square-zero extension of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}$. If $\\varpi$ has a section, then it, composed with $\\omega$, gives a lift of $f$. This familiar argument shows that Condition\n\n(a) is equivalent to saying that for every square-zero extension $(E, p)$ of $H$ in $\\mathscr{C}, p$ splits as algebra morphism in $\\mathscr{C}$; see [30, Section 9.3.2], for example. This in turn is equivalent to\n(a') $H_{2}^{2}(H, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}=0$ for every $H$-module $M$ in $\\mathscr{C}$.\nSee the paragraph containing (2.2).\nSimilarly, the category of algebras in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ has pull-backs. The argument above modified into $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, combined with Propositions 2.4 and 2.5, shows that Condition (b) is equivalent to\n(b') $H_{s}^{2}(H, X)_{\\mathscr{C}}=0$ for every object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, regarded as a trivial $H$-module.\nProof of Theorem 1.3. (c) $\\Rightarrow$ (a). This follows, since $H / H^{+}(=\\mathbf{1})$ is a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$, over which $H$ is obviously coflat, and being smooth is the same as being $H / H^{+}$-smooth.\n(a) $\\Rightarrow$ (d). By Proposition 2.7 (2), Condition (d) is equivalent to ( $\\mathrm{b}^{\\prime}$ ), which is satisfied under ( $\\mathrm{a}^{\\prime}$ ), or equivalently, under (a).\n(d) $\\Rightarrow$ (b). In fact, the conditions are equivalent, since they are both equivalent to $\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n(b) $\\Rightarrow$ (c). This follows by applying the next proposition for $H$-comodule algebras in $\\mathscr{C}$, to $H$, in particular.\n\nProposition 2.9 (see [17, Proposition 3.19]). Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be as above, and let $H$ be a Hopf algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$. If $Q$ is a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$ such that $H$ is coflat as a right (or equivalently, left) $Q$-comodule, then every $H$-smooth $H$-comodule algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$ is necessarily $Q$-smooth.\n\nProof. Let $Q$ be a quotient Hopf algebra of $H$. Given an object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C} Q$ and $Y$ of $\\mathscr{C}$, we have a canonical isomorphism $\\left(X \\square_{Q} H\\right) \\otimes Y=X \\square_{Q}(H \\otimes Y)$, since $\\otimes Y$ is exact. It follows that $X \\square_{Q} H$ naturally turns into an object of $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. In fact, the co-tensor product $\\square_{Q} H$ gives rise to a functor $\\mathscr{C}^{Q} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{C}^{H}$. Moreover, we have a natural isomorphism of abelian groups,\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{C}^{Q}(N, X) \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} \\mathscr{C}^{H}\\left(N, X \\square_{Q} H\\right)\n$$\n\nanalogous to (in fact, generalizing) (2.7); $f$ from the group on the left maps to $\\left(f \\square_{Q} \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\right) \\circ \\rho_{N}: N \\rightarrow X \\square_{Q} H$ on the right. Since $\\square_{Q} H$ is a lax monoidal functor, for which the relevant constraints are not necessarily isomorphic by definition, it follows that if $X$ is an algebra in $\\mathscr{C}^{Q}$, then $X \\square_{Q} H$ is such in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. Moreover, if $N$ is an algebra in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$, as well, then the isomorphism above restricts to a bijection\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Alg} \\mathscr{C}^{Q}(N, X) \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} \\operatorname{Alg} \\mathscr{C}^{H}\\left(N, X \\square_{Q} H\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Alg} \\mathscr{C}^{Q}$ and $\\operatorname{Alg} \\mathscr{C}^{H}$ denote the categories of the algebras in respective categories.\n\nLet $A$ be an $H$-comodule algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$, or namely, an algebra in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$. Given an algebra $R$ of $\\mathscr{C}^{Q}$ and its nilpotent ideal $I$, we have the natural commutative diagram\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nAssume that $H$ is $Q$-coflat. Then the natural algebra morphism $R \\square_{Q} H \\rightarrow R / I \\square_{Q} H$ in $\\mathscr{C}^{H}$ is epic, whose kernel, $I \\square_{Q} H$, is nilpotent. If $A$ is $H$-smooth, then the vertical arrow on the right is surjective, whence so is the one on the left. This shows that $A$ is $Q$-smooth.\n\nRemark 2.10. It is now easy to show a non-commutative analogue of Theorem 1.3 in view of the proof of [16, Theorem 1.2]. Suppose that $\\mathscr{C}$ is a semisimple abelian braided monoidal category which satisfies the same conditions as (I)-(II), and $H$ is a Hopf algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$, in general. The definition of (equivariant) smoothness extends to this context in an obvious manner (though one might prefer the word \"quasifree\" to \"smooth\", in view of [30, Section 9.3.2]), and we see that the following are equivalent:\n$(\\alpha) H$ is smooth;\n$(\\beta) H$ is $H$-smooth as a right $H$-comodule algebra;\n$(\\gamma) H$ is $Q$-smooth as a right $Q$-comodule algebra for every quotient Hopf algebra $Q$ of $H$ such that $H$ is coflat as a left $Q$-comodule.\n( $\\delta$ ) $H$ is left hereditary as an algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$, or in other words, an $H$-submodule of any left $H$-module that is projective is necessarily projective.\nIndeed, a point of the proof is to see the following: as an analogue of Condition $\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)$ above, the condition\n( $\\beta$ ') For every left $H$-module $M$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, the 2 nd Hochschild cohomology $H^{2}(H, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ constructed in $\\mathscr{C}$ vanishes, where the $M$ of coefficients is regarded as an $(H, H)$-bimodule with respect to the trivial right $H$-action through the counit $\\varepsilon_{H}$\nis equivalent to $(\\beta)$. Here, $H^{2}(H, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ is naturally isomorphic to the 2 nd Ext group $\\operatorname{Ext}_{H}^{2}(\\mathbf{1}, M)_{\\mathscr{C}}$ for the left $H$-modules in $\\mathscr{C}$, which form an abelian category with enough projectives. In addition, given a left $H$-module $N$ in $\\mathscr{C}$, a projective resolution of the trivial $H$-module $\\mathbf{1}$, with $\\otimes N$ applied, turns into a projective resolution of $N$.\n\nThe conditions above, except $(\\alpha)$, have the variants with the sides, left and right, exchanged, and those variants and $(\\alpha)$ (thus, the above conditions all together) are proved to be equivalent to each other.",

The coproduct, the counit and the antipode of $H$ are denoted by $\\Delta_{H}, \\varepsilon_{H}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{H}$, respectively, as before. The coproduct will be presented so that\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{H}(h)=h_{(1)} \\otimes h_{(2)}, \\quad h \\in H\n$$\n\nBy Theorem 1.3, Conditions (a)-(d) for $H$ are known to be equivalent.\n3.1. Proof of Part 1, characteristic zero case. We do not assume char $k=0$ until explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe following is well known. But we give a proof for the sake of further discussion.\n\nLemma 3.1. Suppose that $H$ is of finite type. Then Conditions (a) and (e) are equivalent, or explicitly, $H$ is smooth if and only if it is geometrically reduced.\n\nProof. It is known that a Noetherian algebra is smooth if and only if it is geometrically regular, i.e., it remains regular after base extension to the algebraic closure of $k$; see [30, Corollary 9.3.13 and the following Remark].\n'Only if'. The geometrical regularity implies the geometrical reducedness.\n'If'. The $H$-module $\\Omega_{H / k}$ of K\u00e4hler differentials is projective (in fact, free); see [29, 11.3 Theorem], for example. In general, a finite-type algebra $A$ with projective K\u00e4hler differential module is smooth, or equivalently, geometrically regular, either if char $k=0$ or if char $k>0, k$ is perfect and $A$ is reduced; see [27, Lemmas 33.25.1 and 33.25.2]. In the case where char $k>0$, apply this to the base extension of $H$ to the algebraic closure of $k$.\n\nRecall that $H$ can be presented as a directed union\n\n$$\nH=\\bigcup_{\\alpha} H_{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nof Hopf subalgebras $H_{\\alpha}$ of finite type. Accordingly, we have\n\n$$\nS_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)=\\varliminf_{\\alpha} S_{H_{\\alpha}}^{2}\\left(H_{\\alpha}^{+}\\right), \\quad \\mu_{H}=\\varliminf_{\\alpha} \\mu_{H_{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nAssume char $k=0$. Notice from the general fact noted in the last paragraph of the last proof that every $H_{\\alpha}$ satisfies Condition (a) and the equivalent (e), whence $H$ does (e). On the other hand, Theorem 1.3 and Lemma 3.1 ensure the equivalence of Conditions (a)-(e) for every $H_{\\alpha}$ (in arbitrary characteristic). In view of (3.2), it follows that $H$ satisfies (d), and thus (a)-(c), as well, by the cited theorem. This proves Part 1 of Theorem 1.2.\n3.2. Proof of Part 2, positive characteristic case. Throughout in this subsection we assume char $k=p>0$.\n\nA main subject of our argument is the abelian group $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)$, which is now a vector space. The coefficients are in the trivial $H$-module $k$. By (2.10) we have a natural $k$-linear isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{s}^{2}(H, k) \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mu_{H}\\right), k\\right)\n$$\n\nProposition 3.2. Conditions (a)-(d), which are known to be mutually equivalent by Theorem 1.3, are equivalent to\n(b\") $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)=0$, where $k$ is regarded as a trivial $H$-module.\nProof. This holds since we have by (3.3) that $\\left(\\mathrm{b}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\Leftrightarrow(\\mathrm{d})$.\nTo prove Part 2 of Theorem 1.2, notice first that (e) implies (f). Takeuchi [26, Proposition 1.9] proves that (f) implies (d). In view of Proposition 3.2, it remains to prove that (b\") implies (e). This follows from the following proposition, which, indeed, shows that if $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)=0$, then we have $H_{s}^{2}(J, k)=0$ for every finite-type Hopf subalgebra $J$ of $H$. By Proposition 3.2 now applied to $J$, the last condition is equivalent to every $J$ being smooth. This is equivalent, by Lemma 3.1, to every $J$ being geometrically reduced, or to Condition (e).\n\nProposition 3.3. Given a Hopf subalgebra J of H, the restriction map\n\n$$\n\\text { res : } H_{s}^{2}(H, k) \\rightarrow H_{s}^{2}(J, k)\n$$\n\nis surjective.\n\nProof. Let us consider the map\n\n$$\nS_{J}^{2}\\left(J^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich arises naturally from the inclusion $J \\hookrightarrow H$. The five lemma shows that the map above is injective if and only if so is its restriction $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mu_{J}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mu_{H}\\right)$ to the kernels of the $\\mu$ maps. It follows by the isomorphism (3.3) and its naturality that the injectivity of the map (3.4) is equivalent to the desired surjectivity of res.\n\nPresent $H=\\bigcup_{\\alpha} H_{\\alpha}$ as in (3.1). To prove the injectivity of the map (3.4) (and the equivalent surjectivity of res), we may (and we do) suppose that $H$ and thus $J$ are of finite type, in view of (3.2), replacing $H$ and $J$ with $H_{\\alpha}$ and $J \\cap H_{\\alpha}$, respectively. Here we remark that $J \\cap H_{\\alpha}$ is of finite type by [23, Corollary 3.11].\n\nIn general, for an algebra $A$, the symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology $H_{s}^{2}(A,-)$ is identified, through a natural isomorphism, with the 1st Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology $D^{1}(A \\mid k,-)$; see [30, Exercise 8.8.4]. The restriction map for $H_{s}^{2}$ is identified with such a map for $D^{1}$, which extends up to the 2nd Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology so that\n\n$$\nD^{1}(A \\mid k, M) \\xrightarrow{\\text { res }} D^{1}(B \\mid k, M) \\longrightarrow D^{2}(A \\mid B, M)\n$$\n\nwhere $B$ is a subalgebra of $A$, and $M$ is an $A$-module.\nTherefore, for our purpose, it suffices to prove that $D^{2}(H \\mid J, k)=0$. Let $Q:=$ $H / J^{+} H$ be the quotient Hopf algebra of $H$ corresponding $J$; this $Q$ is necessarily of finite type. We have an $H$-algebra isomorphism (see [25, p.456, line 4])\n\n$$\nH \\otimes_{J} H \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} H \\otimes Q, \\quad a \\otimes_{J} b \\mapsto a b_{(1)} \\otimes\\left(b_{(2)} \\bmod \\left(J^{+}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $H \\otimes_{J} H$ is supposed to be an $H$-algebra through the embedding of $H$ into the left tensor factor. The base change property of the Andr\u00e9-Quillen cohomology (see [10, Proposition 1.4.3], for example), applied to the flat ring maps $J \\rightarrow H$ and $k \\rightarrow H$, shows\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD^{2}(H \\mid J, M) & =D^{2}\\left(H \\otimes_{J} H \\mid H, M\\right) \\\\\n& =D^{2}(H \\otimes Q \\mid H, M)=D^{2}(Q \\mid k, M)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is a module over $H \\otimes_{J} H(=H \\otimes Q)$, and may be now supposed to be the trivial module $k$. But this cohomology, in the case where $M=k$, vanishes, as desired. Indeed, since $Q$ is locally complete intersection by Corollary 3.5 below, it follows by Avramov's Theorem [2, (1.2)] that the 2nd Andr\u00e9-Quillen homology $D_{2}(Q \\mid k, k)$ vanishes, whence\n\n$$\nD^{2}(Q \\mid k, k)=\\operatorname{Hom}_{k}\\left(D_{2}(Q \\mid k, k), k\\right)=0\n$$\n\nSee [30, Exercise 8.8.6].\nSuppose that $k$ is a perfect field (of char $k=p>0$ ), and let $H$ be a Hopf algebra of finite type. Then the nil radical Nil $H$ of $H$ is a Hopf ideal, and the resulting quotient Hopf algebra\n\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{red}}:=H / \\mathrm{Nil} H\n$$\n\nis geometrically reduced, or equivalently (see Lemma 3.1), ( $H_{\\text {red }}$-smooth.\nProposition 3.4 ([7, III, \u00a7 3, 6.4 Corollaire]). Let the situation be as above. If $H \\neq$ $H_{\\text {red }}$, then $H$ is, regarded naturally as an $H_{\\text {red }}$-comodule algebra, in the form\n\n$$\nH=k\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p^{e_{1}}}, \\cdots, T_{n}^{p^{e_{n}}}\\right) \\otimes H_{\\mathrm{red}}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ and $e_{i}, 1 \\leq i \\leq n$, are positive integers.\n\nThe corollary in [7] referred to above shows the result more generally for locally algebraic group schemes. We will give below a highly self-contained proof in the present affinity situation, which uses the $H_{\\text {red }}$-smoothness of $H_{\\text {red }}$.\n\nLet $A$ be an algebra over an arbitrary field, which is essentially of finite type, i.e., a localization of a finite-type algebra by some multiplicatively closed subset. We say that $A$ is locally complete intersection, if the localization $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ at every prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ is complete intersection. A local algebra essentially of finite type, such as $A_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ above, is said to be complete intersection, if it is in the form\n\n$$\nS^{-1} k\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] / I\n$$\n\nwhere $S^{-1} k\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right]$ is a localization of a polynomial algebra $k\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right]$, and $I$ is an ideal generated by a regular sequence. It is known that $A$ is locally complete intersection if it is regular, or in particular, smooth. In addition, $A$ is locally complete intersection if it turns into such after some base field extension; see $[2,(5.11)(2)]$. These facts, combined with Proposition 3.4, prove the following corollary in the non-trivial, positive-characteristic case.\n\nCorollary 3.5. A finite-type Hopf algebra over an arbitrary field is locally complete intersection.\n\nProof of Proposition 3.4. Let us be in the situation of the proposition.\nNotice that the nil radical Nil $H$ of $H$ is nilpotent. Since $H_{\\text {red }}$ is $H_{\\text {red }}$-smooth, the natural map $\\pi: H \\rightarrow H_{\\text {red }}=H / \\mathrm{Nil} H$, as an $H_{\\text {red }}$-colinear algebra-surjection, has a section, say, $\\phi: H_{\\text {red }} \\rightarrow H$. Replacing $\\phi$ with $a \\mapsto \\varepsilon_{H}\\left(\\phi\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{H_{\\text {red }}}\\left(a_{(1)}\\right)\\right) \\phi\\left(a_{(2)}\\right)\\right.$, we may and we do suppose that it is counit-preserving, $\\phi \\circ \\varepsilon_{H_{\\text {red }}}=\\varepsilon_{H}$. Denote the left coideal subalgebra of $H_{\\text {red }}$-coinvariants in $H$ by\n\n$$\nB:=H^{\\cos \\left(H_{\\text {red }}\\right)}\\left(=\\left\\{h \\in H \\mid h_{(1)} \\otimes \\pi\\left(h_{(2)}\\right)=h \\otimes \\pi(1)\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nand set $\\left.\\varepsilon_{B}:=\\varepsilon_{H}\\right|_{B}$ and $B^{+}:=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\varepsilon_{B}\\right)\\left(=B \\cap H^{+}\\right)$. Notice that $\\phi$ makes the $H_{\\text {red }}$-comodule (algebra) $H$ into an $H_{\\text {red }}$-Hopf module [22, Section 4.1]. By the Hopf-module Theorem [22, Theorem 4.1.1] we see that\n\n$$\n\\alpha: B \\otimes H_{\\mathrm{red}} \\rightarrow H, \\quad \\alpha(b \\otimes a)=b \\phi(a)\n$$\n\nis an $H_{\\text {red }}$-colinear isomorphism of $B$-algebras, which is counit-preserving, $\\varepsilon_{H} \\circ \\alpha=$ $\\varepsilon_{B} \\otimes \\varepsilon_{H_{\\text {red }}}$. It follows that $B^{+} H=\\mathrm{Nil} H$, whence $B$ is finite-dimensional and local.\n\nThe rest is a modification of the proof of the Theorem in [29, Section 14.4], which proves the result in the special case where $B=H$. We prove by induction on $\\operatorname{dim} B$ that $B$ is in the form\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p^{p_{1}}}, \\cdots, T_{n}^{p^{p_{n}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich, we understand, presents $k$ in the first induction step where $\\operatorname{dim} B=1$. Recall that for an arbitrary algebra $A$, the the Frobenius map $F_{A}: k^{1 / p} \\otimes A \\rightarrow A$, $F_{A}\\left(c^{1 / p} \\otimes a\\right)=c \\alpha^{p}$ is defined, and it is a Hopf algebra map in case $A$ is a Hopf algebra. Since $k$ is perfect, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Im}\\left(F_{A}\\right)=A^{p}\\left(:=\\left\\{a^{p} \\mid a \\in A\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe isomorphism $\\alpha$ restricts to\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{p}: B^{p} \\otimes\\left(H_{\\mathrm{red}}\\right)^{p} \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} H^{p}\n$$\n\nwhich shows $\\left(H_{\\text {red }}\\right)^{p}=\\left(H^{p}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$. In addition, $H^{p}$ is a Hopf subalgebra of $H$, and $\\alpha^{p}$ is a counit-preserving $\\left(H^{p}\\right)_{\\text {red }}$-colinear isomorphism of $B^{p}$-algebras, whence\n\n$B^{p}=\\left(H^{p}\\right)^{\\cos \\left(H^{p}\\right)_{\\text {tot }}}$ ). We may suppose $\\operatorname{dim} B>1$, which implies $\\operatorname{dim} B^{p}<\\operatorname{dim} B$. The induction hypothesis applied to $B^{p}$ shows that there exist elements $y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{s}$ of $B^{+}$and some positive integers $e_{i}$ such that the algebra map\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{s}^{p}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p^{e_{1}}}, \\cdots, T_{s}^{p^{e_{s}}}\\right) \\rightarrow B^{p}\n$$\n\ninduced by $T_{i}^{p} \\mapsto y_{i}^{p}, 1 \\leq i \\leq s$, is an isomorphism. Notice that $y_{i}^{p_{i}}=0,1 \\leq$ $i \\leq s$. In addition, $y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{s}$ are linearly independent modulo $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$, since they map through $F_{B}$ to $y_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, y_{s}^{p}$ in $\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+}$which are linearly independent modulo $\\left(\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+}\\right)^{2}$. Choose elements $z_{s+1}, \\cdots, z_{n}$ of $B^{+}$which are maximal with respect to the properties that $z_{j}^{p}=0, s<j \\leq n$, and $z_{s+1}, \\cdots, z_{n}$ are linearly independent modulo $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$. It may happen that $\\left\\{y_{i}\\right\\}$ or $\\left\\{z_{j}\\right\\}$ is empty.\n\nNotice that the assignment\n\n$$\nT_{i} \\mapsto \\begin{cases}y_{i}, & 1 \\leq i \\leq s \\\\ z_{i}, & s<i \\leq n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\ngives rise to an algebra map\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p^{e_{1}}}, \\cdots, T_{s}^{p^{e_{s}}}, T_{s+1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{n}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow B\n$$\n\nTo complete the proof we wish to prove that this is an isomorphism. Let\n\n$$\nC:=B /\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+} B\n$$\n\nThis is finite-dimensional and local with the maximal ideal $C^{+}:=B^{+} /\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+} B$. The algebra map above, divided by the maximal ideals of the mutually isomorphic local subalgebras in (3.10), reduces to\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{n}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow C\n$$\n\nwhich is induced again by (3.11). Since $B$ and $B^{p}$ are left coideal subalgebras of $H$, it follows by $[19,3.4$ Theorem] that $H$ is flat, and hence free, over $B$ and over $B^{p}$. It follows that $B$ is free over $B^{p}$. By Nakayama's Lemma we have only to prove that the local algebra map (3.12) is an isomorphism. Moreover, it suffices to prove that the associated graded algebra map\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{n}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{n}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{gr} C\n$$\n\nis an isomorphism, where we suppose $\\operatorname{deg} T_{i}=1,1 \\leq i \\leq n$, and let\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gr} C:=\\bigodot_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(C^{+}\\right)^{n} /\\left(C^{+}\\right)^{n+1}\n$$\n\nFor later use notice from $\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+} B \\subset\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$ that\n\n$$\nC^{+} /\\left(C^{+}\\right)^{2}=\\left(B^{+}+\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+} B\\right) /\\left(\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}+\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+} B\\right)=B^{+} /\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nTo prove that the graded algebra map (3.13) is isomorphic, we make\nClaim. $\\operatorname{gr} C$ is, as a graded algebra, in the form $k\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{m}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{m}^{p}\\right)$.\nWe postpone for a little while to prove the claim. By the claim we have only to prove that the map (3.13) restricted to degree 1 is isomorphic, or in other words (in view of (3.14)), $y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{s}, z_{s+1}, \\cdots, z_{n}$ form a basis of $B^{+}$modulo $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$.\n\nTo see that they span $B^{+}$modulo $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$, let $b \\in B^{+}$. Since $b^{p}$ is a polynomial in the $y_{i}^{p}$ with zero constant, and $k$ is perfect, we have a polynomial $u$ in the $y_{i}$ with zero constant, such that $b^{p}=u^{p}$. It follows by choice of $\\left\\{z_{j}\\right\\}$ that $b \\sim u\\left(\\in B^{+}\\right)$is a\n\nlinear combination of the $z_{j}$ modulo $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$, whence $b$ is such of the $y_{i}$ and the $z_{j}$. To see the linear independence, suppose that a linear combination $\\sum c_{i} y_{i}+\\sum d_{j} z_{j}$ is in $\\left(B^{+}\\right)^{2}$. Since $z_{j}^{p}=0$, we have $\\sum c_{i}^{p} y_{i}^{p}$ is in $\\left(\\left(B^{p}\\right)^{+}\\right)^{2}$, whence $c_{i}^{p}=0,1 \\leq i \\leq s$. This implies that the coefficients $c_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ are all zero.\n\nIt remains to prove the claim. Define quotient Hopf algebras of $H_{\\text {red }}$ and of $H$ by\n\n$$\nK:=H_{\\mathrm{red}} /\\left(H_{\\mathrm{red}}^{p}\\right)^{*} H_{\\mathrm{red}}, \\quad J:=H /\\left(H^{p}\\right)^{*} H\n$$\n\nNotice that $K$ is a quotient Hopf algebra of $J$, and let $\\mathfrak{a}$ be such that $J / \\mathfrak{a}=K$. The isomorphisms $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha^{p}$ induce a counit-preserving $K$-colinear algebra-isomorphism\n\n$$\nC \\otimes K \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} J\n$$\n\nfrom which we see $C=J^{\\alpha \\alpha K}$ and $C^{+} J=\\mathfrak{a}$. Construct\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gr} J=\\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\mathfrak{a}^{n} / \\mathfrak{a}^{n+1}\n$$\n\nThis is a commutative graded Hopf algebra with neutral component $(\\operatorname{gr} J)(0)=K$. The last isomorphism induces a $K$-colinear isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gr} C \\otimes K \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} \\operatorname{gr} J\n$$\n\nof graded algebras over $\\operatorname{gr} C$. It follows that $\\operatorname{gr} C$ turns into a graded Hopf algebra which is naturally isomorphic to the quotient graded Hopf algebra\n\n$$\n(\\operatorname{gr} J) / K^{+}(\\operatorname{gr} J)\n$$\n\nof $\\operatorname{gr} J$. This has the properties: (i) $(\\operatorname{gr} C)(0)=k$, (ii) $\\operatorname{gr} C$ is generated by $(\\operatorname{gr} C)(1)$, (iii) the $p$-th power of every element of $(\\operatorname{gr} C)(1)$, that is necessarily a primitive element by (i), is zero. Hence we have a graded Hopf algebra surjection\n\n$$\nk\\left[T_{1}, \\cdots, T_{m}\\right] /\\left(T_{1}^{p}, \\cdots, T_{m}^{p}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{gr} C\n$$\n\nwhich is isomorphic in degree 1 . Here the $T_{i}$ are supposed to be primitive elements of degree 1. All the primitive elements of the source are of degree 1 , and they map isomorphically into $\\operatorname{gr} C$. It follows by [22, Lemma 11.0.1] that the surjection above is injective, and is thus isomorphic, as desired.",

Sample computations of $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)$ \n\nThis section is devoted to sample computations of the $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)$ which was the main subject of the argument proving Theorem 1.2 (2). We thus work in Vec, and let $H$ be a Hopf algebra over a field $k$, as in the preceding section.\n4.1. Augmented cleft extensions. We review from [14] a trick of the computation, modifying it into the commutative situation. Here, char $k$ may be arbitrary.\n\nFix a non-zero algebra $R$. Let $A=\\left(A, \\rho_{A}\\right)$ be an $H$-cleft extension [20, Definition 7.2.1] over $R$. Thus, $A$ is an $H$-comodule algebra such that\n\n$$\nR=A^{\\omega_{1} H}(:=\\{x \\in A \\mid \\rho(x)=x \\otimes 1\\})\n$$\n\nand there exists an $H$-colinear map $\\phi: H \\rightarrow A$ which is invertible with respect to the convolution product.

We have an $R$-linear and $H$-colinear isomorphism,\n\n$$\nR \\otimes H \\rightarrow A, \\quad x \\otimes h \\mapsto x \\phi(h)\n$$\n\nThis turns into an $H$-colinear $R$-algebra isomorphism, if we regard the source $R \\otimes H$ as the $H$-crossed product $R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H$ which is equipped with the product\n\n$$\n(x \\otimes h)(y \\otimes \\ell):=x y \\sigma\\left(h_{(1)}, \\ell_{(1)}\\right) \\otimes h_{(2)} \\ell_{(2)}, \\quad x, y \\in R, h, \\ell \\in H\n$$\n\ngiven by the (invertible) symmetric Hopf 2-cocycle\n\n$$\n\\sigma: H \\otimes H \\rightarrow R, \\quad \\sigma(h, \\ell):=\\phi\\left(h_{(1)}\\right) \\phi\\left(\\ell_{(1)}\\right) \\phi^{-1}\\left(h_{(2)} \\ell_{(2)}\\right)\n$$\n\nsee [20, Section 7.1, Proposition 7.2.3]. The unit of $R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H$ is $1 \\otimes 1$ by the property $\\phi\\left(1_{H}\\right)=1_{A}$. By saying $\\sigma$ is symmetric, we mean that $\\sigma(h, \\ell)=\\sigma(\\ell, h)$ for all $h, \\ell \\in H$.\n\nSuppose that $R=\\left(R, \\epsilon_{R}\\right)$ is augmented with respect to an algebra map $\\epsilon_{R}: R \\rightarrow$ $k$. We say that $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ is an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $R$, if $A$ is $H$-cleft extension over $R$, and $\\epsilon_{A}: A \\rightarrow k$ is an algebra map extending $\\epsilon_{R}$; the inclusion $R \\hookrightarrow A$ is thus an augmented algebra map. In this case we can and we do choose an invertible $H$-colinear map $\\phi: H \\rightarrow A$ so that\n\n$$\n\\text { (i) } \\phi\\left(1_{H}\\right)=1_{A}, \\quad \\text { (ii) } \\epsilon_{A} \\circ \\phi=\\varepsilon_{H}\n$$\n\nIn this paper we call such a $\\phi$ an $H$-section; it is characterized as a unit-preserving $H$-colinear section of the $H$-colinear extension $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}=\\left(\\epsilon_{A} \\otimes \\operatorname{id}_{H}\\right) \\circ \\rho_{A}: A \\rightarrow H$ of $\\epsilon_{A}$; see (2.6). For (ii), one may replace a unit-preserving $\\phi$ with $h \\mapsto \\epsilon_{A}\\left(\\phi^{-1}\\left(h_{(1)}\\right)\\right) \\phi\\left(h_{(2)}\\right)$, $H \\rightarrow A$. One sees that $R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H$ then turns into an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $R$ with respect to $\\epsilon_{R} \\otimes \\varepsilon_{H}: R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H \\rightarrow k$, which is indeed an algebra map. It is isomorphic to $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ through the isomorphism given by (4.1). Here two augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $R$ are said to be isomorphic, if there exists an $H$-colinear, augmented $R$-algebra morphism (necessarily, isomorphism by [11, Lemma 1.3]) between them.\n\nLemma 4.1. Let $R^{+}:=\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\epsilon_{R}: R \\rightarrow k\\right)$ denote the augmentation ideal, and suppose that it is square-zero, $\\left(R^{+}\\right)^{2}=0$. Then\n\n- the augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $R$, and\n- the Hochschild extensions of $H$ by $R^{+} \\otimes H$ in the category $\\mathrm{Vec}^{H}$ of $H$ comodules\nare in one-to-one correspondence up to isomorphism and equivalence, where $R^{+}$is regarded as a trivial $H$-comodule, and $H$ thus coacts on $R^{+} \\otimes H$ through the right tensor factor.\n\nProof. To an augmented $H$-cleft extension $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ over $R$, there corresponds the Hochschild extension\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow R^{+} \\otimes H \\longrightarrow A \\xrightarrow{\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}} H \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nof $H$ by $R^{+} \\otimes H$ in $\\mathrm{Vec}^{H}$, where $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}$ denotes, as before, the $H$-colinear extension of $\\epsilon_{A}$. To see that this is indeed such an extension, choose an $H$-section, and construct the $H$-crossed product $R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H$ as above. Through the isomorphism given by (4.1), $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}: A \\rightarrow H$ is identified with $\\epsilon_{R} \\otimes \\operatorname{id}_{H}: R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H \\rightarrow H$, whose kernel is $R^{+} \\otimes H$, indeed; one also verifies that the $H$-section, which is identified with $h \\mapsto 1 \\otimes h$, $H \\rightarrow R \\otimes_{\\sigma} H$, is a unit-preserving $H$-colinear section of $\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}$. In addition, if two augmented $H$-cleft extensions, $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ and $\\left(A^{\\prime}, \\epsilon_{A^{\\prime}}\\right)$, over $R$ are isomorphic, we have isomorphic square-zero extensions, $\\left(A, \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A}\\right)$ and $\\left(A^{\\prime}, \\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{A^{\\prime}}\\right)$, of $H$ in $\\mathrm{Vec}^{H}$, whence the corresponding Hochschild extensions are equivalent.\n\nConversely, given a Hochschild extension\n\n$$\n0 \\rightarrow R^{+} \\otimes H \\xrightarrow{i} A \\xrightarrow{p} H \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nof $H$ by $R^{+} \\otimes H$ in $\\mathrm{Vec}^{H}$, one sees that a unit-preserving $H$-colinear section $j$ of $p$ is necessarily invertible (in $\\operatorname{Hom}(H, A)$, since it is so modulo the square-zero ideal $\\operatorname{Hom}\\left(H, R^{+} A\\right)$ ). Moreover, we have $A^{\\mathrm{co} H}=R^{+} \\oplus k=R$, and $\\left(A, \\varepsilon_{H} \\circ p\\right)$ is an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $R$ with an $H$-section $j$. Clearly, mutually equivalent such Hochschild extensions give rise to mutually isomorphic augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $R$.\n\nFor $\\left(A, \\varepsilon_{H} \\circ p\\right)$ as above, the corresponding Hochschild extension is the given one (4.5). Conversely, the Hochschild extension in the form (4.4) gives rise to $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$.\n\nIn view of Proposition 2.5, it follows that the set of all isomorphism classes of the augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $R$ is in one-to-one correspondence with $H_{s}^{2}\\left(H, R^{+}\\right)$. Since we are interested in the case where $R^{+}$is one-dimensional, we choose as $R$ the algebra\n\n$$\nk[\\tau]=k[T] /\\left(T^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nof dual numbers, in which we have set $\\tau:=T \\bmod \\left(T^{2}\\right)$. This is augmented with respect to the natural projection $\\epsilon_{k[\\tau]}: k[\\tau] \\rightarrow k[\\tau] /(\\tau)=k$, and the augmentation ideal $k[\\tau]^{+}=k \\tau$ is one-dimensional, indeed.\n\nFor this $k[\\tau]$ we have the following.\nProposition 4.2 (see [14, Proposition 1.9 (2)]). There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between\n\n- the set of all isomorphism classes of the augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$, and\n- $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)$.\n\nGiven an augmented $H$-cleft extension $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ over $k[\\tau]$, choose an $H$-section $\\phi: H \\rightarrow A$. We have the Hochschild extension given in (4.4), in which $\\overline{\\epsilon_{A}}$ has $\\phi$ as a unit-preserving $H$-colinear section. In view of (2.9) (see the description of the product $m_{\\bar{E}}$ on $H \\otimes H$ ), we see that there uniquely arises a normalized symmetric Hochschild 2-cocycle $s: H \\otimes H \\rightarrow k$ such that\n\n$$\n\\phi(h) \\phi(\\ell)=\\phi(h \\ell)+s\\left(h_{(1)}, \\ell_{(1)}\\right) \\tau \\phi\\left(h_{(2)} \\ell_{(2)}\\right), \\quad h, \\ell \\in H\n$$\n\nThe cohomology class of $s$ in $H_{s}^{2}(H, k)$ corresponds to the isomorphism class of $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$.\n\nRemark 4.3. For non-commutative $H$-comodule algebras, the notion of an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ is defined without any change. The last cited result [12, Proposition 1.9 (2)] tells, in fact, that the one-to-one correspondence given in Proposition 4.2 extends to a one-to-one correspondence between\n\n- the set of all isomorphism classes of those non-commutative augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ which are central, i.e., including $k[\\tau]$ in their centers, and\n- the 2nd Hochschild cohomology $H^{2}(H, k)$ with coefficients in the trivial $H$-module $k$.\n\n4.2. Sample 1: $H$ is an example from [26]. In this subsection we suppose char $k=$ $p>0$, and let $H$ be the Hopf algebra given in [26, Example 1.7], denoted by $\\bar{A}$. Thus, $H$ is, as an algebra, generated by an $\\infty$-sequence of elements, $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{i}, \\cdots$, and is defined by the relations\n\n$$\ny_{1}^{p}=y_{2}^{p^{2}}=\\cdots=y_{i}^{p^{i}}=\\cdots\n$$\n\nThis is indeed an Hopf algebra, in which $y_{i}$ are all primitive, $\\Delta_{H}\\left(y_{i}\\right)=y_{i} \\otimes 1+$ $1 \\otimes y_{i}$. It is shown in the cited example that $H_{\\text {red }}$ is a smooth Hopf algebra, and the projection $H \\rightarrow H_{\\text {red }}$ with nil (but not bounded nil) kernel does not split as an algebra map.\n\nOne sees that $H$ has a linear basis,\n\n$$\ny_{1}^{e_{1}} y_{2}^{e_{2}} \\cdots y_{i}^{e_{i}} \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere the exponents $e_{i}$ range so that\n(i) $e_{1} \\geq 0$, (ii) $0 \\leq e_{i}<p^{i}$ for $i \\geq 2$, and (iii) $e_{i}=0$ for $i \\gg 0$.\n\nProposition 4.4. We have an isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{*}^{2}(H, k) \\simeq k^{\\mathbb{N}}\n$$\n\nof vector spaces, where $k^{N}=\\prod_{i=0}^{\\infty} k$ denotes the direct product of countably infinitely many copies of $k$.\n\nProof. Given an $\\infty$-sequence $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\cdots, c_{i}, \\cdots\\right)$ of scalars $c_{i}(\\in k)$, let $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ denote the $k[\\tau]$-algebra which is generated by $z_{1}, z_{2}, \\cdots, z_{i}, \\cdots$, and is defined by the relations\n\n$$\nz_{i}^{p^{i}}=z_{i+1}^{p^{i+1}}+c_{i} \\tau, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nA simple use of Bergman's Diamond Lemma [3, Section 10.3] shows that $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ has a $k[\\tau]$-free basis,\n\n$$\nz_{1}^{e_{1}} z_{2}^{e_{2}} \\cdots z_{i}^{e_{i}} \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere the exponents $e_{i}$ range just as in (4.7). This $A_{c}$ turns into an $H$-comodule algebra with respect to the coaction $\\rho_{c}: A_{c} \\rightarrow A_{c} \\otimes H$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\rho_{c}\\left(z_{i}\\right)=z_{i} \\otimes 1+1 \\otimes y_{i}, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nEquip $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ with the algebra map $\\epsilon_{\\boldsymbol{c}}: A_{\\boldsymbol{c}} \\rightarrow k$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_{\\boldsymbol{c}}(\\tau)=0 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\epsilon_{\\boldsymbol{c}}\\left(z_{i}\\right)=0, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nDefine a linear map $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}: H \\rightarrow A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}\\left(y_{1}^{e_{1}} y_{2}^{e_{2}} \\cdots y_{i}^{e_{i}} \\cdots\\right)=z_{1}^{e_{1}} z_{2}^{e_{2}} \\cdots z_{i}^{e_{i}} \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere the $e_{i}$ range so as in (4.7). One sees that $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ is $H$-colinear, and it satisfies the conditions (i)-(ii) in (4.3). In particular, it satisfies (i), and is, therefore, invertible by [22, Lemma 9.2.3], since $H$ is irreducible, i.e., $1_{H}$ spans the coradical of $H$. Since the $k[\\tau]$-linear extension\n\n$$\nk[\\tau] \\otimes H \\rightarrow A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}, \\quad x \\otimes a \\mapsto x \\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}(a)\n$$\n\nof $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ is an $H$-colinear isomorphism, we have $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}^{\\omega H}=k[\\tau]$. Thus, $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}=\\left(A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}, \\epsilon_{\\boldsymbol{c}}\\right)$ is an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ with an $H$-section $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$.\n\nClaim. Choose two $\\infty$-sequences $\\boldsymbol{c}$ and $\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\prime}$. If $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}}$ and $A_{\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\prime}}$ are isomorphic as augmented $H$-cleft extensions over $k[\\tau]$, then $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\boldsymbol{c}^{\\prime}$.\n\nIndeed, suppose that $f: A_{e^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow A_{e}$ is an isomorphism. This $f$ decomposes uniquely into a composition\n\n$$\nA_{e^{\\prime}} \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} k[\\tau] \\otimes H \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} A_{e}\n$$\n\nwhere the second isomorphism is (4.10). The first is necessarily in the form\n\n$$\na\\left(\\in A_{e^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(g \\otimes \\mathrm{id}_{H}\\right) \\circ \\rho_{e^{\\prime}}(a)\n$$\n\nwhere $g: A_{e^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow k[\\tau]$ is a $k[\\tau]$-linear map which is unit-preserving and augmented. So, we have $g\\left(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=d_{i} \\tau$ for some $d_{i} \\in k$, and\n\n$$\nf\\left(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=z_{i}+d_{i} \\tau, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere $z_{i}^{\\prime}$ denote the generators of $A_{e^{\\prime}}$ analogous to the $z_{i}$ of $A_{e}$. It follows that\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\left(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)^{p^{i}}-\\left(z_{i+1}^{\\prime}\\right)^{p^{i+1}}\\right)=\\left(z_{i}+d_{i} \\tau\\right)^{p^{i}}-\\left(z_{i+1}+d_{i+1} \\tau\\right)^{p^{i+1}}, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nwhich reduce to $c_{i}^{\\prime} \\tau=c_{i} \\tau$, or $c^{\\prime}=c$. This proves the claim.\nClaim. Every augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ is isomorphic to $A_{e}$ for some $c \\in k^{\\text {H }}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $\\left(A, \\epsilon_{A}\\right)$ be an augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$. Choose an $H$-section $\\phi: H \\rightarrow A$, and set\n\n$$\nw_{i}:=\\phi\\left(y_{i}\\right), \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nNotice $\\epsilon_{A}\\left(w_{i}\\right)=0$. By a simple computation one sees $w_{i}^{p^{i}}-w_{i+1}^{p^{i+1}} \\in A^{\\cos H}=k[\\tau]$, and that this last element is killed by $\\epsilon_{A}$. It follows that\n\n$$\nw_{i}^{p^{i}}-w_{i+1}^{p^{i+1}}=c_{i} \\tau, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\nfor some $c_{i} \\in k$. Set $\\boldsymbol{c}:=\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\cdots, c_{i}, \\cdots\\right)\\left(\\in k^{\\mathbb{H}}\\right)$. Then we see that\n\n$$\nh\\left(z_{i}\\right)=w_{i}, \\quad i=1,2, \\cdots\n$$\n\ndefines an $H$-colinear, augmented $k[\\tau]$-algebra map $h: A_{e} \\rightarrow A$, which is necessarily an isomorphism by [11, Lemma 1.3]. This proves the claim.\n\nFrom the two claims above and Proposition 4.2 we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets in (4.8). To $\\boldsymbol{c}=\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\cdots, c_{i}, \\cdots\\right)$ in $k^{\\mathbb{H}}$, there corresponds the cohomology class of the normalized 2-cocycle $s_{c}: H \\otimes H \\rightarrow k$ which arises from the $H$-section $\\phi_{c}$ through the relation (4.6). It satisfies\n(i) $s\\left(y_{i}, y_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=0$ for $0 \\leq r<p^{i}-1$,\n(ii) $s\\left(y_{i}, y_{i}^{p^{i}-1}\\right)-s\\left(y_{i+1}, y_{i+1}^{p^{i+1}-1}\\right)=c_{i}$,\nwhere $i=1,2, \\cdots$. Notice that $s\\left(y_{i}^{\\prime}, y_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=s\\left(y_{i}, y_{i}^{r+t-1}\\right)$ for any positive integers $r, t$, since the 2-cosycles are naturally identified with the linear maps $S_{H}^{2}\\left(H^{+}\\right) \\rightarrow k$; see the proof of Proposition 2.7. If a 2-cocycle $s$ has the properties (i)-(ii) above, then the corresponding augmented $H$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ is isomorphic to the $A_{e}$, as is seen from the augment proving the last claim. It follows that two 2-cocycles satisfying (i)-(ii) in common are cohomologous to each other. Therefore, we see\n\n$$\ns_{c}+s_{e^{\\prime}} \\sim s_{c+e^{\\prime}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\lambda s_{c} \\sim s_{\\lambda c}, \\lambda \\in k\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sim$ indicates \"cohomologous\". This proves that the obtained one-to-one correspondence is indeed a linear isomorphism.\n\n4.3. Sample 2: $H$ is a group algebra $k G$. We continue to suppose char $k=p>$ 0 . Recall from Proposition 3.3 that the restriction map $H_{s}^{2}(H, k) \\rightarrow H_{s}^{2}(J, k)$ is surjective, and this follows from the result proved under the assumption that $H$ is of finite type. Here we wish to verify the result directly by explicit computations, when $H=k G$ is a finite-type commutative group algebra and $J$ is its Hopf (indeed, group) subalgebra.\n\nThe symmetric 2nd Hochschild cohomology $H_{s}^{2}(k G, k)$ (resp., the 2nd Hochschild cohomology $H^{2}(k G, k)$ ) is linearly isomorphic to the symmetric part of the 2 nd group cohomology $H^{2}(G, k)_{\\text {sym }}$ (resp., the full 2nd group cohomology $H^{2}(G, k)$ ). Therefore, the computational results below may be standard, or even known, for experts in group theory. But our method of computations, which uses augmented cleft extensions possessing linear structure and depends on the Diamond Lemma, would be useful.\n\nLet $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group. Decompose $G$ into the direct sum $G=\\bigoplus_{\\alpha} G_{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ runs through $\\{\\infty$, all pimes $\\}$, of the torsion-free part $G_{\\infty}$ and the $t$-primary parts $G_{t}$ for primes $t$. We have\n\n$$\nH_{s}^{2}(k G, k)=\\bigoplus_{\\alpha} H_{s}^{2}\\left(k G_{\\alpha}, k\\right), \\text { and } H_{s}^{2}\\left(k G_{\\alpha}, k\\right)=0 \\text { if } \\alpha \\neq p\n$$\n\nin view that $k G_{\\alpha}$ is smooth unless $\\alpha=p$. Therefore, we may and we do suppose that $G$ is a non-trivial finite abelian $p$-group. We present the operation on $G$ by addition. Let $o(g)$ denote the order of $g \\in G$, which is thus some power of $p$.\n\nChoose a system $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{q}$ of non-zero generators of $G$ such that\n\n$$\nG=\\mathbb{Z} x_{1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} x_{q}\n$$\n\nThe number $q$ does not depend of choice of the systems.\nProposition 4.5. We have a linear isomorphism\n\n$$\nH_{s}^{2}(k G, k) \\simeq k^{q}\n$$\n\nProof. Given an element $\\boldsymbol{a}=\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{q}\\right)$ of $k^{q}$, define $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$ to be the $k[\\tau]$-algebra which is generated by $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{q}$, and is defined by the relation\n\n$$\nz_{i}^{o\\left(x_{i}\\right)}=1+a_{i} \\tau, \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq q\n$$\n\nBy the Diamond Lemma [3, Section 10.3], this has a $k[\\tau]$-free basis,\n\n$$\nz_{1}^{n_{1}} \\ldots z_{q}^{n_{q}}, \\quad 1 \\leq n_{i}<o\\left(x_{i}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq q\n$$\n\nEquipped with the algebra map $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\rightarrow k$ determined by $\\tau \\mapsto 0$ and $z_{i} \\mapsto 1,1 \\leq$ $i \\leq q, \\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$ turns into an augmented $k G$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ with respect to the coaction given by\n\n$$\n\\rho_{\\boldsymbol{a}}: \\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\otimes k G, \\quad \\rho_{\\boldsymbol{a}}\\left(z_{i}\\right)=z_{i} \\otimes x_{i}, 1 \\leq i \\leq q\n$$\n\nIndeed, a $k G$-section is given by the linear map $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{a}}: k G \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$ which sends each element $x_{1}^{n_{1}} \\ldots x_{q}^{n_{q}}$ of $G$, where $1 \\leq n_{i}<o\\left(x_{i}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq q$, to the $k[\\tau]$-free basis element $z_{1}^{n_{1}} \\ldots z_{q}^{n_{q}}$ of $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$. The associated (see (4.6)) symmetric Hochschild 2 -cocyle $s: k G \\otimes k G \\rightarrow k$ is seen to have the properties\n(i) $s\\left(x_{i}, x_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=0$ for $0 \\leq t<o\\left(x_{i}\\right)-1$,\n(ii) $s\\left(x_{i}, x_{i}^{o\\left(x_{i}\\right)-1}\\right)=a_{i}$,\n\nwhere $1 \\leq i \\leq q$. An argument analogous to the one of proving Proposition 4.4 shows that every augmented cleft $k G$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ is isomorphic to some $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{a}\\left(\\in k^{q}\\right)$ is uniquely determined, and the resulting one-to-one correspondence $H_{s}^{2}(k G, k) \\simeq k^{q}$ is a linear isomorphism.\n\nLet $F$ be a non-trivial subgroup of $G$. Choose a system $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{r}$ of non-zero generators of $F$ such that\n\n$$\nF=\\mathbb{Z} y_{1} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} y_{r}\n$$\n\nsimilar to (4.12). Then one can present uniquely the elements $y_{i}$ so that\n\n$$\ny_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{q} c_{i j} x_{j}, \\quad 0 \\leq c_{i j}<o\\left(x_{j}\\right), c_{i j} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\nwhere $1 \\leq i \\leq r$. Note that\n\n$$\no\\left(y_{i}\\right)=\\max \\left\\{o\\left(c_{i j} x_{j}\\right) \\mid 1 \\leq j \\leq q\\right\\}\n$$\n\nLemma 4.6. The two systems of the generators can be re-chosen so that\n(i) $c_{i j}=0$ if $i>j$;\n(ii) $o\\left(y_{i}\\right)=o\\left(c_{i i} x_{i}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq r$;\n(iii) $o\\left(y_{1}\\right) \\geq \\cdots \\geq o\\left(y_{r}\\right)$.\n\nThis is easily proved by induction on $q$. As for $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{q}$, it suffices to re-number them without re-choosing the elements.\n\nRemark 4.7. By (i) we necessarily have $r \\leq q$. By (ii), for each $1 \\leq i \\leq q, o\\left(y_{i}\\right)$ divides $o\\left(x_{i}\\right)$, and $c_{i i}$ is a multiple of $o\\left(x_{i}\\right) / o\\left(y_{i}\\right)$ by some non-zero integer, say, $m_{i}$ that is prime to $p$. We can and we do re-choose $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{r}$ so that $m_{i}=1$, or namely,\n(iv) $c_{i i}=o\\left(x_{i}\\right) / o\\left(y_{i}\\right), \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq r$.\n\nWe have only to replace each $y_{i}$ with $\\ell_{i} y_{i}$, where $\\ell_{i}$ is an integer such that $\\ell_{i} m_{i} \\equiv 1$ $\\bmod o\\left(x_{i}\\right)$.\n\nProposition 4.8. The restriction map\n\n$$\n\\text { res }: H_{s}^{2}(k G, k) \\rightarrow H_{s}^{2}(k F, k)\n$$\n\nis surjective.\nProof. Recall from the proof of Proposition 4.5 that every augmented $k G$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ is in the form $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{a} \\in k^{q}$. It has the $k G$-section $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{a}}: k G \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$. Define an augmented subalgebra of $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$ by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{B}:=\\rho_{\\boldsymbol{a}}^{-1}\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\otimes k F\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$ denotes the coaction (4.14) on $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}$. As a general fact, this is a $k F$ comodule algebra with respect to the coaction $\\rho_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\mid \\mathcal{B}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{B}$ is the augmented $k F$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$, with a $k F$-section $\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\mid k F: k F \\rightarrow \\mathcal{B}$. Clearly, the assignment $\\mathcal{A}_{\\boldsymbol{a}} \\mapsto \\mathcal{B}$ is identified with the restriction of their associated (Hopf, and also Hochschild) 2-cocycles.\n\nFor $1 \\leq i \\leq r$, let\n\n$$\nw_{i}:=\\phi_{\\boldsymbol{a}}\\left(y_{i}\\right)=z_{i}^{\\ell_{i \\mathrm{q}}} z_{i+1}^{\\ell_{i+1}} \\ldots z_{q}^{\\ell_{i q}^{\\ell_{q}}}(\\in \\mathcal{B})\n$$\n\nWe have an isomorphism $H_{2}^{2}(k F, k) \\simeq k^{r}$ which is analogous to (4.13), and is now determined by the system $y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{r}$ of generators. It sends the $\\mathcal{B}$, naturally identified with a cohomology class, to the element $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{r}\\right)$ of $k^{r}$ determined by\n\n$$\nw_{i}^{o\\left(y_{i}\\right)}=1+b_{i} \\tau, \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq r\n$$\n\nTo present $\\boldsymbol{b}$ explicitly, define an $r \\times q$ matrix $T=\\left(t_{i j}\\right)$ by\n\n$$\nt_{i j}= \\begin{cases}c_{i j} \\frac{o\\left(y_{i}\\right)}{o\\left(x_{i}\\right)}, & \\text { if } i \\leq j \\\\ 0, & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNotice that $T$ is an integral matrix such that the $r \\times r$ submatrix $T^{\\prime}$ of $T$ consisting of the first $r$ columns is an upper triangular with diagonal entries 1 by (iv), whence it has an integral inverse matrix. We see\n\n$$\n\\left(z_{j}^{c_{i j}}\\right)^{o\\left(y_{i}\\right)}=1+t_{i j} a_{j} \\tau, \\quad i \\leq j\n$$\n\nwhence\n\n$$\nw_{i}^{o\\left(y_{i}\\right)}=1+\\sum_{j=1}^{q} t_{i j} a_{j} \\tau, \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq r\n$$\n\nAs an additional remark, in case $i<j$, the integer $t_{i j}$ is divided by $p$ if and only if $o\\left(y_{i}\\right)>o\\left(c_{i j} x_{j}\\right)$, whence the terms $t_{i j} a_{j} \\tau$ in $j$ such that $o\\left(y_{i}\\right)>o\\left(c_{i j} x_{j}\\right)$ are zero. Now, from (4.16)-(4.17) we see ${ }^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{b}=T^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{a}$. It follows that the restriction map in question is identified, through the relevant isomorphisms, with the linear map $k^{q} \\rightarrow k^{r}$ (between vector spaces of column vectors) given by the matrix $T$ with entries specialized to $k$. Since the matrix has full rank by the invertibility of $T^{\\prime}$, the last linear map and thus the restriction map are surjective.\n\nNotice from (4.11) that the conclusion of Proposition 4.8 holds, more generally, when $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, and $F$ is its subgroup.\n\nRecall Remark 4.3, and notice the restriction map extends to that\n\n$$\n\\text { res : } H^{2}(k G, k) \\rightarrow H^{2}(k F, k)\n$$\n\nof (non-symmetric) 2nd Hochschild cohomologies. To conclude this section we show that this extended restriction map can be non-surjective.\n\nProposition 4.9. The extended restriction map above is not surjective under the situation where $G=\\mathbb{Z} x_{1} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} x_{2}$ is a finite group of order $p^{3}$ and $F=\\mathbb{Z} y_{1} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} y_{2}$ is its subgroup of order $p^{2}$ such that\n\n$$\no\\left(x_{1}\\right)=p^{2}, \\quad o\\left(x_{2}\\right)=p, \\quad y_{1}=p x_{1}, \\quad y_{2}=x_{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Choose arbitrarily an element $b \\in k$, and let $B_{b}$ be the non-commutative $k[\\tau]$-algebra which is generated by $w_{1}, w_{2}$, and is defined by the relations\n\n$$\nw_{1}^{p}=w_{2}^{p}=1, \\quad w_{2} w_{1}=(1+b \\tau) w_{1} w_{2}\n$$\n\nThen we see by using the Diamond Lemma that $B_{b}$ has a $k[\\tau]$-free basis, $w_{1}^{n_{1}} w_{2}^{n_{2}}$, where $0 \\leq n_{i}<p, i=1,2$, and is indeed a non-commutative augmented, central $k F$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$ (see Remark 4.3) with respect to the algebra map $B_{b} \\rightarrow$ $k, \\tau \\mapsto 0, w_{i} \\mapsto 1$ and the coaction $B_{b} \\rightarrow B_{b} \\otimes k F, w_{i} \\mapsto w_{i} \\otimes y_{i}$, where $i=$ 1,2. Suppose that this $B_{b}$ arises by restriction from a non-commutative augmented,\n\ncentral $k G$-cleft extension, say, $A$ over $k[\\tau]$. Choose a $k G$-section $\\phi: k G \\rightarrow A$, and let $z_{1}:=\\phi\\left(x_{1}\\right), z_{2}:=\\phi\\left(x_{2}\\right)$. Then we see that $A$ includes $B_{b}$ so that\n\n$$\nz_{1}^{p}=\\left(1+c_{1} \\tau\\right) w_{1}, \\quad z_{2}=\\left(1+c_{2} \\tau\\right) w_{2}\n$$\n\nfor some $c_{1}, c_{2} \\in k$. But, since $z_{2} z_{1}=\\left(1+c_{3} \\tau\\right) z_{1} z_{2}$ for some $c_{3} \\in k$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(1+\\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\\right) \\tau\\right) w_{2} w_{1} & =z_{2} z_{1}^{p}=\\left(1+c_{3} \\tau\\right)^{p} z_{1}^{p} z_{2} \\\\\n& =z_{1}^{p} z_{2}=\\left(1+\\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\\right) \\tau\\right) w_{1} w_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhence we must have $b=0$. Therefore, if $b \\neq 0$, then $B_{b}$ does not arise from any non-commutative augmented, central $k G$-cleft extension over $k[\\tau]$; this shows the desired non-surjectivity.",

      "text": "# 5. Proof of Theorem 1.4 \n\nThis section is divided into two subsections, according to the two parts of the theorem.\n5.1. Proof of Part 1, characteristic zero case. We work in sVec. We do not assume char $k=0$ until explicitly mentioned. Recall that every object $X$ of sVec decomposes uniquely into the direct sum $X=X_{0} \\oplus X_{1}$ of the even component $X_{0}$ and the odd component $X_{1}$. The objects $X$ such that $X=X_{0}$ form a symmetric monoidal full subcategory of sVec isomorphic to sVec.\n\nLet $H$ be a Hopf algebra in sVec, and let $\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$ denote the corresponding affine group scheme. There are naturally associated\n\n$$\n\\bar{H}:=H / H_{1} H \\quad \\text { and } \\quad W^{H}:=\\left(T_{e}^{*}(\\mathfrak{G})\\right)_{1}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\bar{H}=H / H_{1} H$ denotes the quotient of $H$ divided by the Hopf ideal generated by the odd component $H_{1}$ of $H$, which is characterized as the largest ordinary quotient Hopf algebra of $H$. On the other hand, $W^{H}=\\left(T_{e}^{*}(\\mathfrak{G})\\right)_{1}$ denotes the odd component of the cotangent super-vector space $T_{e}^{*}(\\mathfrak{G})=H^{+} /\\left(H^{+}\\right)^{2}$ of $\\mathfrak{G}$ at the identity $e$. By Theorem 4.5 of [13] (proved when char $k \\neq 2$ ) we have an algebra isomorphism\n\n$$\nH \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} \\wedge\\left(W^{H}\\right) \\otimes \\bar{H}\n$$\n\nin sVec, which can be chosen so as to be counit-preserving and $\\bar{H}$-colinear, in addition; refer to [15, Remark 5.9] for a more acceptable proof. The cited proofs prove, in fact, the opposite-sided version of the isomorphism above. In characteristic char $k=2$ (recall that then, the commutativity additionally requires every odd element to be square-free), the isomorphism follows from [18, Theorem 5.7], if one assumes that $H$ is of finite type. It can be generalized, removing the assumption, by following the above cited proofs.\n\nLet $R$ be an algebra in sVec with an ideal $I$. Since every odd element of $I$ is square-zero, it follows that $I$ is nil if and only if the even component $I_{0}$ of $I$ is a nil ideal of the ordinary algebra $R_{0}$.\n\nIn view of (5.2), it suffices for our purpose to prove that an (ordinary) algebra $\\operatorname{map} \\bar{H} \\rightarrow(R / I)_{0}=R_{0} / I_{0}$ can lift to some algebra map $\\bar{H} \\rightarrow R_{0}$, since an algebra morphism $\\wedge\\left(W^{H}\\right) \\rightarrow R / I$, being restricted to a linear map $W^{H} \\rightarrow(R / I)_{1}$ that can lift to some linear map $W^{H} \\rightarrow R_{1}$, can lift to the algebra morphism $\\wedge\\left(W^{H}\\right) \\rightarrow R$ which uniquely extends the last linear map. A conclusion is that we may (and we do) work in Vec.\n\nNow, assume char $k=0$. Given an (ordinary) algebra $R$ with a nil ideal $I$, an (ordinary) Hopf algebra $H$ and an algebra map $f: H \\rightarrow R / I$, we have the same pull-back diagram as (2.12), in which $\\varpi: T \\rightarrow H$ is now an algebra surjection with nil kernel. It suffices to prove that this $\\varpi$ has a section, whose composition with $\\omega$ is seen to be a desired lift.\n\nConsider a pair $(J, s)$ of a Hopf subalgebra $J$ of $H$, and a section $s: J \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}(J)$, by which we mean a section of the algebra surjection $\\left.\\varpi\\right|_{\\varpi^{-1}(J)}: \\varpi^{-1}(J) \\rightarrow J$. An example is the trivial $\\left(k, \\mathrm{id}_{k}\\right)$. Introduce a natural order to the (non-empty) set of all those pairs, by defining $\\left(J_{1}, s_{1}\\right) \\leq\\left(J_{2}, s_{2}\\right)$ if $J_{1} \\subset J_{2}$ and $s_{1}=\\left.s_{2}\\right|_{J_{1}}$. By Zorn's Lemma we have a maximal pair, say, $\\left(J_{\\max }, s_{\\max }\\right)$. It remains to prove $J_{\\max }=H$. On the contrary we assume $J_{\\max } \\varsubsetneqq H$, and wish to show that there exists a pair properly greater than $\\left(J_{\\max }, s_{\\max }\\right)$; the contradiction implies the desired equality. One can choose a finite-type Hopf subalgebra $K$ of $H$ which is not included in $J_{\\text {max }}$. Define $J:=J_{\\max } \\cap K$. Then, $J$ is a Hopf subalgebra of $K$, which is of finite type by [23, Corollary 3.11]. One point of the present proof is: we have a canonical isomorphism\n\n$$\nJ_{\\max } \\otimes_{J} K \\simeq J_{\\max } K, \\quad x \\otimes_{K} y \\mapsto x y\n$$\n\nby [25, Proposition 6]. Notice that $s_{\\max }_{J}: J \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}(J)$ is a section.\nWe claim that this $s_{\\max } J_{J}$ extends to some section $K \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}(K)$. This can be restated so that $s_{\\max } J_{J}$ extends to some $J$-algebra section $K \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}(K)$, with $\\varpi^{-1}(K)$ regarded as a $J$-algebra through $\\left.s_{\\max }\\right|_{J}$. Since $K$ is of finite type as a $J$-algebra, there exists a finite-type $J$-subalgebra, say, $A$ of $\\varpi^{-1}(K)$ such that $\\left.\\varpi\\right|_{A}: A \\rightarrow K$ maps onto $K$. Let $Q:=K / J^{+} K$ be the quotient Hopf algebra of $K$ which corresponds to $J$. We have a $K$-algebra isomorphism similar to (3.5),\n\n$$\nK \\otimes_{J} K \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} K \\otimes Q, \\quad x \\otimes_{K} y \\mapsto x y_{(1)} \\otimes y_{(2)} \\bmod \\left(J^{+} K\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the source is regarded as a $K$-algebra through $K=K \\otimes_{J} J \\hookrightarrow K \\otimes_{J} K$. Another point of the proof is: the Hopf algebra $Q$ is smooth since char $k=0$; see Theorem 1.2 (1). By the base change property of smoothness, $K \\otimes_{J} K(=K \\otimes Q)$ is smooth over $K$, i.e., smooth in the category of $K$-algebras. It follows by [17, Proposition 5.1] that $K$ is smooth (indeed, $Q$-smooth) over $J$. Notice that the kernel of $\\left.\\varpi\\right|_{A}: A \\rightarrow K$ is finitely generated, whence it is a nilpotent ideal. Then we see that there exists a desired $J$-algebra section, say, $t: K \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}(K)$ which maps into $A$.\n\nIn view of (5.3), we see that $s_{\\max }$ and $t$ amount to a section\n\n$$\nJ_{\\max } K \\rightarrow \\varpi^{-1}\\left(J_{\\max } K\\right), \\quad x y \\mapsto s_{\\max }(x) t(y)\n$$\n\nwhich together with $J_{\\max } K$ form a pair properly greater than $\\left(J_{\\max }, s_{\\max }\\right)$. This completes the proof of Part 1 of the theorem.\n5.2. Proof of Part 2, positive characteristic case. Assume char $k=p>0$. Let $\\mathscr{C}$ be sVec or $\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$. Recall from Section 1.4 the additional assumption posed when $\\mathscr{C}=\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$ that $p \\geq 5$, and $k$ is algebraically closed.\n\nSuppose $\\mathscr{C}=\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$. Let us recall from Ostrik [21] and Venkatesh [28] some basics on it. This is a semisimple abelian category which contains precisely $p-$ 1 simple objects including the unit object 1. (Compare with the fact that sVec contains precisely two simples, i.e., the even and the odd 1-dimensional supervector spaces.) By [28, Lemma 2.20] the symmetric $p$-th power $S^{p}(L)$ of every\n\nsimple object $L$ other than $\\mathbf{1}$ equals zero. Given an object $X$ of $\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$, let $X_{0}$ (resp., $X_{\\neq 0}$ ) denote the sub-object of $X$ which is the sum of all simple sub-objects that are (resp., are not) isomorphic to $\\mathbf{1}$. Then we have $X=X_{0} \\oplus X_{\\neq 0}$. All the objects $X$ such that $X=X_{0}$ (resp., $X$ includes only simples that are isomorphic to either $\\mathbf{1}$ or another specific one, the $L_{p-1}$ in [21], [28]) form a symmetric monoidal full subcategory of $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$ which is isomorphic to Vec (resp., sVec).\n\nGiven an algebra $R$ in $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$ with an ideal $I, R_{0}$ is an ordinary subalgebra of $R$, and $I_{0}$ is an ideal of $R_{0}$. We see that $I$ is bounded nil if and only if $I_{0}$ is so. This is true for algebras and their ideals in sVec, as well.\n\nLet us be given a Hopf algebra $H$ in $\\operatorname{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$, and the corresponding affine group scheme $\\mathscr{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$. The analogous objects to those in (5.1) are\n\n$$\n\\bar{H}:=H / H_{\\neq 0} H \\quad \\text { and } \\quad W^{H}:=\\left(T_{e}^{*}(\\mathfrak{G})\\right)_{\\neq 0}\n$$\n\nThe former $\\bar{H}$ is an ordinary Hopf algebra. Theorem 5.1 of [15] proves that there is a (counit-preserving $\\bar{H}$-colinear) algebra isomorphism\n\n$$\nH \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} S\\left(W^{H}\\right) \\otimes \\bar{H}\n$$\n\nwhich is analogous to (5.5). Here, $S\\left(W^{H}\\right)$ denotes the symmetric algebra on $W^{H}$; it is an analogue of the exterior algebra $\\wedge\\left(W^{H}\\right)$ in sVec, which is, indeed, the symmetric algebra in the category. We remark that the cited theorem proves, in fact, the opposite-sided version of the isomorphism above, replacing $S\\left(W^{H}\\right)$ with another isomorphic algebra $\\Gamma\\left(W^{H}\\right)$.\n\nCorollary 1.6 of [26] proves that if $H$ is a Hopf algebra in Vec for which Condition (f) is satisfied, or namely, the Frobenius map is injective, then it has the stronger smoothness as claimed. Since such an $H$ is smooth by Theorem 1.2 (2), the desired result holds for ordinary Hopf algebras. This, together with (5.2), (5.6), proves the desired result in general, as is seen from the argument of the fourth paragraph of the last subsection.",

      "text": "# APPENDix A. A simple proof of triviality of torsors over an algebraically Closed field \n\nIn this appendix we work in Vec, except in Remark A.2.\nWibmer [31] gave an elementary proof of the fact that a torsor under an affine group scheme over an algebraically closed field is necessarily trivial; this fact is the same as the uniqueness of the so-called Tannakian groups over a field such as above. We give a (hopefully) simpler proof of the triviality of torsors, which uses the same idea as was used to prove Theorem 1.4 (1); see Section 5.1.\n\nSuppose that $k$ is an arbitrary field, and $\\mathscr{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$ is an affine group scheme represented by a Hopf algebra $H$. Every torsor under $\\mathscr{G}$ is necessarily affine, and it is uniquely represented by an $H$-comodule algebra $A$, which is a twisted form of $H$, i.e., $A$ becomes isomorphic to $H$ after some base field extension. Such an $A$ is precisely what is called an $H$-Galois extension over $k$; it is by definition a non-zero $H$-comodule algebra $A=\\left(A, \\rho_{A}\\right)$ such that the $A$-linear extension\n\n$$\nA \\otimes A \\rightarrow A \\otimes H, \\quad a \\otimes b \\mapsto a \\rho_{A}(b)\n$$\n\nof the structure map $\\rho_{A}: A \\rightarrow A \\otimes H$ is an isomorphism (of $H$-comodule algebras); the isomorphism, specialized through an algebra map $A \\rightarrow L$ to some extension field $L$ of $k$, shows that $A$ is a twisted form of $H$, and conversely, for such a twisted\n\nform, the map above is isomorphic since it turns so after some base field extension. Therefore, the above-mentioned triviality is translated as follows, and in fact, we are going to give a simple proof of this.\nProposition A.1. Suppose that $k$ is an algebraically closed field, and let $H$ be a Hopf algebra. Then an H-Galois extension over $k$ is necessarily trivial, i.e., it is isomorphic to $H$ as an $H$-comodule algebra.\nProof. Suppose that $A=\\left(A, \\rho_{A}\\right)$ is an $H$-Galois extension over $k$. From (A.1) notice\n\n$$\nk=A^{\\cos H}(:=\\left\\{x \\in A \\mid \\rho_{A}(x)=x \\otimes 1\\right\\})\n$$\n\nWe may suppose that $H$ is not of finite type, since $A$ is trivial by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, in case $H$ is of finite type; see [29, Section 18.3]. Given a Hopf subalgebra $J$ of $H$, define\n\n$$\nA_{J}:=\\rho_{A}^{-1}(A \\otimes J)\n$$\n\nThis turns naturally into a $J$-comodule algebra, and is, in fact, a $J$-Galois extension over $k$. For the isomorphism (A.1) restricts to an isomorphism $A \\otimes A_{J} \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} A \\otimes J$ of $J$-comodule algebras, which shows by specialization that $A_{J}$ is a twisted form of $J$. In particular, we have $A_{J}^{\\cos J}=k$; see (A.2). Suppose that we are given an $H$-colinear algebra map $f: J \\rightarrow A$. Then we see that $f$ maps into $A_{J}$, and there results a $J$-colinear algebra map $J \\rightarrow A_{J}$, through which $A_{J}$ is a $J$-module, and is, moreover, a $J$-Hopf module [22, Section 4.1]. It follows by the Hopf-module Theorem [22, Theorem 4.1.1] that the resulting is, in fact, an isomorphism\n\n$$\nJ=A_{J}^{\\cos J} \\otimes J \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} A_{J}\n$$\n\nof $J$-comodule algebras; see the proof of Proposition 3.4.\nAnalogously to the proof of Theorem 1.4 (1), let us consider a pair $(J, f)$ of a Hopf subalgebra $J$ of $H$ and an $H$-colinear algebra map $f: J \\rightarrow A$. A trivial example is $(k, k \\hookrightarrow A)$. The set of all those pairs, into which we introduce the natural order defined by $\\left(J_{1}, f_{1}\\right) \\leq\\left(J_{2}, f_{2}\\right)$ if $J_{1} \\subset J_{2}$ and $f_{1}=f_{2} \\mid J_{1}$, has a maximal pair, $\\left(J_{\\max }, f_{\\max }\\right)$, by Zorn's Lemma. As is seen from the cited proof, it remains to prove the following.\nClaim. Given finite-type Hopf subalgebras $J$ and $K$ of $H$ such that $J \\subset K$, every $H$-colinear algebra map $J \\rightarrow A$ can extend to such a map $K \\rightarrow A$.\n\nIndeed, in order to see $J_{\\max }=H$, which will complete the proof, we suppose on the contrary that $J_{\\max } \\varsubsetneqq H$, and choose arbitrarily a finite-type Hopf subalgebra $K$ of $H$ which is not included in $J_{\\max }$. The claim applied to $J_{\\max } \\cap K$ and $K$ gives an $H$-colinear algebra map from $J_{\\max } K\\left(=J_{\\max } \\otimes_{J_{\\max } \\cap K} K\\right.$, see (5.3)) to $H$ which extends $f_{\\max }$; the extended map, paired with $J_{\\max } K$, gives a pair properly greater than $\\left(J_{\\max }, f_{\\max }\\right)$. This contradiction shows the desired equality.\n\nTo prove the claim let us be given an $H$-colinear algebra map $f: J \\rightarrow A$, which results in an isomorphism $J \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} A_{J}$ of $J$-comodule algebras such as in (A.4). As was seen in the first paragraph of the proof, one can choose an isomorphism $K \\xrightarrow{\\simeq} A_{K}$ of $K$-comodule algebras, which we identify with the identity map $\\operatorname{id}_{K}$ of $K$. Then $f$ is identified with an automorphism $f: J \\xrightarrow{\\sim} J\\left(=\\Delta_{K}^{-1}(K \\otimes J)\\right.$, see (A.3)) of the $J$-comodule algebra $J$, which is necessarily in the form\n\n$$\nf: J \\rightarrow J, \\quad f(x)=g\\left(x_{(1)}\\right) x_{(2)}\n$$\n\nwhere $g=\\varepsilon_{J} \\circ f$, or $f=\\bar{g}$ in the notation of (2.6). It remains to prove that this can extend to some automorphism $f^{\\prime}: K \\xrightarrow{\\circ} K$ of the $K$-comodule algebra $K$. Since such an $f^{\\prime}$ is necessarily in the form $f^{\\prime}(x)=g^{\\prime}\\left(x_{(1)}\\right) x_{(2)}$ with $g^{\\prime}: K \\rightarrow k$ an algebra map, we need to prove that the algebra map $g: J \\rightarrow k$ can extend to an algebra map $K \\rightarrow k$. Indeed, this is possible by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz since $K$ is faithfully flat over $J$ by [23, Theorem 3.1].\n\nRemark A.2. Suppose $\\mathscr{C}=\\mathrm{sVec}$ or $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p}^{\\text {ind }}$, see (1.3). The result just proven holds more generally in $\\mathscr{C}$. To see this, suppose that $H$ is a Hopf algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$, and let $\\mathfrak{G}=\\operatorname{Spec} H$ be the corresponding affine group scheme. Since every nonzero algebra in $\\mathscr{C}$ has a field as a non-zero quotient ordinary algebra, it follows that in $\\mathscr{C}$, an $H$-Galois extension over the unit object $\\mathbf{1}$ is the same as a twisted form of the $H$-comodule algebra $H$. Those forms are classified by the 1st Amitsur cohomology $H^{1}(\\mathbf{1}, \\mathfrak{G})_{\\mathscr{C}}$ constructed in $\\mathscr{C}$. But this is naturally identified with the ordinary $H^{1}\\left(k, \\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}\\right)$, or namely, we have\n\n$$\nH^{1}(\\mathbf{1}, \\mathfrak{G})_{\\mathscr{C}}=H^{1}\\left(k, \\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}=\\operatorname{Spec} \\bar{H}$ is the affine group scheme corresponding to the ordinary Hopf algebra $\\bar{H}$ (see (5.1), (5.5)) associated with $H$. For the complex for computing $H^{1}(\\mathbf{1}, \\mathfrak{G})_{\\mathscr{C}}$, which is in the form\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{G}(L) \\rightrightarrows \\mathfrak{G}(L \\otimes L) \\rightrightarrows \\mathfrak{G}(L \\otimes L \\otimes L)\n$$\n\nis naturally identified with the one\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}(L) \\rightrightarrows \\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}(L \\otimes L) \\rightrightarrows \\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}(L \\otimes L \\otimes L)\n$$\n\nfor computing $H^{1}\\left(k, \\mathfrak{G}_{\\mathrm{ev}}\\right)$, where $L$ ranges through all extension-fields of $k$; see [17, Section 5.2]. Therefore, the proved Proposition A. 1 implies the generalized result in the categories.\n\nFunding The second-named author is supported by Japan Society of Promotion of Science, KAKENHI, Grant Numbers 23K03027.",
