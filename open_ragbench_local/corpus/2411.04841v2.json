A firm offers a contract to incentivise a worker protected by limited liability. A regulator chooses the set of permissible contracts to (i) improve efficiency and (ii) protect the worker. The regulator does not know the worker's actions and the firm's costs and evaluates regulations by their worst-case regret. The regretminimising regulation imposes a minimum piece rate compensation for the worker: it allows all contracts above a minimum linear contract. The slope of the minimum contract balances the worker's protection and the necessary flexibility for incentive provision.\n\n\nJEL classification codes: D82, D86, D33.\nKeywords: Regulation; Minmax Regret; Contracts; Minimum Wage.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *We thank Gabriel Carroll, Piotr Dworczak, Yingni Guo, Ian Jewitt, Andy Kleiner, Stefan Krasa, Meg Meyer, Mallesh Pai, Thomas Piketty, Ludvig Sinander, Quitz\u00e9 Valenzuela-Stookey, Thomas Zuber and audiences at PSE, CRC TR 224 Summer School, UIUC, and Bonn.

As a result, policymakers have regulated labour contracts to correct the inefficient distortions caused by firms and to ensure a more equitable distribution of the surplus generated (Berger et al., 2025). ${ }^{1}$ Policymakers have often advocated these regulations to curb firms' monopsony power. So, regulations have primarily been evaluated on their effects on unemployment (Stigler, 1946; Card and Krueger, 2016). However, the firms' market - hence bargaining - power distorts not only the allocation of workers but also the contractual relationship between firms and workers: Labour contract regulations also influence the inner workings of firms - e.g., firms' technology choices and the efforts exerted by workers (Obenauer and von der Nienburg, 1915; Coviello et al., 2022). This paper focuses on the impacts of contract regulations on incentives inside the firm.\n\nWe consider the problem of a regulator choosing what contracts to authorize in the canonical principal-agent model with moral hazard (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1979). In practice, regulators have neither the knowledge nor the ability to tailor regulations to individual firm-worker interactions at each point in time. Regulations apply identically to firms with varying technologies and costs (e.g., within a sector or geographic area), and regulators face a trade-off between workers' protection and firms' flexibility. While potentially beneficial to employed workers, any regulation also risks preventing some firms from hiring, exacerbating inefficiencies. ${ }^{2}$ Thus, regulations must be designed to perform well in different situations. We capture this by studying robust (non-Bayesian) regulations.\n\nOur model builds on classic moral hazard models. A firm (she) contracts with\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The two objectives of efficiency and redistribution are clearly stated by the U.S. Treasury in \"The State of Labor Market Competition\" (2022).\n    ${ }^{2}$ Berger et al. (2025) study a similar trade-off for the minimum wage: while it protects low-income workers and reduces inefficiencies due to firms' monopsonistic power, it stops less productive firms from hiring, resulting in new inefficiencies.\n\na worker (he), who then takes a costly productive action that yields a stochastic output. Hiring the worker imposes a fixed cost for the firm. The set of productive actions and the fixed cost define the firm's technology. The worker's actions being non-contractible, the firm incentivises production by offering an (authorised) contract that maps realised outputs to payments. We assume the firm and the worker are protected by limited liability, they are risk-neutral, and they maximise their profit and surplus. We add a third player to that standard model: the regulator (they). They choose the regulation, which is the set of authorised contracts the firm can offer. We assume that the regulator's payoff is a weighted sum of the firm's profit and the worker's surplus, where the latter has a (weakly) greater weight $\\alpha \\geq 1$.\n\nWhile the firm and the worker know the technology, the regulator has no information. They evaluate regulations according to their worst-case regret. For a given technology and regulation, the regret is the difference between the regulator's full information payoff - had they known the technology - and their actual payoff given the optimal choices of contract and action made by the firm and the worker for the chosen regulation. So, the regret measures the waste of opportunity that the regulator must tolerate because of their lack of information. The worst-case regret for a regulation is the maximal regret over all possible technologies and equilibria of the contractual relationship. The regulator chooses the regulation to minimise their worst-case regret.\n\nOur main result establishes that a minimum linear contract regulation is optimal (Theorem 1). The regret-minimising regulation allows every contract above the linear contract $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{*}: y \\mapsto \\frac{\\alpha-1}{2 \\alpha-1} \\cdot y$, where $y$ is the output and $\\alpha$ is the weight the regulator places on the worker's surplus. This regulation guarantees the worker a minimal piece rate compensation (or share of the production), thereby safeguarding his surplus. However, unlike a flat minimum contract, the minimum linear contract preserves the firm's flexibility to provide incentives while limiting the firm's motives for distorting production. It achieves this by combining two features. First, the minimum linear contract partially realigns the firm's incentives toward efficient pro-\n\nduction. It incentivises the worker to choose productive actions, which lessens the firm's interest in distorting production downward. It also reduces the firm's incentive to distort production upward, as it stops the firm from offering overly convex (bonus) contracts that can implement high-output actions cheaply. Hence, the minimum linear contract aligns the firm's incentives with the regulator's preferences for efficiency. Second, the optimal regulation limits the risk of stymieing production and wasting all potential surplus by granting the firm complete flexibility above the minimum contract. The optimal regulation trades off the risk of pushing the firm out of business and the regulator's preference for efficient production and fair allocation of the surplus.\n\nFinding an optimal regulation is a delegation problem (Holmstrom, 1980). The central challenge to solving it arises from the size of the delegation possibility set. We are interested in the regulation of contracts, not only that of outcomes. The regulator can, therefore, restrict the firm's contractual choice to be in any subset of the infinitedimensional space of all measurable mappings from outcomes to payments. A key step to tackle the problem is to show that technologies with binary distributions over extreme outputs maximise regret. ${ }^{3}$ Intuitively, binary distributions can be seen as garblings of non-binary distributions (Garrett et al., 2023). So, they minimise the informational content of output. By the Informativeness Principle (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1979), this makes incentive provision harder and exacerbates distortions, hence increasing the regulator's regret. Restricting attention to binary distributions then implies that we can focus on linear contracts to bind the regulator's regret, which reduces the problem's dimensionality and complexity.\n\nAlthough our model largely simplifies the firm-worker relationship, it can provide insights into labour regulations in industries where workers are paid based on measures of individual performances. This is the case for freelancers, gig workers (e.g., taxi or food delivery drivers), or certain agriculture workers and retailers (Coviello et al., 2022). Our main result suggests imposing a minimal piece-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{~A}$ binary distribution is supported over extreme outputs $\\{0, \\bar{y}\\}$.\n\nrate payment for these workers. Hence, it can shed light on several regulations recently adopted to protect gig workers: New York City imposed a minimum pay rate per hour for app-based restaurant delivery workers; ${ }^{4}$ the Government of British Columbia (Canada) also set a minimum per hour wage for gig workers; ${ }^{5}$ Washington State imposed a minimal payment per course, mile and minute for Uber and Lyft drivers. ${ }^{6}$ One can also view our result as setting a minimum profit-sharing (or bonus) for employees (Atkinson, 1972; Weitzman, 1989). This is, for instance, a rule implemented in France since 1967 for firms with more than 100 employees. ${ }^{7}$ Similar to our rationale for the optimality of the minimum piece rate compensation, one explicit goal of this French regulation was to \"align\" shareholders' and employees' goals to improve productivity. Nimier-David et al. (2023) find evidence that the mandated profit-sharing increased the labour share at the firm level and mostly benefited low-skill workers.\n\nIn the rest of the paper, we first derive comparative statics, and show in particular that, absent redistributive concerns, laissez-faire is optimal (Section 2.2). In that case, the risk that the regulation prevents the firm from producing outweighs the costs due to rent-seeking distortions; hence, the regulator grants the firm complete flexibility. Then, Section 2.3 discusses other optimal regulations. Although a complete characterization of the set of optimal regulations remains elusive because of the complexity of the regulator's choice set, we show that any optimal regulation must share the key features of the minimal piece rate regulation identified in Theorem 1. In Section 3, we relax the assumptions on the regulator's information and show that the minimal piece rate regulation remains optimal when the regulator knows more about the technology (e.g., the effort costs and output distribution are ranked according to the monotone likelihood ratio property or first-order stochastic dominance). Finally, Section 4 concludes: we compare our approach to the traditional labour mar-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ See City of New York (2024).\n    ${ }^{5}$ See Government of British Columbia (2025).\n    ${ }^{6}$ See Shepardson (2022).\n    ${ }^{7}$ The eligibility threshold was reduced to 50 employees in 1990, and to 11 employees in 2025.\n\nket models used to analyse regulations (e.g., Stigler, 1946; Burdett and Mortensen, 1998; Naidu et al., 2016; Berger et al., 2025) and discuss future avenues for research.\n\nRelated literature. To study the regulation of private contracting between workers and firms, we build on the canonical principal-agent model with moral hazard (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1979; Laffont and Martimort, 2002; Jewitt et al., 2008). In particular, we view regulation as a delegation problem. The delegation literature, starting with Holmstrom (1980), has focused on aligning a better-informed agent's behaviour to a principal's preferences by restricting the actions the agent can take. So, it naturally lends itself to the study of regulation. Firms typically know more about the environment, and regulators can constrain firms' choices (Laffont, 1994). For example, Amador and Bagwell (2022) studied Baron and Myerson's (1982) monopoly regulation problem in a setting without transfers. Closer to ours are papers that study robust non-Bayesian regulations. In particular, Guo and Shmaya (2025) derived the regret-minimizing monopoly regulation. ${ }^{8}$ Malladi (2022) studies the robustly optimal approval rules for innovation. Finally, Thomas (2024) also studies robust labour market regulations as a delegation problem. He shows that combining minimum wage, overtime pay, and a cap on hours can help protect the worker and improve efficiency under different bargaining protocols.\n\nWe differ from these papers in our focus: we study the effect of regulations on incentive provision. Our problem is one of moral hazard, while Guo and Shmaya (2025) and Malladi (2022) consider adverse selection and Thomas (2024) abstracts away from incentives to focus on bargaining. In our paper, the regulator chooses the set of permissible contracts. The delegation set is a subset of the space of all measurable mappings from outputs to payments. Instead, in the three aforementioned papers as well as in the delegated contracting literature that considers moral hazard (e.g., Hiriart and Martimort, 2012; Iossa and Martimort, 2016), the regula-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ See Naidu and Posner (2022) and the Appendix C of Guo and Shmaya (2025) for a reinterpretation of Guo and Shmaya's results in terms of labour market regulation.\n\ntor determines the set of permissible outcomes or allocations. The delegation sets are then subsets of finite-dimensional spaces. Two notable exceptions are Bhaskar et al. (2023) and Bhaskar and McClellan (2024), who, like us, examine regulations as delegation problems in the space of contracts. In the former, the authors examine the optimal regulation of contracts in insurance markets. Unlike us, they look at a Bayesian framework, and the regulated interaction suffers from adverse selection. In the latter, they study the regulation of wage contracts in a dynamic labour market. They derive the Bayesian optimal regulation when the frictions arise from search inefficiencies. As in standard labour market models, wages distribute the surplus between firms and workers but do not incentivise effort. We focus on incentive provision and show that regulations can compound existing distortions in moral hazard problems. As a result, we highlight a new trade-off for regulators between firm autonomy and worker protection that leads to qualitatively different regulations.\n\nMoreover, we contribute to the growing literature on mechanism design with a non-Bayesian objective, restarted in economics with Chassang (2013), Garrett (2014), and Carroll (2015) (see Carroll, 2019, for a survey). In particular, we follow Wald (1950), Savage (1951), Hurwicz and Shapiro (1978), Manski (2012), and Guo and Shmaya $(2023,2025)$ in evaluating policies by their worst-case regret. This literature has typically studied the design of robust compensation schemes between a principal and an agent or in a hierarchical organization (Walton and Carroll, 2022). We depart by looking at the regulation problem and show that the robustness approach can give us economically meaningful predictions when the Bayesian problem remains intractable. Notably, linear contracts play a role in our model to realign incentives as in Carroll (2015), Walton and Carroll (2022), or Carroll and Bolte (2023). While in the robust incentive provision problem, linear contracts ensure that workers' incentives are not too distant from the firms', in our case, they ensure that the firms' incentives are not too distant from the regulator's.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1 Model \n\nThere are three players: the regulator (they), the firm (she) and the worker (he).\n\nTechnologies. A technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A}) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)}$consists in an operating $\\operatorname{cost} k \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$and a production set ${ }^{9} \\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, F_{i}\\right): i \\in I\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$. The production set $\\mathcal{A}$ describes the actions available to the worker. An action is a pair $(e, F)$, where $F \\in \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$is a distribution over outputs $y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$and $e \\geq 0$ is the associated cost of production (e.g., effort). The operating cost $k$ captures the firm's fixed costs if she hires the worker (e.g., maintenance, utilities, software subscription). We make the following assumptions on all technologies $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nAssumption 1. A production set $\\mathcal{A}$ is a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$(for the topology associated with the total variation norm).\n\nAssumption 2. There exists $\\bar{y} \\geq 0$ such that for any production set $\\mathcal{A}$ and any action $(e, F) \\in \\mathcal{A}, \\mathbb{E}_{F}[y] \\leq \\bar{y}$.\n\nAssumption 1 is technical. For instance, it holds if all output distributions have a common finite support. It guarantees that the firm's and the regulator's optimisation problems ( $\\Pi$ ) and ( $R^{\\text {full }}$ ) below admit a solution. On the other hand, Assumption 2 is substantive. It states that the maximum expected output is bounded by $\\bar{y}$. So, it contains a critical piece of information for the regulator. They do not need to worry about technologies for which output is unbounded. As a result, the regulator's regret remains bounded. Both Assumptions 1 and 2 are typically satisfied in the literature. They hold, for instance, for all technologies considered in Holmstr\u00f6m (1979), Grossman and Hart (1983), or Jewitt et al. (2008). We denote by $\\mathbb{T}$ the set of all technologies whose production sets satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9} \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$is the set of all Radon probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$. We equip $\\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$with the topology generated by the total variation norm.\n\nExample 1 (Binary technology). One important class of technologies for our analysis that satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2 is the class of binary technologies:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}=\\left(k, \\mathcal{A}=\\left(e_{i}, B_{\\mu_{i}}\\right)_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathbb{R}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere for any $i \\in I, B_{\\mu_{i}}$ is a binary distribution supported on $\\{0, \\bar{y}\\}$ with mean ${ }^{10} \\mu_{i}$. Namely, $B_{\\mu_{i}}=a \\delta_{\\bar{y}}+(1-a) \\delta_{0}$ for some $a \\in[0,1]$ such that ${ }^{11} a \\bar{y}=\\mu_{i}$.\n\nExample 2. In classic moral hazard models (e.g., Jewitt et al., 2008), the agent typically chooses an effort level $e \\in[0, \\bar{e}]$, which costs $c(e)$ and induces the distribution $F(\\cdot \\mid e)$ with density $f(\\cdot \\mid e)$. In our notations, the production set is then the image of $e \\mapsto(c(e), F(\\cdot \\mid e))$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}=(c(e), F(\\cdot \\mid e))_{e \\in[0, \\bar{e}]}\n$$\n\nIt satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2 (for standard assumptions, e.g., $e \\mapsto(c(e), F(\\cdot \\mid e))$ is continuous).\n\nContracts and regulations. We assume that both the worker and the firm are protected by limited liability. A contract is a (measurable) mapping $w: \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \\leq w(y) \\leq y$. It specifies the payment $w(y)$ the worker receives for each output level $y$. We denote by $\\mathcal{C}_{0}$ the set of all measurable function from $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$to $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \\leq w(y) \\leq y$ for all $y \\geq 0$. A regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ is a closed (for the product topology on $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\\mathbb{R}_{+}}$) subset of allowed contracts: $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. For any regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ we define the function $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$ by $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)=\\inf \\{w(y): w \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$ for all $y \\geq 0$. We refer to the linear contract $y \\mapsto \\ell \\cdot y$ as the contract $\\ell$.\n\nExample 3 (Minimum piece-rate). A possible regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ takes the form of a minimum piece-rate: $\\mathcal{C}=\\left\\{w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0}: w(y) \\geq \\ell \\cdot y\\right.$ for all $\\left.y \\geq 0\\right\\}$. It authorizes all and only the con-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ Under Assumption 1, assuming that the index set $I$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is without loss of generality since every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.\n    ${ }^{11}$ For any pair of output distributions $F$ and $G$ and any real number $a \\in[0,1]$, we denote as $a F+$ $(1-a) G$ the output distribution obtained by the usual mixture operation.\n\ntracts that exceed the minimum linear contract $\\ell$ pointwise. In this case, $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$ is a contract in $\\mathcal{C}$ and is equal to $\\ell$.\n\nAs we assume that the worker is risk-neutral, limited liability for the worker is the sole agency friction. ${ }^{12}$ On the other hand, limited liability for the firm stops the regulator from forcing the firm to pay the worker more than the realised output. Although this assumption can be economically justified (e.g., the firm can default), we make it to simplify and solve the regulator's problem: knowing that all feasible contracts pay 0 when the output is $y=0$ simplifies the analysis. ${ }^{13}$\n\nFirm's and worker's payoffs. The firm and the worker are risk-neutral. Given a contract $w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0}$, an action $(e, F) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\Delta\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$, and an operating cost $k \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the firm's, worker's, and regulator's payoffs are, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pi & =\\mathbb{E}_{F}[y-w(y)]-k \\\\\nW S & =\\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e \\\\\n\\text { and } \\quad U & =\\Pi+\\alpha W S\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha \\geq 1$ is the weight the regulator places on the worker's surplus $W S$. Finally, we assume that the worker and the firm both have access to an outside option that gives them a payoff of 0 .\n\nTiming. The timing of the game is as follows.\n\n1. The regulator chooses the regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$, i.e., the set of authorised contracts.\n2. Nature determines the technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A})$, which is observed by the firm and the worker.\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ Absent the worker's limited liability, a solution to the contracting problem for the principal is to sell the firm to the agent at a fixed price. In this case, we show in Appendix D. 3 that the optimal regulation just puts a cap on the price the firm can ask. Moral hazard plays no role.\n    ${ }^{13}$ We conjecture that our minimum linear contract regulation remains optimal without this constraint, but our proof does not show it.\n\n3. The firm decides whether she wants to hire the worker. If she does not, the game ends, and both players receive their outside option. If the firm wants to hire the worker, she proposes a contract $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ to the worker.\n4. If the worker refuses the firm's contract, the game ends, and both players receive their outside option. If the worker accepts the contract, he chooses a productive action, and the payoffs are realised.\n\nThe firm's problem. The firm solves a (constrained) moral-hazard problem. She chooses what authorized contract to offer to maximise profits when the worker best responds by choosing the action that maximises his payoffs. Formally, given a regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ and technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A}) \\in \\mathbb{T}$, the firm solves: ${ }^{14}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pi(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})= & \\max \\left\\{0, \\max _{w \\in \\mathcal{C},(e, F) \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\mathbb{E}_{F}[y-w(y)]-k\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\text { s.t. } \\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e \\geq 0 \\\\\n& \\text { and } \\quad \\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{F}}[w(y)]-\\tilde{e} \\quad \\text { for all }(\\tilde{e}, \\tilde{F}) \\in \\mathcal{A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe interpretation of the maximization problem (II) is as follows. Since the firm anticipates the worker's response to any contract, we can equivalently view the firm as directly choosing the worker's action, taking his optimizing behavior as a constraint. ${ }^{15}$ Namely, the worker chooses the action in $\\mathcal{A}$ that maximises his payoff given the offered contract. This is captured by the incentive compatibility constraint $\\left(I C_{W}\\right)$. Furthermore, the worker accepts a contract $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ if and only his payoff is greater than his outside option. This is captured by the participation constraint $\\left(I R_{W}\\right)$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ Lemma 10 in Appendix D. 2 guarantees the existence of an optimal contract and associated optimal action under mild regularity conditions that are satisfied by all the regulations we consider. Note, however, that we do not impose these conditions as part of the definition of a regulation, and, thus, that writing the maximum for an arbitrary $\\mathcal{C}$ is a small abuse of notations.\n    ${ }^{15}$ As is standard in principal-agent models, we implicitly assume that the firm can select her preferred action when the worker is indifferent between several.\n\nThe worker's surplus when the regulation is $\\mathcal{C}$, the technology is $\\mathcal{T}$, and the worker and the firm play the subgame perfect equilibrium $\\sigma=\\left(w_{(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})}^{\\star},(e, F)\\right)$, is\n\n$$\nW S(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T}, \\sigma)=\\mathbb{E}_{F}\\left[w_{(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})}^{\\star}(y)\\right]-e\n$$\n\nWe denote by $\\Sigma$ the set of equilibria of the contracting game.\n\nRegulator's objective. The regulator cares about distributional efficiency. If they were fully informed of the technology $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}$, they would choose the contract and incentivise the action that maximise their payoff, solving the following program: ${ }^{16}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV(\\mathcal{T})=\\max _{w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0},(e, F) \\in \\mathcal{A}} & \\mathbb{E}_{F}[y-w(y)]-k+\\alpha\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e\\right) \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & \\mathbb{E}_{F}[y-w(y)]-k \\geq 0 \\\\\n& \\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e \\geq 0 \\\\\n& \\mathbb{E}_{F}[w(y)]-e \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{F}}[w(y)]-\\tilde{e} \\text { for all }(\\tilde{e}, \\tilde{F}) \\in \\mathcal{A}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs above, since the regulator anticipates the firm's and worker's best responses to any contract, we can assume, equivalently, that the regulator directly chooses the worker's and firm's actions taking their optimizing behaviours as constraints. Hence, the regulator's choice of contract and action must satisfy the worker's incentive compatibility and participation constraints $\\left(I C_{W}\\right)$ and $\\left(I R_{W}\\right)$, as in (II), as well as the firm's participation constraint $\\left(I R_{F}\\right)$. The latter reflects the fact that the firm can stay out of business if her profit is not at least her outside option. ${ }^{17}$ We refer to any action that solves $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$ as the $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$-optimal one.\n\nHowever, in our problem, the regulator does not know the firm's technology when they choose the regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. We assume that the regulator minimises\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ It is easily seen that the regulator does not gain from allowing multiple contracts.

This is our sole departure from the Bayesian approach, which would assign a prior belief over the set of possible technologies $\\mathbb{T}$. The regulator would then minimise the expected regret. ${ }^{19}$ Instead, the regulator is cautious and wishes to find the regulation that performs the best is the worst-case scenario, namely to find $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ that minimises the worst-case regret:\n\n$$\n\\inf _{\\mathcal{C}} W C R(\\mathcal{C})\n$$\n\nOne can interpret the above problem as the following zero-sum game.

Let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{R} & =\\min _{w \\in\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}\\right]} \\max \\left\\{\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 w-\\bar{y}}{8-\\bar{w}}}(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}), \\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w})\\right\\} \\\\\n\\text { and } \\quad \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star} & =\\left\\{w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0}: w(y) \\geq \\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot y:=\\frac{\\alpha-1}{2 \\alpha-1} \\cdot y \\text { for all } y \\geq 0\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(i) The worst-case regret of any regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ is at least $\\bar{R}$.\n(ii) The worst-case regret of the regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is $\\bar{R}$, hence $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is optimal.\n\nThe proof is in Appendix A and Section 2.4 sketches and explains the argument. Theorem 1 highlights the regulator's trade-off between giving the firm enough flexibility to incentivise production and limiting the firm's ability to distort production and extract surplus from the worker. Either the regulation is too restrictive and deters the firm from hiring the worker, thus wasting production opportunities. Or the regulation is too permissive and the firm produces but excessively distorts production and extracts too much of the surplus.\n\nThe two terms in the maximand of the lower bound $\\bar{R}$ reflect this trade-off when the regulation only imposes a minimum linear contract $\\ell$ such that $\\ell \\cdot \\bar{y}=\\underline{w}$. The first term captures the regulator's regret in a scenario where the regulation stops the firm from hiring the worker. The second term captures the regulator's regret for allowing ample distortions. The min and the max operators result from, respectively,\n\nthe regulator's ability to choose a regulation (in this case, the slope of the minimum linear contract) and the regulator's concern about the worst-case scenario. The optimal minimum linear contract in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is then obtained by solving for the optimal $\\underline{w}^{\\star}$ in Equation (1) and choosing the slope $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ such that $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}=\\underline{w}^{\\star}$. Hence, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ equalises the regulator's maximal regret from surplus destruction when the regulation prevents production and from rent-extraction distortions that harm the worker when the firm produces.\n\nHow does the regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ reconcile the regulator's and the firm's conflicting objectives to minimise the regulator's regret? It combines two features: (i) the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ and (ii) maximal flexibility above this minimum contract. First, the minimum linear contract protects the worker by guaranteeing him a minimal share of the output. Furthermore, it also limits the firm's incentives to distort production to extract the worker's surplus. Unlike a constant minimum wage that raises the cost of incentive provision uniformly, the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ already provides the worker with incentives to choose more productive actions (see, e.g., Hurwicz and Shapiro, 1978; Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987; Carroll, 2015), which limits the firm's ability to distort production downward. Furthermore, $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ also prevents upward distortions because the firm has to pay the worker a minimum share $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ for each output $y$. The firm thus cannot offer very convex contracts (e.g., bonus contracts) that can cheaply incentivise over-production. So, the minimum linear contract curtails rent extraction by lowering the firm's potential gain from underand overproduction. As a result, the firm implements an action closer to the ( $R^{\\text {full }}$ )optimal one, thus reducing the regulator's regret. Second, granting the firm flexibility above the minimum linear contract mitigates the risk of preventing production. The more flexible a regulation is (i.e., it includes more contracts), the more actions the firm can implement, thus limiting the risk of impeding production and wasting the entire surplus. Since the minimum linear contract already realigns the firm's and regulator's motives, the regulator does not gain from further restricting the firm's autonomy.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.2 Comparative statics: when is laissez-faire optimal? \n\nTheorem 1 provides insights into the evolution of the optimal regulation as a function of the regulator's redistributive weight $\\alpha$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "## Corollary 1.\n\n(i) The optimal regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is more constraining as $\\alpha$ increases: $\\alpha \\geq \\alpha^{\\prime} \\Longrightarrow \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha^{\\prime}}^{\\star}$.\n(ii) When $\\alpha=1$, laissez-faire is optimal: $\\mathcal{C}_{1}^{\\star}=\\mathcal{C}_{0}$.\n\nCorollary 1 is a direct consequence of Theorem 1: (i) as $\\alpha$ increases, the slope $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ increases and thus the regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ allows fewer contracts; (ii) in particular, $\\ell_{1}^{\\star}=0$, hence the regulator does not gain from regulating when they only care about total surplus $(\\alpha=1)$.\n\nPoint (i) indicates that the more the regulator values the worker surplus, the more willing they are to risk preventing production (when the surplus is small) in exchange for guaranteeing the worker a larger share of the surplus when production happens. This is reminiscent of the equity-efficiency trade-off in the minimum wage literature. While a higher minimum wage may distort the market and prevent firms from hiring, it ensures a greater salary for employed workers (Berger et al., 2025).\n\nIn the extreme case, when $\\alpha=1$, increasing the firm's profit at the expense of the worker does not increase the regret. However, the firm's profit-maximizing behaviour may. Distortions to extract the agent's incentive rent are costly for the regulator: they waste potential surplus. Corollary 1 reveals that the risk of pushing the firm out of business outweighs any potential gain from limiting these distortions. Indeed, any regulation reduces the firm's potential profit and, hence, jeopardises the firm's viability. When $\\alpha=1$, mitigating this risk becomes the regulator's primary objective. The optimal policy, therefore, grants full flexibility to the firm. In other words, the information asymmetry between the regulator and the firm is too severe for the regulator to correct the inefficient distortions introduced by moral hazard. For any regulation, there is a scenario where the regulation prevents the firm from\n\nproducing, and that scenario becomes the main concern of a regulator whose objective is to maximize total surplus.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 2.3 Characteristics of optimal regulations \n\nThe optimal regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ proposed in Theorem 1 is not the only regulation that minimises the worst-case regret. For instance, the proof of Theorem 1 shows that the regulation allowing all and only linear contracts above $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is also optimal. Still, we argue that all optimal regulations share the key features of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$.\n\nTheorem 2. Any optimal regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ must satisfy the following properties. ${ }^{20}$\n(i) (Minimum guarantee) For all $y \\in[0, \\bar{y}]$,\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{0, y-\\left(\\bar{y}-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right)\\right\\} \\leq \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y) \\leq \\min \\left\\{y, \\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand for all $y \\geq \\bar{y}$,\n\n$$\n\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)=\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot y\n$$\n\n(ii) (Robust to gaming) For any $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$, if $w(\\bar{y})=\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}$, then $\\underline{\\operatorname{conv}}(w)(\\bar{y}) \\geq \\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}$.\n(iii) (Minimal flexibility) For all $y \\geq \\bar{y},\\left[\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot y, y-\\rho^{\\star}\\right] \\subset \\operatorname{Im}(\\mathcal{C})(y)$, where $\\rho^{\\star}=e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}(1-$ $\\left.\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}\\right) y$.\n\nThe proof is in Appendix B. Theorem 2 shows that, although the details of optimal regulations may vary, the fundamental elements that ensure optimality are invariant. (i) Any optimal regulation must include a minimum guarantee for the worker, $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$, which cannot be \"too far\" from $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$. Specifically, $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$ must lie in the hatched region of Figure 1 for outputs below $\\bar{y}$ and be equal to $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot y$ for outputs above $\\bar{y}$. The same logic behind the optimality of the minimum linear contract in Theorem 1\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{20} \\underline{\\operatorname{conv}}(w)(\\cdot)=\\sup \\{g: g$ convex and $g \\leq w\\}$ stands for the convex envelope of $w$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(\\mathcal{C})(y)=$ $\\{v \\geq 0: \\exists w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $w(y)=v\\}$ is the image of the regulation.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Region of $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$ and minimal flexibility of optimal regulations.\nalso underpins the necessity of a minimum guarantee. Furthermore, (ii) optimal regulations must prevent the firm (and Nature) from gaming this minimum guarantee. Although there may be permitted contracts below $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{*}$ for outputs lower than $\\bar{y}$, the lower convex envelope of such contracts must be at least equal to $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{*}$ above $\\bar{y}$. Otherwise, by generating technologies where the firm optimally offers such a contract and the expected payment is on the lower convex envelope of the contract, Nature can increase the regulator's regret.\n\nFinally, (iii) optimal regulation must afford the firm a minimum of flexibility by having contracts whose union of the images cover the dotted region in Figure 1. Inflexible regulations have been blamed for reducing firms' productivity, resulting in less hiring, shorter working hours, and even, in extreme cases, firms' shutdowns (Clemens, 2021). Theorem 2 (iii) echoes this critique. Autonomy is essential for the firm to leverage her private information. Optimal regulations, therefore, cannot be overly rigid.\n\nMinimal Regulation. Theorem 2 (i) and (ii) also imply that the minimum linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is the least restrictive optimal regulation among those having a minimum contract, namely a contract that is point-wise lower than any permitted contract.\n\nDefinition 1. A regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ has a minimum contract if $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}} \\in \\mathcal{C}$.\nCorollary 2. If the regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ is optimal and has a minimum contract, then $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$.\nThe regulations having a minimum contract are appealing for their simplicity especially those allowing every contract above the minimum contract. Within this class, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is the most flexible regulation that is optimal. As a result, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is the firm's preferred regulation among the optimal regulations with a minimum contract. Formally, for any such regulation $\\mathcal{C}, \\Pi(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T}) \\leq \\Pi\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)$ for any technology $\\mathcal{T} \\in

{"section_id": 6, "text": "# 2.4 Proof Sketch of Theorem 1 \n\nOur main result, Theorem 1, first gives a uniform lower bound on the regulator's worst-case regret for any regulation, $\\bar{R}$, and, second, shows that the minimum linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ achieves this lower bound - hence is optimal.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "### 2.4.1 Lower bound $\\bar{R}$\n\nStep 1: regulation-specific lower bound. To show that $\\bar{R}$ is a lower bound on the worst-case regret of any regulation, we first obtain the following lower bound for a given arbitrary regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ :\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})=\\max \\left\\{\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})-\\bar{y}}{y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y}) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}\\right\\}}, \\alpha \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y}), \\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\n$\\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})$ is obtained by constructing two scenarios generating regret, separating the case where the firm does not produce under the regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ and the case where she does.\n\nCase 1: no production. In this case, we can always assume that the least costly action's effort cost is zero because lowering the effort cost of all actions as well as the operational cost by the same amount does not change the agent's and the firm's incentives while it (weakly) increases the regulator's regret.\n\nConsider first a technology with a single productive action producing output $\\bar{y}$ with certainty: $\\mathcal{T}=\\left(k,\\left(0, \\delta_{\\bar{y}}\\right)\\right)$. Since the firm does not produce, $k \\geq \\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})$. In this case, the regret is $\\alpha(\\bar{y}-k)$ and thus is equal to $\\alpha \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})$ if $k=\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})$ (see Lemma 1).\n\nNext, we construct a technology with multiple actions, for which the firm does not produce, that induces a regret equal to the first term in the maximand of $\\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})$. We fix an operational cost $k$ and construct a binary technology (c.f. Example 1) with the following features (see Lemma 2 for the formal details):\n(i) the least productive action has an expected output of $a \\bar{y}$, with $a \\in(0,1)$, and a cost of 0 ;\n(ii) there is a continuum of productive actions indexed by $i \\in[a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y}]$ such that $i$ is the expected output of action $i$ and $e_{i}$ its cost;\n(iii) $a \\bar{y}$ is such that no contract in the regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ can profitably implement action $a \\bar{y}$;\n(iv) the incentive costs are such that all the actions $i \\in(a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y})$ can only be incentivised by a contract that yields zero profit for the firm (while all contracts that implement action $\\bar{y}$ yield a non-positive profit).\n\nThis technology is illustrated in Figure 2. Since actions are binary (with common support), any contract $w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0}$ is outcome-equivalent to the linear contract $y \\mapsto \\ell \\cdot y$, where $\\ell=\\frac{w(\\bar{y})}{\\bar{y}}$. Hence, we can think in terms of linear contracts. Point (iv) guarantees that for any $i \\in(a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y})$, only the contract with slope $\\frac{i-k}{i}$ implements action ${ }^{21}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ If the agent chooses action $i$, this contract gives an expected payment of $\\frac{i-k}{i} \\times i=i-k$; hence the firm's profit is 0 . Any steeper (resp. less steep) would give a negative (resp. positive) profit to the firm.\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Regret is equal to $\\alpha \\times\\left(\\bar{y}-e_{\\bar{y}}-k\\right)$.\n$i \\in(a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y})$. This constraint pins down the effort costs: they must solve the first-order differential equation with an initial condition,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial e_{i}}{\\partial i}=\\frac{i-k}{i}, \\quad e_{a \\bar{y}}=0\n$$\n\nThe solution is depicted as the cost graph $\\left\\{\\left(i, e_{i}\\right): i \\in[a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y}]\\right\\}$ in Figure 2. We obtained this equation from the worker's incentive constraint: he prefers action $i$ to $j<i$ under contract $\\ell$ if and only if $\\ell \\geq \\frac{e_{i}-e_{j}}{i-j}$. Since the cost $e_{i}$ increases less than one to one with the expected output $i$, action $\\left(e_{\\bar{y}}, \\delta_{\\bar{y}}\\right)$ maximises the surplus. The regulator would implement this action if they were fully informed, with the contract $y \\mapsto$ $\\frac{\\bar{y}-k}{\\bar{y}} \\cdot y$, giving the entire surplus to the worker. Therefore, the regret is equal to $\\alpha \\times\\left(\\bar{y}-e_{\\bar{y}}-k\\right)$. Having constructed this technology for a given operational cost $k$ and expected output of the least productive action $a \\bar{y}$, we can now maximise the regret over $k$ and $a \\bar{y}$. This yields the lower bound $\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})-\\bar{y}}{y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y}) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}\\right\\}}$ (see Lemma 2).\n\nBefore trying to understand intuitively the rational for our construction, observe that, because we focused on binary technologies, only the point $\\left(\\bar{y}, \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)$ matters to compute the regret. In particular, the same technology generates the same regret\n\nif, instead of $\\mathcal{C}$, we consider the regulation that only impose the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\mathcal{C}}:=\\frac{g \\mathcal{C}(g)}{g}$ instead.\n\nThe goal of the above construction is to maximise the surplus of the most productive action - the ( $R^{\\text {fuli }}$ )-optimal one - while keeping implementation costs high enough so the firm's profit is never strictly positive. For that purpose, we first focus on technologies so that the non-positive profit constraint is binding (point (iv)). Second, we focus on binary actions. To undersday why, it is helpful to go back to the standard moral hazard problem. In moral hazard problems, output plays a dual role. It is (1) the firm's revenue and (2) the only informative signal about the worker's action. Therefore, the firm must use the informational content of output to incentivise the worker. As in Garrett et al. (2023), the key observation is that a binary distribution is a garbling of a distribution with the same mean. Replacing all actions in the production set by equally costly and productive actions whose output distributions are binary thus reduces the informational content of outputs while keeping the (total) surplus unchanged. By the Informativeness Principle (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1979), a less informative signal makes incentive provision more expensive. Although it may not increase the firm's implementation costs for all regulations, it does for regulations that only impose a minimum linear contract. As a result, while binary technologies may not be regret-maximizing for all regulations $\\mathcal{C}$, they maximize the regulator's regret (when the firm does not produce) for the regulation imposing the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\mathcal{C}}$.\n\nCase 2: production. In this second case, we can assume that the operational cost is zero since reducing it does not change the firm's decision to produce and (weakly) increases the regulator's regret. Furthermore, we can also assume that the worker surplus is zero as uniformly increasing the effort cost of actions does not alter the firm or worker's incentives and leaves the regret unchanged, as long as the worker is still willing to participate.\n\nAs in the case without production, we construct a binary technology with the\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Regret is equal to $\\alpha\\left(\\bar{y}-e_{\\bar{y}}\\right)-\\left(a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}\\right)$.\nfollowing key features (see Lemma 3 for the formal details):\n(i) the least productive action has an expected output of $a \\bar{y}$, with $a \\in(0,1)$;\n(ii) there is a continuum of productive actions indexed by $i \\in[a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y}]$ such that $i$ is the expected output of action $i$ and $e_{i}$ its cost;\n(iii) $a \\bar{y}$ is such that the firm can incentivise action $a \\bar{y}$ and capture the whole generated surplus $a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}$ under the regulation $\\mathcal{C}$;\n(iv) the incentive costs are such that all the actions $i \\in(a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y})$ can only be incentivised by a contract that yields exactly $a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}$ in profit for the firm (while all contracts that implement action $\\bar{y}$ yield at most profit $\\left.a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}\\right)$.\n\nFigure 3 depicts this technology. Similar to the first case, point (iv) implies that the cost graph $\\left\\{\\left(i, e_{i}\\right): i \\in[a \\bar{y}, \\bar{y}]\\right\\}$ satisfies the differential equation\n\n$$\ne_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{i-\\left(a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}\\right)}{i}, \\quad e_{a \\bar{y}}=\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y}) a\n$$\n\nAction $\\left(e_{\\bar{y}}, \\delta_{\\bar{y}}\\right)$ is the $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$-optimal action that the regulator would implement by offering the contract $y \\mapsto y$, giving the entire surplus to the worker. However, point\n\n(iv) also implies that in the worst-case scenario the firm implements action $a \\bar{y}$. Therefore, the regret is equal to $\\alpha\\left(\\bar{y}-e_{\\bar{y}}\\right)-\\left(a \\bar{y}-e_{a \\bar{y}}\\right)$. Finally, observe that the technology we constructed is parametrised by the given expected output of the least productive action (the action implemented by the firm), $a \\bar{y}$. Maximizing over this parameter, we obtain the lower bound $\\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)$ (see Lemma 3).\n\nAs in the previous case, only the point $\\left(\\bar{y}, \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)$ matters for our construction. Hence, the same technology would give the same regret under the regulation imposing the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\frac{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})}{\\bar{y}}$.\n\nThe goal of the above construction is to maximize the surplus of the $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$ optimal action, while ensuring that action $a \\bar{y}$ remains the (weakly) most profitable one. For that purpose, we focus on technologies so that the profit constraint is binding (point (iv)). Second, we consider binary actions for the same reason we did in the case without production. Binary actions reduce the informational content of output. As a result, we can construct a binary worst-case scenario for the regulation imposing the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\mathcal{C}}$, increasing implementation costs and, thus, the surplus of $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$-optimal action, while keeping action $a \\bar{y}$ as the most profitable one.\n\nStep 2: uniform lower bound. Step 1 establishes that the worst-case regret of any regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ is at least $\\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})$. Direct computation shows that: (i) if $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y}) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}$, then $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})>e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)$; (ii) if $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})<\\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}$, then $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})<\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})-\\bar{y}}{y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})\\right)$ (see Lemma 7). $\\bar{R}$ is then obtained by minimising $\\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})$ over the variable $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(\\bar{y})$ in the relevant range $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2} \\bar{y}\\right]$. Therefore, $\\bar{R} \\leq \\bar{R}(\\mathcal{C})$ for every $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$.

{"section_id": 8, "text": "# 2.4.2 Optimality of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ \n\nThe second part of the proof shows that the two technologies constructed in the first part (Step 1) are the worst-case scenarios for the regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$. Specifically, we first\n\nprove that the regulator's regret under $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is bounded above by\n\n$$\n\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\bar{y}-\\bar{y}}{g-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\bar{y}}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all technologies for which the firm does not produce (Lemma 4). Second, we show that the regulator's regret is at most\n\n$$\n\\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all technologies such that the firm produces (Lemma 5). As previously observed, the minimum linear contract $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is such that $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}$ coincides with minimising $\\underline{w}$ in the definition of $\\bar{R}$. That is,\n\n$$\n\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\bar{y}-\\bar{y}}{g-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\bar{y}}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right)=\\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\left(\\bar{y}-\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star} \\cdot \\bar{y}\\right)=\\bar{R}\n$$\n\nTherefore, Lemmas 4 and 5 establish that the regulator's regret under regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ is no greater than the uniform lower bound $\\bar{R}$, hence proving the optimality of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$.\n\nCase 1: no production. Consider an arbitrary technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A})$ such that the firm does not produce under regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$. Since the firm optimally decides not to produce, no contract in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ (i.e., above $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\star}$ ) can give the firm's a positive profit. In particular, the $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$-optimal action, denoted $\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right)$, cannot be implemented by the linear contract with slope $\\frac{\\mu_{R}-k}{\\mu_{R}}-\\epsilon$, for any small $\\epsilon>0$ (if allowed), where $\\mu_{R}$ denotes the mean of $F_{R}$.

As a result, only the linear contracts are needed to obtain the regulator's best regret guarantee. This is because, as we argued in the first part of the proof, binary technologies maximise regret for minimum linear contract regulations.\n\nCase 2: production. The idea behind Lemma 5 parallels that for Lemma 4. Consider\n\nan arbitrary technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A})$ such that the firm produces. In that case, we use the firm's profit-maximizing behaviour to bind the regulator's regret. Denote by $\\Pi$ the firm's profit and by $\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right)$ the $\\left(R^{f u l l}\\right)$-optimal action, and let $\\mu_{R}$ be the expected output of $F_{R}$. We will bind the regulator's regret by considering the firm's potential deviations to linear contracts. A first observation is that the linear contract with slope $\\frac{\\mu_{R}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{R}}-\\epsilon$ (if allowed) cannot implement $\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right)$ for any ${ }^{23} \\epsilon>0$. Otherwise, the firm could increase her profit. Therefore, there must exist a less productive action $\\left(e_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ with mean $\\mu_{1}<\\mu_{R}$ such that the worker prefers $\\left(e_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ to $\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right)$ when offered the linear contract with slope $\\frac{\\mu_{R}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{R}}$ :\n\n$$\ne_{R}-e_{1} \\geq\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{R}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{R}}-\\epsilon\\right)\\left(\\mu_{R}-\\mu_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIf the linear contract with slope $\\frac{\\mu_{1}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{1}}-\\epsilon$ is authorized, offering it again cannot increase the firm's profit. So, there must again exist another less productive action $\\left(e_{2}, F_{2}\\right)$ with mean $\\mu_{2}<\\mu_{1}$ such that the agent prefers it to $\\left(e_{1}, F_{1}\\right)$ when offered the above linear contract. Proceeding inductively, we construct a chain of actions $\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(e_{1}, F_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow \\ldots$ such that, for all $i$,\n\n$$\ne_{i-1}-e_{i} \\geq\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{i-1}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{i-1}}-\\epsilon\\right)\\left(\\mu_{i-1}-\\mu_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nuntil we reach an action $\\left(e_{N}, F_{N}\\right)$ such that the linear contract with slope $\\frac{\\mu_{N}-\\Pi}{\\mu_{N}}$ is not permitted.

So, allowing all linear contracts above $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{*}$ is also an optimal regulation.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 3 Incorporating Additional Knowledge \n\nA salient question in the recent robustness literature, to which we belong, is to what extent the features derived are robust. That is, there is a \"robustness concern about the robustness literature\" (e.g., Ball and Kattwinkel, 2024; Olszewski, 2024).\n\nMore knowledge? For example, our conclusions are derived under the assumption that the regulator has very little knowledge about the technologies available. We prove our main result, Theorem 1, under the stark assumption that the regulator has no information on the firm's production technology but an upper bound on its expected output, $\\bar{y}$. We take this minimally informed regulator as a natural starting point. It highlights a relevant practical trade-off for regulators about the effects of regulations on incentive provision, and it provides a potential remedy by imposing a minimal piece-rate compensation for workers.\n\nHowever, the regulator may sometimes know more about the possible technologies. In particular, assuming that more costly actions are more \"productive\" seems reasonable. To capture this, economists have typically assumed that actions are ranked according to the Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property (MLRP) (see, e.g., Jewitt, 1988; Innes, 1990; Jewitt et al., 2008). Incorporating this additional knowledge\n\namounts to restricting the set of available technologies to be ${ }^{24}$\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{T}^{M L R P}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{T}=\\left(k, \\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, F_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{T}: i \\geq j \\Rightarrow e_{i} \\geq e_{j} \\text { and } F_{i} \\geq_{M L R P} F_{j}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nA regulator who knows that actions in the production set are MLRP-ranked solve the following problem:\n\n$$\n\\inf _{\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}} \\sup _{\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{M L R P}} R(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})\n$$\n\nProposition 1. The minimal linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ minimises the regulator's regret when they know that $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{M L R P}$ :\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{M L R P}} R\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)=\\min _{\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}} \\max _{\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{M L R P}} R(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})=\\bar{R}\n$$\n\nAccording to Proposition 1 (proved in Appendix C), the minimum linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ is still optimal when the regulator knows that the actions in the production set are ranked according to MLRP. Proposition 1 also implies that $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ is optimal for any intermediate levels of additional knowledge.\n\nCorollary 3. For all technology possibility set $\\mathbb{T}^{\\prime}$ such that $\\mathbb{T}^{M L R P} \\subset \\mathbb{T}^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathbb{T}$, the regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ minimises the regulator's regret when the regulator knows that $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{\\prime}} R\\left(\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)=\\inf _{\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}} \\sup _{\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{\\prime}} R(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ remains optimal under other natural weaker requirements on the set of possible technologies than being MLRP-ranked. For example, if the regulator knows that actions are ranked according to Average Output (AO) or First-Order Stochastic Dominance (FOSD) (e.g., Georgiadis et al., 2024), i.e., the set of possible\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ To allow for general distributions (e.g., mixtures of absolutely continuous and singular distributions), we work with the generalized definition of MLRP by Athey (2002) (Definition A.1).\n\ntechnologies is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{T}^{A O}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{T}=\\left(k, \\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, F_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{T}: i \\geq j \\Rightarrow e_{i} \\geq e_{j} \\text { and } \\mathbb{E}_{F_{i}}[y] \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{F_{j}}[y]\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\text { or } \\mathbb{T}^{F O S D}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{T}=\\left(k, \\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, F_{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{T}: i \\geq j \\Rightarrow e_{i} \\geq e_{j} \\text { and } F_{i} \\geq_{F O S D} F_{j}\\right\\}, \\\\\n& \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*} \\text { remains optimal, since } \\mathbb{T}^{M L R P} \\subset \\mathbb{T}^{F O S D} \\subset \\mathbb{T}^{A O} \\subset \\mathbb{T} \\text {. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProposition 1 and Corollary 3 show that the worst-case scenarios the regulator considers are economically plausible. They satisfy the typical constraints imposed on technologies in moral hazard models. In particular, they confirm that the optimality of the simple minimum linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ and the trade-off we identify stems from meaningful economic concerns rather than unrealistic worstcase technologies.\n\nLess knowledge? On the other hand, our model assumes that the regulator knows the exact maximal expected output possible, $\\bar{y}$. This raises a potential concern: how important is the regulator knowing the precise value $\\bar{y}$ ? To alleviate this concern, we examine how the regret guarantee varies when we perturb the set of possible technologies. This approach, proposed by Ball and Kattwinkel (2024) in defining \"robust robustness,\" allows us to assess the sensitivity of our findings to the assumption that the regulator knows the exact uniform upper bound on expected output. Specifically, we study the impact of small perturbations to the set of possible technologies $\\mathbb{T}$ on the regulator's regret. What happens when we allow technologies that comprise actions whose associated expected output is strictly greater than $\\bar{y}$ ?\n\nTheorem 1 provides an answer. The regulator's regret is continuous in $\\bar{y}$. So, the effect of small perturbations vanishes as the maximal expected output converges to $\\bar{y}$. Our regulation passes the \"robust robustness test.\" It turns out that the optimal minimum linear contract regulation $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ identified in Theorem 1 does even better than passing the test as it does not change with $\\bar{y}$. As a result, $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ remains exactly optimal when we vary $\\bar{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Hence, the optimal regulation is robust to possible mis-\n\nspecifications. Moreover, Theorem 2 establishes that $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$ is the most flexible optimal regulation that is robust to misspecifications. Indeed, points (i) and (ii) imply that any regulation $\\mathcal{C}$ optimal for all possible values of $\\bar{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$must be more restrictive than $\\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{\\alpha}^{*}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# 4 Discussion\n### 4.1 Allocation vs. Incentives\n\nWe have focused on the impact of regulations on the contractual relations between firms and workers and their choices within the organisation. Classic labour markets models, instead, largely view wages as an allocative instrument that determines the matching between workers and firms and the distribution of surplus within each match (e.g., Stigler, 1946; Burdett and Mortensen, 1998; Lee and Saez, 2012; Naidu et al., 2016; Naidu and Posner, 2022; Berger et al., 2025). The key statistics of interest are then the firm-level labour supply elasticities, as wages reflect both workers' productivity and responsiveness to wage variations. These models predict that wages will be lower in markets in which firms have more monopsony power because workers with fewer employment options are less elastic to the firm's offered wage. Wages in monopsonistic markets are below the marginal product of labour, resulting in (inefficient) unemployment as the firms optimally ration their demand for labour. Conversely, competitive markets feature a perfectly elastic labour supply. Wages then price the marginal product of labour, and sorting is efficient. Therefore, the merit of an increase in the minimum wage can be evaluated through its (un)employment effect.\n\nAs a result, researchers have largely evaluated regulations through their effects on wages and (un)employment (Card and Krueger, 1994; Cengiz et al., 2019; Jardim et al., 2022) and on firm's profits (Draca et al., 2011; Bell and Machin, 2018). While the debate remains contentious, a growing body of research has concluded that the\n\nemployment effects of moderate minimum wage increases are close to zero (Card and Krueger, 2016; Wolfson and Belman, 2019). Interpreted through the lenses of the classic models, this result implies that (i) labour markets are not competitive, and consequently, (ii) moderate raises of the minimum wage benefit workers and increase the total surplus. Therefore, the regulatory debate (and, in particular, the debate on the minimum wage) has also focused on the degree of competition in labour markets and the precise calibration of minimum wage increases (e.g., Dube, 2019; Naidu and Posner, 2022; Berger et al., 2025).\n\nHowever, the traditional models studying the labour market as a pure allocation problem have mostly overlooked the role of wages and labour contracts in incentive provision. They implicitly assume that firms adjust solely through hiring and wage posting decisions. Yet, a growing body of literature shows that firms adapt by adjusting prices (Aaronson, 2001; MaCurdy, 2015; Harasztosi and Lindner, 2019), substituting inputs (Lang and Kahn, 1998; Portugal and Cardoso, 2006; Giuliano, 2013; Clemens et al., 2021), or changing monitoring and effort expectations (Coviello et al., 2022; Ku, 2022). ${ }^{25}$ Moreover, increasing the minimum wage can also affect worker retention and reduce turnover (Portugal and Cardoso, 2006; Dube et al., 2016). Reducing the firm-worker relationship to a \"black box\" risks ignoring these additional costs and benefits, leaving us with a potentially incomplete understanding of the trade-offs the regulator faces. How do different regulations change the incentives of firms and workers, the production decisions, or the allocation of surplus within a match? Our model aims to give a first answer by opening the firm's \"black box\" and studying the effect of regulations on the intensive rather than extensive margin.\n\nOptimal Regulation without limited liability. One way to account for the importance of incentive provision is to study the optimal regulation absent limited liability. Indeed, in our model, making the worker liable eliminates moral-hazard distortions. The firm's problem (II) admits an efficient solution: selling the firm to the worker.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ Clemens (2021) offers an up-to-date exhaustive review.\n\nThe worker becomes the residual claimant of the surplus and, hence, chooses the efficient action. Proposition 2 below characterizes the optimal regulation without limited liability constraints. Its proof is in Appendix D.3.\n\nProposition 2. The regulation $\\mathcal{C}^{\\text {noLL }}=\\left\\{w: \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\mid w(y)=y-S\\right.$ for some $\\left.S \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\alpha-1} \\bar{y}\\right\\}$ is optimal when the worker is not protected by limited liability. Moreover,\n\n$$\nW C R\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{\\text {noLL }}\\right)=\\alpha \\frac{\\alpha-1}{2 \\alpha-1} \\bar{y}=\\underline{R}\n$$\n\nThe optimal regulation caps the price the firm can ask the worker. Conditional on production, it therefore does not create any inefficiency. It, however, may prevent high-cost firms from producing to guarantee that the workers employed by more productive firms enjoy some of the surplus created. In that case, the regulator's regret is strictly smaller than their regret when the worker is protected by limited liability: $\\bar{R}>\\underline{R}$, which points to the importance of accounting for the moral hazard problem.\n\nOur findings in Section 2 illustrates this. Neglecting moral hazard can be deceiving. We may overlook rent-extraction distortions and, hence, the trade-off that arises between worker protection and contractual flexibility. They also highlight a new cost: minimum wage regulations compress the pay schedule, demotivating effort and exacerbating inefficiencies. Still, we show that contract regulations can be a useful regulatory tool when the regulator has redistributive preferences, even absent extensive margin responses.\n\nMoreover, studying the regulation of contracts has an additional benefit. It moves us beyond the view that labour market regulations amount to price control. Viewed as price floors, minimum wages struggle to boost efficiency when firms' productivity levels differ since (i) the minimum wage bites most for near-competitive, lowproductivity firms, (ii) the range of employment-increasing minimum wages at lowproductivity firms is small since labour supply is elastic, (iii) employment gains quickly become employment losses as firms shrink, and (iv) large firms that ac-\n\ncount for the most distortions respond little to change in the minimum wage (Berger et al., 2025). Considering contracts regulation instead allows for more tailored policy instruments, as firms with different technologies may choose different contracts. Hence, our findings suggest that approaches more nuanced than a blanket minimum wage (e.g., conditioning on output measures, like the pay standards implemented by New York City for high-volume for-hire services in 2019, the minimum pay per mile and minutes for gig drivers imposed in Washington state in 2022, or the minimal profit-sharing rule in France, may help achieve some of the missing efficiency gains in Berger et al. (2025).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 4.2 Future research \n\nWe have focused on the effect of regulation on incentive provision in the moral hazard model with limited liability. There are other forms of moral hazard that we did not consider: for example, the risk-incentive trade-off, multi-tasking and misaligned performance measures, or moral hazard in teams. The trade-offs there may differ, leading to different optimal regulations. These are interesting questions left for future research.\n\nSimilarly, we focus on the regulation of contracts and shut down any other instrument a regulator may have. One widely studied such instrument is taxes (see, for instance, the large literature on optimal taxation: Mirrlees, 1971; Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1976; Saez, 2001; Piketty and Saez, 2013, among many others). Redistributive taxation aims to equalise production benefits ex-post. In contrast, the regulation we consider is predistributive, namely, it \"encourages a more equal distribution of economic power and rewards\" ex-ante (Hacker, 2011). Predistribution has received less attention and, yet, has been shown to be an important factor in the lower levels of inequality observed in Europe compared to the United States (Blanchet et al., 2022; Bozio et al., 2024). ${ }^{26}$ This paper thus contributes to the normative investigation of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ Kuziemko et al.

For any regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$,\n\n$$\nW C R(\\mathcal{C}) \\geq \\sup _{0 \\leq y \\leq \\bar{y}} \\alpha \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. Suppose that the production set $\\mathcal{A}$ contains a single action producing the output level $0 \\leq y^{\\prime} \\leq \\bar{y}$ with probability 1 at zero cost, $\\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{\\left(0, \\delta_{\\left\\{y^{\\prime}\\right\\}}\\right)\\right\\}$, and that the operational cost $k$ is such that $0 \\leq k<y^{\\prime}$. Given the technology $\\mathcal{T}=(k, \\mathcal{A})$ and the regulation $\\mathcal{C}$, the maximal profit the firm can obtain is\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)-k\n$$\n\nwhere $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\inf \\left\\{w\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right): w \\in \\mathcal{C}_{0}\\right\\}$. If $k>y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$, no contract is signed between the firm and the worker, as the firm strictly prefers her outside option to the best available contract in $\\mathcal{C}$. The regret for the regulator is then\n\n$$\nR(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})=\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k\\right)\n$$\n\nsince contract $w^{R}$ such that $w^{R}(y)=(y-k) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{y^{\\prime}=y\\right\\}}$ implements action $\\left(0, \\delta_{\\left\\{y^{\\prime}\\right\\}}\\right)$ and allocates the entire surplus to the worker. Taking the supremum over $k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\right.$ $\\left.\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$, we obtain\n\n$$\nW C R(\\mathcal{C}) \\geq \\alpha \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we obtain the bound in Lemma 1 by taking the supremum over $0 \\leq y^{\\prime} \\leq$ $\\bar{y}$.\n\nLemma 2. For any regulation $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$,\n\n$$\nW C R(\\mathcal{C}) \\geq \\alpha \\sup _{0 \\leq y \\leq \\bar{y}} e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)-y}{y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)}}\\left(y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} y\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. For all $0 \\leq y \\leq \\bar{y}$, define $\\underline{w}^{C}(y)=\\inf \\{w(y): w \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}^{I C}=$ $\\left\\{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}: \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y) \\leq \\frac{1}{2} y\\right\\}$. If $\\mathcal{Y}^{I C}=\\emptyset$, we are done since, by definition, the regret is non negative. So, suppose that $\\mathcal{Y}^{I C} \\neq \\emptyset$, and let $y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{I C}$.\n\nLet the operational cost $k$ be (strictly) smaller than $y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$. Denote by $B_{i}$ the binary output distribution with support $\\left\\{0, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ and mean $i$. Define $\\underline{i}=y^{\\prime} \\frac{k}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}$ and the production set $\\mathcal{A}^{k}$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}^{k}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right): i \\in I=\\left[\\underline{i}, y^{\\prime}\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere, for all $i \\in I$,\n\n$$\ne_{i}=i-\\frac{k y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}+k\\left(\\ln \\left(\\frac{k y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)-\\ln (i)\\right)\n$$\n\nFor all $0 \\leq k<y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$, the distributions $B_{i}, i \\in I$, are supported on $\\left\\{0, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{A}^{k}$ is compact and satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2.\n\nBy definition of $e_{i}$, for all $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial i}\\left(\\ell^{w} i-e_{i}\\right)=\\ell^{w}-\\frac{i-k}{i} \\geq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\ell^{w} \\geq \\frac{i-k}{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ell^{w}=\\frac{w\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}{y^{\\prime}}$. So, for $\\underline{i}<i<y^{\\prime},\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right)$ is implementable by $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ if and only if\n\n$$\nw\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{i-k}{i} y^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nAction $\\underline{i}$ is only implementatble by $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}$, and action $i=y^{\\prime}$ is implementable by $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$\n\nif and only if\n\n$$\nw\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq \\frac{y^{\\prime}-k}{y^{\\prime}} y^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nNext, observe that, for all $i \\in[\\underline{i}, y^{\\prime}]$, any contract that implements $\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right)$ gives a profit of at most zero to the principal. As a result, any contract that implements $\\left(e_{y^{\\prime}}, B_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)$ is a regulator's preferred contract. They maximise the total surplus, since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} e_{i} \\leq 1$, and allocate all of it to the worker:\n\n$$\nV(\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, since no contract gives the firm a strictly positive payoff, in the worst-case scenario for the regulator, the firm chooses her outside option. The regulator's regret is then\n\n$$\nR(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T})=V(\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nPlugging in the effort cost, the regret is equal to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right) & =\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-y^{\\prime}+\\frac{k y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}-k\\left(\\ln \\left(\\frac{k y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)-\\ln \\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\alpha k\\left(\\frac{y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}-\\ln \\left(\\frac{k}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)-1\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the worst-case regret is obtained by maximizing over all possible technologies, we can obtain a lower bound by taking the supremum of the above expression with respect to $k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{C}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$. Since the function $k \\rightarrow \\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)$ is continuous on $\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]$, its supremum over $k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$ is equal its maximum over\n\n$k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]$. Taking derivatives with respect to $k$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}\\left(\\alpha k\\left(\\frac{y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}-\\ln \\left(\\frac{k}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)-1\\right)\\right) \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\frac{y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}-\\ln \\left(\\frac{k}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right)-2 \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & k \\leq e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)-y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}}\\left(y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, $\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-k-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)$ is maximised over $k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]$ at\n\n$$\nk=e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)-y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}}\\left(y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows that the regulator's worst-case regret is bounded below by\n\n$$\nW C R(\\mathcal{C})=\\sup _{\\mathcal{T}} R(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{T}) \\geq \\sup _{k \\in\\left[0, y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)} R\\left(\\mathcal{C},\\left(k, \\mathcal{A}^{k}\\right)\\right)=\\alpha e^{\\frac{2 \\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)-y^{\\prime}}{y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}}\\left(y^{\\prime}-\\underline{w}^{C}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $y^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{I C}$ was arbitrary, the lower bound in Lemma 2 follows.\nLemma 3. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. For all $y \\geq 0$, define $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)=\\inf \\{w(y): w \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$. Then\n\n$$\nW C R(\\mathcal{C}) \\geq \\alpha e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} \\sup _{0 \\leq y \\leq \\bar{y}}\\left(y-\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{0}$. For all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, define $\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}(y)=\\inf \\{w(y): w \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$. Let $0 \\leq \\mu_{F} \\leq$ $y^{\\prime} \\leq \\bar{y}$ and $\\Pi=\\left(1-\\frac{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}{y^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mu_{F}$. Denote by $B_{i}$ the binary output distribution with support $\\left\\{0, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ and mean $i$. Define the production set $\\mathcal{A}^{\\Pi}$ as\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}^{\\mu_{F}}=\\left\\{\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right): i \\in I=\\left[\\mu_{F}, y^{\\prime}\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere, for all $i \\in I$,\n\n$$\ne_{i}=i-\\mu_{F}+\\Pi\\left(\\ln \\left(\\mu_{F}\\right)-\\ln i\\right)+\\frac{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}{y^{\\prime}} \\mu_{F}\n$$\n\nWe consider the technology $\\mathcal{T}=\\left(0, \\mathcal{A}^{\\mu_{F}}\\right)$, i.e., we assume that the firm has no operational cost. For all $0 \\leq \\mu_{F} \\leq y^{\\prime}$, the distributions $F_{i}, i \\in I$, are supported on $\\left\\{0, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{A}^{k}$ is compact and satisfies Assumptions 1 and 2.\n\nBy definition of $e_{i}$, for all $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial i}\\left(\\ell^{w} i-e_{i}\\right)=\\ell^{w}-\\frac{i-\\Pi}{i} \\geq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\ell^{w} \\geq \\frac{i-\\Pi}{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\ell^{w}=\\frac{w\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}{y^{\\prime}}$. So, $\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right)$ with $i<y^{\\prime}$ is implementable by $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ if and only if\n\n$$\nw\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{i-\\Pi}{i} y^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhile action $i=y^{\\prime}$ is implementable by $w \\in \\mathcal{C}$ if and only if\n\n$$\nw\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq \\frac{y^{\\prime}-\\Pi}{y^{\\prime}} y^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nNext, observe that, for all $i$, any contract that implements $\\left(e_{i}, B_{i}\\right)$ gives a profit of at most $\\Pi$ to the principal, and exactly $\\Pi$ if the inequality holds with equality, since\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\frac{i-\\Pi}{i}\\right) \\mathbb{E}_{B_{i}}[y]=\\Pi\n$$\n\nMoreover, the contract $w(y)=y$ implements the surplus maximizing action $\\left(e_{y^{\\prime}}, B_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)$ (since $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial i} e_{i} \\leq 1$ ), and leaves no profit to the firm, hence allocating the entire surplus to the worker. So, it is the regulator's preferred contract.\n\n$$\nV(\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha\\left(y^{\\prime}-e_{y^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince no contract gives the firm a strictly higher profit than $\\Pi$, in the worst-case scenario, she decides to implement the least productive action, generating the average\n\noutput $\\mu_{F}$.

So, we obtain a sequence $\\left\\{\\left(e_{j}, F_{j}\\right)\\right\\}_{0 \\leq j \\leq N \\leq \\infty}$, where $\\left(e_{0}, F_{0}\\right)=\\left(e_{R}, F_{R}\\right)$, such that, for all $1 \\leq j \\leq N-1, \\mu_{j+1}<\\mu_{j}$ and\n\n$$\ne_{j}-e_{j+1}>\\left(1-\\epsilon_{1}-\\frac{1-\\frac{\\rho_{1} \\cdot \\bar{y}}{\\bar{y}}}{\\mu_{j}} \\mu_{F}\\right)\\left(\\mu_{j}-\\mu_{j+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some $0<\\epsilon_{j}<\\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon_{j-1}$. If $N=\\infty$, passing to a subsequence and relabeling if necessary, we can assume that the sequence $\\left\\{\\left(e_{j}, F_{j}\\right)\\right\\}_{0 \\leq j \\leq N=\\infty}$ converges to some action $\\left(e_{\\infty}, F_{\\infty}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{A}$ with mean $\\mu_{\\infty}$ since $\\mathcal{A}$ is compact by Assumption 1.

Assume that the operational cost $k$ is such that $k<\\bar{y}-\\frac{\\underline{w}^{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\bar{y}^{\\prime}} \\bar{y}$.

It yields profit $\\bar{\\Pi}$ in the first case and $\\underline{\\Pi}$ in the second.

Property (i) holds by definition: $k^{0}=0$.

The regulator's regret is therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right) & =V(\\mathcal{T})-\\left(P\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)-k+\\alpha W S\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& =(\\alpha-1)\\left(P\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)-k\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince for all $y \\geq 0$ and $w \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, y-w(y) \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\alpha-1} \\bar{y}$,\n\n$$\nP\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\alpha-1} \\bar{y}\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right) & =(\\alpha-1)\\left(P\\left(\\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}, \\mathcal{T}\\right)-k\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq(\\alpha-1)\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\alpha-1} \\bar{y}-k\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq \\underline{R}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the above holds for an arbitrary technology $\\mathcal{T} \\in \\mathbb{T}, \\mathcal{C}^{n o L L}$ is optimal.

A regulator chooses the set of permissible contracts to (i) improve\nefficiency and (ii) protect the worker. The regulator does not know the\nworker's actions and the firm's costs and evaluates regulations by their\nworst-case regret. The regret-minimising regulation imposes a minimum piece\nrate compensation for the worker: it allows all contracts above a minimum\nlinear contract. The slope of the minimum contract balances the worker's\nprotection and the necessary flexibility for incentive provision.", "updated": "2025-02-17T15:39:30Z", "published": "2024-11-07T16:31:03Z"}
