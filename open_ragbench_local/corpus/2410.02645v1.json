(2015) for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) to derive an approximate formula for credit default swap (CDS) spread under the two-dimensional shifted square-root diffusion (SSRD) model of Brigo and Alfonsi (2005), within a stochastic intensity framework. Unlike the original approach, which assumed uncorrelated interest rate and default intensity factors for calibration, we derive our approximation formula and subsequently propose a calibration strategy, without assuming such a condition. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that our approximation formula allows fast calibration to market data and provides accurate estimates of CDS spreads and related survival probabilities.\n\nThe two-dimensional SSRD model is based on the generalised square-root diffusion model introduced by Duffie and Singleton (1999), where both interest rate and default intensity are modelled as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes. A key feature of the SSRD model is its ability to separate the calibration of interest rate and default intensity processes using bond price and credit spread data. The model has gained significant attention and has been extended in later research. For example, Brigo and Cousot (2006) demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing implied volatility patterns in CDS options and compared its performance to a term structure market model. Brigo and El-Bachir (2006) further enhanced the model\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *DSAS, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada. email: aagarw93@uwo.ca\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ ASBS, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom. email: ying.liao@glasgow.ac.uk\n\nby adding jumps to the stochastic intensity process, enabling better calibration to default swaptions across various strikes and maturities. Later, Brigo and El-Bachir (2010) advanced analytical tractability of the extended SSRD model and developed an exact formula for pricing default swaptions.\n\nIn contrast to the SSRD model, recent developments in credit derivatives modelling have focused on integrating market dynamics - such as stock prices, volatilities, and default intensities - while making more restrictive assumptions about interest rate. Carr and Linetsky (2006) introduced the jump-to-default constant elasticity of variance (JDCEV) model, a hybrid credit-equity framework where stock prices follow a diffusion process with the potential to drop to zero at default. In this model, interest rate is assumed to be positive and deterministic, and the default intensity is linked to the instantaneous variance of stock price. Di Francesco et al. (2019) extended this model by introducing a stochastic interest rate, which can be negative, using the Vasicek process, relaxing the assumption of positive and deterministic rate. However, these assumptions, particularly around interest rate, may not fully reflect recent market conditions, such as the Bank of Japan's decision to raise rates in March 2024, signaling an end to the era of negative interest rate.\n\nWhile the SSRD model provides key advantages, it does not offer a closed-form solution for CDS spreads, requiring approximation methods. Brigo and Alfonsi (2005) proposed an analytical approximation using the Vasicek-mapping technique to price CDS within the SSRD framework. This method involves mapping the two-dimensional correlated CIR dynamics to a correlated Vasicek model, then calculating the CDS spread using the Vasicek dynamics. In this work, we avoid the mapping approach and derive an asymptotic approximation for the CDS spread directly within the SSRD model. Recently, Lorig et al. (2017) introduced a unified method for pricing European-style options across various volatility models, building on earlier work of Pagliarani and Pascucci (2012) and Lorig et al. (2015). Their approach uses Taylor's expansions to solve nonlinear PDEs with state-dependent coefficients. We apply their method to derive a second-order asymptotic approximation for CDS spreads, using the CDS pricing framework of Brigo and Alfonsi (2005). Based on this approximation, we propose a new calibration technique that does not assume uncorrelated interest rate and default intensity factors. Through extensive numerical tests with real-world data, we show that our second-order approximation accurately estimates CDS spreads and outperforms the mapping approximation in the SSRD model.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the operational mechanism of CDS and reviews the SSRD model. Section 3 establishes the notations, and Section 4 outlines the asymptotic approximation technique. Section 5 presents the explicit approximation formulas for the CDS spread and risk-neutral survival probability. Section 6 details the model calibration process, and Section 7 demonstrates the numerical performance of the proposed method in the calibrated model. The appendices A. 1 to A. 3 contain the explicit expression for the second-order approximation formula of CDS spread and additional calibration results.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Model and assumptions \n\nA credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative that insures against the default risk of a specific entity, called the reference entity. The protection buyer has the right to sell the reference entity's bonds at face value if a default occurs, with the notional principal defining this face value. To maintain this right, the buyer pays premiums to the seller, based on a percentage of the notional principal determined by the CDS spread. The protection seller compensates the buyer upon default, typically paying a percentage of\n\nthe notional principal known as the loss-given-default, which equals one minus the recovery rate.\nFor analytical simplicity, we assume frictionless financial markets with no arbitrage opportunities or dividends. Following Duffie and Singleton (1999), we model an entity's default as an exogenous process that is independent of default-free markets, with no economic or financial indicators predicting its occurrence. This means the default dynamic is entirely governed by the default intensity process. The default intensity at time $t$, symbolised by $\\lambda_{t}$, is defined as the instantaneous probability of the default event. We assume that the default intensity is time-dependent, stochastic, and strictly positive at all times, i.e., $\\lambda_{t}>0$ for $t \\geq 0$.\n\nAssumption 1. The default is hypothesised as the first jump in a Cox process (doubly stochastic Poisson process), and the time $\\tau$ at which the default occurs, is characterised as the initial jump time within this framework.\n\nLet us introduce a complete filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathbb{P})$, where $\\mathbb{P}$ denotes the risk-neutral pricing measure based on the short-term interest rate process $r_{t}$. We define the filtration $\\mathbb{D}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{D}_{t}, t \\geq 0\\right\\}$, where $\\mathcal{D}_{t}:=\\sigma\\left(\\mathrm{D}_{u} \\mid u \\leq t\\right)$, with a right-continuous process $\\mathrm{D}_{t}:=\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau \\leq t\\}}$, capturing the occurrence and precise timing of a default event. Moreover, we define the filtration $\\mathbb{F}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}, t \\geq 0\\right\\}$, representing the information of the default-free market up to time $t$. Let $\\mathbb{G}:=\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{t}, t \\geq 0\\right\\}$, be an arbitrary filtration on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathbb{P})$, which is assumed to satisfy $\\mathbb{G}=\\mathbb{F} \\vee \\mathbb{D}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{G}_{t}=\\mathcal{F}_{t} \\vee \\mathcal{D}_{t}$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{G}$ is the enlarged filtration. This probability space forms the foundation for all subsequent stochastic processes, with expectations calculated with respect to $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nDefinition 1. (Brigo and Mercurio (2001), Section 22.2.3) Let $\\Lambda_{t}$ denote the cumulative intensity up to time $t$, which is defined through the formula $\\Lambda_{t}:=\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s$. By the property of the Cox process, the default time is permitted to be denoted as $\\tau:=\\Lambda^{-1}(\\xi)$, where $\\xi$ is a standard exponential random variable independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$.\n\nRemark 1. Assuming that the default intensity $\\lambda_{t}$ indicates the instantaneous probability of default in the infinitesimal interval $[t, t+\\mathrm{d} t]$, given no prior default, it can be inferred that\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{t} \\mathrm{~d} t=\\mathbb{P}(t \\leq \\tau<t+\\mathrm{d} t \\mid \\tau \\geq t)\n$$\n\nThus, the survival probability at time $t$, under the risk-neutral measure, is given as\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\tau \\geq t)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\xi \\geq \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s}\\right]\n$$\n\nWithin the two-dimensional shifted square-root diffusion (SSRD) model proposed by Brigo and Alfonsi (2005), the short-term interest rate $r_{t}$ and the default intensity $\\lambda_{t}$ are modelled as correlated Cox-IngersollRoss (CIR) processes. The model dynamics are given as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{d} r_{t} & =\\alpha_{1}\\left(\\beta_{1}-r_{t}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma_{1} \\sqrt{r_{t}} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\mathrm{d} \\lambda_{t} & =\\alpha_{2}\\left(\\beta_{2}-\\lambda_{t}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma_{2} \\sqrt{\\lambda_{t}} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(2)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{W}_{t}^{(1)}$ and $\\mathrm{W}_{t}^{(1)}$ are standard Brownian motions under $\\mathbb{P}$, with instantaneous correlation $\\rho \\in[-1,1]$. That is, $\\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(1)} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(2)}=\\rho \\mathrm{d} t$. To ensure that the interest rate and the default intensity always remain positive, the parameters must satisfy the following Feller conditions\n\n$$\n2 \\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1}>\\sigma_{1}^{2}, \\quad 2 \\alpha_{2} \\beta_{2}>\\sigma_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}$ are constants.\nRemark 2. In the SSRD model (2), the formula for the risk-neutral survival probability is analogous to that for the zero-coupon bond ( ZCB ) price.

Thus, from the derivations above, we get the formula for CDS spread in (3).\n\nRemark 3. Market CDS spread at any time can be obtained by setting $t=0$ in (3) and adjusting the remaining time to maturities accordingly.

Thus, we derive the approximation formulas for it using the approximation method and procedure outlined in Pascucci (2011), Lorig et al. (2015) and Lorig et al.

We assume that the coefficients $a_{\\alpha}$ are bounded and have globally Lipschitz continuous derivatives up to order $\\mathrm{N} \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, with the derivatives having a bounded norm. Moreover, we denote by $\\left(a_{\\alpha, n}(t, z)\\right)_{0 \\leq n \\leq \\mathrm{N}}$ an N -th order polynomial expansion for any $t \\in[0, \\mathrm{~T}]$, where $a_{\\alpha, n}(t, z)$ are polynomials with state-independent $a_{\\alpha, 0}$, i.e, $a_{\\alpha, 0}(t, \\cdot)=a_{\\alpha, 0}(t)$.

(2015) to derive their higherorder approximations, which can potentially be more accurate than their corresponding approximations obtained from the Vasicek-mapping technique.\n\nTo facilitate the analysis, we introduce functions $v(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})$ and $h(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})$, which are defined as follows\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nv(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T}):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} s} x_{\\mathrm{s}}+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{2} s} y_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s} \\mid x_{t}=x, y_{t}=y\\right], & t \\in[0, \\mathrm{~T}] \\\\\nh(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T}):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} s} x_{\\mathrm{s}}+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{2} s} y_{\\mathrm{s}}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s} y_{\\mathrm{T}} \\mid x_{t}=x, y_{t}=y\\right], & t \\in[0, \\mathrm{~T}]\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwith the transformations\n\n$$\nx_{t}:=\\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} t} r_{t}, \\quad y_{t}:=\\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{2} t} \\lambda_{t}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the SSRD model (2) is transformed to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{d} x_{t} & =\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} t} \\mathrm{~d} t+\\sigma_{1} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} t} x_{t}} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\mathrm{d} y_{t} & =\\alpha_{2} \\beta_{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{2} t} \\mathrm{~d} t+\\sigma_{2} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{2} t} y_{t}} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(2)} \\\\\n\\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(1)} \\mathrm{dW}_{t}^{(2)} & =\\rho \\mathrm{d} t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAccording to the Feynman-Kac principle, (13) and (14) are the solutions to the following Cauchy problems, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\left(\\partial_{t}+\\mathcal{A}(t)\\right) v(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})=0, & v(\\mathrm{~T}, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})=1 \\\\\n\\left(\\partial_{t}+\\mathcal{A}(t)\\right) h(t, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})=0, & h(\\mathrm{~T}, x, y, \\mathrm{~T})=y\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere the operator $\\mathcal{A}(t)$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(t)=a(t, x, y) \\partial_{x x}+b(t, x, y) \\partial_{y y}+c(t, x, y) \\partial_{x y}+\\kappa(t, x, y) \\partial_{x}+k(t, x, y) \\partial_{y}+\\gamma(t, x, y)\n$$\n\nwith the coefficients $a, b, c, \\kappa, k$, and $\\gamma$ specified accordingly as,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\na(t, x, y):=\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{1}^{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} t} x, & b(t, x, y):=\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_{2}^{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{2} t} y, & c(t, x, y):=\\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\frac{\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}\\right) t}{2}} x^{\\frac{1}{2}} y^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\n\\kappa(t, x, y):=\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} t}, & k(t, x, y):=\\alpha_{2} \\beta_{2} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{2} t}, & \\gamma(t, x, y):=-\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} t} x+\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{2} t} y\\right)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nRemark 5.

Our proposed calibration procedure involves the following three steps:\n\n- Step 1: Calibration of the interest rate model.\n\nWe calibrate the parameters of the interest rate process $r_{t}$ in the SSRD model (2) separately to the ZCB prices generated from the interest rate swap curve, such as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) swap curve. Since $r_{t}$ follows a CIR process, the ZCB price formula is similar to the one stated in Remark 2, which is given as\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}(t, \\mathrm{~T}):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}} r_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s}\\right]=\\widehat{\\mathrm{A}}(t, \\mathrm{~T}) \\mathrm{e}^{-\\widehat{\\mathrm{B}}(t, \\mathrm{~T}) r_{t}}, \\quad t \\in[0, \\mathrm{~T}]\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{A}}(t, \\mathrm{~T}) & :=\\left(\\frac{2 \\widehat{h} \\mathrm{e}^{\\frac{\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\widehat{h}\\right)(\\mathrm{T}-t)}{2}}}{2 \\widehat{h}+\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\widehat{h}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\widehat{h}(\\mathrm{~T}-t)}-1\\right)}\\right)^{\\frac{2 \\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1}}{\\sigma_{1}^{2}}} \\\\\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{~B}}(t, \\mathrm{~T}) & :=\\frac{2\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\widehat{h}(\\mathrm{~T}-t)}-1\\right)}{2 \\widehat{h}+\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\widehat{h}\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\widehat{h}(\\mathrm{~T}-t)}-1\\right)} \\\\\n\\widehat{h} & :=\\sqrt{\\alpha_{1}^{2}+2 \\sigma_{1}^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis calibration step can be formulated as an optimisation problem where the aim is to minimise the difference between the model given prices and the market data. We employ the unweighted nonlinear least squares method, for which the objective function is formalised as follows\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right)} \\mathrm{F}\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{mkt}}}\\left|\\mathrm{P}\\left(0, \\mathrm{~T}_{i}\\right)-\\widehat{\\mathrm{P}}_{i}\\right|^{2}, \\text { s.t. } \\alpha_{1}, \\sigma_{1}>0,2 \\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1}>\\sigma_{1}^{2}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{mkt}}$ is the number of ZCB prices from the market and $\\widehat{\\mathrm{P}}_{i}$ is the market ZCB price observed with maturity $\\mathrm{T}_{i}$. We use the Nelder-Mead method for solving the above optimisation problem. After completing this step, we obtain the calibrated values for parameters $\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{1} . r_{0}$ is observed directly from the market.\n\n- Step 2: Matching the model ZCB price with its approximation.\n\nSince we use the transformed SSRD model (16) to generate the approximation formula for the CDS spread, we need to ensure that the ZCB prices derived from the models for $r_{t}$ and $x_{t}$ are consistent. This is an important calibration step, as it ensures the accuracy of our approximation formula for CDS spreads. Recall that in the transformed SSRD model, interest rate $r_{t}$ is transformed into $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} t} x_{t}$. According to Proposition 3, we can express the ZCB price in terms of $x_{t}$, with $\\bar{x}_{\\text {fixed }}=x$, as follows\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{P}}(t, x, \\mathrm{~T}):=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathrm{e}^{-\\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} s} x_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s} \\mid x_{t}=x\\right]=\\widehat{\\mathrm{P}}_{0}(t, y, \\mathrm{~T})+\\widehat{\\mathrm{P}}_{1}(t, y, \\mathrm{~T}), \\quad t \\in[0, \\mathrm{~T}]\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{0}(t, x, \\mathrm{~T}) & =\\mathrm{e}^{-x \\psi\\left(-\\alpha_{1}, t, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)-\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1} \\Theta\\left(-\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{1}, t, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)} \\\\\n\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{1}(t, x, \\mathrm{~T}) & =\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{0}(t, x, \\mathrm{~T}) \\sigma_{1}^{2} \\psi\\left(-\\alpha_{1}, t, \\mathrm{~T}\\right) \\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{1} s}\\left(x \\psi\\left(\\alpha_{1}, t, s\\right)+\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1} \\Theta\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{1}, t, s\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} s \\\\\n& +\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}_{0}(t, x, \\mathrm{~T}) \\sigma_{1}^{4} \\psi\\left(-\\alpha_{1}, t, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)^{3} \\int_{t}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{e}^{\\alpha_{1} s}\\left(x \\psi\\left(\\alpha_{1}, t, s\\right)+\\alpha_{1} \\beta_{1} \\Theta\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{1}, t, s\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo maintain consistency in the ZCB prices across the two representations, we introduce a volatility parameter $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}(0, \\mathrm{~T})^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right)}=\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}\\left(0, x_{0}, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIn the above, $\\mathrm{P}(0, \\mathrm{~T})^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right)}$ is the ZCB price generated from the original SSRD model (2), while $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}\\left(0, x_{0}, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}\\right)}$ is the ZCB price generated the transformed SSRD model (2) with volatility parameter $\\sigma_{1}$ being replaced with $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$. This step is similar to the \"particular Vasicek volatility\" calculation in Brigo and Alfonsi (2005, Page 16). Given that volatility is a positive constant, in the above equation we can replace $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}^{2}$ with $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ instead and solve a quadratic equation in $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$. If the quadratic equation does have solutions, we select the positive square root of the smaller positive $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ as the volatility parameter $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$. However, if the quadratic equation does not have a real solution, we choose the value of $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ that minimises the difference between $\\mathrm{P}(0, \\mathrm{~T})^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{1}\\right)}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{P}}\\left(0, x_{0}, \\mathrm{~T}\\right)^{\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}, \\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}\\right)}$ as the particular volatility. From a practical viewpoint, the volatility parameter $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ can be interpreted as the time-averaged value of $\\sigma_{1} \\sqrt{r_{t}}$ over the interval $[0, \\mathrm{~T}]$. We only compute and utilise the volatility parameter $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ corresponding to the longest maturity in the CDS spread dataset. For instance, if we use a CDS spread dataset covering maturities from 1 year to 10 years for the final calibration, we calculate and apply $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ for the 10-year term using (25). In the following calibration steps, we employ $\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{1}$ as the volatility parameter for the interest rate model, instead of $\\sigma_{1}$ obtained in the first step.\n\n- Step 3: Final calibration.\n\nIn this step, we calibrate the parameters $\\Xi:=\\left(\\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{2}, \\sigma_{2}, \\lambda_{0}, \\rho\\right)$ in the transformed SSRD model (16) to the market data on CDS spread using the first-order approximation formula in (18). Using the first-order approximation formula ensures that this step is computationally quick. Moreover, we observe that no loss of precision occurred even when calculating the final estimate using a secondorder approximation formula. In this step, we employ a weighted nonlinear least squares method to minimise the difference between the market CDS spreads and the model CDS spreads, where the weights are chosen to account for different levels of reliability or variability in the market data. The objective function is given as\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\Xi} \\mathrm{F}(\\Xi)=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{mkt}}} \\omega_{i}\\left|\\mathrm{R}_{i}-\\widehat{\\mathrm{R}}_{i}\\right|^{2}, \\text { s.t. } \\alpha_{2}, \\sigma_{2}, \\lambda_{0}>0,-1 \\leq \\rho \\leq 1\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{mkt}}$ denotes the number of market CDS spread values used, $\\omega_{i}$ denotes the weight of each term, $\\mathrm{R}_{i}$ denotes the model CDS spread with maturity $\\mathrm{T}_{i}$, and $\\widehat{\\mathrm{R}}_{i}$ denotes the market CDS spread observed with maturity $\\mathrm{T}_{i}$. In the case where we assume $\\rho=0$, the objective function simplifies to\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\Xi} \\mathrm{F}(\\widehat{\\Xi})=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{mkt}}} \\omega_{i}\\left|\\mathrm{R}_{i}-\\widehat{\\mathrm{R}}_{i}\\right|^{2}, \\text { s.t. } \\alpha_{2}, \\sigma_{2}, \\lambda_{0}>0\n$$\n\nWhen presenting the numerical results in Section 7, we specify the choice of weights depending on the available data.\n\nAfter obtaining all the parameter estimates from the calibration procedure, we compute the estimate for the CDS spread using (4) with $\\mathrm{N}=2$.

We also conduct a comparison study with the data reported in Di Francesco et al. (2019), where the main focus is on negative interest rate. In all cases presented here, as well as in Appendix A. 2 and Appendix A.3, it is evident that our approximation formula provides an excellent fit to the market data. Furthermore, the survival probabilities estimated using our approximation are highly accurate when compared with those inferred from the market CDS spreads. Based on the reported computational time in Table 12 and Table 18, we can also conclude that our approximation formula facilitates an efficient and fast calibration to the market data. All experiments are conducted on an Apple M2 Chip (8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine) and 8 GB Unified Memory (RAM).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "### 7.1 Bloomberg data\n\nWe only report calibration results for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co and HSBC Bank PLC here. The results for other banks - Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG - are reported in Appendix A.2. Since the CDS contracts for these entities are traded in different currencies, we calibrated the interest rate CIR model to different daily yields curves for ZCBs, selecting secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) swap curve for the US dollar and Euro short-term rate (ESTR) swap curve for the Euro to generate the corresponding zero rates and ZCB prices. The calibration results for the ZCB price are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. It is evident that our calibration approach yields excellent results.\n\nAs reported on Bloomberg, the maturity dates of CDS contracts are fixed on 20 June and 20 December each year. For a CDS contract traded on 8 April 2024, the 6 -month maturity corresponds to 20 December 2024, and so on. Thus, we compute the actual maturity (in years) using the Actual/360 day-count convention when computing the volatility parameter $\\widehat{\\sigma}_{1}$ (Step 2 in Section 6) and calibrating to the market data on CDS spread. The volatility parameter $\\widehat{\\sigma}_{1}$ are $2.214 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $3.253 \\times 10^{-7}$ for the US dollar and Euro, respectively, calculated based on the longest available actual maturity of CDS spreads.\n\nTable 1: Calibration results for ZCB prices (SOFR)\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\n$\\alpha_{1}=0.88422, \\beta_{1}=0.03816, \\sigma_{1}=0.09597, r_{0}=$ 0.05384 .\n\nTable 2: Calibration results for ZCB prices (ESTR)\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\n$\\alpha_{1}=1.59549, \\beta_{1}=0.02440, \\sigma_{1}=0.18694, r_{0}=$ 0.03963 .\n\nFor this dataset, we choose the following weight formula\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}:=\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\left|\\mathrm{Bid}_{i}-\\mathrm{Ask}_{i}\\right|}{\\sum_{i}^{\\mathrm{N}} \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{mkt}}} \\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathrm{Bid}_{i}-\\mathrm{Ask}_{i}\\right|}}\n$$\n\nas it provides the fastest and best calibration results across various different weight choices. Here, Bid ${ }_{i}$ and $\\mathrm{Ask}_{i}$ correspond to the bid and ask values of the CDS spread with $i$-th maturity, respectively. We design this weight formula to assign greater importance to terms with higher liquidity, and are more likely to cause significant calibration error. Additionally, we compare the accuracy of our approximation for the CDS spread with the Vasicek-mapping technique from Brigo and Alfonsi (2005). In a nutshell, their procedure is composed of three stages:\n\n1. Calibrate the parameters in the interest rate and default intensity processes separately to the interest rates and credit markets, assuming zero correlation between the two processes.\n2. Compute the \"particular Vasicek volatilities\", denoted as mapping volatilities, by employing the mapping equation from Brigo and Alfonsi (2005, page 16) for both interest rate and default intensity processes.\n3. Use the obtained parameters in the two-dimensional Vasicek model with customised correlation values to compute the estimates of CDS spread, referred to as the mapping approximations.\n\nWhen computing the mapping approximations, the parameter values for the interest rate process remain the same as those presented in Table 1 and Table 2. The mapping volatilities of the interest rate model are 0.01915 and 0.02962 for the US dollar and Euro, respectively. The parameter values for the default intensity model are obtained by calibrating the survival probability formula to the market data. These values are reported in Table 3. The mapping volatilities of the default intensity process are 0.01915 for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co and 0.0056 for HSBC Bank PLC. The longest available CDS spread actual maturity is used when computing the mapping volatilities. For the correlated case, we consider only extreme values of correlation in the mapping approximations and report the better of the two results.\n\nTable 3: Parameters obtained from the calibration of default intensity process for computing mapping approximation\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nIn Table 4 and Table 5, we present the CDS spread estimates from the SSRD model using asymptotic approximation technique, referred as to the PDE approximation, for two different reference entities, along with the mapping approximations. In Table 6 and Table 7, we also present both approximations while assuming no correlation between the interest rate and default intensity processes. As evident from the results in Table 4 - Table 7, the mapping approximations are highly inaccurate for short maturities, whereas the PDE approximations remain accurate throughout the CDS spread curve. In general, the relative bid-ask values of CDS spread are higher for short-term maturities compared to maturities greater than 5 years, which leads to the poor performance of the Vasicek-mapping technique. Overall, it can be seen that the estimates via our approximation technique are more accurate than mapping approximations.\n\nFurthermore, we can observe that the CDS spread approximations are significantly affected by changes in the correlation parameter, by comparing the results in Table 4 and Table 5 with the results in Table 6 and Table 7. It is apparent that assuming no correlation between the interest rate and default intensity processes leads to poorer calibration performance in the SSRD model. Therefore, our approximation technique, which does not assume zero correlation between the two processes, not only ensures that the model aligns well with the market, but also outperforms the Vasicek-mapping technique of Brigo and Alfonsi (2005). We also report the computational time of our calibration procedure in Table 12. Compared with the Vasicek-mapping technique, which required an average of 30 seconds for calibration, our approach achieves significant accuracy without requiring too much extra time. In addition to JP Morgan Chase \\& Co and HSBC Bank PLC, we also provide calibration results for other entities in Table A.2.1 - Table A.2.4. For those entities as well, the estimates of CDS spread obtained from our approximation technique remain accurate when compared to the market data.\n\nWe also present the estimation results for the risk-neutral survival probability $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Q}}$ using (22) in Table 8 - Table 11. It is clear that our approximation formula yields very accurate estimates. However, we observe that the estimated relative errors slightly increase with longer maturities, a phenomenon attributed to the error bound of our approximation, which increases with time, as stated in Remark 4.\n\nTable 4: Calibration results for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co CDS spreads (correlated case)\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\n${ }^{\\mathrm{a}}$ The correlation coefficient used is $\\rho=-1$.\n${ }^{\\mathrm{b}} \\alpha_{2}=0.00126, \\beta_{2}=1.46292, \\sigma_{2}=0.00039, \\lambda_{0}=0.00207, \\rho=-0.96$.\nTable 5: Calibration results for HSBC Bank PLC CDS spreads (correlated case)\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{\\text {a }}$ The correlation coefficient used is $\\rho=-1$.\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{b}} \\alpha_{2}=0.00433, \\beta_{2}=0.39790, \\sigma_{2}=0.00006, \\lambda_{0}=0.00176, \\rho=-0.45395$.\n\nTable 6: Calibration results for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co CDS spreads (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\n${ }^{*} \\alpha_{2}=0.00176, \\beta_{2}=1.04968, \\sigma_{2}=0.00274, \\lambda_{0}=0.00207$.\nTable 7: Calibration results for HSBC Bank PLC CDS spreads (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_6](table_6)\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{*} \\alpha_{2}=0.00682, \\beta_{2}=0.25644, \\sigma_{2}=0.02269, \\lambda_{0}=0.00174$.\n\nTable 8: Risk-neutral survival probabilities for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co (correlated case)\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\nTable 10: Risk-neutral survival probabilities for JP Morgan Chase \\& Co (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_8](table_8)\n\n[^0]Table 9: Risk-neutral survival probabilities for HSBC Bank PLC (correlated case)\n\n![table_9](table_9)\n\nTable 11: Risk-neutral survival probabilities for HSBC Bank PLC (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_10](table_10)\n\n[^0]:    * We apply the PDE approximation method here.\n\nTable 12: Computational time of the calibrations\n\n![table_11](table_11)", "tables": {"table_0": "| Term <br> (year) | Market | Model | Rel. <br> Error |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 | 0.95075 | 0.95263 | $0.1975 \\%$ |\n| 2 | 0.91163 | 0.91316 | $0.1683 \\%$ |\n| 3 | 0.87691 | 0.87759 | $0.0773 \\%$ |\n| 4 | 0.84472 | 0.84430 | $0.0502 \\%$ |\n| 5 | 0.81363 | 0.81262 | $0.1241 \\%$ |\n| 6 | 0.78327 | 0.78227 | $0.1275 \\%$ |\n| 7 | 0.75383 | 0.75311 | $0.0954 \\%$ |\n| 8 | 0.72512 | 0.72506 | $0.0086 \\%$ |\n| 9 | 0.69751 | 0.69806 | $0.0786 \\%$ |\n| 10 | 0.67080 | 0.67207 | $0.1887 \\%$ |", "table_1": "| Term <br> (year) | Market | Model | Rel. <br> Error |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 | 0.96620 | 0.96857 | $0.2449 \\%$ |\n| 2 | 0.94187 | 0.94392 | $0.2174 \\%$ |\n| 3 | 0.92015 | 0.92103 | $0.0962 \\%$ |\n| 4 | 0.89965 | 0.89892 | $0.0810 \\%$ |\n| 5 | 0.87926 | 0.87739 | $0.2129 \\%$ |\n| 6 | 0.85861 | 0.85638 | $0.2601 \\%$ |\n| 7 | 0.83778 | 0.83587 | $0.2279 \\%$ |\n| 8 | 0.81658 | 0.81586 | $0.0880 \\%$ |\n| 9 | 0.79543 | 0.79632 | $0.1123 \\%$ |\n| 10 | 0.77382 | 0.77726 | $0.4439 \\%$ |", "table_2": "|  | $\\alpha_{2}$ | $\\beta_{2}$ | $\\sigma_{2}$ | $\\lambda_{0}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| JP Morgan Chase \\& Co | 0.05815 | 0.04013 | 0.06641 | 0.00145 |\n| HSBC Bank PLC | 0.10298 | 0.02465 | 0.06978 | 0.00090 |", "table_3": "| Term (year) | Market (bps) | Mapping approximation |  | PDE approximation |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Model (bps) | Rel.

(2019), which employs the same asymptotic approximation method of Lorig et al. (2015), but in the extended jump-to-default constant elasticity of variance (JDCEV) model (Carr and Linetsky (2006)). In their model setup, they assumed that the interest rate follows a Vasicek process allowing for negative values. We use the market data as reported in Di Francesco et al. (2019) for performing our comparative calibration study. From Table 13, it is apparent that the CIR model for the interest rate as assumed in the SSRD model offers a much better fit than the Vasicek model used in the extended JDCEV model. The volatility parameter $\\widehat{\\sigma}_{1}$ (Step 2 of Section 6) is computed to be 0.11836 for longest 6-year maturity of CDS spreads.\n\nTable 13: Calibration results for ZCB prices (LIBOR)\n\n![table_12](table_12)\n\nIn this particular calibration study, the following choice of weights in the final optimisation step (Step 3 in Section 6) provides the best results.\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}_{i}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{N}} \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{~T}_{i}}}\n$$\n\nThe idea here is to assign more weight to the CDS spread values corresponding to short-term maturities as they are susceptible to give large calibration errors. The calibration results from our approximation method are presented in Table 14 - Table 17, along with the estimates reported in Di Francesco et al. (2019). It is evident that the estimates using our approximation formula (4) in the transformed SSRD model (16) closely align with the market data, for both correlated and uncorrelated cases. The relative errors are notably small, except for the very short maturity values, such as 1-year maturity, and non-liquid\n\nterms, such as the CDS with 4-year maturity, which are attributed to market incompleteness, as argued in Di Francesco et al. (2019). In addition to the reference entities BNP Paribas and UBS AG, we also present the calibration results for four other distinct entities in Table A.3.1 - Table A.3.4. Our approximation formula also yields excellent results for those entities as well.\n\nTable 14: Calibration results for BNP Paribas CDS spreads (correlated case)\n\n![table_13](table_13)\n\n$\\alpha_{2}=0.00150, \\beta_{2}=2.79211, \\sigma_{2}=0.00033, \\lambda_{0}=0.00350, \\rho=0.06969$.\n\nTable 15: Calibration results for UBS AG CDS spreads (correlated case)\n\n![table_14](table_14)\n\n$\\alpha_{2}=0.00803, \\beta_{2}=0.38923, \\sigma_{2}=0.00176, \\lambda_{0}=0.00274, \\rho=0.96$.\n\nTable 16: Calibration results for BNP Paribas CDS spreads (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_15](table_15)\n\n$\\alpha_{2}=0.00361, \\beta_{2}=1.16567, \\sigma_{2}=0.00097, \\lambda_{0}=0.0035$.\n\nTable 17: Calibration results for UBS AG CDS spreads (uncorrelated case)\n\n![table_16](table_16)\n\n$\\alpha_{2}=0.01021, \\beta_{2}=0.30701, \\sigma_{2}=0.00601, \\lambda_{0}=0.00274$.\n\nTable 18: Computational time of the calibrations\n\n![table_17](table_17)\n\nMoreover, we compute the estimate of the risk-neutral survival probability using (22) and compare it with the market data. The results are reported in Table 19 - Table 22.

Most notably, we derive our approximation without assuming uncorrelated interest rate and default intensity, as required by Brigo and Alfonsi (2005) for their calibration procedure. With several numerical studies using different market data on CDS spread, we demonstrate the efficiency of our calibration procedure and accuracy of our CDS spread approximation, while comparing it with other existing approximations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# References \n\nBielecki, T.

However, we restrict the display of the explicit expression for the approximation formula to the second order, as various numerical experiments indicate that the second-order approximation is sufficiently accurate.\n\nFrom Proposition 2, we obtain the second-order approximation formula of CDS spread at $t=0$, given\n\nby\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}_{2}=\\frac{(1-\\zeta) \\int_{0}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{2} s} \\sum_{n=0}^{2} h_{n}(0, x, y, s) \\mathrm{d} s}{\\int_{0}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\alpha_{2} s} \\sum_{n=0}^{2} h_{n}(0, x, y, s)\\left(s-\\iota_{\\mathrm{N}(s)-1}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s+\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{M}}\\left(t_{i}-t_{i-1}\\right) \\sum_{n=0}^{2} v_{n}\\left(0, x, y, t_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwith the zeroth term $v_{0}$ and $h_{0}$ specified in (20) and (21), respectively.
