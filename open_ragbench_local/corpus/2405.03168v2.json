By applying the Bethe-ansatz method, we can exactly solve the\nwavefunction and eigenvalue of the bound state in the continuum band, which\nenable us to precisely determine the phase diagrams of BIC. Our results\ndemonstrate that the non-reciprocal hopping can delocalize the bound state and\nthus shrink the region of BIC. By analyzing the wavefunction, we identify the\nexistence of two types of BICs with different spatial distributions and\nanalytically derive the corresponding threshold values for the breakdown of\nBICs. The BIC with similar properties is also found to exist in another system\nwith an impurity potential.", "updated": "2025-04-06T13:39:36Z", "published": "2024-05-06T05:22:58Z"}
