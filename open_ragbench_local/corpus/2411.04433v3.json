While recent advances have focused on\nenhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic\nmechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their\nmechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct\napproach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation.\nUsing both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered\nmixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger\ntransverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement\noriginates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture\nof two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The\nidentified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across\ndifferent material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to\nengineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.", "updated": "2025-04-19T04:39:05Z", "published": "2024-11-07T04:56:36Z"}
