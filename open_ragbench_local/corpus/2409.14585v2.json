Introduction\n\nApproximate nonlinear filters often rely on assumptions of unimodality (e.g., Kalman filters [31]) or computationally cheap tractable simulations. The latter mainly refers to sequential Monte Carlo methods, also known as particle filters. Despite their effectiveness in various settings and their asymptotic convergence to the true filter, these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality with respect to the state dimension $[42,44,48,49]$. There is currently a lot of progress within the Bayesian filtering community, e.g., [39], where sampling-based methods have improved substantially $[12,13,22,40,50,53]$. However, the curse of dimensionality remains an open problem for the nonlinear case.\n\nOne motivation for developing methods suitable for a high-dimensional setting comes from applications. There exist numerous domains of applications for Bayesian filtering: target tracking $[7,15,26]$, finance $[17,52]$, chemical engineering [45], and weather forecasts [9, 19, 24], to mention a few prominent ones. Many problems are inherently high-dimensional. An extreme example is [2], in which the authors discuss the challenge in weather forecasting with a corresponding dimension of $10^{7}$ that arises from the spatial domain.\n\nTo address the challenge of high-dimensional applications, effective methods for Bayesian filtering must be developed to manage the complexity of the state space and accurately estimate the filtering probability distribution. In many settings, it is desirable to obtain the probability density of the filter and not only estimates of mean and covariance, or a finite number of particles. We refer to the filtering probability distribution as the probability of observing a hidden state $S_{k}$ given noisy measurements $y_{0: k}$ up to time $k$. If such a density $p_{k}$ exists, it satisfies, for a measurable set $C$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the relation\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(S_{k} \\in C \\mid y_{0: k}\\right)=\\int_{C} p_{k}\\left(x \\mid y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x\n$$\n\nMoreover, it can be shown that this density adheres to an evolution equation: for discrete observations, it satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation [34], and for continuous observations, it satisfies the Kushner-Stratonovich equation [36]. There are approximation techniques that work well in low dimensions to obtain the filtering density through solving these (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These classical techniques, such as finite elements [8] and finite differences, are\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60G25, 60G35, 62F15, 62G07, 62M20, 65C30, 65M75, 68T07.\n    Key words and phrases.

Direct approaches such as PhysicsInformed Neural Networks (PINN) [43], deep Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) methods [1, 20], deep neural operators [38], deep Ritz method [21], deep Picard iterations [29], and more, have shown excellent performance in handling higher dimensions to different degrees. Recently, there was success with a score-based PINN applied to a high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in [30]. However, in general, there are challenges with these methods with respect to modeling probability densities. Specifically, because the Fokker-Planck equation models a probability density function associated with Brownian motion and, since in very high dimensions, its values become extremely small, this poses challenges for existing methods in terms of numerical accuracy.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on further development of one such approximation technique, called Deep Splitting. It was demonstrated to perform very well for PDEs with strong symmetries in dimensions up to 10000 [5], and has been extended to partial integro-differential equations [23]. For the Zakai equation [51], different deep splitting methods have been applied for offline filtering, when the solution is approximated for a single observation sequence $[4,14,37]$. In a subsequent work, deep splitting was combined with an energy-based approach on the Zakai equation and generalized to the online setting where it showed promising results for a state dimension up to $d=20$ [3]. Here we extend it to a format more interesting for most applications in engineering and science, namely the setting where the underlying process $S$ is continuous in time and space, but the observations $O$ are discrete in time. This is done by propagating the Fokker-Planck equation for the prediction and by updating the solution with Bayes' formula at every measurement.\n1.1. Problem formulation. Let $B$ be a Brownian motion on some complete probability space, $T>0$ denote a terminal time for the filtering, and $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{K}=T$ be observation times. The filtering problem in question deals with time-continuous state and time-discrete observations, where the state and observation models are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{d} S_{t}=\\mu\\left(S_{t}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma\\left(S_{t}\\right) \\mathrm{d} B_{t}, \\quad t \\in(0, T] \\\\\n& S_{0} \\sim q_{0} \\\\\n& O_{k} \\sim g\\left(O_{k} \\mid S_{t_{k}}\\right), \\quad k=0, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this setting we refer to the $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$-valued process $S$, solving a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) with drift $\\mu$ and diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$, as the unknown state process and the $\\mathbb{R}^{d^{d}}$-valued variable $O=\\left(O_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$ as the observation process. We stress that (2) is a statistical model, only used in a distributional sense, meaning that pathwise values of $S$ and $O$ are irrelevant and therefore notation for the probability space is not introduced. In any sensible statistical procedure, the distribution of $O$, determined by the model (2) is approximately that of the data $y$, as otherwise the filter will output nonsense. The model implicitly defines a measurement likelihood $L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right):=p\\left(O_{k}=\\right.$ $\\left.y_{k} \\mid S_{t_{k}}=x\\right)=g\\left(y_{k} \\mid x\\right)$, and in Section 2.2 we establish rigorous regularity conditions for the measurement likelihood $L(y, x)$. The standard measurement model, used in almost all publications on filtering with discrete observations, is the Gaussian model with $g\\left(y_{k} \\mid x\\right)=N\\left(y_{k} ; h(x), Q\\right)$, where $h$ is a measurement function and $Q$ is a covariance matrix. The filtering problem, i.e., the problem of obtaining the filtering density (1), assuming the state and observation model (2), and given data $y$, can be solved by recursively solving a Fokker-Planck equation and by updating using Bayes' formula. To formalize the unnormalized exact filter we initialize $p_{0}\\left(0, x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right)$, and recursively define\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{k}\\left(t, x, y_{0: k}\\right)=p_{k}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k}}^{t} A^{*} p_{k}\\left(s, x, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s, \\quad t \\in\\left(t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right], k=0, \\ldots, K-1 \\\\\n& p_{k}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)=p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThroughout this paper the filter, $p_{k}$, is denoted with three arguments $(t, x, y)$, rather than the conventional $(t, x \\mid y)$. This should not be confused with the joint distribution over $(t, x, y)$, which we do not address here. The distribution is unnormalized, since the normalizing factor in\n\nthe Bayes formula has been neglected, but is otherwise a classical Bayesian filtering system of recursive prediction-update steps. The operator $A^{*}$, that appears in the Fokker-Planck equation in (3), is the adjoint of the infinitesimal generator of the diffusion process $S$ in (2). It remains to solve (3) to define $\\left(p_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K-1}$ including a final update at time $t_{K}$ to define $p_{K}$. In Section 2 we introduce a Feynman-Kac based solution $\\widetilde{\\pi}$, that approximates the exact filtering density $p$. It is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n+1}(x, y)\\right)_{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\underset{u \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) ; C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right)-G \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1 \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{0,0}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, 0}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k-1, N}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $Z$ is an Euler-Maruyama approximation of $S$, or rather of the solution $X$ of an SDE with the same distribution as $S$ but driven by a Brownian motion $W$ on a probability space $(\\Omega, A, \\mathbb{P})$. The operator $G$ is a first order differential operator. By solving the optimization problem and finding $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k}$ for all $k=0, \\ldots, K$, one has obtained a machine for approximating the unnormalized filtering density (and prediction density) for all possible measurement sequences $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) \\subset$ $\\mathbb{Y}:=\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(K+1)}$ with probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{Y}$. This makes inference for the online setting very efficient.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is the introduction of this new scheme and its corresponding error analysis. We derive a strong convergence rate in $L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)$ of order 1 in time, assuming a parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition as in [10]. The convergence rate is independent of the distribution of the data $y$. The analysis relies in part on stochastic integration by parts from the Malliavin calculus. See Appendix A for an exposition of this theory.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the setting and notation that we use and derive the approximations. In this section we also show regularity and uniqueness of the solution to (3), and of its approximations, and state the main theorem on strong convergence. Section 3 contains the proof of the strong convergence and some auxiliary lemmas that we need. Finally, in Section 4 we detail the additional approximation steps needed for a tractable method based on neural networks and examine the convergence order numerically.

The online deep splitting filter and main results \n\nIn this section, we present the notation, the background, and formal derivation of the method.\n2.1. Notation. We denote by $\\langle x, y\\rangle$ and $\\|z\\|$ the inner product and norm in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ if $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and the Frobenius norm if $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. The space of functions in $[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, which are $k$ times continuously differentiable in the first variable and $n$ times continuously differentiable in the second variable with no cross derivatives between the variables, is denoted $C^{k, n}\\left([0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. Furthermore, functions in the space $C_{b}^{k, n}\\left([0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ have bounded derivatives. The space $C_{b}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ consists of functions in $C^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ which, together with their derivatives, are of most polynomial growth. Similarly, functions in the space $C_{0}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right) \\subset C^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ are such that they and their derivatives tend to 0 at infinity. For $n$ or $k=\\infty$, we adopt the usual modifications. Let $(A, \\mathcal{B}, \\nu)$ be a measure space and $U$ be a Banach space. By $\\mathcal{L}^{0}(A ; U)$, we denote the space of strongly measurable functions $f: A \\rightarrow U$ and by $L^{0}(A ; U)$ the equivalence classes of functions in $\\mathcal{L}^{0}(A ; U)$ that are equal $\\nu$-almost everywhere. The Bochner spaces $L^{p}(A ; U) \\subset L^{0}(A ; U), p \\in[1, \\infty]$, are defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(A ; U)} & :=\\left(\\int_{A}\\|f(x)\\|_{U}^{p} \\mathrm{~d} \\nu(x)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}<\\infty, \\quad p \\in[1, \\infty) \\\\\n\\|f\\|_{L^{\\infty}(A ; U)} & :=\\sup _{x \\in A}\\|f(x)\\|_{U}<\\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere and throughout the paper, we write sup to mean the essential supremum. For Banach spaces $U$ and $V$, we denote by $\\mathcal{L}(U ; V)$ the space of bounded linear operators that map from $U$ to $V$.\n\nFor smooth vector fields $V, W \\in C^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ we define the Lie bracket of $V$ and $W$ by\n\n$$\n[V, W](x)=D V(x) W(x)-D W(x) V(x), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nHere $D V(x)$ is the Jacobi matrix of $V$ with respect to $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We say that vector fields $V_{0}, \\ldots, V_{n} \\in$ $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ satisfy a parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition if, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{V_{j_{1}}(x),\\left[V_{j_{1}}(x), V_{j_{2}}(x)\\right],\\left[\\left[V_{j_{1}}(x), V_{j_{2}}(x)\\right], V_{j_{3}}(x)\\right], \\ldots ;\\right. \\\\\nj_{i} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\} \\text { for all } i=1, \\ldots, n\\}=\\mathbb{R}^{d}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTo improve clarity, we suppress $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ in equations throughout the paper whenever appropriate. We define the index set $\\mathcal{I}_{K, N}:=\\{0, \\ldots, K-1\\} \\times\\{0, \\ldots, N\\} \\cup\\{K\\} \\times\\{0\\}$, for $K, N \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$. Finally, if $R$ is a stochastic process, then we let $R^{t, x}$ denote the conditioned process $R$ that starts in $x$ at time $t$, so that $R_{t}^{t, x}=x$.\n2.2. Setting. Throughout the rest of Sections 2 and 3 we assume that the following holds. Let $T>0$, and $d, d^{\\prime}, K \\geq 1$ be positive integers. We consider $K+1$ uniformly distributed observation times, denoted $\\left(t_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$, satisfying\n\n$$\n0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{K-1}<t_{K}=T\n$$\n\nwith $t_{k+1}-t_{k}=\\frac{T}{K}$ for $k=0, \\ldots, K-1$. Moreover, for numerical approximations we use a family of finer uniform grids given by\n\n$$\nt_{k}=t_{k, 0}<t_{k, 1}<\\cdots<t_{k, N-1}<t_{k, N}=t_{k+1}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, K-1\n$$\n\nwith $t_{k, n+1}-t_{k, n}=\\frac{T}{K N}$ for $k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1$. In our error analysis, we write $\\tau:=\\frac{T}{K N}$.\nThe underlying state process $\\left(S_{t}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$ is $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$-valued and, for convenience, we define $\\mathbb{Y}:=\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(K+1)}$ to denote the space of data measurements. We denote by $y_{k: n}, 0 \\leq k \\leq n$, the $d^{\\prime} \\times(n-k+1)$-matrix $\\left(y_{k}, y_{k+1}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)$.\nThroughout the paper, we use a filtered probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{A},\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ equipped with a Brownian motion $W$ adapted to $\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$.\nThe assumptions on the functions in the statistical model (2) are listed next.\n(i) The coefficients $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, initial density $q_{0}$, and measurement likelihood $L$ are bounded, infinitely smooth and with bounded derivatives, i.e., $\\mu \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right), \\sigma \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}\\right)$, $q_{0} \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right), L \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$.\n(ii) The coefficients $\\mu$ and $\\sigma=\\left[\\sigma_{1}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{d}\\right]$, where $\\sigma_{i}$ denotes the $i^{\\prime}$ th column of $\\sigma$, satisfy the parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition, i.e., the vector fields $V_{0}, \\ldots, V_{d}$ defined by\n\n$$\nV_{i}=\\sigma_{i}, \\quad \\text { for } i=1, \\ldots, d, \\quad V_{0}=\\mu+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{d} D V_{j} V_{j}\n$$\n\nsatisfy (4) for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n2.3. Solution to the filtering problem and deep splitting approximations. The filtering method considered in this paper is a version of the method in $[3,4]$ but now adapted to the case of discrete observations. More precisely, we model the state, denoted $S$, with an SDE and the observation process, denoted $O$, with discrete random variables coupled to discrete time points of $S$, see (2). Under the conditions of Section 2.2, it is well known from the literature that the SDE in (2) has a unique solution $S$. That the observation process $O$ is well defined is clear. We remind the reader that the problem under consideration is that of finding the conditional probability distribution of $S_{t}$ given the measurements $y_{0: k}$, up to and including time $t$. More precisely, we are\n\nfor $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$ interested in the unnormalized conditional density $p\\left(t, x \\mid y_{0: k}\\right), t \\in\\left[t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right)$, satisfying for all measurable sets $C$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ the relation\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(S_{t} \\in C \\mid y_{0: k}\\right)=\\frac{\\int_{C} p\\left(t, x \\mid y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x}{\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} p\\left(t, x \\mid y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} x}\n$$\n\nTo this end, we introduce the Fokker-Planck equation. We recall that the state process $S$ satisfying (2) has an associated infinitesimal generator $A$. This operator and its formal adjoint $A^{*}$, are defined, with $a:=\\sigma \\sigma^{\\top}$, for $\\varphi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, as\n\n$$\nA \\varphi=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^{d} a_{i j} \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\varphi}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}}+\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\mu_{i} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial x_{i}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad A^{*} \\varphi=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}}\\left(a_{i j} \\varphi\\right)-\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{i}}\\left(\\mu_{i} \\varphi\\right)\n$$\n\nTo connect with the framework of the deep splitting method $[3,4,5]$, we write $A^{*}=A+F$, where the first order differential operator $F$ is defined by, for $\\varphi \\in C^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right), x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n(F \\varphi)(x)=\\sum_{i, j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial a_{i j}(x)}{\\partial x_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x)}{\\partial x_{j}}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial^{2} a_{i j}(x)}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}} \\varphi(x)-\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_{i}(x)}{\\partial x_{i}} \\varphi(x)-2 \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\mu_{i}(x) \\frac{\\partial \\varphi(x)}{\\partial x_{i}}\n$$\n\nThe recursion (3), that defines $\\left(p_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$, then becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{k}\\left(t, x, y_{0: k}\\right)=p_{k}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k}}^{t} A p_{k}\\left(s, x, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s+\\int_{t_{k}}^{t} F p_{k}\\left(s, x, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s, \\quad t \\in\\left(t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right] \\\\\n& k=0, \\ldots, K-1 \\\\\n& p_{0}\\left(0, x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n& p_{k}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)=p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe solution $\\left(p_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$, obtained by solving (5) for every path $y_{0: K} \\in \\mathbb{Y}$, involves both prediction, when $t \\in\\left(t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right]$, and filtering, when $t=t_{k}$. The following proposition summarizes the regularity of the solution.\n\nProposition 2.1. There exists a unique $p_{k} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; C\\left(\\left[t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right), k=0, \\ldots, K$, satisfying (5). Moreover, $p_{k}(y) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{1, \\infty}\\left(\\left[t_{k}, t_{k+1}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ ) for all $k=0, \\ldots, K, y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$.\n\nProof. We fix $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$ and begin by noting that if $p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, y_{0: k-1}\\right) \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, then $p_{k}\\left(t_{k}, y_{0: k}\\right)=$ $p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, since $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ is an algebra. In particular, this holds for $p_{0}\\left(0, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0} L\\left(y_{0}\\right)$. It remains to prove that the Fokker-Planck equation is regularity preserving and that $p_{k}$ is continuously differentiable in time. For this purpose it is enough to consider one step and to prove that $p_{0}\\left(y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{1, \\infty}\\left(\\left[0, t_{1}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. The conditions of $[10$, Theorem 4.3$]$ are satisfied under (i) and (ii) of Section 2.2, which tells us that the probability density of $S$ is infinitely smooth and bounded. More precisely, for all $t \\in\\left[0, t_{1}\\right]$ we have $p_{0}\\left(t, y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. It remains to show the time regularity. In [16, Chapter 9] the semigroup $(P(t))_{t \\geq 0}$ of bounded linear operators on $C_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ is defined as the solution operator to the Kolmogorov backward equation. Likewise, one can define the adjoint semigroup $R=P^{*}$ on $C_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, associated with the forward equation (5). From this we have for $t \\in\\left[0, t_{1}\\right]$ that $p_{0}\\left(t, y_{0}\\right)=R(t) \\phi_{0}$, where $\\phi_{0}:=p_{0}\\left(0, y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. Following [16, Proposition 9.9] one can analogously show that for all $\\psi \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ it holds $A^{*} R(t) \\psi=R(t) A^{*} \\psi$. In particular, this holds for $\\psi=\\phi_{0}$ and therefore\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} p_{0}\\left(t, y_{0}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t} R(t) \\phi_{0}=A^{*} R(t) \\phi_{0}=R(t) A^{*} \\phi_{0}, \\quad t \\in\\left[0, t_{1}\\right]\n$$\n\nFrom the regularity of $\\phi_{0}$ we have that $A^{*} \\phi_{0} \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ and thus $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} p_{0}\\left(t, y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ for all $t \\in\\left[0, t_{1}\\right]$. This shows that $p_{0}\\left(y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{1, \\infty}\\left(\\left[0, t_{1}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. Lastly, the uniqueness of $p_{0}\\left(y_{0}\\right)$ follows analogously to [16, Theorem 9.11] and uniqueness of $p_{0} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; C\\left(\\left[0, t_{1}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right.$ follows since $L$ is uniformly bounded and thus so is $\\phi_{0}=L(y) q_{0}$ over $\\mathbb{Y}$.\n\nRemark 2.1. The solution to (5) gives unnormalized densities. Instead, in $[11,18]$ the normalized update step is used, replacing the third row of (5) with\n\n$$\np_{k}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\frac{p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right)}{\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} p_{k-1}\\left(t_{k}, z, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, z\\right) \\mathrm{d} z}\n$$\n\nThe benefit of directly obtaining a normalized density has to be compared to the additional computational cost of evaluating or approximating this integral. In this work, we consider the unnormalized version.\n\nThe scene is now set for applying the deep splitting methodology between each of the measurement updates. However, the derivation in this paper is done in a slightly different way that avoids the explicit splitting equations seen in $[3,5]$. This leads to the same approximation scheme in the end, but is beneficial for our error analysis. To prepare for Feynman-Kac representations, used in the the deep splitting scheme and the error analysis, we introduce $X:[0, T] \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, that for all $t \\in[0, T], \\mathbb{P}$-a.s., satisfies\n\n$$\nX_{t}=X_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\mu\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}, \\quad X_{0} \\sim \\widehat{q}_{0}\n$$\n\nHere $\\widehat{q}_{0}$ is a probability density with finite moments. A natural choice is $\\widehat{q}_{0}=q_{0}$, but to emphasize that this is not necessary, and since it gives increased flexibility in the resulting optimization problem, we have a general $\\widehat{q}_{0}$ here. From this point, with a slight abuse of notation, we let $t_{n}:=t_{0, n}, n=0, \\ldots, N$, and the previously defined time points $\\left(t_{k}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$ will consistently be denoted by $\\left(t_{k, 0}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$. We have the following Feynman-Kac representation for the solution $p_{k}$.\n\nProposition 2.2 (Feynman-Kac representation formula). The solutions $p_{k}, k=0, \\ldots, K-1$, to (5), in the time points $t_{k, n+1}, n=0, \\ldots, N-1$, and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, satisfy\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, X_{t_{N}-t_{n}}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{t_{N}-t_{n+1}}^{t_{N}-t_{n}} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. The proof follows a standard derivation; see, e.g., [32]. We start by fixing $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$. Furthermore, we simplify the notation by omitting the dependence on $y_{0: k}$, where it is possible to do so without confusion. We start by noting that the solution $p_{k}$ to (5), for $n=0, \\ldots, N-1$ and $t \\in\\left(t_{k, n}, t_{k, n+1}\\right]$, satisfies\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} p_{k}(t)=A p_{k}(t)+F p_{k}(t)\n$$\n\nReparametrization of time $t \\mapsto t_{k, N}-t$, so that $t_{k, N}-t \\in\\left(t_{k, n}, t_{k, n+1}\\right]$, yields\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t\\right)+A p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t\\right)=-F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t\\right), \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}, t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)\n$$\n\nNoting that $X$ has the same generator $A$ as $S$, and the fact that $p_{k} \\in C^{1,2}\\left(\\left[t_{k, 0}, t_{k+1,0}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, allows us to use It\u00f4's formula for $p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right)$. This gives, $\\mathbb{P}$-a.s.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right)= & p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t}\\left\\langle\\nabla p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right), \\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right)+A p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInserting (8) into the third term we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right)= & p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t}\\left\\langle\\nabla p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right), \\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& -\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe recall that $p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, y_{0: k}\\right) \\in C_{6}^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ for all $s \\in\\left[t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}, t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)$ and that $\\sigma$ is bounded. This guarantees that\n\n$$\n\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right)^{\\top} \\nabla p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right)\\right\\|^{2}\\right] \\mathrm{d} s<\\infty\n$$\n\nand hence the It\u00f4 integral in (9) is a square integrable martingale with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}$. Taking the conditional expectation in (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right] \\\\\n& \\quad=\\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)-\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy reordering the terms and using the fact that $p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}$-measurable, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\quad+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe note that the right endpoint limit in $t \\in\\left[t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}, t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)$ satisfies\n\n$$\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t\\right) \\rightarrow p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right) \\quad \\text { as } \\quad t \\rightarrow\\left(t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $\\mathbb{P}$-a.s.\n\n$$\nX_{t} \\rightarrow X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}} \\quad \\text { as } \\quad t \\rightarrow\\left(t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining these we see that the $L^{2}$-limit of the right hand side of (10) satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow\\left(t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}\\right)} \\mathbb{E} & {\\left[\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-t, X_{t}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\\right.\\right.} \\\\\n& \\left.\\left.-\\left(p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}}\\right)+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\\right)\\right]^{2}\\right]=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInserting the limit from (11) in (10) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\quad+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRewriting the conditional expectation with respect to a conditioned process $\\left(X_{t}^{s, x}\\right)_{t \\geq s}$ (starting in $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at time $s$ ), and making the $y_{0: k}$-dependence explicit in the notation, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{k}\\left(t_{k, n+1}, x, y_{0: k}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, X_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}} F p_{k}\\left(t_{k, N}-s, X_{s}^{t_{k, N}-t_{k, n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we note that $t_{k, N}-t_{k, n}=t_{N}-t_{n}$ for all $k$ and $n$. The proved identity holds for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$. This completes the proof.\n\nIn the next step, we consider a forward Euler approximation of the integral term in (7). First, we introduce the first order differential operator $G$ acting on $\\phi \\in C^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ according to\n\n$$\n(G \\phi)(x)=\\phi(x)+\\tau(F \\phi)(x), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nWe define the approximations $\\pi_{k, n+1},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N-1}$, at each time step $t_{k, n+1}$, of (7) by the recursive formula\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi_{k, n+1}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\pi_{k, n}\\left(X_{t_{N}-t_{n}}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, y \\in \\mathbb{Y}, k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsatisfying\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi_{0,0}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right) & =q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n\\pi_{k, 0}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right) & =\\pi_{k-1, N}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotice that we have $n=0$ in the final update for $k=K$. Thus, $\\pi_{k, n}$ is defined for $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}=$ $\\{0, \\ldots, K-1\\} \\times\\{0, \\ldots, N\\} \\cup\\{K\\} \\times\\{0\\}$.\n\nProposition 2.3. There exists a unique $\\pi_{k, n} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right),(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, satisfying (13) and (14). Furthermore, $\\pi_{k, n}(y) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ for $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}, y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$.\n\nProof. We fix $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$ and suppress it from the notation whenever suitable. The lemma is proved by induction. For the base case, with $k=0$ and $n=0$, from the assumption (i) of Section 2.2 we have $\\pi_{0,0}\\left(y_{0}\\right)=q_{0} L\\left(y_{0}\\right) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. For the induction step we take $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, K\\}, n \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$, and assume that $\\pi_{k, n-1} \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. We use the fact that $\\pi_{k, n}(x)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\pi_{k, n-1}\\left(X_{t_{y}-t_{n-1}}^{t_{N}-t_{n-2}}\\right)\\right]$, is the Feynman-Kac solution $u:\\left[t_{k, n-1}, t_{k, n}\\right] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, at the left endpoint $t_{k, n-1}$, to the Kolmogorov backward equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} u(t, x)+A u(t, x)=0, \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{k, n-1}, t_{k, n}\\right) ; \\quad u\\left(t_{k, n}, x\\right)=\\left(G \\pi_{k, n-1}\\right)(x)\n$$\n\nAs a consequence of the assumption, we have $G \\pi_{k, n-1} \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ since $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are infinitely smooth. By [34, Theorem 4.8.6] or [28], $u(t) \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ for all $t \\in\\left[t_{k, n-1}, t_{k, n}\\right]$ and this shows that $\\pi_{k, n} \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. For the case $n=1$ we stress that, by the definition of $\\pi$, we take $\\pi_{k, 0}=\\pi_{k-1, N} L$ and notice that it belongs to $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. The uniqueness of the solution follows by [16, Theorem 9.11]. From the boundedness of $L$ it follows that $\\pi_{k, n} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)$ and this completes the proof.\n\nThe convergence of this approximation is stated in the following lemma, which we prove in Section 3.3 .\n\nLemma 2.1. Let $p_{k}, k=0, \\ldots, K$, be the solution to (5) and $\\pi_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, be the solution to (13) and (14). For $\\tau:=\\frac{T}{K N} \\leq 1$, there exists $C:=C(T, \\mu, \\sigma, L, K)>0$, such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}}\\left\\|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)-\\pi_{k, n}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)} \\leq C \\tau\n$$\n\nSince the equation for the process $X$ lacks analytical solution in general, we must consider approximations. On the finer time mesh $t_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N-1}$, we define an Euler-Maruyama approximation $Z$, with $Z_{0,0} \\sim \\widehat{q}_{0}$, by\n\n$$\nZ_{k, n+1}=Z_{k, n}+\\mu\\left(Z_{k, n}\\right)\\left(t_{k, n+1}-t_{k, n}\\right)+\\sigma\\left(Z_{k, n}\\right)\\left(W_{t_{k, n+1}}-W_{t_{k, n}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor convenience, we let $Z_{n}:=Z_{0, n}, n=0, \\ldots, N$. Now, we define the approximations $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}$, of $\\pi_{k, n+1}$, by replacing $X$ with $Z$ in (13), i.e., by the recursion\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)= & \\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}^{t_{n+1}, x}, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, y \\in \\mathbb{Y}, k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsatisfying\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\pi}_{0,0}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right) & =q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n\\bar{\\pi}_{k, 0}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right) & =\\bar{\\pi}_{k-1, N}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe following proposition can be proved identically to Proposition 2.3, adapting arguments with $Z$ satisfying an SDE with piecewise constant coefficients on each time interval $\\left[t_{k, n}, t_{k, n+1}\\right)$.\n\nProposition 2.4. There exists a unique $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right),(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, satisfying (16) and (17).

Let $\\pi_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, be the solution to (13) and (14), and $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, be the solution to (16) and (17). For $\\tau:=\\frac{T}{K N} \\leq 1$, there exists $C:=C(T, \\mu, \\sigma, L, K)>0$, such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}}\\left\\|\\pi_{k, n}-\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)} \\leq C \\tau\n$$\n\nFinally, we reach our first main result, namely the convergence of the approximation $\\bar{\\pi}$ of $p$.\nTheorem 2.1. Let $p_{k}, k=0, \\ldots, K$, be the solution to (5) and $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, be the solution to (16) and (17).

This follows directly from Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 together with the triangle inequality.\n2.4. Optimization based formulation of the deep splitting scheme. Here we reformulate the conditional expectation, formulated as a conditioned process in the proof of Proposition 2.2, as the optimum from a recursive minimization problem. This will allow us to approximate the solution by means of a neural network and stochastic gradient descent. We discuss this approximation further in Section 4.2, in the context of numerical examples. The first optimization problem defined below gives a solution to the recursion (16) for a fixed $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$, and was first introduced in [4] for stochastic PDE trajectories. In [14] a similar approach was introduced for the FokkerPlanck equation. A scheme based on this formulation requires retraining of the neural network for every observation path and works in an offline setting, where one is only interested in the inference of a single path. We prove this proposition below and an alternative proof can be found in [6, Proposition 2.7].\n\nProposition 2.5. The functions $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}, k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1$, defined in (16) and (17) satisfy the minimization problems\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right)_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\\\\n& \\quad=\\underset{u \\in C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}\\right)-G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, y_{0: k}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right], \\quad n=0, \\ldots, N-1, y \\in \\mathbb{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. We start by fixing $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}, k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0, \\ldots, N-1$, and introduce the random variables\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_{k, n+1} & =\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}, y_{0: k}\\right) \\\\\n\\Xi_{k, n} & =G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, y_{0: k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (16) we have $\\Phi_{k, n+1}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Xi_{k, n} \\mid \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}\\right)\\right]$. and by the interpretation of the conditional expectation as an orthogonal $L^{2}$-projection, see [33, Corollary 8.17], we thus have that $\\Phi_{k, n+1}$ is the unique minimizer in $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}\\right)\\right)$ of $\\Phi \\mapsto \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\Phi-\\Xi_{k, n}\\right|^{2}\\right]$. Moreover, we have $\\Phi_{k, n+1}=$ $u^{*}\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\nu^{*}=\\underset{u \\in \\mathcal{C}^{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}\\right)-\\Xi_{k, n}\\right|^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe know that $u^{*}=\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1}$ from the definition of $\\Phi_{k, n+1}$ and conclude that $u^{*}$ is continuous, since $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1} \\in C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ by Proposition 2.4. We can thus minimize over continuous functions in (18).\n\nWe generalize the minimization problem obtained in Proposition 2.5 by making a change of probability measure. Instead of fixing $y$ we consider the expectation with respect to a probability measure $\\mathbb{P}_{Z} \\times \\mathbb{P}_{Y}$, where $\\mathbb{P}_{Z}$ is the distribution of (15), and $\\mathbb{P}_{Y}$ can be chosen arbitrarily. However, it is natural to use the measurement model $g$ in the statistical model (2). The obtained solution becomes a deterministic function over $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right)$, allowing for instantaneous evaluation of new observation sequences, suitable for an online setting. In Section 4 we use neural networks as function approximators and the new optimization problem drops the need of retraining the networks.\n\nProposition 2.6. Let $Y \\in L^{\\infty}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{Y})$ be a random variable distributed with $\\mathbb{P}_{Y}, \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n+1},(k, n) \\in$ $\\mathcal{I}_{K, N-1}$ be the solutions to (16)-(17) and the functions $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n+1}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},(k, n) \\in$ $\\mathcal{I}_{K, N-1}$, be the solutions to the recursive optimization problems\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n+1}(x, y)\\right)_{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\underset{u \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) ; C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right)-G \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& k=0, \\ldots, K-1, n=0,1, \\ldots, N-1 \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{0,0}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, 0}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k-1, N}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen $\\widetilde{\\pi}$ is well defined and moreover, for all $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, and $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right)$, we have $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(y_{0: k}\\right)=$ $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(y_{0: k}\\right)$.\n\nProof. We remind the reader that $Y$ now represents a random variable with distribution $\\mathbb{P}_{Y}$, and hence it is enough to show that $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(\\cdot, Y_{0: k}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(\\cdot, Y_{0: k}\\right)$ in $L^{\\infty}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})$. We proceed with the proof by using an induction argument. The base case $k=0$ and $n=0$ is trivially valid, since $\\bar{\\pi}_{0,0}\\left(Y_{0}\\right)=q_{0} L\\left(Y_{0}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{0,0}\\left(Y_{0}\\right)$ by definition, and moreover $x \\mapsto q_{0}(x) L(y, x)$ is continuous for every $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$ and $(x, y) \\mapsto q_{0}(x) L(y, x)$ is bounded. For the induction step, we fix $k \\in\\{0, \\ldots, K-1\\}$, $n \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$ and assume that $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right)=\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right) \\in L^{\\infty}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})$. By definition, for a fixed $Y_{0: k}(\\omega)=y_{0: k}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mid \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-n}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe minimization problem (19) is solved by the conditional expectation\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right) \\mid \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nBy the inductive assumption we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right) & =\\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, Y_{0: k}\\right) \\mid \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}\\left[G \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n-1}\\left(Z_{N-(n-1)}, y_{0: k}\\right) \\mid \\mathfrak{S}\\left(Z_{N-n}\\right)\\right]\\left.\\right|_{y_{0: k}=Y_{0: k}} \\\\\n& =\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}\\left(Z_{N-n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $x \\mapsto \\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}(x, y)$ is continuous for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$, then so is $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}$, as we have shown that they coincide for $y \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) \\subset \\mathbb{Y}$.\n\nThe next result is our second main result. It is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.6 .\n\nCorollary 2.1.

Convergence of deep splitting approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation. In this section we harvest the fruits of our analysis for the Fokker-Planck equation alone, disconnected from any filtering problem.

CONVERGENCE PROofs \n\nThis section is devoted to the error analysis of the obtained approximation scheme in Proposition 2.6. Section 3.1 contains some preliminaries used for the analysis. In Section 3.2 we state and prove two auxiliary lemmas which are used in Section 3.3 to prove Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2.\n3.1. Preliminaries for the analysis. We remind the reader that throughout this section we assume the setting of Section 2.2. For convenience in the later proofs we rewrite the operator $F$ by defining $f_{0}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $f_{1}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{0}(x) & =\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i, j=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial^{2} a_{i j}(x)}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}}-\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial \\mu_{i}(x)}{\\partial x_{i}} \\\\\nf_{1}^{j}(x) & =\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial a_{i j}(x)}{\\partial x_{i}}-2 \\mu_{j}(x), \\quad j=1, \\ldots, d\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWith these functions, we can write $F$, acting on a function $\\phi \\in C^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, in the form\n\n$$\n(F \\phi)(x)=f_{0}(x) \\phi(x)+f_{1}(x) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi(x), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nFrom Assumption (i) of Section 2.2, Proposition 2.1, and Proposition 2.4, we define uniform bounding constants $C_{\\phi}=\\max _{|n| \\leq 4}\\left\\|D^{\\alpha} \\phi\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{Y} ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)}$ for $\\phi=f_{0}, L$, and $\\bar{\\pi}_{k, n}$, for $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$.

All the estimations in the proofs hold uniformly with respect to $y \\in \\mathbb{Y}$, and to emphasize the spatial dependence we write $p_{k}(t)(x)$ instead of $p_{k}(t, x, y)$.\n\nLemma 3.2.

Here we adapt the same approximation procedures. The initial step involves approximating the expectation in (19) using a Monte Carlo average. This consists of sampling $M$ independent pairs $\\left(Z_{0: N}^{m}, Y_{0: K}^{m}\\right)_{m=1}^{M}$ from (15) and (2) respectively. The updated problem reads\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\left(\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n+1}^{M}(x, y)\\right)_{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)}}\\right. \\\\\n& =\\underset{u \\in C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)}{\\arg \\min } \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}^{m}, Y_{0: k}^{m}\\right)-G \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M}\\left(Z_{N-n}^{m}, Y_{0: k}^{m}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\\\\n& k=0, \\ldots, K-1, \\quad n=0, \\ldots, N-1 \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{0,0}^{M}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, 0}^{M}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k-1, N}^{M}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApproximating expectations with Monte Carlo averages is a classical technique and by the central limit theorem one can, for well behaved integrands, expect a convergence of order $\\frac{1}{2}$ in $M$.\nThe second step is to approximate $C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$ by a neural network, more precisely, by the space $\\left\\{\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}: \\theta \\in \\Theta_{k}\\right\\} \\subset C\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. Here every $\\theta$ in the space of parameters $\\Theta_{k} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{\\left(d+d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)\\right) \\times J^{E} \\times 1}$ defines a continuous function $\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}$, a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) with $\\mathfrak{L}$ hidden layers and a width of $J$ neurons, mapping $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. In this work we use ReLU activation functions between each hidden layer except the final one, for which we instead use an energy-based activation described below. Other constructions with more advanced (or simpler) architectures could be of interest in future work, but here the focus lies on examining\n\nthe convergence order numerically rather than on optimized architectures. The new optimization problem reads\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.\\left(\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n+1}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}(x, y)\\right)_{\\{x, y\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)}}\\right. \\\\\n& \\quad=\\underset{u \\in\\left\\{\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathcal{S}}: \\theta \\in \\Theta_{k}\\right\\}}{\\arg \\min } \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\left|u\\left(Z_{N-(n+1)}^{m}, Y_{0: k}^{m}\\right)-G \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\left(Z_{N-n}^{m}, Y_{0: k}^{m}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\\\\n& k=0, \\ldots, K-1, \\quad n=0, \\ldots, N-1 \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{0,0}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\left(x, y_{0}\\right)=q_{0}(x) L\\left(y_{0}, x\\right) \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, 0}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k-1, N}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\left(x, y_{0: k-1}\\right) L\\left(y_{k}, x\\right), \\quad k=1, \\ldots, K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn [47] it is shown how well FCNNs approximate functions in Sobolev spaces. Specifically, with a fixed width $J$, it can be shown that the approximation converges with order $\\mathfrak{L}^{-\\gamma}$, where $J$ and $\\gamma>0$ depend on the underlying dimension $d$ and the regularity of the Sobolev space.\n\nThe energy-based activation layer mentioned above consists of taking a scalar output $f_{\\theta}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)$ through the exponential function. That is, we let the normalized conditional density be approximated, for each $\\theta \\in \\Theta_{k}$ and input pair $\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime} \\times(k+1)}$, by\n\n$$\np\\left(x \\mid y_{0: k}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)}{Z_{\\theta}\\left(y_{0: k}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)=\\mathrm{e}^{-f_{\\theta}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)}, \\quad Z_{\\theta}\\left(y_{0: k}\\right)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\mathrm{e}^{-f_{\\theta}\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)} \\mathrm{d} z\n$$\n\nThere are two main ideas behind the use of energy-based activation for probabilistic modeling. The first is that we do not have to evaluate the normalizing constant $Z_{\\theta}$, if we are only concerned with the unnormalized density. This speeds up training and still learns the density. The second concerns the scalar energy $f_{\\theta}$. The idea is that it should assign low energy (resulting in a high probability) to pairs $\\left(x, y_{0: k}\\right)$, that are more likely to occur and high energy (resulting in low probability) to pairs that are less likely to occur. This fits very well with solving (36), where it is enough to approximate an unnormalized solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (5) and to do the normalization in the inference stage. Trivially, this activation guarantees positive values which is a crucial when approximating probabilities. One can also construct $f_{\\theta}$ in such a way that it guarantees that $Z_{\\theta}$ is finite, e.g., by learning Gaussian tails [3]. Finally, we employ the time reparametrization that was done in [3, Section 3.4], which defines an equivalent optimization problem that is more suitable for computations.\n4.2. Evaluation. The objective of Section 4 is to numerically examine the convergence order of the approximation $\\widetilde{\\pi}$. To do this, we need to approximate the left hand side of (20). Subsection 4.1 introduces the approximation $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}$ of $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}$. For numerical stability, we incorporate a normalization of $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, 0}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\left(Y_{0: k}^{m}\\right)$, for all $k=0, \\ldots, K$ and $m=1, \\ldots, M$ in the training process before training each subsequent network. In Section 4.3 we evaluate the strong error in two 1-dimensional examples and the normalization is done with quadrature. Now, we measure the error between $p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}$ in $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)$ for fixed $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$. By the triangle inequality and by estimating the $L^{2}$-norm by the $L^{\\infty}$-norm, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)} \\\\\n& \\quad \\leq\\left\\|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)}+\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathfrak{L}}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\mathbb{P}_{Y}\\right) ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe see that the first term on the right hand side of (37) is the left hand side in Corollary 2.1. The second term is the error that occurs due to the statistical approximation depending on $M$ and the approximation error by the neural network depending on $\\mathfrak{L}$. In Subsection 4.3 we set $M$ and $\\mathfrak{L}$ sufficiently large such that the first term on the right hand side of (37) is the dominating error.\n\nWe need further approximations to evaluate the left hand side of (37), which is, for $(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N}$, defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathcal{L}}\\right\\|_{L^{2}\\left(1 \\mathrm{~S} ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)} & =\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, Y_{0: k}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathcal{L}}\\left(Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)}^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup _{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\\left|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, x, Y_{0: k}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathcal{L}}\\left(x, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo evaluate (38), we first approximate the expectation with $M_{\\mathrm{e}}$ Monte Carlo samples from (2). Secondly, since we are only evaluating this in $d=1$, we approximate the supremum by taking the supremum over a uniform grid $B$ in a bounded domain of $\\mathbb{R}$, where the solutions have most of their mass. Combining the approximations, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sup _{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}}\\left|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, x, Y_{0: k}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathcal{L}}\\left(x, Y_{0: k}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\n& \\quad \\approx\\left(\\frac{1}{M_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\sum_{m_{\\mathrm{e}}=1}^{M_{\\mathrm{e}}} \\sup _{x \\in B}\\left|p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}, x, Y_{0: k}^{m_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)-\\widetilde{\\pi}_{k, n}^{M, \\mathcal{L}}\\left(x, Y_{0: k}^{m_{\\mathrm{e}}}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe approximation error becomes arbitrarily small by choosing $|B|$ and $M_{\\mathrm{e}}$ large enough.\n4.3. Numerical convergence. In this section we empirically examine the convergence order of the EBDS method applied to two one-dimensional examples. The first one is a drifted Brownian motion that satisfies the assumptions in Section 2.2. The other is a bistable process, characterized by two modes in its corresponding probability distribution, and does not satisfy the assumptions. In both examples, we have $q_{0}=\\mathcal{N}(0,1), \\sigma(x)=1$, Gaussian measurements $Y_{k} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(h\\left(S_{t_{k, 0}}\\right), R\\right)$ with measurement function $h(x)=x$ and variance $R=1$. It is worth mentioning that this corresponds to a rather low signal-to-noise ratio, which some would argue is a harder problem. The drifted Brownian motion process has a drift coefficient $\\mu(x)=2$, while the bistable process has a drift coefficient $\\mu(x)=\\frac{2}{5}\\left(5 x-x^{3}\\right)$. In both cases, we use $K=20$ with equidistant measurements with a final time of $T=2$. This decision was made based on the observation that the $L^{2}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$-error reaches a relatively stable value before $t=2$ for both examples.\n\nTo evaluate (39), we need the reference solution $p_{k}\\left(t_{k, n}\\right)$. In the drifted Brownian motion example, this corresponds to the famous Kalman filter mentioned earlier, see, e.g., [46]. The bistable process with its nonlinearity in the drift has no analytical solution. Instead, we employ a bootstrap particle filter with 10000 particles to find a good approximation of the true solution. Finally, the constants for the numerical evaluation in the drifted Brownian motion example and the bistable example are, respectively: $M_{\\mathrm{e}}=\\{5000,500\\}, J=128, M=10^{6}, \\mathfrak{L}=3$ and $|B|=2000$.\n\nIn Figure 1 we see the error (39) with 5 different discretizations $N=1,2,4,8,16$ over all time steps $t_{k, n},(k, n) \\in \\mathcal{I}_{K, N-1}$. Each error trajectory corresponds to the average over 10 runs of the method to better illustrate the performance. It is easy to see how the error decreases by an increasing number of time steps $N$ in both examples. On the dashed lines, at time steps $\\left(t_{k, 0}\\right)_{k=0}^{K}$, the solutions are updated with new measurements, and we see that the error tends to increase ever so slightly at these time steps. It is not clear why this is the case, and our best guess is that it relates to a slight numerical instability or inaccuracy during normalization. We can also observe that, in the two examples, the drifted Brownian motion example reaches a steady-state error more quickly for all discretizations.\n\nLooking at the final time $T=2$ for the different discretizations, we see the convergence in Figure 2. In the figure, we see 10 instances of the performed algorithm, obtaining 10 slightly different approximations due to stochastic gradient descent, illustrated in red. The figure has a logarithmic scale and shows that the average error, illustrated in blue, decreases with about order 1 for the drifted Brownian motion example and with about order $\\frac{1}{2}$ for the bistable example compared to the reference lines of $O\\left(N^{-1}\\right)$ and $O\\left(N^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)$, where $N=\\frac{2}{K \\tau}$.\nThis indicates that the assumptions in Section 2.2 are crucial for order 1 convergence and that order $\\frac{1}{2}$ might be possible under weaker assumptions.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. The figure illustrates the $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)\\right)$-error over time for five different discretizations averaged over 10 instances. To the left we see the error for the drifted Brownian motion example and to the right we see the error for the example with the bistable process.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. The figure presents the convergence for the numerical scheme for 10 individual instances of the scheme in red, their average in blue, and in black we see reference lines of order 1 and $\\frac{1}{8}$ respectively. To the left we have the errors corresponding to the drifted Brownian motion example and to the right the example with the bistable process.\n\nFor transparency, we also remark that if we let $M$ and $\\mathfrak{L}$ stay constant and keep increasing $N$, the error will stop to decrease after some threshold as the statistical error and neural network approximation error starts to dominate. To examine the convergence we set a sufficiently large sample size $M=10^{6}$ and layer depth $\\mathfrak{L}=3$ for all the discretizations.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Malliavin integration by parts \n\nHere we prove Lemma 3.1 by means of Malliavin integration by parts. This proof follows the notes of [35]; similar material can be found in [27] or [41]. This is provided for the reader to easier understand the results of this paper and to get a short introduction to Malliavin calculus. We follow [35] and start with some notation.\n\nWe let $H$ denote a separable Hilbert space and $H^{\\otimes n}$ be the $n$-fold tensor product of $H$. For $H$ being the space $L^{2}\\left(I ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ for $I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, which is the case we are interested in, the tensor product space is realized as $L^{2}\\left(I^{a} ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$. Furthermore, we let $W$ be an $H$-isonormal Gaussian process on a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathbb{P})$. That is, a family $W=\\{W(h): h \\in H\\}$ of real-valued random variables such that each $W(h)$ is Gaussian and $\\mathbb{E}[W(h) W(g)]=\\langle h, g\\rangle_{H}$. One can show that such $W$ exists. If $H=L^{2}(I ; \\mathbb{R})$, then $B_{t}=W\\left(I_{(0, t)}\\right)$ is a Brownian motion and $\\int_{0}^{t} f_{s} \\mathrm{~d} B_{s}=W\\left(I_{(0, t)} f\\right)$ is the Wiener integral. Now we define $\\mathcal{S}$ as the space of smooth random variables having the form\n\n$$\nF=f\\left(W\\left(h_{1}\\right), W\\left(h_{2}\\right), \\ldots, W\\left(h_{n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some $f \\in C_{b}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right), h_{1}, \\ldots, h_{n} \\in H$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We note that $\\mathcal{S}$ is dense in $L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})$. Now, by $D F$ we denote the Malliavin derivative of $F$ as the $H$-valued random variable defined by\n\n$$\nD F=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\partial_{j} f\\left(W\\left(h_{1}\\right), W\\left(h_{2}\\right), \\ldots, W\\left(h_{n}\\right)\\right) h_{j}\n$$\n\nIt can be shown that the operator $D$ is closable in $L^{p}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^{p}(\\Omega ; H)$ and with a slight abuse of notation we will denote the closure of $D$ with $D$. We denote the domain of $D$, for each $p \\geq 1$,\n\nby $\\mathbb{D}^{1, p}=\\{F \\in \\mathcal{S}:\\|F\\|_{\\mathbb{D}^{1, p}}<\\infty\\}$, where\n\n$$\n\\|F\\|_{\\mathbb{D}^{1, p}}=\\left(\\mathbb{E}|F|^{p}+\\mathbb{E}\\|D F\\|_{H}^{p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\mathbb{D}^{1, p}$ is the closure of $\\mathcal{S}$ with respect to the above norm. We inductively define the space $\\mathbb{D}^{k, p}=\\left\\{F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{k-1, p}: D F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{k-1, p}\\right\\}$ such that $D^{k} F=D\\left(D^{k-1} F\\right)$, where the norm is defined by\n\n$$\n\\|F\\|_{\\mathbb{D}^{k, p}}=\\left(\\mathbb{E}|F|^{p}+\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\|D^{j} F\\right\\|_{H \\pi j}^{p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, we define the space\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}=\\bigcap_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\bigcap_{p \\geq 1} \\mathbb{D}^{k, p}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the divergence operator $\\delta$, sometimes called the Skorohod integral, adjoint to the Malliavin derivative $D: L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}) \\rightarrow L^{2}(\\Omega ; H)$. Its domain $\\operatorname{dom}(\\delta) \\subset L^{2}(\\Omega ; H)$ is defined as all $u \\in L^{2}(\\Omega ; H)$ such that there exists a $G \\in L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})$ that satisfies, for all $Y \\in \\mathbb{D}^{1,2}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\langle D Y, u\\rangle_{H}=\\mathbb{E}[Y G]\n$$\n\nand we set $\\delta(u):=G$. In the case $H=L^{2}(I ; \\mathbb{R})$ and $u \\in \\operatorname{dom}(\\delta)$ being an adapted process, we have $\\delta(u)=\\int_{I} u_{s} \\mathrm{~d} B_{s}$, the It\u00f4 integral.\n\nThe Malliavin matrix with respect to a random variable $F=\\left(F_{1}, \\ldots, F_{m}\\right)$ in $H$ is the random matrix\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}=\\left(\\left\\langle D F_{i}, D F_{j}\\right\\rangle_{H}\\right)_{i, j=1}^{m}\n$$\n\nThe following proposition is quoted from [35, Proposition 2.2.4].\nProposition A.1. Let $F \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right)$ satisfy $F_{j} \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, m$ such that $D F \\in$ $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; H^{m \\times 1}\\right)$ and the Malliavin matrix $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $(\\operatorname{det} \\mathcal{M})^{-1} \\in L^{p}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})$ for all $p \\geq 1$. Then we have for $\\varphi \\in C_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right), Y \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$, and $j=1, \\ldots, m$ that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y \\partial_{j} \\varphi(F)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_{j} \\varphi(F)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{j}$ is defined by\n\n$$\nZ_{j}=\\delta\\left(Y\\left(\\mathcal{M}^{-1} D F\\right)_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nand belongs to $\\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$.\n\nIt is convenient to reformulate this using matrix notation. We see by the linearity of the expectation and the Skorohod integral and by summing over $j=1, \\ldots, m$, with $Y=\\left(Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{m}\\right)$, where $Y_{j} \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$, that we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\nabla \\varphi(F) \\cdot Y]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\delta\\left(Y \\cdot \\mathcal{M}^{-1} D F\\right) \\varphi(F)\\right]\n$$\n\nWe now connect with the notation in (6) and Lemma 3.1. There the dimensions of the state variable $X$ and the driving Browian motion $W$ are the same. For pedagogical reasons, we here let the dimension of $X$ be $m$ and that of $W$ be $d$; hence, $\\sigma$ is of type $m \\times d$. We define $X_{t}=X_{t}^{\\dagger_{N}-t_{n+1}, \\mathcal{E}} \\in$ $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right), t \\in\\left[t_{N}-t_{n+1}, t_{N}-t_{n}\\right]$, and without loss of generality we assume that $t_{N}-t_{n+1}=0$, so that it is enough to consider a Hilbert space $H=L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$. In this space, we let, with a slight abuse of notation, $W=\\left(W^{1}, \\ldots, W^{d}\\right)$ denote a Brownian motion defined by the $H$-isonormal Gaussian process, where $W_{t}^{j}=W\\left(I_{[0, t]} e_{j}\\right)$ and $\\left(e_{j}\\right)_{j=1}^{d}$ is the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The Malliavin derivative of a random variable $F \\in L^{2}(\\Omega, \\mathbb{R})$ then becomes $D F \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\\right)\\right)$ (a row vector), which we denote by $(D F)_{a}^{k}, u \\in[0, T], k=1, \\ldots, d$. Now we want to use Proposition A. 1 for fixed $s, t \\in[0, T], F=X_{t} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}\\right), Y=f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times 1}\\right)$ (column vectors)\n\nand $\\varphi=\\phi \\in C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$. This gives the Malliavin derivative $D X_{t}^{j} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\\right)\\right)$ for $j=1, \\ldots, m$ and $D X_{t} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}\\right)\\right.$ with the Malliavin matrix\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{M}_{t}=\\left(\\left\\langle D X_{t}^{i}, D X_{t}^{j}\\right\\rangle_{L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)}\\right)_{i, j=1}^{m} & =\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} \\sum_{k=1}^{d}\\left(D X_{t}^{i}\\right)_{u}^{k}\\left(D X_{t}^{j}\\right)_{u}^{k} \\mathrm{~d} u\\right)_{i, j=1}^{m} \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{u}\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{u}^{\\top} \\mathrm{d} u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we use the fact that $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{u}=0$ for $u \\geq t$, since $X_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable. In order to prove Lemma 3.1 we want to apply Proposition A. 1 and for this we need to show, for all $j=1, \\ldots, m$, that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX_{t}^{j} & \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty} \\\\\nf_{1}^{j}\\left(X_{s}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty} \\\\\n\\phi & \\in C_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} & \\text { exists and }\\left(\\operatorname{det} \\mathcal{M}_{t}\\right)^{-1} \\in L^{p}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nGiven conditions (41)-(43), by applying (40), we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\nabla \\phi\\left(X_{t}\\right) \\cdot f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\\right]=\\left\\langle\\delta\\left(f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\cdot \\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} D X_{t}\\right), \\phi\\left(X_{t}\\right)\\right\\rangle_{L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})}\n$$\n\nProposition A. 1 also states that $\\delta\\left(f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\cdot \\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} D X_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$, which implies that there exists a constant $C_{\\mathcal{M}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\delta\\left(f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\cdot \\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} D X_{t}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})} \\leq C_{\\mathcal{M}}\n$$\n\nCombining this with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in (44) we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\nabla \\phi\\left(X_{t}\\right) \\cdot f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\\right]\\right| \\leq\\left\\|\\delta\\left(f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\cdot \\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} D X_{t}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})}\\left\\|\\phi\\left(X_{t}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})} \\leq C_{\\mathcal{M}}\\left\\|\\phi\\left(X_{t}\\right)\\right\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega ; \\mathbb{R})}\n$$\n\nThis proves the lemma under the assumption that conditions (41)-(43) hold. The full proof of this is very technical and we refrain from giving all details. Still, we find it useful to give a glimpse of the arguments involved and, therefore, to outline important parts of the proof. For this purpose, we start by citing a result on the Malliavin regularity of SDE with smooth coefficients.\n\nTheorem A. 1 (2.3.6 and 2.3.7 in [35]). Let the drift coefficient $\\mu: \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ be in $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right)$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ be in $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}\\right), x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, and let $\\left(X_{t}^{0, x_{0}}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$ be the unique adapted process which, for all $t \\in[0, T], \\mathbb{P}$-almost surely satisfies\n\n$$\nX_{t}=x_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} \\mu\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s+\\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}\n$$\n\nThe components $X^{j}$ in $X$ satisfy for all $t \\in[0, T]$ that $X_{t}^{j} \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$, and the derivative $D X_{t} \\in$ $L^{2}\\left(\\Omega ; L^{2}\\left([0, T] ; \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}\\right)\\right)$ satisfies for all $s, t \\in[0, T]$ with $s \\leq t$, $\\mathbb{P}$-almost surely\n\n$$\n\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{s}=\\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right)+\\int_{s}^{t} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{u}\\right)\\left(D X_{u}\\right)_{s} \\mathrm{~d} u+\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{s}^{t} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{u}\\right)\\left(D X_{u}\\right)_{s} \\mathrm{~d} W_{u}^{j}\n$$\n\nFor the case $s>t$, we have $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{s}=0$. Here, the derivative $\\mu^{\\prime}(X) \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right)$, or equivalently an $m \\times m$-matrix, and the derivatives $\\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}(X) \\in \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m} ; \\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right)$, or equivalently an $m \\times m$-matrix defining the Jacobian of the $j$ :th column in $\\sigma$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, d$.\n\nThe theorem implies that $X_{t}^{j} \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$ satisfies (41), since $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ in (6) belong to $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty}$. Moreover, by [35, Lemma 2.2.1] it holds for $F \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$ and $\\varphi \\in C^{\\infty}$ that $\\varphi(F) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$. Therefore, we conclude that $f_{1}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{D}^{\\infty}$. Clearly, (42) is fulfilled since $C_{\\mathrm{b}}^{\\infty} \\subset C_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\infty}$ and thus it remains to verify the condition (43).\n\nWe follow the derivation of [35] closely. To this end, we want to construct a new representation of the Malliavin matrix by the use of an auxiliary process $\\left(Y_{t}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$. More specifically we claim that the solution $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{s}$ to (45) can be represented by the evolution operator $Y_{t} Y_{s}^{-1}$ as $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{s}=$\n\n$Y_{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{s}\\right)$. Here $Y$ is defined as the matrix-valued stochastic process $[0, T] \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ that for all $t \\in[0, T], \\mathbb{P}$-almost surely satisfies\n\n$$\nY_{t}=I+\\int_{0}^{t} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s+\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} \\mathrm{~d} W_{s}^{j}\n$$\n\nThe idea is to show that the new representation of $D X_{t}$ holds and as a consequence find a new representation of the Malliavin matrix $\\mathcal{M}_{t}$. Since we are interested in showing that $\\mathcal{M}_{t}$ is invertible we first show that $Y$ is invertible and that its inverse has finite moments. By applying It\u00f4's formula to $f(A)=A^{-1}$ with derivatives $f^{\\prime}(A)[H]=-A^{-1} H A^{-1}$ and $f^{\\prime \\prime}(A)[H, H]=2 A^{-1} H A^{-1} H A^{-1}$, we obtain formally that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{t}^{-1}= & I^{-1}-\\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{~d} s-\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{~d} W_{s}^{j} \\\\\n& +\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{s}^{-1} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{~d} s \\\\\n= & I-\\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s-\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}^{j}+\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} Y_{s}^{-1}\\left(\\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} s\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf we formulate this as an equation, then we expect $Y_{t}^{-1}$ to be the solution $Z_{t}$ that, for all $t \\in[0, T]$, $\\mathbb{P}$-almost surely satisfies\n\n$$\nZ_{t}=I+\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{d} Z_{s}\\left(\\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\\right)^{2}-Z_{s} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} s-\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{0}^{t} Z_{s} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}^{j}\n$$\n\nSince $\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right)$ and $\\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right)$, for all $j=1, \\ldots, d$, are uniformly bounded, the coefficients in (46) are of linear growth and thus satisfy the standard conditions to show existence and uniqueness of an SDE. This guarantees the existence of $Z$ and that its moments of all orders are finite.\nMoreover, by applying It\u00f4's formula to $f(A, B)=A B$ one can show that $Z_{t} Y_{t}=I$, and hence showing that $Y_{t}$ is $\\mathbb{P}$-almost surely a right-inverse of $Z_{t}$. Analogously this can be done with $f(A, B)=B A$ to show that $Y_{t} Z_{t}=I$ and hence showing that $Y_{t}$ is almost surely invertible with the inverse $Y_{t}^{-1}=Z_{t}$. Finally, we show that for all $r \\in[0, t]$ and fixed $t \\in[0, T]$ it holds\n\n$$\n\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{r}=Y_{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe do this by inserting the process $t \\mapsto Y_{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)$ into the right hand side of (45) and verifying that this gives the correct left hand side. Indeed,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) & +\\int_{r}^{t} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\mathrm{d} s+\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{r}^{t} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\mathrm{d} W_{s}^{j} \\\\\n& =\\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)+\\left(\\int_{r}^{t} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} \\mathrm{~d} s+\\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\int_{r}^{t} \\sigma_{j}^{\\prime}\\left(X_{s}\\right) Y_{s} \\mathrm{~d} W_{s}^{j}\\right) Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)+\\left(Y_{t}-Y_{r}\\right) Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\\\\n& =Y_{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $Y_{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)$ satisfies the same equation (45) as $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{r}$ for all $r \\in[0, t]$ and $t \\in[0, T]$. Using the new representation (47) of $\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{r}$, the Malliavin matrix $\\mathcal{M}_{t}$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{r}\\left(D X_{t}\\right)_{r}^{\\top} \\mathrm{d} r=\\int_{0}^{t} Y_{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)^{\\top}\\left(Y_{r}^{-1}\\right)^{\\top} Y_{t}^{\\top} \\mathrm{d} r=Y_{t} C_{t} Y_{t}^{\\top}\n$$\n\nHere we have defined $C_{t}$ for all $t \\in[0, T]$ as\n\n$$\nC_{t}:=\\int_{0}^{t} Y_{r}^{-1} \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right) \\sigma\\left(X_{r}\\right)^{\\top}\\left(Y_{r}^{-1}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathrm{d} r\n$$\n\nWe recall that the inverse $Y_{t}^{-1}$ exists and has finite moments of all orders. This implies, with H\u00f6lder's inequality on $\\left\\|Y_{t} C_{t} Y_{t}^{\\top}\\right\\|_{L^{p}}$, that its enough to prove that $C_{t}$ is invertible with finite moments on its determinant to prove that this also holds for $\\mathcal{M}_{t}$. To this end we state the following lemma whose proof can be found in [35].\n\nLemma A. 1 (2.4.4 [35]). Let $M$ be a random symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with entries in $\\bigcap_{p} L^{p}(\\Omega)$. Assume that, for all $p \\geq 2$, there exist a constant $C_{p}$ and an $\\epsilon_{p}>0$, such that, for all $\\epsilon \\in\\left(0, \\epsilon_{p}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\|x\\|=1} \\mathbb{P}\\left(x^{\\top} M x \\leq \\epsilon\\right) \\leq C_{p} \\epsilon^{p}\n$$\n\nThen $(\\operatorname{det} M)^{-1} \\in \\bigcap_{p \\geq 1} L^{p}(\\Omega)$.\nOne can show that $C_{t}$ satisfies the conditions of this lemma, which implies the desired result that $\\left(\\operatorname{det} C_{t}\\right)^{-1} \\in L^{p}(\\Omega)$ for all $p$. We omit the proof and refer to [35, Theorem 2.4.5] for a technical proof building on a H\u00f6rmander condition and concepts of \"almost implications\". It is worth noting that the parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition (4) that we assume in Section 2 is a sufficient condition for this to hold. We have thus highlighted parts of the proof of the following result, which implies Lemma 3.1.\n\nLemma A.2. Under assumptions (i) and (ii), for $\\phi \\in C_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d} ; \\mathbb{R}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[f_{1}\\left(X_{s}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\\left(X_{t}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\delta\\left(f_{1}\\left(X_{s}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right) \\cdot \\mathcal{M}_{t}^{-1} D X_{t}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right) \\phi\\left(X_{t}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right)\\right] \\\\\nx \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\quad s, t \\in\\left(t_{N}-t_{n+1}, t_{N}-t_{n}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, there exists a constant $C_{\\mathcal{M}}>0$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left[f_{1}\\left(X_{s}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\\left(X_{t}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right)\\right]\\right| \\leq C_{\\mathcal{M}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left.\\left|\\phi\\left(X_{t}^{t_{N}-t_{n+1}, x}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right. \\\\\nx \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\quad s, t \\in\\left(t_{N}-t_{n+1}, t_{N}-t_{n}\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nKasper B\u00e4gmark, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, SE-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nEmail address: bagmark@chalmers.se\n\nAdam Andersson, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, S-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden, and SaAB AB, S-412 76 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nEmail address: adam.andersson@chalmers.se\n\nStig Larsson, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, SE-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nEmail address: stig@chalmers.se\n\nFilip Rydin, Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, SE-412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nEmail address: filipry@chalmers.se", "tables": {}, "images": {}}], "id": "2409.14585v2", "authors": ["Kasper B\u00e5gmark", "Adam Andersson", "Stig Larsson", "Filip Rydin"], "categories": ["math.NA", "cs.NA", "math.PR", "stat.CO", "stat.ML"], "abstract": "A numerical scheme for approximating the nonlinear filtering density is\nintroduced and its convergence rate is established, theoretically under a\nparabolic H\\\"ormander condition, and empirically in two numerical examples.
