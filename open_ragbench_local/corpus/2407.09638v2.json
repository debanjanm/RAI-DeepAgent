Our model posits that respect for the elderly arises endogenously: parents invest in cultivating cultural values in their children, who later reciprocate in proportion to this investment. We show that this model is functionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are transferred by the elderly. We focus on the distinct roles of property rights, finding that while insecure output rights may promote elderly welfare, secure rights over productive resources can have comparable benefits. The model reveals a nonlinear relationship between cultural sophistication, property rights, and economic factors such as the capital and land intensity of production, driving variations in elderly well-being across societies. Finally, we consider how the model suggests demographic, technological, and policy changes influence elderly well-being across the spectrum of development.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nAging and the elderly have always been part of human existence. Living into old age is common among hunter-gatherers and was likely even common among early Homo sapiens, suggesting that long lifespans may be an evolutionary adaptation to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle (Gurven and Kaplan, 2009; Kaplan and Robson, 2002, 2003). However, the experience of aging varies significantly across societies. In modern economies, the elderly often sustain themselves through personal means and government-provided benefits (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). By contrast, in traditional societies, including preliterate ones, the elderly's roles and treatment are diverse. They may be revered for their knowledge, act as cultural custodians, or benefit from specialized or evolving property rights. In some cases, their longevity enables them to accumulate productive assets and experience.\n\nDemographic and technological shifts are reshaping institutions and cultural practices surrounding aging. Increased longevity and declining fertility have dramatically expanded the elderly population worldwide, both in total and relative to younger ages. The global population aged 65 or older is expected to rise from 524 million in 2010 to 1.5 billion by 2050 (World Health Organization, 2011). In 1950, there were three children under five for every person over 65; by 2050, this ratio is projected to reverse (World Health Organization, 2011). These changes influence work, consumption, and savings patterns, particularly for the elderly. Popular works, such as Diamond (2012, Chapter 6), highlight aspects of this transformation, and some governments are responding with targeted policies (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019). ${ }^{1}$\n\nAcross all economic development levels, but especially in less developed economies, the elderly play a key role in preserving and transmitting culture. This raises critical questions: how might demographic and technological changes affecting the elderly influence cultural transmission? (World Health Organization, 2011, p. 5). Notably, much of the anticipated growth in the elderly population will occur in lower income countries, where tradition and culture strongly shape their condition (World Health Organization, 2011; United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019).\n\nWe present a simple model to examine the factors shaping elderly treatment across societies, from hunter-gatherers to modern economies. The model shows how material conditions shape cultural practices supporting the elderly and how technological and demographic shifts transform these practices. It highlights the interaction between property rights over productive assets and output, elderly treatment, and cultural transmission.

In Section 2, we relevant models from the literature on the economics of aging, and how they relate to property rights, cultural transmission, and modernization. In Section 3, we discuss aspects of the cross-cultural literature on aging and treatment of the elderly. In Section 4, we present our model, which emphasizes property rights, and shows how a 'curvilinear' pattern in cultural concern for the elderly emerges. Section 5 discusses implications of results and concludes.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Literature \n\nEconomic analysis of aging has long focused on the connection between aging, savings behavior, and capital accumulation, central to many dynamic economic models. For example, the life-cycle model of Modigliani (1966) and the overlapping generations (OLG) models of Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965) explicitly link these factors. The OLG model has proven particularly useful for studying how aging interacts with family structure, intergenerational transfers, and capital accumulation (Michel et al., 2006). Some models, such as those by Boldrin and Jones (2002) and Nishimura and Zhang (1995), invert the traditional altruism paradigm, exploring child-to-parent altruism, which naturally generates elderly support and investment in children's education and fertility.\n\nOther research emphasizes the strategic role of intergenerational transfers in family cohesion. For example, Cigno (1993) shows that family-based transfers can be self-enforcing under specific economic conditions, such as the availability of capital markets and social support systems (Kaplan and Robson, 2003). Studies like Morand (1999) and Blackburn and Cipriani (2006) further explore the connection between fertility, growth, and elderly support, highlighting transitions from high-fertility, traditional economies to low-fertility, modern ones, with changing patterns of intergenerational transfers.\n\nModels of cultural transmission, such as those by Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001), offer additional insights into elderly treatment. Olivera (2013) demonstrates how norms of elderly care can persist despite declining fertility and rising life expectancy. Similarly, Varvarigos (2021) links strong family ties, intergenerational transfers, and traditional means of production to evolving societal norms. Cremer et al. (2013) and Ponthiere (2013) analyze the interaction between social support systems and familial altruism, showing how state-provided care can influence family dynamics and value transmission.\n\nOur approach builds on these foundations but focuses on how cultural transmission in-\n\nteracts with elderly treatment. Unlike models centered on genetic or altruistic motives, we examine how middle-aged individuals cultivate their children's interest in cultural goods provided by the elderly, creating a direct link between cultural preservation and elderly support. This perspective aligns with Cozzi (1998), where cultural investment serves as a form of wealth storage for future consumption.\n\nEmpirical work on altruism toward the elderly supports the complexity of these dynamics. While early studies struggled to disentangle altruistic and self-interested motives (Laferr\u00e9re, 1999), recent research, such as Klimaviciute et al. (2017), finds evidence of 'moderate altruism' driving intergenerational transfers.\n\nOur model advances this literature by integrating strategic and altruistic aspects of elderly treatment with economic growth, property rights, and production. Unlike most prior research, which uses partial equilibrium approaches, we adopt a general equilibrium framework, as in Acemoglu (2009, Chapter 9). This approach allows us to explore how preferences, technology, and elderly treatment co-evolve and to develop measures of 'elderly treatment' and 'elderly prestige.' It also connects technological change with the evolving status and treatment of the elderly, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding these dynamics across cultures and economies.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 The Ethnology of Elderly Treatment\n### 3.1 Cross-cultural research\n\nA foundational study in cross-societal analysis of elderly treatment is Simmons (1970) (originally published in 1945), which surveyed 71 societies, including hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and subsistence agriculturalists from diverse technological, geographical, and environmental conditions. Simmons aimed to capture a broad cross-section of societies to identify patterns in elderly treatment and how these patterns vary with subsistence strategies and societal complexity. ${ }^{2}$\n\nSimmons's work provides a comprehensive snapshot of elderly treatment across societies before the influence of global modernization and established a framework for subsequent cross-cultural studies. It highlights how the role of the elderly evolves with societal complexity and subsistence strategies. Our summary draws on Simmons' findings, the review by Holmes (1976), and the discussion in Arnhoff et al. (1964).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Simmons's methodology resembles the approaches used by G. P. Murdock and collaborators in the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock, 1969) and the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock and White, 1969), as well as data utilized in Pryor (1973). For applications of cross-cultural data in economic modeling, see Baker and Jacobsen (2007b,a); Baker and Miceli (2005).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3.1.1 Food Sharing and Taboos \n\nIn societies without well-developed property rights, such as subsistence hunter-gatherer groups, communal food sharing and food taboos provide consumption security for the elderly. As property rights in land and livestock develop, elderly consumption becomes more secure (Simmons, 1970, Ch. 2).\n\nFood sharing is common among hunter-gatherers, motivated by factors such as insurance, exchange, or resource management, though pinpointing a singular reason is difficult. ${ }^{3}$ Sharing typically redistributes resources 'vertically' from adults to both the elderly and children, and 'horizontally' among hunters (Lee, 2003). Moreover, hunter-gatherers often lack individual ownership rights over food and land, correlating shared food output with communal access to resources. ${ }^{4}$\n\nFood taboos advantageous to the elderly, described as 'Victual Deference' by Silverman and Maxwell (1978), are widespread among hunter-gatherers in various environments. Simmons noted that these taboos serve as \"a social expedient of particular advantage to the aged\" and are often manipulated by the elderly for personal benefit (Simmons, 1970, p. 26). Examples from Simmons include the Inuit, Omaha, Pomo, Iban, and Arunta, where tabooed foods often favored the elderly. Additional examples include the Ju/hoansi of the Kalahari Desert, where elders are believed to have powers enabling them to consume foods considered too dangerous for younger individuals, such as ostrich eggs (Rosenberg, 2009, p. 33). Similarly, among the Chukchee of Siberia, reindeer milk is deemed harmful to the young (McArdle and Yeracaris, 1981; Bogoras, 1904). In the Cook Islands, the Pukapukan people maintained a system of food sharing and taboos that allowed elders to control distribution and reserve nutritious parts, such as belly fats and internal organs, for themselves (Simmons, 1970, p. 10).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "### 3.1.2 Property rights\n\nWhile nonexclusive food sharing benefits the elderly, Simmons observes that \"property rights have been lifesavers for the aged\" (Simmons, 1970, p. 36), suggesting that well-defined property rights over assets also benefit them. Simmons distinguishes between these types of rights, emphasizing that while nonexclusive rights over food help sustain the elderly, ownership of assets like land or livestock provides additional advantages.\n\nSimmons documents asset accumulation by the elderly, such as working animals and livestock, in groups like the Navajo (Southwestern North America), Chukchi (Siberia), Yakut\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ See Baker and Swope (2021) for an overview of sharing theories among hunter-gatherers, and Kelly (2013, Chapter 6) for an extensive discussion.\n    ${ }^{4}$ However, hunter-gatherers can still be territorial at the group level; see (Baker, 2003).\n\n(Russian Far East), and Akamba (Kenya). In agricultural societies with land ownership, respect for the elderly often aligns with asset accumulation. As Simmons notes, \"Firmly entrenched property rights which enhanced the powers of the aged have also been very common among all cultivators of the soil\" (Simmons, 1970, p. 44).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 3.1.3 Knowledge and the Elderly \n\nThe elderly often secure livelihoods by providing valuable services, including administrative tasks that convey power and prestige. Among less developed societies in Simmons' sample, elders may receive payment for childcare, food processing, technical knowledge, or administrative expertise. Their status improves with the importance of tradition and the degree of specialized knowledge they possess.\n\nSimmons also highlights the provision of cultural goods by the elderly in exchange for compensation. For instance, elderly Navajo were paid for knowledge of magic songs and charms, while Pomo and Lengua medicine men earned fees for performing rites (Simmons, 1970, p. 37-38). Cultural conditioning plays a role in establishing property rights over such intangible assets, as with rights over songs and charms, and in shaping practices like food tabooing or game-sharing rules that benefit the elderly.\n\nBeliefs in the magical powers of the elderly are widespread among subsistence hunters and gatherers, instilling fear and respect. Elders are often thought capable of bringing or curing disease, beliefs actively cultivated across varied contexts, including the Yahgan (Tierra del Fuego), Arunta (Australia), Greenland Inuit, Pomo (California Desert), and Witoto (Northern Peru). Among the Ju/'hoansi, some elders are believed to have healing powers derived from their ability to harness mystical forces without being overwhelmed (Rosenberg, 2009, p. 34).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "### 3.1.4 Inculcation\n\nAttitudes and practices toward the elderly are consciously instilled in the young, often at significant cost to parents. Simmons (1962) emphasizes that such treatment arises from deliberate application of resources and effort, stating, 'Respect for old age has resulted from social discipline' (Simmons, 1970, p. 50). Expanding on this point, Simmons observes:\n...while human beings can be as indifferent to the dependency needs of their ancestors...they *can also* learn, be taught, inspired, or impelled to respect, succor, and sustain their elders...these patterns of group and filial responsibility are 'passed on' from generation to generation...This learned behavior is called 'culture'.\" (Simmons, 1962, p. 37)\n\nCultural conditioning thus enables the elderly to access and control resources they might otherwise lack.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 3.2 Elderly Status and Cultural Complexity \n\nSubsequent cross-cultural research on elderly treatment reaches similar conclusions. Press and McKool Jr. (1972, p. 298) summarize Cowgill and Holmes (1971) and their \"ostensibly universal generalizations about the status of the aged,\" that align closely with Simmons (1970). These include the high status of the elderly in contexts where knowledge accumulation is economically important, property rights are accessible, and the elderly can perform meaningful economic tasks. In fact, Press and McKool Jr. (1972, p. 299) note that their independently derived determinants of elderly status coincided with Cowgill's findings.\n\nAlthough much focus has been on hunter-gatherers and subsistence agricultural or pastoral societies, later research explores how elderly treatment evolves with increasing technological complexity. This involves changes in property rights, social complexity, and production methods. However, defining a consistent trajectory for elderly treatment as societies develop is challenging. Research suggests a nonlinear relationship, with treatment varying across levels of societal complexity. Terms like 'status' and 'good treatment' are often poorly defined, complicating analysis. ${ }^{5}$ For example, comparisons of elderly treatment in huntergatherer versus modern industrial societies may hinge on unclear definitions of status and modernity.\n\nA significant characterization is the 'curvilinear hypothesis' (Blumberg and Winch, 1972), as developed by Nimkoff and Middleton (1960). ${ }^{6}$ This hypothesis posits a nonlinear relationship between social complexity and family structure: hunter-gatherers and advanced societies tend to have smaller families, while intermediate-level societies feature expansive familial structures. In societies of intermediate complexity, the elderly often hold high status, as documented by Lee (1979). However, this literature often conflates two factors: preferential treatment due to cultural norms and respect derived from accumulated resources. The core question remains: how do asset accumulation and cultural transmission interact?", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "### 3.3 Some quantitative evidence\n\nSimmons (1970) provides extensive cross-tabulations of variables to highlight empirical regularities in elderly treatment.

To address this, we constructed indices summarizing key societal features related to the elderly. These indices suggest meaningful relationships among societal characteristics. Appendix A provides a detailed discussion of the data and index construction.\n\nThe data includes qualitative traits scaled into indices, summarized in Table 1. The first four indices consider the elderly's role in directly economically productive activities, in social production, in advice and knowledge provision, and the holding of titular roles in the society. The fifth index combines the first three forms of production. The sixth index considers the openness of the society to market-based economic activity. The seventh index measures positive treatment of the elderly, and the eighth index measures the amount of positive inculcation towards the elderly.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Indices constructed from data in Simmons (1970).\n\nWe then correlated the six production and openness of economy indices with the two indices for positive treatment of the elderly and positive inculcation towards the elderly. Table 2 presents these correlations. Positive treatment of the elderly is positively correlated with the elderly's contribution to production and with their provision of advice and knowledge, as well as with the combined production index and with their holding of titular duties. Positive inculcation regarding the elderly is also positively correlated with these categories except for titular duties. Positive treatment and positive inculcation are positively correlated. Interestingly, the open economy index is not correlated with positive treatment and shows some evidence (though not at standard statistical significance) or negative correlation with\n\npositive inculcation. We shall consider these patterns in the context of consistency with our formal model later in the paper.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable 2: Pairwise correlations between indices based on Simmons (1970). * denotes significance at $95 \\%$.

While industrialization is often considered detrimental to elderly well-being (Dowd, 1981, e.g.,), the relationship between industrialization and elderly welfare is nuanced. This complexity remains relevant even in modern societies, raising questions about how institutions like social security systems influence care for the elderly. Such questions grow in significance as many regions transition from traditional to modern economies in the coming decades.\n\nFor example, Koda and Uruyos (2018) find that public transfers can crowd out private care for the elderly, and that the implications of modernization, including lower fertility and smaller families, tend to reduce familial support. These findings align with theories in Koda and Uruyos (2018) and Cigno (1993). However, Ko and M\u00f6ring (2021), in their study of pensions in rural China, report that public pensions increase both well-being and intergenerational exchange. Similarly, Kodate and Timonen (2017) describe the complex interplay between public funding, paid healthcare workers, cultural norms, and family care.\n\nThe treatment of the elderly can influence and be influenced by consumption smoothing. Allocating resources for the future may enhance elderly care through cultural norms, asset accumulation, or both, depending on property rights and the nature of production.\n\nOur model is constructed to shed light on these trade-offs, offering insight into how elderly treatment may evolve in the coming decades. By capturing the interaction between elderly treatment and economic attributes, the model generates predictions consistent with the\n\ncomplexity observed in the ethnographic record. In addition, it helps clarify vague concepts in the empirical literature such as 'status,' 'prestige,' or what it means for the elderly to be 'treated well.'", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 4 Theoretical Framework \n\nThe model is a standard infinite-horizon overlapping-generations framework, where young, middle-aged, and elderly agents coexist at any given time. Decision-making occurs solely in middle age. Young agents derive no utility but may be inculcated with an appreciation for culture. In the base model, middle-aged individuals cultivate a preference in the young for giving gifts to the elderly. Upon reaching middle age, these individuals transfer resources to the elderly, deriving 'warm glow utility' as described by Andreoni (1989). This willingness to transfer depends on the degree of appreciation instilled in them during youth by the current middle-aged cohort. ${ }^{7}$\n\nMiddle-aged and elderly consumption at time $t$ are denoted $c_{m t}$ and $c_{e t}$, with gifts to the elderly represented by $g_{m t}$. The lifetime utility of a middle-aged agent is given by the log-linear utility function:\n\n$$\nU_{t}=\\left(1-\\eta_{t}\\right) \\ln c_{m t}+\\eta_{t} \\ln g_{m t}+\\beta \\ln c_{e t+1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta_{t}$ measures the relative importance of gift-giving in middle-aged utility.\nMiddle-aged agents receive income $y_{m t}$, allocated to consumption $c_{m t}$, savings $s_{m t}$, gifts $g_{m t}$, and inculcative investment in the young. Inculcation determines the future demand parameter $\\eta_{t+1}$, reflecting the young's appreciation for culture when they reach middle age. ${ }^{8}$ The cost of inculcation is $d_{t} \\eta_{t+1}$, with $d_{t}=\\delta y_{m t}(\\delta \\in(0,1))$, scaling costs to income. ${ }^{9}$ Middle-aged consumption is thus:\n\n$$\nc_{m t}=y_{m t}-d_{t} \\eta_{t+1}-s_{m t}-g_{m t}\n$$\n\nElderly consumption $c_{e t}$ is derived from three sources: returns on previous savings $R_{t} s_{m t-1}$, earned income $y_{e t}$, and received gifts $g_{e t}$. Income $y_{e t}$ may include compensation\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ This approach resembles models in which cultural heritage and societal devotion are endogenously determined, such as Cozzi (1998). However, Cozzi's model assumes self-fulfilling beliefs about culture without active cultivation.\n    ${ }^{8}$ This contrasts with Olivera (2013) and Varvarigos (2021), where inculcation increases the likelihood of preference similarity across generations. These can be described as 'Simpsonian' models, inspired by Homer Simpson's parenting philosophy: \"Kids are the best... You can teach them to hate the things you hate.\" (The Simpsons, season 11, episode 233, 1999).\n    ${ }^{9}$ This assumption ensures equilibria remain stationary, facilitating balanced-growth path analysis.\n\nfor productive or advisory roles, government transfers such as social security, or traditional sharing of output in hunter-gatherer societies. Elderly consumption is given by:\n\n$$\nc_{e t}=R_{t} s_{m t-1}+y_{e t}+g_{e t}\n$$\n\nThis model of intergenerational gift-giving also captures cultural transmission. We will demonstrate that the utility function in (1) aligns with a model where cultural goods of endogenously determined value are exchanged across generations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# 4.1 Simple model mechanics \n\nWe begin with a simplified version of the model in which there is no savings ( $s_{m t}=0$ in Equation (3)). This simplification serves three purposes: it clarifies the intuition by focusing solely on the inculcation and gift decisions of current middle-aged agents; it empirically aligns with premodern economies where labor and natural resources, rather than capital accumulation, drive output - a characteristic of hunter-gatherer and subsistence agricultural societies; and it provides insight into the interplay between property rights, inculcation, and elderly treatment.\n\nSubstituting middle-aged consumption (2) and elderly consumption (3) into (1) and setting $s_{m t}=0$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nU_{m t}=\\left(1-\\eta_{t}\\right) \\ln \\left(y_{m t}-g_{m t}-d_{t}\\right)+\\eta_{t} \\ln g_{m t}+\\beta \\ln \\left(y_{e t+1}+g_{e t+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo simplify further, we assume $\\eta_{t} \\in 0, \\eta$ with $0<\\eta<1$, so the current middle-aged generation makes a binary choice: whether to inculcate children to enjoy giving gifts to the elderly at intensity $\\eta$ and cost $d_{t}$, or not. Simultaneously, they decide on a gift for the current elderly, based on the previous generation's inculcation. These assumptions allow us to model the problem as a stationary, infinite-horizon game where each generation sequentially decides on inculcation, anticipating that future generations will adhere to the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium strategy.\n\nMiddle-aged utility in an inculcation equilibrium is:\n\n$$\nU_{m t, \\eta}=(1-\\eta) \\ln \\left(y_{m t}-g_{m t}-d_{t}\\right)+\\eta \\ln g_{m t}+\\beta \\ln \\left(y_{e t+1}+g_{e t+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $g_{e t+1}$ is the expected gift in the next period, given that current youth are inculcated. Stability of this equilibrium can be analyzed by considering a deviation where a middle-aged agent opts out of inculcation, leading to no future gifts. In this case, the agent's lifetime utility becomes:\n\n$$\nU_{m t, 0}=(1-\\eta) \\ln \\left(y_{m t}-g^{\\prime} m t\\right)+\\eta \\ln g^{\\prime} m t+\\beta \\ln \\left(y_{e t+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhen inculcation and gift-giving are maintained, optimal gifts are derived by differentiating (5) with respect to $g_{m t}$, yielding:\n\n$$\ng_{m t}^{*}=\\eta\\left(y_{m t}-d_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, the middle-aged agent gives a gift proportional to disposable income, defined as income remaining after inculcation. Using this, equilibrium gifts received, $g^{e t}$, can be determined. To account for demographic changes, we assume a constant population growth rate $n$, such that $n t+1=(1+n) n_{t}$. In equilibrium, this implies $g^{e t}=(1+n) g^{*} m t$.\n\nIf the middle-aged agent abandons inculcation, the final gift given is $g^{\\prime} m t=\\eta y m t$, and no gift is received during old age in the subsequent period.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 4.1.1 Gifts and transfer of cultural goods \n\nBefore continuing to analyze inculcative decisions, we show that the warm glow gift-giving model is equivalent to a model in which cultural goods are transferred between generations. This allows us to relate the importance of gifting in support of the elderly to a more general notion of cultural transmission and its importance in maintaining the elderly.\n\nSuppose that instead of enjoying giving gifts, the current middle-aged generation places value on consumption of a cultural good, for which a price $p_{t}$ must be paid. The demand for cultural goods is $x_{t}^{d}$ and the good is supplied by current elderly, each of whom has one unit of the good to supply.

When cultural goods are more valuable to the young, as reflected in a higher value of $\\eta_{t+1}$, they pay more for them, enriching the elderly. ${ }^{10}$ We can now establish that this cultural goods model is observationally equivalent to the warm-glow gift-giving model under our assumptions. This leads us to Proposition 1.\n\nProposition 1 (Equivalence of gift-giving and cultural exchange). The models captured by utility functions (1) and (8) are observationally equivalent:\n\n- Gift-giving: Middle-aged agents choose gifts to the elderly, and receive 'warm-glow' utility from giving gifts.\n- Cultural exchange: Middle-aged agents spend $x_{t}^{d} p_{t}$ on cultural goods supplied by the elderly and earn utility from these goods.\n\nProof: The gift-giving model resulted in an equilibrium gift given by current middle-aged agents proportional to current middle-aged disposable income, as in (7). For the cultural goods model, differentiating (9) with respect to $x_{t}^{d}$ and solving gives the demand for $x_{t}^{d}$ as:\n\n$$\nx_{t}^{d}=\\eta \\frac{y_{m t}-d_{t}}{p_{t}}\n$$\n\nEach elderly agent has a supply of one unit of cultural goods, so demand equal to supply requires $x_{t}^{s}=(1+n) x_{t}^{d}$ or $1=(1+n) x_{t}^{d}$.

If relative elderly income falls below the threshold $Y^{*}$, inculcation occurs in equilibrium. The threshold increases (making inculcation more likely) if population growth increases ( $n \\uparrow$ ); this is because there are more middle-aged agents for each elderly agent, resulting in more gifts received. If the effectiveness of inculcation increases $(\\eta \\uparrow)$, if inculcation becomes cheaper $(\\delta \\downarrow)$, and if old-age consumption becomes more important $(\\beta \\uparrow)$, inculcation becomes more likely. When inequality (13) does not hold, middle-agers do not anticipate the need to inculcate current youth, as the income they earn when old generates sufficient income for sustenance. Also, the relatively low income of middle-agers does not produce sufficiently large gifts to warrant inculcation.\n\nWe now add to the model a measure of the status or prestige of the elderly: the relative\n\nconsumption of the elderly, $\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}}$. Using (7) and (13), we write this consumption ratio as follows, accounting for the range of relative incomes for which inculcation and concurrent gift-giving occurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}} & =\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}, & \\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}>Y^{*} \\\\\n& =\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}(1-\\eta)(1-\\delta)}+\\frac{(1+n) \\eta}{1-\\eta}, \\quad \\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}} \\leq Y^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEquation (14) suggests that there may not be a direct link between inculcative activity and elderly treatment. The elderly may provide services or other productive labor so that $y_{e t}$ is large relative to $y_{m t}$.

While he describes property rights as 'lifesavers' for the elderly (Simmons, 1970, p. 36), he also notes that weaker property rights can sometimes benefit them, such as when food is shared communally. To clarify, we distinguish between property rights over inputs like land and property rights over output such as game acquired. Simmons appears to blur these distinctions in his ethnographic overview. Strong property rights over productive assets likely benefit the elderly by ensuring resources are invested in ownership or accumulation. Conversely, weak property rights over output, encouraging communal sharing, also seem advantageous for them. This input-output distinction aligns naturally with the Euler decomposition of the production function (17).\n\nSuppose that each agent has an ownership share of the fixed resource $\\sigma_{i t}, i=m, e$ where $\\sum \\sigma_{i t}=1$ across the population or, in our case, $\\sigma_{e t} N_{e t}+\\sigma_{m t} N_{m t}=1$.

It provides direct insight into how well the elderly are treated given the fundamental characteristics of the economy on its own, but it also functions as the driving variable in whether or not we expect to see inculcation and a cultural factor in the treatment of the elderly as it appears in the inequality (13) in Proposition 2. When $\\phi=0$, (29) collapses to unity. This is because when all output is shared equally, elderly and middle-aged are the same. In Proposition 3, we collect the key results concerning relative income and the definition of property rights embodied in (29).\n\nProposition 3 (Property rights and the relative income of the elderly). The relative income of the elderly, $\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m} t}$ is $U$-shaped in the degree of definition of property rights $\\phi$, provided a) production is not too labor-intensive ( $\\alpha$ is not too large), and b) provided $A_{e}<A_{m}$; the elderly have a relatively smaller endowment of labor.\n\nProof: In what follows, the total population is $N_{e t}+N_{m t}=N_{t}$. Taking the derivative of relative income $\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}$ in (29) and simplifying gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}\\right)}{\\partial \\phi}=\\frac{N_{t} L_{t}\\left(A_{e t} N_{e t}+A_{m t}\\left(N_{t} \\phi^{\\rho}(1-\\alpha)(1+\\rho)-N_{e t}\\right)\\right)}{N_{e t}\\left((1-\\alpha) A_{m t} N_{t} \\phi^{\\rho+1}-\\left(A_{m t}-A_{e t}\\right) N_{e t} \\phi-L_{t}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nEvaluating (30) at $\\phi=0$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\left(\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}\\right)}{\\partial \\phi}=\\left(A_{e t}-A_{m t}\\right) \\frac{N_{t}}{L_{t}}\n$$\n\nWhich is negative so long as $A_{e t}<A_{m t}$. Therefore, the relative income ratio starts at 1 and initially decreases in $\\phi$. The sign of the derivative in (30) thereafter depends wholly on the expression in the numerator of (30):\n\n$$\nA_{e t} N_{e t}+A_{m t}\\left(N_{t} \\phi^{\\rho}(1-\\alpha)(1+\\rho)-N_{e t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis expression is increasing in $\\phi$ and equals zero at a critical value of $\\phi, \\phi^{*}$, given by:\n\n$$\n\\phi^{*}=\\left(\\frac{\\left(A_{m t}-A_{e t}\\right) N_{t}}{A_{m t} N_{t}(1-\\alpha)(1+\\rho)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}\n$$\n\nAs the derivative in equation (31) is initially negative, equals zero at a unique point $\\phi^{*} \\in(0,1)$ and then becomes positive, relative income is U -shaped in the degree to which property rights are developed, $\\phi$.\n\nProposition 3 starts with the assumption that $A_{e t}<A_{m t}$, which means that an elderly agent provides fewer effective units of labor than a middle-aged agent. Another assumption is that $\\alpha$ is not very large; if it were $\\phi^{*}$ would be outside the $(0,1)$ range and relative elderly income would only decreases in $\\phi$. When $\\phi=1$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{A_{e t}}{A_{m t}}+\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\frac{N_{m t}}{N_{e t}}\n$$\n\nThe limit ratio in (34) can be greater than one or less than one, depending on the relative elderly population and their relative productivity. For small enough $\\alpha$ (that is, production is resource intensive), the ratio in (34) can be greater than one even if $A_{e t}=0$ (the elderly do not supply any material labor). Then, the elderly can achieve a high level of prestige measured by relative income even in the absence of inculcation. This is because the elderly have accumulated assets in middle age.\n\nFigure 1 plots the relative income ratio (29) as a function of property rights development, $\\phi$, under varying assumptions about production. While model parameters can shift the curve's position, its overall shape remains consistent. The figure aligns with the empirical evidence discussed earlier. It suggests that in relatively egalitarian societies, cultural protections for the elderly may be unnecessary. However, as property rights initially develop, downward pressure on the relative consumption of the elderly creates demand for mechanisms like cultural inculcation to ensure their livelihood. For example, cultural goods or food taboos can transfer current income into future consumption. As resource ownership expands, asset income begins to benefit the elderly directly, reducing the need for such institutions, even as their prestige continues to rise.\n\nFigure 2 combines results from Propositions 2 and 3. As property rights develop ( $\\phi$ increases) and the economy moves rightward along the $x$-axis, the relative consumption ratio $\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}}$ (equivalent to $\\frac{y_{e t}}{y_{m t}}$ in this range) initially declines, crossing the $Y^{*}$ threshold from Proposition 2 at the vertical dashed line. At this point, inculcation begins, encouraging young people to support the elderly, mitigating the decline in relative treatment. However, once property rights become sufficiently advanced, inculcation ceases, as shown in the figure.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Relative consumption of the elderly $\\left(\\frac{c_{o t}}{c_{m t}}\\right)$, as functions of the development of property rights in output and productive resources from nonexistent $(\\phi=0)$ to complete $(\\phi=1)$.

{"section_id": 21, "text": "# 4.4 Savings, Capital Accumulation, and Inculcation \n\nWe now analyze a version of the model where assets are accumulated through conscious savings decisions, exploring how this interacts with inculcation and gifts to the elderly. This approach also connects inculcative investment with savings and aligns the exposition with classical growth models featuring technological progress.\n\nThe optimization problem of a current middle-aged agent can be written as the problem of maximizing $U_{t}$ in (1) subject to constraints (2) and (3), as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\max _{g_{t}, s_{m t}, \\eta_{t+1}} & \\left(1-\\eta_{t}\\right) \\ln c_{m t}+\\eta_{t} \\ln g_{m t}+\\beta \\ln c_{e t+1} \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & c_{m t}=y_{m t}-d_{t} \\eta_{t+1}-s_{m t}-g_{m t} \\\\\n& c_{e t+1}=s_{m t} R_{t+1}+(1+n) g_{e t+1}+y_{e t+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe solution of (35) presents two challenges. First, a solution must take into account that current middle-aged agents' future gifts depend on current inculcative investment through the parameter $\\eta_{t+1}$, and in an equilibrium solution to the model, beliefs about this dependence must be correct. Second, a solution must admit the possibility of solutions in which $\\eta_{t}^{*}=$ 0 . The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium solution to the problem (35) has a structure in which agents give gifts in proportion to the present discounted value of lifetime income, with this proportion depending on $\\eta_{t}$. For the time being, we have bypassed the issue of the determination of $\\eta_{t}^{*}$ and skip to the form of the gift-giving function, which is given in Proposition 4:\n\nProposition 4 (Gifts with accumulation). If $\\eta_{t}>0$ in equilibrium, gifts $g_{m t}^{*}$ are given by:\n\n$$\ng_{m t}^{*}=\\frac{\\eta_{t}}{1+\\beta}\\left(y_{m t}+\\frac{y_{e t+1}}{R_{t+1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof: See Appendix B.\nProposition 4 shows how equilibrium gifts and therefore, by analogy to Proposition 1, cultural transmission, are proportional to lifetime income. Using Proposition 4, we can then begin to solve the maximization problem in (35). Two aspects of this solution are highlighted in Proposition 5.\n\nProposition 5 (Total savings and gross returns on savings). If $\\eta_{t}>0$ in equilibrium, middleaged agents' aggregate savings - the sum of inculcative investments and conventional savings - is described by:\n\n$$\ns_{m t}+\\eta_{t+1} d_{t}=\\frac{\\beta y_{m t}-\\frac{y_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}}{1+\\beta}\n$$\n\nIn equilibrium, the gross rate of return on conventional savings is given by:\n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\frac{1+n}{1+\\beta} \\frac{y_{m t}+\\frac{y_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}}{d_{t-1}}\n$$\n\nProof: See Appendix C.\nEquation (37) in Proposition 5 describes the total amount middle-aged agents wish to allocate to future consumption. Expenditures on savings and inculcation add up to the fraction of income a middle-aged agent wishes to save, which depends upon current income less discounted future income. Equation (38) in Proposition 5 requires that the rates of return on the different means of transferring current wealth to the future in (37) be equilibrated. The rate of return on inculcative investments and conventional savings must be equal; otherwise, middle-aged agents would not employ both savings instruments. As we maintain the assumption that $d_{t}$ is proportional to income $\\left(d_{t}=\\delta y_{m t}\\right)$, we can interpret (38) to mean that returns to assets such as capital must be equal in equilibrium to the unit return on inculcative investment.\n\nThe question remains whether an equilibrium with gifts and inculcation is sustainable; i.e., whether $\\eta_{t}>0$ in equilibrium. We need to round out the model to see how $\\eta_{t}, s_{t}$, and $R_{t}$ depend on the underlying nature of the economy, as they are quantities determined in equilibrium and require specification of the production side of the economy.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 22, "text": "# 4.4.1 Production and Economic Growth \n\nWe again use a Cobb-Douglas production technology in which production occurs according to the aggregate production function $Y_{t}=L_{t}^{\\alpha} K_{t}^{1-\\alpha}$, where $K_{t}$ now denotes the total capital stock and as before $L_{t}$ denotes total effective labor supply:\n\n$$\nL_{t}=A_{m t} N_{m t}+A_{e t} N_{e t}\n$$\n\nWe assume that $A_{i t}, i=e, m$ grows at a constant exogenous rate $a$, while the population grows at a rate $n$.

In equilibrium, Proposition 5 implies that the effective capital stock evolves over time according to:\n\n$$\n(1-\\alpha) k_{t}^{-\\alpha}=\\frac{(1+n)(1+a)}{(1+\\beta) \\delta}\\left(\\left(\\frac{k_{t}}{k_{t-1}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}+\\frac{\\tau_{e}(1+a)}{1-\\alpha} \\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_{t-1}^{1-\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhile the inculcative parameter $\\eta_{t}$ evolves over time according to:\n\n$$\n\\eta_{t+1}=\\frac{\\beta}{(1+\\beta) \\delta}-\\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_{t}^{1-\\alpha}}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{e}(1+a)}{(1-\\alpha)(1+\\beta) \\delta}+\\frac{(1+n)(1+a)}{\\alpha \\delta\\left(1-\\gamma_{e}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof: See Appendix E.\nEquation (43) describes the dynamics of inculcation but also determines whether there will be any inculcative investment at all in equilibrium. When the right-hand side of (43) is nonpositive, $\\eta_{t+1}=0$ in equilibrium. This possibility depends on the rates of population growth and technological progress; in particular, a higher rate of technological progress makes\n\n$\\eta=0$ more likely. Higher growth rates increase the demand and hence returns on capital, making inculcation less desirable. Also making $\\eta=0$ more likely in equilibrium are higher inculcative costs, as measured by $\\delta$, and greater direct participation in the economy by the elderly (larger values for both $\\tau_{e}$ and $\\gamma_{e}$ ).\n\nA value of the relative consumption ratio of the elderly $\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}}$ can be found using the equilibrium values of savings, inculcation, and gifts. In Appendix E, we describe the calculations that lead to Proposition 7:\n\nProposition 7 (Relative consumption, inculcation, and growth). In equilibrium, when $\\eta_{t}^{s}>$ 0 , the relative ratio of elderly to middle-age consumption is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}}=\\frac{\\beta R_{t}}{1-\\eta_{t}} \\frac{y_{m t-1}+\\frac{y_{e t}}{R_{t}}}{y_{m t}+\\frac{y_{e t+1}}{R_{t+1}}}\n$$\n\nOtherwise, relative consumption is simply determined by relative incomes; that is\n\n$$\n\\frac{c_{e t}}{c_{m t}}=\\frac{y_{e t}+R_{t} s_{t-1}}{y_{m t}}\n$$\n\nProof: See Appendix D.\nProposition 7 indicates that the relative consumption ratio depends on relative lifetime incomes, and therefore the overall growth rate of the economy. The proposition also suggests that equilibrium asset returns, $R$, and the magnitude of $\\eta$ are important in driving relative consumption. This is particularly true along a balanced growth path, as in a balanced growth equilibrium, incomes grow at a rate $a$, and asset returns are constant. Along a balanced growth path, (44) reduces to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c_{e}}{c_{m}}=\\frac{\\beta R}{(1-\\eta)(1+\\alpha)}\n$$\n\nEquation (46) therefore indicates that parameters such as $\\alpha$, the labor intensity of production, $n$, the growth rate of population, and $\\delta$, the per-unit-income costs of inculcation will influence the relative consumption of the elderly by exerting an impact on the level of inculcation $\\eta$ and equilibrium asset returns $R$. Of course, $\\eta$ and $R$ are somewhat complicated functions of model parameters, as discussed in Section 4.5.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 23, "text": "# 4.5 Analysis with accumulation \n\nThe rest of the modeling section of the paper consists in delving into the implications of Propositions 5, 6, and 7. We first solve a simplified version of the model in which all elderly\n\nincome derives from asset accumulation, and $y_{e}=0$ at every $t$, which is equivalent to assuming that $\\tau_{e}=\\gamma_{e}=0$, so the elderly do not contribute any productive labor and only provide previously accumulated capital to the economy.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 24, "text": "# 4.5.1 Asset income as the sole source of elderly income \n\nWhen $y_{e t}=0$, the equilibrium gift function (36) reduces to:\n\n$$\ng_{m t}^{*}=\\frac{\\eta_{t}}{1+\\beta} y_{m t}\n$$\n\nAnd the rate equilibration condition (38) is:\n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\frac{1+n}{1+\\beta} \\frac{y_{m t}}{\\delta y_{m t-1}}\n$$\n\nThe sum of cultural investment and asset savings (37) becomes:\n\n$$\ns_{m t}+\\eta_{t+1} d_{t}=\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta} y_{m t}\n$$\n\nEquations (47, 48 and 49) reflect that when there is no elderly labor income, the decisions of current middle-ageds reduce to allocating shares of income between overall savings, giftgiving and inculcation, in such a way that the returns between inculcative investment and asset accumulation are equilibrated.\n\nThe general equilibrium aspects of the model can be deduced by substituting $\\tau_{e}=0$ into (42) in Proposition 6, which gives a simple recursion for the stock of capital per effective unit labor:\n\n$$\nk_{t+1}=\\frac{(1-\\alpha)(1+\\beta) \\delta}{(1+n)(1+a)} k_{t}^{1-\\alpha}\n$$\n\nUsing $\\gamma_{e}=0$ and $\\tau_{e}=0$ in (43) in Proposition 6 and rearranging results in another recursion for the effective capital stock:\n\n$$\nk_{t+1}=\\frac{\\alpha}{(1+a)(1+n)}\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}-\\delta \\eta_{t+1}\\right) k_{t}^{1-\\alpha}\n$$\n\nEquation (51) shows how the possibility of inculcation and gifts impacts the canonical overlapping-generations model with population and technological progress, as developed in Acemoglu (2009). But for the $\\delta \\eta_{t+1}$ term in (51), the accumulation condition is a standard capital accumulation condition in growth models, so the possibility of inculcative investment reduces the amount of capital per effective unit of labor, which will increase equilibrium asset return rates. Dividing (50) by (51) and solving the result for $\\eta_{t+1}$ gives a time-independent\n\nsolution for the inculcative parameter $\\eta$ :\n\n$$\n\\eta_{t+1}^{*}=\\eta^{*}=\\frac{\\beta}{(1+\\beta) \\delta}-\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}(1+\\beta)\n$$\n\nEquation (52) indicates that a larger $\\delta$ reduces the equilibrium size of $\\eta^{*}$. An increase in the relative intensity of capital in production, measured by $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$, also negatively impacts $\\eta$. Societies that employ more capital-intensive means of production, other things equal, will have lower degrees of inculcation.\n\nIf parameters are configured so that $\\eta^{*} \\leq 0$, in equilibrium $\\eta=0$, and there is no inculcative investment. The elderly ensure their livelihood as they would in the typical overlapping generations model: through prior accumulation of productive assets. Setting (52) to zero and solving for $\\alpha$ gives an interpretation of (52) as a condition for inculcation to occur in terms of the relative capital intensity of production:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\leq \\frac{\\beta}{\\delta(1+\\beta)^{2}}\n$$\n\nThis threshold depends positively on the costs of inculcation, and on $\\beta$, which influences the relative weight placed on consumption in old age in utility. If (53) is not satisfied and no inculcation occurs, we recover the law of motion for the capital stock by using $\\eta=0$ in (51). In forming the relative ratio of consumption, we find it most straightforward to solve the model in terms of $R$, equilibrium asset returns, rather than in terms of $k$, the equilibrium per unit of labor capital stock. We find a steady-state value of $k, \\bar{k}$, and then use this to compute the balanced-growth rate of asset returns $\\bar{R}=(1-\\alpha) \\bar{k}^{-\\alpha}$.\n\nWhen no inculcation occurs (that is, (53) is not satisfied), equilibrium returns can be found by using $\\eta=0$ in (51). Writing the resultant expression in terms of $\\bar{R}$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}=(1-\\alpha) \\frac{(1+a)(1+n)(1+\\beta)}{\\beta \\alpha}\n$$\n\nWhen (53) is satisfied, we find $\\eta^{*}$ as given in (52), and equilibrium asset returns follow from (51). These are:\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}=\\frac{(1+a)(1+n)}{(1+\\beta) \\delta}\n$$\n\nCollecting all of these results gives us a relative consumption ratio that depends on whether or not inculcation and gift giving will occur in equilibrium, which can be obtained by using equilibrium values of $\\bar{R}$ and $\\eta$ in Equation (46):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{c_{e}}{c_{m}}=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}(1+\\beta)(1+n), & \\eta^{*}=0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta(1+n)}{\\delta(1+\\beta)\\left(1+\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}(1+\\beta)\\right)-\\beta}, & \\eta^{*}>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPopulation growth increases the relative well-being of the elderly, whether or not gifts are involved. In a high-capital-intensity setting without gift-giving or inculcation, this occurs because population growth raises the relative scarcity of capital, boosting returns on accumulated assets and benefiting the elderly. In cases with gift-giving, this effect is amplified by the greater number of young people, leading to more gifts being distributed to the elderly.\n\nThe capital intensity of production, $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$, significantly influences the relative treatment of the elderly. As in the model from Section 4.2, more labor-intensive production tends to lower the relative treatment of the elderly. However, cultural practices such as inculcation and acculturation emerge to mitigate this decline when income primarily depends on labor rather than accumulated assets, providing a way to transfer income to the elderly. Conversely, in more asset-intensive production, the elderly's relative treatment improves due to asset income, but cultural acculturation to support the elderly diminishes.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates this dynamic, showing the relative consumption of the elderly, $\\frac{c_{e}}{c_{m}}$, from (56) as a function of capital intensity. The figure reveals a nonlinear, U-shaped relationship between elderly treatment and capital intensity, similar to the pattern seen in the property-rights model of Section 4.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 25, "text": "# 4.5.2 Full model solution \n\nWhen the elderly can save and also have a sources of labor income, the model is more complex because elderly labor income provides sustenance and also raises lifetime income. This makes it difficult to accurately state how changes in model parameters influence inculcation, accumulation, and relative treatment of the elderly. With $\\tau_{e}, \\gamma_{e}>0$, the steady-state relationships corresponding to (42) and (43) in Proposition 6 can be written as:\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{(1+n)(1+a)}{(1+\\beta) \\delta}\\left(1+\\frac{(1+a) \\tau_{e}}{R}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{\\beta}{\\delta(1+\\beta)}-\\frac{(1+a)}{\\delta R}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_{e}}{1+\\beta}+\\frac{(1+n)}{\\left(1-\\gamma_{e}\\right)} \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nSolving (57) for the equilibrium asset return rate gives:\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Relative consumption of the elderly $\\left(\\frac{c_{o t}}{c_{m t}}\\right)$, as a function of the capital intensity of production, $\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$.\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{(1+n)(1+a)}{2 \\delta(1+\\beta)}\\left(1+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{4(1+\\beta) \\delta}{(1+n)} r_{e}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom (57), we see that as $\\tau_{e}$ increases, meaning that the elderly have a relatively larger source of income, $R$ increases in an equilibrium with a positive amount of inculcation $(\\eta>0)$. When a future source of income is available, the incentives to save are deadened. Similarly, increases in $\\tau_{e}$ lessen inculcative investments, as is evident from (58).\n\nWhen there is no inculcation, we can solve (43) with $\\eta=0$ and rearrange terms to get the following expression for asset returns:\n\n$$\nR=\\frac{1+a}{\\beta}\\left(\\frac{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}{1-\\gamma_{e}} \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}+\\tau_{e}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing (60) and $\\eta=0$ in (46), we find that relative consumption becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c_{e}}{c_{m}}=\\frac{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}{1-\\gamma_{e}} \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}+\\tau_{e}\n$$\n\nWe can rearrange expression (46) to give a condition for inculcation to occur once again. This condition again reflects the key role played by the capital intensity of production. No inculcation and gift-giving occur in equilibrium so long as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha} \\geq\\left(\\frac{R \\beta}{(1+a)}-\\tau_{e}\\right) \\frac{1-\\gamma_{e}}{(1+\\beta)(1+n)}\n$$\n\nIt is easiest to see how equilibrium is influenced when $\\tau_{e}>0$ compared to the case in which $\\tau_{e}=0$. as depicted on Figure 3. In Figure 4, we superimpose the critical line depicting the relative capital intensity at which $\\eta$ goes to zero, and the resulting consumption ratios when $\\tau_{e}>0$ on those depicted in 3 .\n\nAlthough Figure 4 suggests greater elderly labor income reduces the incidence of inculcative, gift-giving equilibria, it also indicates that the impact of labor income on relative elderly consumption are not obvious. On the left-hand side of the figure we see that the relative consumption ratio of the elderly goes down as a result of the increased income shift. This is because total labor supply increases, which depresses labor incomes in general.\n\nThis last set of results indicates how the advent or expansion of societal welfare targeted towards the elderly may impact the transmission and maintenance of culture, some of the particulars of which we described in Section 3. Such changes act to increase $\\tau_{e}$ in the model, which may have a deleterious effect on inculcation, and therefore cultural transmission.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Relative consumption of the elderly $\\left(\\frac{c_{o t}}{c_{m t}}\\right)$, as a function of relative capital intensity with $\\tau_{e}>0$.

{"section_id": 26, "text": "# 5 Discussion and Conclusions \n\nThe model in this paper builds on prior research into intergenerational transfers and their role in supporting the elderly while allowing for a deeper exploration of cross-cultural findings on elderly treatment. Our analysis spans both recent phenomena, such as the demographic transition, and historical shifts in elderly treatment across varying levels of technological sophistication. By incorporating the interplay between property rights, culture, and elderly treatment, the model centers attention on elderly well-being rather than intermediate economic features like transfer patterns.\n\nThe model highlights the complexity of relationships between ownership, accumulation, production, and elderly treatment, providing theoretical support for observed ethnographic patterns including the 'curvilinear hypothesis.' It also addresses how accumulation in production impacts the elderly, showing that while initial accumulation may disadvantage them, increasing its importance can eventually benefit their relative status. These findings align with the hypothesis of a nonlinear relationship between familial complexity and degree of modernization (Nimkoff and Middleton, 1960; Blumberg and Winch, 1972). They echo Murdock and Provost (1973), who observed that the most culturally advanced societies often fall at the mid-spectrum of technological complexity, noting, \"This essentially bimodal or curvilinear distribution is inconsistent with any unilinear interpretation of social development\" (Murdock and Provost, 1973, p. 392). Our model offers insights into why such a pattern might arise, particularly regarding elderly treatment and cultural transmission. ${ }^{13}$\n\nSeveral avenues for future research emerge from this work. One is the interplay between family structure, technological change, and elderly treatment. While our model touches on these issues through its focus on gift-giving and familial ties, deeper exploration of the connections between elderly treatment, marriage, and fertility is warranted. ${ }^{14}$ Gender differences in elderly treatment also deserve attention, as emphasized by Simmons (1970). Furthermore, the dynamics of inculcation and cultural transmission, including their public-goods and behavioral aspects, remain ripe for investigation (Bowles, 1998). Finally, while our focus has been on inter-societal well-being of the elderly, future research could address inequality among the elderly, examining how poverty and disparities relate to cultural transmission and gift-giving practices. We hope this framework will inspire further inquiry into these important topics.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ Similar patterns are discussed in the context of land inheritance by Baker and Miceli (2005) and marriage institutions by Baker and Jacobsen (2007a,b).\n    ${ }^{14}$ See related discussions in Cigno et al. (2020) and Bisin and Verdier (2000).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 27, "text": "# Appendix A Data Appendix \n\nWe describe the data underlying the analysis presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the text and also provide an overview of the data in Simmons (1970). ${ }^{15}$ Simmons developed variables to measure the presence and importance of material, social, and cultural characteristics across 71 cultures, including hunters, pastoralists, nomads, and agriculturalists. Features were coded as + (very important), $=$ (somewhat important), - (present but unimportant), or 0 (absent). We recoded nonmissing values numerically, ranging from 3 (very important) to 0 (absent).\n\nSimmons's data includes 224 features, with some values specific to women, men, or the elderly. However, missing values and vague variable definitions make formal analysis beyond Simmons's cross-tabulations challenging and potentially misleading. Therefore, we adopted a descriptive approach, compiling summary indices from his data. The evidence presented in the text is based on these indices, whose construction we now discuss.\n\nTable A1 describes the variables that we judge as capturing the market-openness of the economic environment present; specifically, the degree to which property rights, exchange, and market orientation are features of a society.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nTable A1: Variables included in the openness of economy index, which captures the degree to which a market-oriented economy might be present in each society\n\nOur market openness index is constructed by simply adding and subtracting characteristics. While more complex methods like principal components could be used, experimentation showed little benefit compared to this transparent approach. We sum the first six characteristics in Table A1 and subtract the last (communal land ownership). Summary statistics for the index are in Table A8.\n\nSimmons also notes how actively the elderly participate in aspects of the economy. The variables summarized in Table A2 include jobs that the elderly do in society that we judge\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ All data are derived directly from Simmons (1970), and are available on request from the authors.\n\nto directly support the production of physical output in a society, or perform functions that free other members of society to engage in direct production.\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nTable A2: Variables included in market development and sophistication index\n\nFrom these variables, we form what we call a direct production index by simply adding all the variables in the table, treating missing values as zeros. The resulting index is summarized in Table A8 and is designed to capture something about the degree to which the elderly contribute to material life in each culture.\n\nThe next set of variables we use to construct an index of the degree to which the elderly perform important ritualistic or social functions. These variables are summarized on table A3; the sum of the variables comprises our index of social functions, also summarized in table A8.\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nTable A3: Social functions performed by the elderly\n\nThe variables summarized in Table A 4 describe the degree to which the elderly provide advice, store important social information, or perform other functions that require knowledge. We computed an index of knowledge provision based on just summing up these variables.\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\nTable A4: Knowledge provision by the elderly\n\nThe variables in Table A5 describe the degree to which the elderly hold important titles in society, function as elders, judges, or chiefs. Our index of titular duties is created as a simple sum of these variables.\n\n![table_6](table_6)\n\nTable A5: Titular functions of the elderly\n\nVarious variables catalog the degree to which the elderly are respected, supported by the community, or more generally viewed by society. These variables are collected in Table A6, and we collect these variables into an index that is a simple sum of these variables.\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\nTable A6: Positive treatment practices towards the elderly\n\nSome variables actually measure the degree to which the elderly are pictured as having magical powers and related beliefs. We gather all of these variables into an index, which is a simple sum of the variables in Table A7.\n\n![table_8](table_8)\n\nTable A7: Inculcated beliefs about the elderly\n\nTable A8 contains a summary of all indices that we have created. These indices are used to calculate the correlations in Table 1 in the text.\n\n![table_9](table_9)\n\nTable A8: Summary statistics for constructed indices used in Table 1.", "tables": {"table_2": "|

Our model posits that respect for the elderly arises endogenously:\nparents invest in cultivating cultural values in their children, who later\nreciprocate in proportion to this investment. We show that this model is\nfunctionally equivalent to one in which cultural goods are transferred by the\nelderly. We focus on the distinct roles of property rights, finding that while\ninsecure output rights may promote elderly welfare, secure rights over\nproductive resources can have comparable benefits. The model reveals a\nnonlinear relationship between cultural sophistication, property rights, and\neconomic factors such as the capital and land intensity of production, driving\nvariations in elderly well-being across societies. Finally, we consider how the\nmodel suggests demographic, technological, and policy changes influence elderly\nwell-being across the spectrum of development.", "updated": "2025-02-13T16:00:26Z", "published": "2024-07-12T18:53:05Z"}
