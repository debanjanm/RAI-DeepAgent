Introduction \n\nProphet inequalities have emerged as a powerful framework for studying a wide range of problems in revenue management that require robust, real-time decision-making under uncertainty. Introduced in the context of optimal stopping (Krengel and Sucheston 1978, Samuel-Cahn 1984), these inequalities compare online policies (which have distributional knowledge of future arrivals) to an optimal offline benchmark, known as the \"prophet\", providing provable performance guarantees. This perspective unifies diverse applications, including sequential pricing (Hill and Kertz 1982, Gallego and Van Ryzin 1994, Correa et al. 2017), online resource allocation (Alaei et al. 2012, Ma et al. 2021, Feng et al. 2022), and combinatorial auctions (Chawla et al. 2010, Feldman et al. 2013, Dutting et al. 2020), among others. Moreover, by distilling complex, stochastic environments into tractable models, prophet inequalities serve as a foundational tool for theoretical analysis and for offering practical solutions in revenue management-which are often simple, interpretable, and approximately optimal.\n\nA common feature of nearly all work on prophet inequalities, motivated by classical revenue management settings such as pricing a product for sale or assortment planning in retail, is that online policies make only irrevocable decisions; once a decision is made (for example, accepting an arriving user's service request), it is set in stone and cannot be changed later. Relaxing this assumption grants the online policy more flexibility: it can revisit past decisions and cancel some, thereby avoiding early commitments to low-valued user requests. This paradigm is particularly relevant in modern applications such as cloud spot markets, where an assigned computing resource may be reclaimed and reassigned to improve supply efficiency, or in revenue management settings that permit overbooking (e.g., online hotel reservations or selling banner ads), where multiple assignments can initially be made and then selectively revoked later. Similarly, in volunteer matching platforms, the assignments of volunteers to tasks often change when better-suited volunteers arrive to improve match qualities.\n\nAlthough cancellations can help improve the performance of online policies, there is a tradeoff due to the negative externalities-implicit or explicit-that they impose on users whose initial assignments are canceled. Therefore, regardless of the application, it is paramount to control the amount of cancellations an online policy makes. One approach to capture controlled cancellations, known in the literature as the \"buyback model\" (Babaioff et al. 2008, Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg 2009, Ekbatani et al. 2022, 2023), is to maximize a mixed-sign objective function that incorporates costly cancellations: the total reward of an online policy from serving (uncanceled) requests is penalized by the total reward of canceled requests, rescaled by a parameter $f \\geq 0$. This parameter, often referred to as the buyback parameter, can be viewed as the cost of canceling each unit of reward,\n\nreflecting how significant cancellations penalize the online policy. In particular, this model provides a smooth interpolation between the offline scenario, where $f=0$ (i.e., no penalty for cancellations), and the fully online scenario with irrevocable decisions, where $f=+\\infty$ (i.e., no cancellation is allowed).\n\nProblem statement \\& model: Motivated by the above, we initiate the study of the single-item prophet inequality problem with costly cancellations. More formally, we consider a setting in which a decision maker is presented with a sequence of random variables $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots$ one by one (think of them as rewards for fulfilling a request or willingness-to-pay of users for a service), where each $X_{i}$ is drawn independently from a known distribution $F_{i}$. Once $X_{i}$ is revealed in round $i$, the decision maker can accept it or proceed to the next round. In the standard (vanilla) prophet inequality setting, the process ends as soon as the first variable is accepted. We diverge from this setting by allowing the decision maker to accept $X_{i}$ even after previously accepting $X_{j}$ for some $j<i$. If a variable $X_{j}$ was already accepted, it must be revoked (and its reward forfeited) by paying a cancellation cost of $f \\cdot X_{j}$. The goal is to maximize the expected net reward, defined as the value of the final accepted variable minus all cancellation costs. ${ }^{1}$\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the above is a natural model due to invariance under scaling of rewards. From an applications perspective, the model is also quite natural: not only does it fit certain revenue management settings described above, but the cancellation cost can also be alternatively interpreted as a buyback cost, i.e., a \"compensation fee\" in the form of a fixed percentage of the original transfer paid to the user to reclaim the resource-which is prevalent in practice, e.g., in airline booking (U.S. Department of Transportation 2011).\n\nTo establish prophet inequalities in this setting, we compare the expected net reward of an online policy with the prophet benchmark-the offline omniscient policy that observes all realizations in advance and selects the maximum, thereby achieving a reward of $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max _{i} X_{i}\\right]$. We measure performance via the competitive ratio, defined as the worst-case ratio between these two expected rewards. Let $\\alpha(f)$ denote the optimal competitive ratio achievable by any online policy. Because each distribution $F_{i}$ is known, one can compute an optimal online policy using polynomial-time dynamic programming. ${ }^{2}$ Hence, $\\alpha(f)$ is the worst-case ratio of the expected net rewards of the optimal online and offline policies. In the special case of $f=+\\infty$, our model reduces to the classic prophet inequality\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ While it may appear that cancellations happen in an online manner, one could equivalently view this as an online allocation problem with overbooking, where only the request yielding the highest reward is ultimately allocated, and the decision maker pays to cancel all other overbooked requests at the end of the decision making horizon.\n    ${ }^{2}$ The state of this dynamic program is essentially the pair of the current time and the value of the previously accepted variable, so it is polynomial-time solvable by using backward induction, once values are discretized properly.\n\nproblem, which admits a simple threshold-based 0.5-competitive policy (Samuel-Cahn 1984). Importantly, this policy is order-agnostic (Kleinberg and Weinberg 2012), which means that it requires only knowledge of the set $\\left\\{F_{i}\\right\\}$, not the order in which random variables arrive. As $f \\rightarrow 0$, cancellations become free, and a greedy policy can exactly obtain the offline solution, implying $\\lim _{f \\rightarrow 0} \\alpha(f)=1$. Consequently, we expect $\\alpha(f) \\in[0.5,1]$ for all $f \\geq 0$. We now ask the following research questions:\n(i) Can we characterize the optimal competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ as a function of the buyback parameter $f$, for all possible choices of $f \\geq 0$ ?\n(ii) Can we design and analyze a simple, polynomial-time, and order-agnostic policy, \u00e0 la Samuel-Cahn (1984), that achieves the optimal competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ for all $f \\geq 0$ ?\n\nOur main contributions: In summary, we answer both of the above questions in the affirmative. We not only characterize the extra gain from cancellations in the buyback model, but also show that there is a simple policy that achieves this gain, with all the desired properties described earlier.\n(i) Optimal competitive ratio in all parameter regimes. For the first question, we identify a particular nonlinear differential equation, parameterized by $f$, along with certain boundary conditions (see Definition 1). We then show that it always admits a proper solution $y_{f}:\\left[\\frac{f}{f+1}, 1\\right] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ by constructing one for any $f \\geq 0$. Using this solution, we establish our first main result, which is a full characterization of the optimal competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ for all buyback parameters $f \\geq 0$ :\n[Main Result 1] For any buyback parameter $f \\geq 0$, the optimal online policy achieves a competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$ against the optimal offline benchmark. Moreover, for any $f \\geq 0$, there exists an instance with finitely many two-point random variables for which no online algorithm can attain a competitive ratio greater than $\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$.\n\nSee Figure 1 for a comparison of this bound with the literature. For small values of $f$, say $f=0.2$ (with $\\alpha(0.2) \\approx 0.82$ ), there is a substantial improvement in the competitive ratio versus 0.5 . We note that even for moderately large values of $f$, say $f=1$ (with $\\alpha(1)=\\frac{2}{3}$ ) or $f=2$ (with $\\alpha(2)=\\frac{3}{5}$ ), there is still a considerable improvement, showing the value of introducing costly cancellations in the prophet inequality setting. We can also compare our bound with the best bounds in the adversarial setting, where prior stochastic information is not available. In this setting, Babaioff et al. (2008) established an optimal competitive ratio of $\\frac{1}{1+2 f+2 \\sqrt{f(1+f)}}$ for deterministic algorithms, and the follow-up work of Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg (2009) showed an optimal competitive ratio of $\\frac{1}{W_{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{e(1+f)}\\right)}$, where $W_{-1}$ is the non-principal branch of the Lambert $W$ function. ${ }^{3}$ We can clearly observe a considerable\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The Lambert $W$ function is the inverse of $y(x)=x e^{x}$. The non-principal branch is the solution $x=W_{-1}(y)$ when $x \\leq-1$.\n\ngap between their competitive ratios versus ours, even as $f \\rightarrow 0,{ }^{4}$ which can be interpreted as the \"value of information\" about the underlying distributions in our setting.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1 Comparison of different competitive ratio bounds. The blue curve is the optimal competitive ratio (this paper), the red curve is the classic 0.5 bound (Samuel-Cahn 1984) and the black curves are the optimal bounds in the adversarial setting for deterministic policies (Babaioff et al. 2008) and for general randomized policies (Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg 2009).\n\nWe also highlight that for the special case when $f \\geq 1$, we derive a closed-form solution for the differential equation, resulting in a competitive ratio of $\\alpha(f)=\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ in this regime. The instance that demonstrates the tightness of this bound for $f \\geq 1$ is quite intuitive and serves as a natural generalization of the classic \"bad example\" in prophet inequalities: consider two random variables $X_{1}=1$ and $X_{2}=(1+f) \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+f}\\right)$. It is straightforward to verify that any online policy achieves a new reward of at most 1 in expectation. In fact, if the policy selects $X_{1}=1$, it is indifferent between ignoring $X_{2}$ or performing a buyback, obtaining 1 in expectation either way. If it ignores $X_{1}$, it still obtains at most 1 , since $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{2}\\right]=1$. Meanwhile, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max \\left\\{X_{1}, X_{2}\\right\\}\\right]=\\frac{1}{f+1}(f+1)+\\frac{f}{f+1}=\\frac{2 f+1}{f+1}$.\n\nInterestingly, this example is not the worst-case instance for $f<1$. For example, when $\\frac{1}{3} \\leq f<1$, one can construct an instance with $n=3$ variables for which no online algorithm can attain a competitive ratio better than $\\frac{(1+f)\\{\\sqrt{f(2-f)+1}\\}}{(1+f) \\sqrt{f(2-f)+3 f+1}}<\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ (see Section 3.1 for the example). This suggests that the problem poses new algebraic challenges for smaller values of $f$, as the worst-case instance appears to require more variables when $f$ decreases. By devising another (more intricate) closed-form solution for our differential equation when $\\frac{1}{3} \\leq f<1$, we prove that this bound is indeed optimal for\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ For $f=+\\infty$, our bound converge to 0.5 while adversarial bounds converge to 0 . It can also be shown that our bound has an asymptotic behavior of $1-\\Theta\\left(f \\log \\frac{1}{f}\\right)$ for small values of $f$ (Section EC.5), while both adversarial bounds are asymptotically $1-\\Theta(\\sqrt{f})$, thus converging to 1 slower than our bound.\n\nthat regime. However, this investigation serves as evidence that it may be infeasible to obtain closedform solutions for the entire interval $0 \\leq f<1$. Although we do not provide an explicit solution to the differential equation (and therefore for $\\alpha(f)$ ) for $0 \\leq f<\\frac{1}{3}$, we do provide the means to construct a proper solution and identify its properties. We then apply this solution not only to analyze the competitive ratio of the optimal online policy (Section 2), but also to construct a tight worst-case instance (Section 3). Our results imply that, indeed, the worst-case instance involves more random variables, and the optimal online policy performs more buyback operations, as $f$ becomes smaller.\n(ii) Order-agnostic \\& simple optimal-competitive policy. To address the second question, we begin by examining the structural properties of the (order-aware) optimal online policy under the worst-case instance identified in our first main result. Building on the insights and technical building blocks that helped us prove our first set main result, we arrive at our second main result.\n[Main Result II] For any buyback parameter $f \\geq 0$, there is a polynomial-time randomized adaptive policy (Algorithm 2) that (i) achieves the optimal competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$, and (ii) is order-agnostic, relying only on the set of distributions $\\left\\{F_{i}\\right\\}$ rather than their arrival order-in contrast to the optimal online policy, requiring the full sequence of distributions.\n\nOur order-agnostic online policy is a simple algorithm with randomized adaptive thresholds. At a high level, the algorithm is greedy in nature, but has a safeguard: it starts with a randomized threshold to make the first acceptance. After each acceptance, it essentially searches for the \"right next quantile\" of the distribution of $\\max _{i} X_{i}$, which if accepted and swapped with the currently accepted random variable, generates a sufficiently large positive marginal gain. This marginal gain would offset the forfeited reward, the current cancellation cost, and any potential future cancellation costs that might arise as a consequence of this decision. Importantly, this decision to identify the next threshold (or quantile) heavily uses the solution $y_{f}$ to the differential equation and the last accepted quantile, and implicitly \"mimics\" the behavior of the optimal online policy in the worst-case instance (using randomization in a certain way). We explain these connections in detail later (Section 4).\n\nFinally, we evaluate the numerical performance of our algorithm on instances beyond the worst-case in Section EC.6, compared to other existing benchmarks for the classic prophet inequality problem, the adversarial version of the problem, and also an alternative threshold-based greedy algorithm that we introduce and analyze in Section EC.5.2. We observe that in almost all of our simulations, our algorithm either outperforms the other benchmarks or is among the best in terms of empirical performance, while it is the only one that enjoys the above theoretical performance guarantee.\n\nOverview of our techniques: To show our main results, we propose a rich technical framework that involves multiple steps. We sketch the key ideas here and defer the full details to later sections.\n\nFlow-based LP formulation. At a high level, our results are derived from a linear programming (LP) approach. Although in principle one could formulate a nonlinear program to characterize the worst-case performance ratio of the optimal online policy against the prophet benchmark, analyzing such a program can be intractable due to being exponential in size. Inspired by LP-based analyses for the classic prophet inequality problem and its extensions (Alaei 2014, Niazadeh et al. 2018, Feng et al. 2022, Jiang et al. 2022), we circumvent this issue by proposing an alternative polynomial size parametric $L P$ (and its dual) that captures the worst-case competitive ratio of the optimal online policy in our generalization of the prophet inequality problem for any given $f>0$.\n\nTo set up this parametric LP, we begin by proving that for every instance of our problem, there exists a harder instance consisting of two-point random variables $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$, where $v_{1} \\leq v_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$ and $q_{i} \\in[0,1]$. This reduction to a discrete, monotonic instance is intuitive because it ensures that information about the maximum value is revealed as slowly as possible, thereby making the problem more challenging for an online decision-maker who observes these variables sequentially. Formally, we establish this reduction by \"splitting\" the original random variables into two-point distributions without altering the prophet benchmark-in the same spirit as similar variable-splitting techniques used in other prophet-inequality-type problems, e.g., Liu et al. (2021)\u2014and then showing that any policy in the split instance can be simulated in the original instance without loss.\n\nOnce we have a monotonic instance, we set up a factor revealing program to analyze the worst-case competitive ratio. However, it turns out that the constraints are nonlinear in the probabilities $q_{i}$ of the two-point variables, so these probabilities must remain external parameters to obtain our (parametric) LP. Applying LP duality yields another LP, which we informally call \"online contention resolution with recourse.\" This is somewhat analogous to vanilla contention resolution LPs (Alaei 2014, Jiang et al. 2022), where each variable represents the probability of allocating in a certain state, and we aim to achieve a certain level of allocation coverage at each time.\n\nHowever, our program includes new features: each state $(i, j)$ with $i<j$ corresponds to a directed edge from node $i$ to $j$, indicating that at time $j$, the last accepted variable was at time $i$. The LP then takes the form of a generalized flow problem on this digraph, with \"leakage\" along each edge governed by the buyback parameter $f$ (see Figure 2). There are also capacities on the edges to ensure that the final policy is implementable online, and certain demands should be maintained at each node $i$ to account for the allocation coverage at each time in the final policy.\n\nContinuous LP, greedy-type flow, \\& differential equation. The remaining task is to find an explicit solution to this generalized flow problem for every choice of the probabilities $q_{i}$. It turns out that in the worst-case, it is safe to assume that all the probabilities $q_{i}$ are small. This allows us to reduce the problem of finding a solution to the LP for potentially many different values of $q_{i}$ to solving a single continuous generalized flow problem. We then aim to exploit the special combinatorial structure of this problem to derive an explicit feasible solution that characterizes our competitive ratio.\n\nInformally speaking, any feasible solution to this continuous LP can be equivalently interpreted as an implementable online algorithm in a surrogate \"quantile acceptance problem,\" where a decision maker sequentially observes a continuum of Bernoulli random variables in the interval $(0,1]$, each active with a probability of $\\frac{d t}{t}$. At each step $t \\in(0,1]$, if the current quantile $t$ is active, the decision maker should decide whether to select $t$ for the first time (if no quantile was selected before), or decide whether to swap a previously accepted quantile $s<t$ with $t$. The goal is to satisfy the coverage condition of the LP for every $t \\in(0,1]$, where coverage is defined as the total probability of selecting $t$ minus the \"leakage\" due to buyback feature of our problem, which is $(1+f)$ times the total probability of swapping $t$ with a future active quantile (see Section 2.3). We may interpret this as requiring each quantile $t$ be accepted with a sufficiently large effective probability.\n\nViewing these quantiles as small random variables in a monotonic instance, intuitively speaking, an effective algorithm should strive to pick the last active quantile (the analog of the prophet benchmark) with as few swaps as possible, or somewhat similarly, maximize the effective probability that each quantile is selected. ${ }^{5}$ Consequently, one can guess that a candidate optimal strategy would follow a greedy-type rule but with some safeguards: the algorithm selects an active quantile as its first choice and then swaps a previously accepted quantile $s$ with the current active quantile $t$ only if $t>\\tau(s)$, for some function $\\tau:[0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ (likely satisfying $\\tau(s)>s$ ).\n\nIt turns out that restricting to this class of solutions for the quantile acceptance problem-or equivalently our continuous LP-is without loss. Formally speaking, we characterize a particular differential equation for the function $\\tau$ (or its inverse function $y \\doteq \\tau^{-1}$ ) in a somewhat unconventional form (Definition 1), so that the solution $y_{f}$ to this differential equation produces a feasible greedy-type solution for our continuous LP with coverage $\\Theta=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$. Our differential equation is obtained by first identifying structural properties of the greedy-type algorithm described above, then encoding those properties into a single differential equation for the $y$-function used by the algorithm.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ Quite surprisingly, under this dual continuous LP perspective, we only need to consider effective probability of selecting each quantile, rather than their values in the monotonic instance-mirroring how online contention resolution schemes remain agnostic to values when employed in designing prophet inequalities.\n\nWe conclude our analysis by showing that a solution to this differential equation (satisfying certain regularity conditions) indeed exists and describing how to build such a solution algorithmically. Our construction is involved and employs various techniques-such as backward-in-time recursion and the identification of \"correct\" recursive invariants-that may be of independent interest (see Section 2.4 and Section EC. 2 for details; see also Figure EC. 1 for a visualization of our solution).\n\nWe note that our algorithm for solving the \"quantile acceptance problem,\" previously described as providing a feasible solution to our continuous LP (see Algorithm 1), is also more directly linked to our buyback problem. Indeed, every time we observe a $X_{i}$ in the buyback problem, we implicitly observe a quantile of $X_{\\max }$, and must decide whether to accept it. In the buyback problem, we may swap $X_{i}$ with $X_{j}$, analogous to how we may swap quantiles in the quantile acceptance problem. Linearity of expectation shows that accepting each quantile of $X_{\\max }$ with a certain effective probability guarantees we obtain the same competitive ratio for the buyback problem.\n\nHowever, there remain two major differences between the quantile acceptance problem and the buyback problem. Firstly, in the quantile acceptance problem, the activation of each quantile of $X_{\\max }$ is observed in increasing order of quantiles; however, our observations of $X_{i}$ do not need to be in increasing order. Secondly, the probability with which a quantile $t$ of $X_{\\max }$ is observed in the sequence $\\left\\{X_{i}\\right\\}$ need not be $\\frac{d t}{t} .{ }^{6}$ How can we overcome these differences and use our solution to the quantile acceptance problem to design a simple and order-agnostic algorithm for a general instance of the prophet inequality with buyback problem?\n\nSimple and order-agnostic optimal-competitive algorithm. To answer the above question, we formalize a continuum of Bernoulli random variables on $(0,1]$ in which each $t$ is active with a probability of $\\frac{d t}{t}$ as a Poisson point process (PPP) with rate function $\\frac{1}{t}$. Our goal is to embed each observed $X_{i}$ (implicitly a quantile of $X_{\\max }$ ) into this PPP via a simple coupling, and then apply the quantile acceptance algorithm on the resulting coupled process to obtain an algorithm for the original problem.\n\nOur algorithm generates this PPP in an online fashion. As it observes $X_{i}$, it tracks the current maximum observed value in the sequence so far, denoted by $\\hat{x}$. Whenever a new $X_{i}$ exceeds $\\hat{x}$, to couple $X_{i}$ with the PPP, the algorithm simply inserts the quantile of $X_{\\max }$ corresponding to $X_{i}$ into the PPP. It then \"fills the gap\" between $\\hat{x}$ and $X_{i}$ by artificially inserting extra points between these two quantities drawn from a PPP with the rate of exactly $\\frac{1}{t}$. Notice that the algorithm ignores observations that are not peaks, thereby solving the issue that the observed quantiles may not arrive in increasing\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Note that if we have a monotonic instance where each random variable has a sufficiently small chance of being active, then these differences do not exist, and therefore the solution to the quantile acceptance problem can be used directly to have an algorithm for the original problem in such an instance.\n\norder. After generating the PPP, our algorithm flags the same quantiles that are accepted in the quantile acceptance problem. At this point, if we could treat the flagged values as if they were the values the algorithm accepted, we would be done.\n\nHowever, our algorithm can only accept the values $X_{i}$, not all the values in the PPP (since the rest are artificially generated). Fortunately, by linearity of expectation, accepting $X_{i}$ with a carefully chosen probability $p$ can simulate accepting a (flagged) value $z<X_{i}$. This allows us to bound the competitive ratio of the algorithm with the performance of our quantile acceptance algorithm, thereby establishing that it is optimal-competitive. Ultimately, the resulting algorithm is simple: observe the sequence of peaks in the realizations of $X_{i}$ and only accept each peak with carefully chosen probability. These probabilities, defined using the PPP and our solution to the quantile acceptance problem, are easy to calculate and do not depend on the order of future arrivals. See Algorithm 2.\n\nIndifference condition \\& bad examples. Somewhat surprisingly, the same solution to the differential equation that was foundational in our algorithm design also allows us to construct a lower bound instance with two-point distributions for our original problem, which exactly matches our upper bound of $\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$. The key idea is to identify and formalize a property that we observe in the bad examples for $n=2$ and $n=3$ : for these worst-case instances, the optimal competitive online algorithm, when holding a random variable, is indifferent between accepting or rejecting the next one. Restricting ourselves to classes of two-point \"instances with indifference\" (see Section 3.2 for a formal definition), we use our differential equation solution $y_{f}$ in a novel way to construct activation probabilities in our instance. In particular, defining the sequence $\\left\\{k_{i}\\right\\}$, the \"orbits of 0 under $y_{f}$,\" that is, $k_{0}=0$ and $y_{f}\\left(k_{i+1}\\right)=k_{i}$, we let the $i^{\\text {th }}$ random variable be the maximum with probability $k_{i}-k_{i-1}$.

{"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Characterizing the Optimal Competitive Ratio \n\nIn general, one could formulate a nonlinear, exponential-size mathematical program to characterize the worst-case performance of the optimal online policy against the prophet benchmark\u2014mirroring the approach of finding the worst-case competitive ratio through the equilibrium of a zero-sum game between an algorithm (choosing an online policy) and an adversary (choosing the sequence of distributions). In this section, rather than pursuing this na\u00efve approach, we develop a parametric\n\nlinear program whose parameters encode a lower-dimensional \"sufficient statistic\" of the worst-case instance. We then show how this LP characterizes the worst-case ratio between the optimal online policy and the offline optimum, under the adversary's worst-case choices of these parameters.\n\nTo build this parametric factor-revealing LP, we begin in Section 2.1 by introducing a series of reductions that convert any instance to a restricted form, without changing the worst-case competitive ratio. Next, in Section 2.2, we present a discrete version of our LP and its dual, along with a continuous variant of the dual (which corresponds to taking a particular limit of the discrete dual). Finally, inspired by treating our continuous LP as a generalized flow problem (Pulat 1989), we show how to effectively solve the continuous LP (or identify a \"good\" feasible solution) via a specific differential equation in Section 2.3. We briefly sketch how to construct a solution for the differential equation in Section 2.4 and defer the full details to Section EC.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.1. Reduction to a monotonic sequence of two-point distributions \n\nWe claim that, without loss of generality, we can restrict our attention to problem instances comprising a sequence of random variables $X_{i}$ such that (i) they have scaled Bernoulli distributions, that is, $X_{i} \\in\\left\\{0, v_{i}\\right\\}$, and (ii) they are monotonic, that is, $v_{1} \\leq v_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. More precisely, we show the following result, which paves the way for the rest of our analysis.\n\nProposition 1. If a competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with random variables $X_{i}=v_{i} \\cdot \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$, where $\\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$ is a $0 / 1$-Bernoulli random variable with expectation $q_{i}$ and $0<v_{1} \\leq$ $v_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$, then the same competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with nonnegative random variables with finite expectation.\n\nTo prove Proposition 1, we proceed in a sequence of simple reductions. The first step is to discretize the random variables. See Section EC.3.1 for the proof of the following lemma.\n\nLemma 1. If a competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with discrete nonnegative random variables (with finitely many points in the support), then the same competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with nonnegative random variables with finite expectations.\n\nThe second step is to reduce the random variables by \"splitting\" into scaled Bernoulli distributions.\nLemma 2. If a competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with scaled Bernoulli random variables (with values in $\\left\\{0, v_{i}\\right\\}$ for some $v_{i}>0$ ), then the same competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with discrete nonnegative random variables.\n\nProof. Assume that $\\mathcal{D}_{i}$ is supported on a finite set of values $\\mathcal{V}_{i}=\\left\\{0, v_{i}^{1}, \\ldots, v_{i}^{k}\\right\\}$ with $0<v_{i}^{1}<$ $\\cdots<v_{i}^{k}$. We define $k$ new random variables $X_{i}^{1}, \\ldots, X_{i}^{k}$, where $X_{i}^{j}$ has support $\\left\\{0, v_{i}^{j}\\right\\}$ and the probabilities are chosen so that $\\max _{1 \\leq j \\leq k} X_{i}^{j}$ has the same distribution as $X_{i}$ (in particular, we set $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{i}^{j}=v_{i}^{j}\\right]=\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{i}=v_{i}^{j}\\right]}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{i} \\leq v_{i}^{j}\\right]}$ ). We denote the distribution of $X_{i}^{j}$ by $\\mathcal{D}_{i}^{j}$.\n\nGiven the original instance $I_{1}=\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{n}\\right)$ with $n$ random variables, consider a new instance $I_{2}$ with $n+k-1$ random variables, formed by \"splitting\" $X_{i}$ into $k$ scaled Bernoulli random variables $\\left\\{X_{i}^{j}\\right\\}$ as described above. Specifically, let $I_{2}=\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{1}, \\mathcal{D}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{i-1}, \\mathcal{D}_{i}^{1}, \\mathcal{D}_{i}^{2}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{i}^{k}, \\mathcal{D}_{i+1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{n}\\right)$. We couple the two instances so the instantiations of all the random variables are the same, except for $X_{i}$ in $I_{1}$ which equals $\\max _{1 \\leq j \\leq k} X_{i}^{j}$ in $I_{2}$ (and the instantiations of $X_{i}^{j}$ are otherwise independent).\n\nLet us define a policy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ for the instance $I_{1}$ based on a policy $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ for the instance $I_{2}$. First, $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ mimics $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ up to the arrival of $X_{i}$. Suppose both policies hold value $x$ after processing $X_{i-1}$. Upon observing $X_{i}=v_{i}^{r}, \\mathcal{P}_{1}$ simulates $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ via the above coupling. Specifically, $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ generates samples $X_{i}^{j}$ from $\\mathcal{D}_{i}^{j}$ for $j<r$, and observes the last acceptance of $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ on $X_{i}^{1}, X_{i}^{2}, \\ldots, X_{i}^{r-1}, X_{i}=v_{i}^{r}, X_{i}^{r+1}=0, \\ldots, X_{i}^{k}=0$. If this last accepted value is $v$ (one of the $v_{i}^{j}$ with $j \\leq r$, or $x$ if $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ does not accept any $v_{i}^{j}$ ), then $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ accepts $X_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{v-x}{v_{i}^{r-x}}$. Afterward, $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ continues to follow $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$, pretending to hold $v$.\n\nWe claim that $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ performs at least as well as $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$. To see why, recall we couple the instantiation of random variables in $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ as described earlier. Then, upon observing $\\left\\{X_{i}^{j}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{k}$ and $X_{i}$ respectively, $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ hold the same value in expectation after processing these random variables, because:\n\n$$\nx\\left(1-\\frac{v-x}{v_{i}^{r}-x}\\right)+v_{i}^{r}\\left(\\frac{v-x}{v_{i}^{r}-x}\\right)=\\frac{x\\left(v_{i}^{r}-v\\right)+v_{i}^{r}(v-x)}{v_{i}^{r}-x}=v\n$$\n\nSince the expected net reward (including the buyback cost) is linear in the accepted values, by linearity of expectation, the future expected net reward of $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ after observing $X_{i}$ equals that of $\\mathcal{P}_{2} . \\mathcal{P}_{1}$ only surpasses $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ because $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ might accept multiple $X_{i}^{j}$ and therefore pays extra buyback costs.\n\nThe final step of our reduction is to reorder the scaled Bernoulli distributions so that the values $v_{i}$ appear in increasing order. We show that this reordering can only make the instance more difficult.\n\nLemma 3. If a competitive factor $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with monotonic scaled Bernoulli random variables, with values in $\\left\\{0, v_{i}\\right\\}$ for some $v_{i}>0$ and $v_{1} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$, then the same competitive factor $\\alpha(f)$ can be achieved for any instance with scaled Bernoulli random variables.\n\nProof sketch. Consider an instance $I_{2}$ with variables $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$ and $X_{i+1}=v_{i+1} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i+1}\\right)$, where $v_{i}<v_{i+1}$. Let $I_{1}$ be the same instance, except that $X_{i}$ and $X_{i+1}$ are swapped in order. In $I_{1}$, we might as well assume that at time $i$ we observe only $\\max \\left(X_{i+1}, X_{i}\\right)$ (and nothing else), which gives us\n\nstrictly less information than observing $X_{i+1}$ followed by $X_{i}$. Yet, as shown in the proof of Lemma 2, there exists a policy for $I_{1}$ (observing $\\max \\left(X_{i+1}, X_{i}\\right)$ at time $i$ ) that outperforms a given policy on $I_{2}$ (observing $X_{i}$ and then $X_{i+1}$, where $v_{i}<v_{i+1}$ ). Since any permutation can be written as a composition of repeated swaps, this completes the proof. We also include a complete \"from scratch\" proof of Lemma 3, not dependent on Lemma 2 in Section EC.3.2.\n\nCombining Lemmas 1, 2, and 3 implies Theorem 1. By virtue of this result, in the remainder of this section, we focus only on instances with a sequence of monotonic scaled Bernoulli distributions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 2.2. Factor-revealing LPs: finite and infinite-dimensional formulations \n\nLet us now formulate a parametric LP that captures the worst-case ratio of the optimal online policy to the prophet benchmark. To this end, first observe that the optimal online policy can be expressed as a simple dynamic program (DP) given the knowledge of the sequence of distributions. We use the DP formulation to set up our \"factor revealing\" linear program.\n\nDP formulation: To derive this DP, we identify a simple recurrence, also known as the Bellman optimality equation (Bellman 1954), which characterizes the optimal expected reward-to-go at each stage of the process. Suppose that the instance consists of the sequence of random variables $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ with known distributions. For $t=0, \\ldots, n-1$, define\n$\\Phi_{t}(x) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}$ [reward of an optimal online algorithm holding $x$ and observing $\\left.\\left(X_{t+1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\right)\\right]$.\n\nHere, any buyback cost the algorithm might have paid before observing $X_{t+1}$ is ignored. For consistency with the above, $\\Phi_{n}(x) \\triangleq x$, since there is no subsequent variable $X_{n+1}$ to observe and the algorithm simply keeps the value $x$. Given the above definition, $\\Phi_{t}(x)$ satisfies the following recurrence equation:\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{t-1}(x)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max \\left\\{\\Phi_{t}(x), \\Phi_{t}\\left(X_{t}\\right)-f x\\right\\}\\right], \\quad \\forall t \\in[1: n], \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nThe above recurrence holds, simply because upon observing $X_{t}$, any online algorithm has two options: either keeping the value $x$ and skipping $X_{t}$ (in which case it obtains an expected reward of $\\Phi_{t}(x)$ ), or paying the buyback cost of $f \\cdot x$ and accepting the value $X_{t}$ (in which case it obtains an expected reward of $\\Phi_{t}\\left(X_{t}\\right)-f x$ ). Given the value of $X_{t}$, the optimal online algorithm chooses the better of the two options, and in expectation obtains $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max \\left\\{\\Phi_{t}(x), \\Phi_{t}\\left(X_{t}\\right)-f x\\right\\}\\right]$.\n\nNow we focus on instances in the form provided by Theorem 1: monotonic sequences of scaled Bernoulli distributions, with $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$, where $0 \\doteq v_{0}<v_{1} \\leq v_{2} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$. With a slight abuse of notation, let us define $\\Phi_{i, t} \\doteq \\Phi_{t}\\left(v_{i}\\right)$. Then the recurrence in (1) takes the following form:\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{i, t-1}=\\max \\left\\{\\Phi_{i, t},\\left(1-q_{i}\\right) \\Phi_{i, t}+q_{i}\\left(\\Phi_{t, t}-f v_{i}\\right)\\right\\}, \\quad \\forall 0 \\leq i<t \\leq n\n$$\n\nand we define $\\Phi_{i, n}=v_{i}$ for all $i \\in[0: n]$. Here, we use the fact that $\\Phi_{t}(x) \\geq \\Phi_{t}(0)-f x$ (or, in other words, it never makes sense to accept a random variable that is equal to 0 ), which can be proved for the optimal online policy using an easy induction.\n\nDiscrete LP formulation: Fixing $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and the probabilities $\\left\\{q_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in[n]}$ as parameters, where $q_{j} \\in$ $[0,1]$, we formulate a minimization LP with variables $\\left\\{\\Phi_{i, t}\\right\\}_{i, t \\in[n] \\cup\\{0\\}}$ and $\\left\\{v_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in[n]}$. The LP's objective is $\\Phi_{0,0}$, representing the expected reward of an optimal online policy from the beginning (holding nothing). The LP constraints capture the optimality equation in (2) and are valid for the optimal online policy. We also add a constraint that normalizes the optimal offline (the expected maximum value) in the monotonic sequence of scaled Bernoulli random variables $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$, namely, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right)=1$. Note the non-linearity in the parameters $q_{j}$ : this is why we cannot include them as variables in the LP, but leave them as external parameters. For any fixed choice of these parameters $\\left\\{q_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in[n]}$, this LP precisely captures the worst-case ratio between the optimal online policy and the optimal offline. ${ }^{7}$ Formally, we have the following lemma, introducing our first LP.\n\nLemma 4. Given $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{n} \\in[0,1]$, the following LP characterizes the (worst-case) competitive ratio of an optimal online policy for any instance in the form $\\forall i \\in[n]: X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min _{\\Phi_{i, t} \\geq 0, v_{i} \\geq 0} & \\Phi_{0,0} & \\text { s.t } \\\\\n& \\Phi_{i, t-1} \\geq \\Phi_{i, t} & \\forall 0 \\leq i<t \\leq n \\\\\n& \\Phi_{i, t-1} \\geq\\left(1-q_{i}\\right) \\Phi_{i, t}+q_{i}\\left(\\Phi_{i, t}-f v_{i}\\right) & \\forall 0 \\leq i<t \\leq n \\\\\n& \\Phi_{0, n}=0, \\Phi_{i, n}=v_{i} & \\forall 1 \\leq i \\leq n \\\\\n& \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right) \\geq 1 & \\text { (Lemma 3), we first normalize } \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right] \\text { to } 1 \\text { by uniformly scaling all } v_{i} \\text { so that } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right)=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Note that the worst-case instance for the competitive ratio of the optimal online policy is an instance of the form $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$, $0 \\leq v_{1} \\leq \\ldots \\leq v_{n}$ due to Lemma 3. Therefore, intuitively speaking, this LP characterizes the best-response of an adversary who picks the problem instance to minimize the competitive ratio, when we tie the hands of the adversary by fixing $n$ and $\\left\\{q_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in[n]}$.\n\nFor an optimal online policy in this normalized instance, $\\Phi_{i, t}=\\Phi_{t}\\left(v_{i}\\right)$ is feasible in our LP by the optimality equation in (2). Thus, the LP's optimal objective value is at most the expected reward of this online policy in the normalized instance, which in turn equals its competitive ratio in the unnormalized instance.\n\nConversely, let $\\left\\{\\Phi_{i, t}^{*}, v_{i}^{*}\\right\\}$ be an optimal solution to the LP, and consider the instance $X_{i}=v_{i}^{*} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$. By (2) and backward induction-and using that our LP is a minimization program-the optimal expected reward of holding $v_{i}^{*}$ at time $t$ is $\\Phi_{i, t}^{*}$. Moreover, we claim we can add the constraint $v_{i+1}^{*} \\geq v_{i}^{*}$ without changing the optimal objective value. Hence we may assume $v_{1}^{*} \\leq v_{2}^{*} \\leq \\cdots \\leq$ $v_{n}^{*}$. To see this claim, note that Lemma 3 proves that the worst-case performance of the optimal online policy is attained when the values $v_{i}$ are ordered in ascending order, and, the expression $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right)$ (which is equal the expected last nonzero $X_{i}$ in the given order) can only increase when the values are re-arranged in an ascending order.\n\nPutting these observations together, the optimal online policy has an overall expected reward $\\Phi_{0,0}$, and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i}^{*} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right) \\geq 1$ when $v_{1}^{*} \\leq v_{2}^{*} \\leq \\cdots \\leq v_{n}^{*}$. Thus, the worst-case competitive ratio of the optimal online policy is at most the LP's optimal objective value.\n\nWe now slightly reformulate the LP to obtain a simpler equivalent form by a change of variables $\\Delta_{i, t} \\doteq \\Phi_{i, t-1}-\\Phi_{i, t}$ for $0 \\leq i<t \\leq n$, and applying the constraints $\\Phi_{i, n}=v_{i}, \\Phi_{0, n}=0$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\min _{\\Delta_{i, t} \\geq 0, v_{i} \\geq 0} & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\Delta_{0, t} \\\\\n& \\Delta_{i, t} \\geq q_{i}\\left(\\sum_{j=t+1}^{n}\\left(\\Delta_{t, j}-\\Delta_{i, j}\\right)+v_{t}-(1+f) v_{i}\\right) \\quad \\forall 0 \\leq i<t \\leq n \\\\\n& \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_{i} q_{i} \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right) \\geq 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we appeal to LP duality to derive another LP that will be much more useful for our purposes. We postpone the proof of the following lemma, primarily based on strong duality, to Section EC.3.3.\n\nLemma 5. Given $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{n} \\in[0,1]$, the following (dual) LP gives the (worst-case) competitive ratio of an optimal online policy for any instance in the form $\\forall i \\in[n]: X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\max _{x_{s, t} \\geq 0, \\Theta \\geq 0} & \\Theta \\\\\n& x_{0, t} \\leq q_{t}\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} x_{0, t}\\right)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nS.t\n(DUAL-DISC-LP)\n$\\forall 1 \\leq t \\leq n$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nx_{s, t} \\leq q_{t}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{s-1} x_{i, s}-\\sum_{j=s+1}^{t-1} x_{s, j}\\right) & \\forall 1 \\leq s<t \\leq n \\\\\n\\Theta \\hat{q}_{t} \\leq \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} x_{i, t}-(1+f) \\sum_{j=t+1}^{n} x_{t, j} & \\forall 1<t \\leq n\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we define $\\hat{q}_{t} \\triangleq q_{t} \\prod_{j=t+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right)$. (Equivalently, $\\hat{q}_{t} \\in[0,1]$ is the probability that $X_{t}=X_{\\max }$ in an instance with monotonic scaled Bernoulli distributions).\n\nThe LP in Dual-Disc-LP has a natural interpretation. Specifically, $x_{0, t}$ represents the probability that $X_{t}$ is the first variable we accept, and for $1 \\leq s<t, x_{s, t}$ represents the probability that we swap $X_{s}$ for $X_{t}$ at some point. The first constraint encodes that by the time we reach $X_{t}$, there is probability $1-\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} x_{0, i}$ of not having accepted any variable yet. Since $X_{t}$ appears with probability $q_{t}$, we get $q_{t}\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} x_{0, i}\\right)$ as an upper bound on the probability of accepting $X_{t}$. Similarly, $\\sum_{i=0}^{s-1} x_{i, s}-$ $\\sum_{j=s+1}^{t-1} x_{s, j}$ is the probability we have accepted $X_{s}$ and not yet replaced it by $X_{j}$ for some $j<t$. Thus, $q_{t}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{s-1} x_{i, s}-\\sum_{j=s+1}^{t-1} x_{s, j}\\right)$ upper-bounds the probability of swapping $X_{s}$ for $X_{t}$. We refer to these constraints as the online implementability constraints.\n\nThe third constraint, which we refer to as the coverage constraint, enforces that the probability of accepting $X_{t}$ minus $(1+f)$ times the probability that we discard it later (that is, the effective probability of accepting $X_{t}$ given the buyback cost), should be at least $\\Theta$ times the probability $X_{t}$ is the maximum. Satisfying this constraint ensures that we recover at least a $\\Theta$-fraction of $X_{t}$ 's contribution to the optimal offline. Although it is not immediately obvious that this condition is also necessary, Lemma 5 shows that it must hold if a competitive ratio of $\\Theta$ is achievable.\n\nFinally, from a combinatorial perspective, we can view this LP as a generalized flow problem, that is, a network flow with a linear leakage across edges (Pulat 1989). In this combinatorial interpretation, we have nodes $\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and directed edges $\\{(s, t): 0 \\leq s<t \\leq n\\}$. Moreover, $(1+f) x_{s, t}$ represents the flow going out from node $s$ to node $t$, each node extracts a demand proportional to $\\Theta$, and a fraction $f x_{s, t}$ of the flow $x_{s, t}$ along each edge $(s, t)$ is \"lost\" due to the buyback cost (hence, the residual flow $x_{s, t}$ is going into $t$ from $s$ ) (see Figure 2 for more details). Inspired by this interpretation, we plan to demonstrate how to solve the LP in the following sections.\n\nContinuous LP formulation: Recall that the number of random variables $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ served as a parameter in our discrete LP formulations. However, there is a worst-case instance for the competitive ratio involving infinitely many \"vanishing\" scaled Bernoulli random variables, each active with only a tiny probability. Intuitively, by splitting a variable $X_{i}=v_{i} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(q_{i}\\right)$ into smaller pieces (for example\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2 Interpreting Dual-Disc-LP as a generalized flow; the red arrow indicates \"lost\" flow or the leakage (due to the buyback). $X_{t_{1}}, X_{t_{2}}=v_{t} \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-q_{t}}\\right)$ ) one can move towards a problem with vanishing probabilities without actually changing the problem. This observation suggests that the problem can be reformulated in terms of a continuum of (scaled) Bernoulli random variables with infinitesimal probabilities of being non-zero. The first step in solving our discrete LP is to rigorously develop this idea by reformulating the problem in a continuous framework, as formally established in the next proposition. We refer to the parameter $\\Theta$ in this proposition as the coverage parameter in the remainder of the paper.\n\nProposition 2. For a given $f>0$, if there exist non-negative, integrable functions $h$ and $g$ with domains $(0,1]$ and $(0,1] \\times(0,1]$, and parameter $\\Theta>0$, such that\n(DUAL-CONT-LP)\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nt h(t) \\leq 1-\\int_{0}^{t} h(r) d r & \\forall 0<t \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\operatorname{tg}(s, t) \\leq h(s)+\\int_{0}^{s} g(r, s) d r-\\int_{s}^{t} g(s, r) d r & \\forall 0<s \\leq t \\leq 1 \\\\\n\\Theta \\leq h(s)+\\int_{0}^{s} g(r, s) d r-(1+f) \\int_{s}^{1} g(s, r) d r & \\forall 0<s \\leq 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nthen $\\alpha(f) \\geq \\Theta$.\nProof. We construct a solution for Dual-Disc-LP using a pair of functions $h($.$) and g($.$) that satisfy$ the above inequalities. To this end, without loss of generality, we first add a dummy variable 0 at the beginning of our instance, distributed as $0 \\cdot \\operatorname{Ber}(1)$ (hence, we set $v_{0}=0$, and $q_{0}=1$ ), to ensure that the first random variable is deterministic. Since $q_{0}=1$ and we have defined $\\hat{q}_{t}=q_{t} \\prod_{j=t+1}^{n}\\left(1-q_{j}\\right)$, it follows that $\\sum \\hat{q}_{i}=1$. Let us introduce the notation $r_{j}=\\frac{q_{j}}{q_{j}}=\\sum_{i=0}^{j} \\hat{q}_{i}$. The $r_{j}$ 's vary from 0 to 1 , and represent the probability that the last non-zero random variable occurs before or at $X_{j}$. Note that $\\hat{q}_{j}=r_{j}-r_{j-1}$, and thus $q_{j}=\\frac{q_{j}}{r_{j}}=\\frac{r_{j}-r_{j-1}}{r_{j}}$. To obtain a feasible solution for Dual-Disc-LP, we just need to set the decision variables as follows:\n\n$$\nx_{0, t}=\\int_{r_{t-1}}^{r_{t}} h(r) d r \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x_{s, t}=\\int_{r_{s-1}}^{r_{s}} \\int_{r_{t-1}}^{r_{t}} g(r, u) d u d r\n$$\n\nFeasibility of the above solution in Dual-Disc-LP can be shown immediately by integrating the inequalities in Dual-Cont-LP from $r_{t-1}$ to $r_{t}$ and from $r_{s-1}$ to $r_{s}$ as appropriate.

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 2.3. Reduction to the differential equation \n\nOur next goal is to construct a particular feasible solution to the continuous LP feasibility problem Dual-Cont-LP for any given buyback factor $f>0$. This solution is a candidate for being optimal, that is, the feasible solution to Dual-Cont-LP with the maximum possible $\\Theta$. The existence of such a feasible solution with $\\Theta=\\theta_{f}$ (defined later) certifies that $\\alpha(f) \\geq \\theta_{f}$. Later, in Section 3, we will establish that $\\alpha(f) \\leq \\theta_{f}$, confirming that our candidate solution is indeed optimal.\n\nA differential equation: To explain our construction and the main result, we first define the following differential equation (in an unconventional form), which plays a key role in our construction.\n\nDefinition 1 (Y-Function Differential Equation). For any $f \\geq 0$, let $c_{f} \\triangleq \\frac{f}{1+f}, k_{1} \\geq c_{f}$, and consider this differential equation in $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$ for the function $y:\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ with $y\\left(k_{1}\\right)=0$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\ny^{\\prime}(y(t))=\\frac{y(t)-c_{f}}{t-c_{f}}\\left(2-\\frac{y(t)}{y^{\\prime}(t)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)}\\right), & \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]: y(t) \\geq k_{1} \\\\\ny(t)=\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}-1+c_{f}+y(1), & \\forall t \\geq y(1)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIf we conjecture that a solution to this differential equation satisfies $y(t)<t$, we could then solve the equation running \"backward in time,\" since the equation relates the derivative of $y$ at an earlier point $y(t)$ to the value (and derivative) of $y$ at a later point $t$. Building on this observation, in the following theorem, we show that Diff-EQ admits such a \"proper\" solution.\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence of Proper Y-Function). For all $f>0$, there exists a solution $y_{f}$ to the differential equation when $k_{1}=c_{f}$. Moreover, this solution satisfies the following properties:\n(i) $y_{f}(t)$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and $y_{f}(t)<t$ for all $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$.\n(ii) $\\frac{y_{f}(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ is increasing for all $t \\in\\left(k_{1}, 1\\right]$ (or equivalently $\\frac{t}{y_{f}^{(1)}(t)-c_{f}}$ is increasing for all $\\left.t \\in(0, y(1))\\right]$ )\n(iii) There exists a finite integer $n \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{f}$ such that $y_{f}^{(n)}(1) \\leq k_{1}$, where $y_{f}^{(n)} \\triangleq \\underbrace{y_{f} \\circ y_{f} \\circ \\cdots \\circ y_{f}}_{n \\text { times }}$.\n\nWe sketch the proof of the existence of the solution $y_{f}$ to Diff-EQ in Section 2.4, and defer the formal proof to Section EC.2. We are now ready to state the main result of this section.\n\nTheorem 2 (Optimal Competitive Ratio - Lower bound). The optimal online algorithm obtains a competitive ratio of at least $\\theta_{f} \\triangleq \\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$ (see Figure 1).\n\nOverview of the construction: In the rest of this section, we sketch how to construct a feasible solution to Dual-Cont-LP using the solution of the differential equation Diff-EQ, to prove Theorem 2 (formal proofs are postponed to the appendix). This construction will proceed in multiple steps:\n\n- Section 2.3.1: We start by providing an interpretation of Dual-Cont-LP . Then, we argue informally that constructing a feasible solution of Dual-Cont-LP is equivalent to finding an algorithm that acts in an online fashion on a continuum of Bernoulli random variables, accepting each one with an effective probability $\\Theta$. Such an algorithm is in some sense an analog to the online contention resolution schemes (Feldman et al. 2016) adapted to the buyback model.\n- Section 2.3.2: Next, we identify a natural class of algorithms that are likely to accept each variable with a large effective probability. We parameterize this class of algorithms by a number $k_{1} \\in(0,1]$, and a pair of functions, $\\varphi:(0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ and $y:\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$.\n- Section 2.3.3: Then, we identify the properties that $\\varphi$ and $y$ should satisfy to obtain an online algorithm with an effective probability $\\Theta$ of accepting each random variable.\n- Section 2.3.4: Finally, we show how these properties for $\\varphi$ and $y$ can be expressed in terms of just the function $y$. This immediately leads to the differential equation Diff-EQ for $y$.\nIn summary, for a given $f>0$, the (proper) solution $y_{f}$ of Diff-EQ allows us to construct $\\varphi$ and $y$ with desirable properties, leading to an algorithm for the problem of accepting Bernoulli random variables on a continuum that obtains the maximum effective probability $\\Theta=\\theta_{f}$. This algorithm can be interpreted as a solution to Dual-Cont-LP with the maximum possible coverage $\\Theta=\\theta_{f}$.\n2.3.1. Interpretation of Dual-Cont-LP Recall the natural interpretation of Dual-Disc-LP; we provide a similar (informal) interpretation for Dual-Cont-LP by considering an instance with a continuum of (monotone) scaled Bernoulli random variables, each having infinitesimal non-zero probability, arriving over the time interval $[0,1]$. Inspired by the proof of Proposition 2, we interpret the infinitesimal $d s$ as the probability that the random variable arriving at time $s$ is the \"maximum\" or the last non-zero random variable (i.e., $\\hat{q}_{s} \\approx d s$ ), so the location of the maximum is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$. Furthermore, we interpret $q_{s} \\approx \\frac{d s}{s}$ as the probability that the random variable arriving at time $s$ is non-zero (since $\\hat{q}_{s}=\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\right.$ location of maximum is in $\\left.[0, s] \\mid \\cdot q_{s}=s q_{s}\\right) .{ }^{8}$\n\nWe now consider running an online algorithm on this continuum. The algorithm starts at $0,{ }^{\\circ}$ makes a first pick, performs swaps when necessary, and attempts to ensure that the random variable arriving\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ Alternatively, the interval $[0,1]$ can be interpreted as all quantiles of the random variable $X_{\\max }$, arriving sequentially. Once a quantile $s$ arrives, it will be active with probability $\\frac{d s}{s}$. The last active quantile corresponds to the realized quantile of $X_{\\max }$, which is uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$.\n    ${ }^{9}$ In fact, to be more mathematically precise, the algorithm starts at $0^{*}$ by skipping the 0 itself.\n\nat time $t$ is picked with an effective probability of $\\Theta d t$. That is, the probability of picking $t$ minus $(1+f)$ times the probability of swapping away from $t$ is at least $\\Theta d t$. We interpret $h(s) d s$ as the probability that the random variable arriving at $s$ is our algorithm's first pick, and $g(s, t) d s d t$ as the probability that the algorithm will swap the random variable arriving at $s$ with the one arriving at $t>s$. Similar to our discussion of Dual-Disc-LP, the existence of such an algorithm is equivalent to the existence of a feasible solution to Dual-Cont-LP.\n2.3.2. Greedy-type algorithms with a monotonicity property To search for an online algorithm on the continuum with the largest possible $\\Theta$, we posit a particular monotonicity property: if the algorithm decides to swap from $s$ to $t$ for $s<t$, then for any $s^{\\prime}<s$, it would also swap from $s^{\\prime}$ to $t$. Define $y(t)$ as the largest $s$ for which the algorithm is willing to swap to $t$. We further assume that the function $y(\\cdot)$ satisfies the following properties:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y(t) \\text { is strictly increasing in } t \\text {, continuous, and } y(t)<t \\\\\n& y\\left(k_{1}\\right)=0 \\text { for a parameter } k_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Property I)\n\nNote that $y(t)$ is only well defined for $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$. We also define the inverse function $\\tau(\\cdot) \\doteq y^{-1}(\\cdot)$ with support $[0, y(1)]$. By convention, we extend the support by setting $\\tau(s)=1$ for $s \\in[y(1), 1]$.\n\nTo fully specify the algorithm, we must also define the probability with which it selects each $s \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$ as its first pick. We denote this probability by $\\varphi(s) d s$, for a function $\\varphi:\\left(0, k_{1}\\right] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. With these ingredients in place, we now informally describe the execution of the resulting simple candidate algorithm on the continuum $[0,1]$. See Algorithm 1.\n\nWhile we only defined $\\varphi(t) d t$ for $t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$, we can naturally define the extension of $\\varphi(t)$ to $(0,1]$ by letting it be the probability with which $t$ is ever picked by our algorithm (this includes both the probability that it is the algorithm's final pick, and the probability that the algorithm switches away from $t$ ). We now ask the following natural question regarding $\\{y(\\cdot), \\varphi(\\cdot)\\}$ :\n\nWhat conditions must $\\varphi$ and $y$ satisfy so that (i) Algorithm 1 is an implementable online algorithm, and (ii) it achieves an effective selection probability of $\\Theta d t$ for every $t \\in(0,1]$ ?\n2.3.3. Properties of the functions $\\varphi$ and $y$ We now present the following simple and natural observations, which help pinpoint all the properties of $\\varphi$ and $y$ needed to satisfy (i) and (ii).\n\n- For Algorithm 1 to be well-defined, the probability of accepting $t<k_{1}$ must not exceed 1, therefore:\n\n$$\nt \\varphi(t) \\leq 1-\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]\n$$\n\nAlgorithm 1 (informal) candidate algorithm for the continuum $[0,1]$\nInitialize $s \\leftarrow 0 /{ }^{*} s \\in[0,1]$ tracks what the algorithm holds at any time */\nfor active $t \\in(0,1]$ do\nif $t<k_{1}$ and $s=0$ then\nPick $t$ with probability $\\frac{t \\varphi(t)}{1-\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s} . / * t$ is active w.p. $\\frac{d t}{t}$, and nothing was accepted before $t$ w.p. $1-\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s$, so the algorithm ends up selecting $t$ w.p. $\\varphi(t) d t . \\quad * /$\nIf $t$ is picked, update $s \\leftarrow t$.\nelse\nif $t>\\tau(s)(\\equiv s<y(t))$ then\nSwap from $s$ to $t . / * t$ is active w.p. $\\frac{d t}{t}$, so the algorithm ends up selecting $t$ w.p. $\\frac{d t}{t}$ conditional on holding $s . * /$\nUpdate $s \\leftarrow t$.\n\n- Similarly, for any $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$, the probability that Algorithm 1 does not pick anything between $y(t)$ and $t$ is exactly $1-\\int_{y(t)}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s$. At the same time, the algorithm should pick the random variable arriving at time $t$ as long as it is non-zero (i.e., is active) if and only if it has not picked anything between $y(t)$ and $t$. Since $\\varphi(t) d t$ is the probability of ever picking $t$, the quantity $t \\varphi(t)=\\frac{\\varphi(t) d t}{\\frac{d t}{t}}$ is the probability of picking $t$ conditioned on $t$ being non-zero. Therefore, we get:\n\n$$\nt \\varphi(t)=1-\\int_{y(t)}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s, \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]\n$$\n\n(Property IV)\n\n- We further posit that Algorithm 1 always attempts to select the random variable arriving at time $t$ with the lowest possible effective probability, while still maintaining an effective selection probability of $\\Theta d t$ for all $t$. That is, for all $t \\in(0,1)$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\Theta d t=\\varphi(t) d t-(1+f) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\text { Algorithm } 1 \\text { swaps from } t\\right]\n$$\n\nAssuming this, we make the following observations:\n\n1. For $t \\in(0, y(1)]$, Algorithm 1 ends up swapping from $t$ if it eventually picks $t$ and the last non-zero random variable arrives after $\\tau(t)$. These two events are independent. Moreover, the probability of picking $t$ is $\\varphi(t) d t$, and the probability that the last non-zero arrival is after $\\tau(t)$ is $1-\\tau(t)$. Combining these with Eq. (3), for any $t \\in(0, y(1)]$ we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\Theta=\\varphi(t)-(1+f) \\varphi(t)(1-\\tau(t))=\\varphi(t)((1+f) \\tau(t)-f)\n$$\n\n2. For $t \\geq y(1)$, we have $\\varphi(t)=\\Theta$, since there is no further swapping if we pick something after $y(1)$. Moreover, setting $t=1$ in Property IV, we see:\n\n$$\n\\Theta=\\varphi(1)=1-\\int_{y(1)}^{1} \\varphi(s) d s=1-\\int_{y(1)}^{1} \\Theta d s=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}\n$$\n\nPutting the above observations together yields:\n\n$$\n\\Theta=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\varphi(t)=\\frac{\\Theta}{(1+f) y^{-1}(t)-f} \\quad \\forall t \\in(0,1]\n$$\n\nwhere we adopt the convention $y^{-1}(t) \\doteq 1$ for $t \\in(y(1), 1]$.\n\n- Taking the derivative on both sides in Property IV, we get that:\n\n$$\n2 \\varphi(t)+t \\varphi^{\\prime}(t)=\\varphi(y(t)) y^{\\prime}(t), \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]\n$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $t$ and integrating the resulting formula from $k_{1}$, we get:\n\n$$\nt^{2} \\varphi(t)=k_{1}^{2} \\varphi\\left(k_{1}\\right)+\\int_{0}^{y(t)} \\varphi(s) y^{-1}(s) d s, \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]\n$$\n\n(Property VI)\n2.3.4. Identifying the differential equation Observe that as a consequence of Property $\\mathrm{V}, \\varphi$ can be defined in terms of $y$. Therefore, statements about the existence of functions $\\varphi$ and $y$ with the desired properties ought to be reducible to a statement purely about $y$. By substituting all instances of $\\varphi$ in Eq. (5) using Property V, we derive a version of Property IV entirely in terms of $y$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{y^{-1}(t)-c_{f}}-\\frac{t\\left(y^{-1}\\right)^{\\prime}(t)}{\\left(y^{-1}(t)-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}=\\frac{y^{\\prime}(t)}{t-c_{f}}, \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]\n$$\n\nNotice that for $t \\geq y(1), y^{-1}(t)=1$ and therefore the second term on the left-hand side becomes 0 . This implies that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{1-c_{f}}=\\frac{y^{\\prime}(t)}{t-c_{f}}, \\quad \\forall t \\in[y(1), 1]\n$$\n\nwhich yields that $y(t)=\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}-1+c_{f}+y(1)$, for all $t \\geq y(1)$ (an \"initial condition\" in Diff-EQ). For $t \\leq y(1)$, by replacing $t$ with $y(t)$ in Eq. (6) we obtain the following simplified formula:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{t-c_{f}}-\\frac{t}{y^{\\prime}(t)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}=\\frac{y^{\\prime}(y(t))}{y(t)-c_{f}} \\quad \\forall t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]: y(t) \\geq k_{1}\n$$\n\nwhich is exactly our differential equation in Diff-EQ after rearrangement.\n\n2.3.5. Formal analysis Equipped with all the properties identified in our earlier informal discussion, we are now ready to formally show that the Theorem 1 guarantees the existence of functions $\\{y(\\cdot), \\varphi(\\cdot)\\}$ satisfying these properties, and furthermore that the existence of these functions certifies the existence of the desired feasible solution for Dual-Cont-LP. We summarize these results in the following propositions. The proofs are essentially a formalization of the our informal arguments. We postpone the proofs to Section EC.3.5 and Section EC.3.6.\n\nProposition 3. If there exists a solution to Diff-EQ as defined by Theorem 1, then there exists nonnegative real-valued functions $y:\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ and $\\varphi:(0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy Property I, Property II, Property III, Property IV, Property V, and Property VI.\n\nProposition 4. If there exist nonnegative real-valued functions $y:\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right] \\rightarrow[0,1]$ and $\\varphi:(0,1] \\rightarrow$ $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy Property I, Property II, Property III, Property IV, Property V, and Property VI, then there exists a feasible solution for Dual-Cont-LP with coverage $\\Theta=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}$.\n\nWe have succeeded in reducing Theorem 2 to Theorem 1.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 2.4. Solving the differential equation: proof sketch \n\nAs discussed above, we have reduced the problem of analyzing the optimal competitive ratio to solving Diff-EQ with $k_{1}=c_{f}$. Since $y(1)$ is unknown, let us introduce the parameter $\\theta=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}$. Recalling that $c_{f}=\\frac{f}{1+f}$, we must then solve this differential equation:\n\n- For $t \\in\\left[2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}, 1\\right], y(t)$ is given explicitly as\n\n$$\ny(t)=1-\\frac{1}{\\theta}+c_{f}+\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}\n$$\n\nAs stated earlier, this segment can be viewed as the initial condition of the differential equation.\n\n- For every $t<1$, if $y(t) \\geq k_{1}$, then\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(y(t))=\\frac{y(t)-c_{f}}{t-c_{f}}\\left(2-\\frac{y(t)}{y^{\\prime}(t)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nGiven a parameter $\\theta \\in[1 / 2,1]$, a solution (or at least a partial solution) can be found as follows: The function $y(t)$ is determined explicitly on the interval $[y(1), 1]$; recall that $y(1)=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$. Given this segment of the solution, we can now compute an extension to the interval $[y(y(1)), y(1)]$, using equation (8)-note that all the quantities on the right-hand side are known for $t \\in[y(1), 1]$, due to the initial segment. By integration, we obtain a solution $y(t)$ for $t \\in[y(y(1)), y(1)]$. Then we iterate this process, obtaining a solution on the interval $[y(y(y(1))), y(y(1))]$, etc. The process terminates if we extend the solution to the full interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, or if the solution fails for some reason.\n\nOur goal is to find a solution $y(t)$ on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ such that $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$ and $y(t)$ is increasing on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$. As we prove in Section EC.2, such a solution can always be found for a suitable choice of $\\theta \\in[1 / 2,1]$, and we will show in Section 3 that this is exactly the optimal bound for a given value of $f$. Here we discuss at a high-level why such a solution exists and how the proof works. Before proceeding to the general case, let us discuss two special cases in which we can explicitly solve the differential equation and obtain a closed-form solution $y(t)$, as well as the optimal competitive ratio.\n\nThe case of $f \\geq 1$ : In this case, the choice of\n\n$$\n\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}=\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\n$$\n\nand $k_{1}=c_{f}$ leads to a complete solution given by the initial segment:\n\n$$\ny_{f}(t)=(1+f)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2} \\text { for } c_{f} \\leq t \\leq 1\n$$\n\nWe have $y_{f}(1)=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta_{f}}=\\frac{1}{1+f} \\leq \\frac{f}{1+f}=c_{f}$. This shows that the initial segment already covers the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ and the solution is complete. Given the simple two-variable example discussed in the introduction, we also obtain that $\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ is the optimal competitive ratio for $f \\geq 1$.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nThe case of $\\frac{1}{3} \\leq f<1$ : Here, after setting $k_{1}=c_{f}$, we need to extend the solution beyond the initial segment. By integration, we obtain a solution on $[y(y(1)), y(1)]$, and then we determine that in order to obtain $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$, the correct choice of the parameter $\\theta$ is\n\n$$\n\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}=\\frac{(1+f)(\\sqrt{f(2-f)}+1)}{(1+f) \\sqrt{f(2-f)}+3 f+1}\n$$\n\nIf we define $a_{f}=\\frac{f(1-\\sqrt{f(2-f)}]}{(1+f)(1-f)^{2}}$, the solution has the form\n\n$$\ny_{f}(t)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}-a_{f} & \\text { for } y(1) \\leq t \\leq 1 \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{1+f}{t+a_{f}}} \\cdot\\left(\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}-c_{f}\\left(\\sqrt{t+a_{f}}-\\sqrt{c_{f}+a_{f}}\\right)^{2}\\right) & \\text { for } c_{f} \\leq t \\leq y(1)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis implies that there exists an algorithm obtaining a competitive ratio of $\\theta_{f}=\\frac{(1+f)(\\sqrt{f(2-f)}+1)}{(1+f) \\sqrt{f(2-f)+3 f+1}}$ in the regime of $f \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{3}, 1\\right]$. The interval of $\\left[\\frac{1}{3}, 1\\right]$ is determined by the fact that for $f<1 / 3$, we need to iterate the procedure more than two times to obtain a solution on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nThe general case. For general $f>0$ (in particular $0<f<\\frac{1}{3}$ ), we do not provide an explicit solution of the differential equation, and we also do not have an explicit formula for the optimal competitive ratio $\\theta_{f}$. Nevertheless, we prove that a solution exists for a suitable choice of $\\theta$ and we describe the solution in a somewhat implicit form. Here we sketch a high-level argument for the existence of a monotonic solution such that $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$.\n\nConsider a fixed buyback factor $f>0$, and different choices of $\\theta \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ (which also determine the value $y(1)$ and the initial segment of the solution). By solving the differential equation (as far as possible), we obtain a solution $y^{\\theta}(t)$. Depending on our choice of $\\theta$, several options could occur:\n\n- The solution can be extended to the full interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ so that it is monotonically increasing and $y^{\\theta}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$. This is the ideal option-it means that we have found a value of $\\theta$ for which a $\\theta$-competitive algorithm can be designed.\n- A monotonic solution exists on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, but it fails to satisfy $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$.\n- A monotonic solution does not exist on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$-either because we obtain $y^{\\prime}(t)=0$ for $t>c_{f}$ which leads to division by 0 in the differential equation, or we obtain $y^{\\prime}(t)<0$ which means that the solution is not monotonically increasing.\nThe figure below illustrates the different options that might happen.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nThe crux of the proof is that the solution $y^{\\theta}(t)$ as a function of the parameter $\\theta$ behaves continuously in $\\theta$, for a range of $\\theta$ such that the solution $y^{\\theta}(t)$ can be defined on the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$. We remark that due to the non-linear nature of the differential equation, this is by no means an obvious fact. In\n\nfact, the behavior of $y^{\\theta}(t)$ can be rather unstable for larger values of $\\theta$, where the solution cannot be extended to the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, and the solution can break down or diverge in various ways.\n\nA key property that we prove is that if a solution $y^{\\theta}(t)$ is well-defined on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, and $y\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0$, then $y^{\\theta}(t)$ must be convex. This leads to other desirable properties of $y^{\\theta}(t)$ (for example, the derivative $y^{\\prime}(t)$ for $t>c_{f}$ satisfies $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ which means that quantities in the differential equation do not diverge). Finally, a continuity argument proves that since there exist solutions such that $y^{\\theta}\\left(c_{f}\\right)<0$, and also $y^{\\theta^{\\prime}}\\left(c_{f}\\right)>0$, there must be a critical value $\\theta^{*}$ such that $y^{\\theta^{*}}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$, and this is the desired value $\\theta=\\theta_{f}$ for any given $f>0$.

{"section_id": 7, "text": "# 3. Worst-Case Instances \n\nPreviously, we showed that the competitive ratio $\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$ can be achieved by an optimal online algorithm for any $f>0$. Our goal in this section is to prove that this result is tight.\n\nTheorem 3 (Optimal Competitive Ratio - Upper bound). No online algorithm, either deterministic or randomized, can achieve a competitive ratio better than $\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$.\n\nRecall the simple two-variable example showing that no competitive ratio better than $\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ can be achieved by an online algorithm: $X_{1}=1$ (deterministic) and $X_{2}=(1+f)$ w.p. $\\frac{1}{(1+f)}$ and 0 otherwise. By comparing with the competitive ratio guarantee of our optimal online algorithm for $f \\geq 1$, we conclude that this bound is tight for $f \\geq 1$. Note that in this instance, the algorithm is indifferent between accepting or rejecting the first random variable. In Section 3.1, we build on this idea to construct a harder instance with $n=3$ random variables for $0<f<1$ where any algorithm achieves an even worse competitive ratio (in fact, exactly the competitive ratio established in (9) for $f \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{3}, 1\\right]$. Then, in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, we construct a general worst-case instance for every $f$ based on similar ideas, using our solution to the differential equation, completing the proof of Theorem 3.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "### 3.1. Warm-up: Hard instance with three random random variables\n\nLet $0<f<1$. Consider the following instance with $n=3$ random variables and parameter $x \\geq(1+f)$ :\n\n$$\nX_{1}=1, \\quad X_{2}= \\begin{cases}x & \\text { w.p. } \\frac{1}{x} \\\\ 0 & \\text { o.w. }\\end{cases}, \\quad X_{3}= \\begin{cases}x(1+f) & \\text { w.p. } \\frac{x-1-f}{(1+f)(x-1)} \\\\ 0 & \\text { o.w. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe values and probabilities are chosen so that the optimal online algorithm remains indifferent between accepting $X_{i}$ or rejecting it, assuming it has already accepted $X_{i-1}$ for $i \\in\\{2,3\\}$. The expected value of the prophet benchmark in this instance can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]=\\frac{f}{1+f}+\\frac{x f}{(1+f)(x-1)}+\\frac{x(x-1-f)}{(x-1)}=x+f \\frac{x-1-x f}{(x-1)(1+f)}\n$$\n\nTo determine the expected reward for the optimal online algorithm, we can solve the recurrence described in (2) to show that $\\Phi_{0}(0)=x-f$. By setting $x \\geq(1+f)$ to minimize the competitive ratio, we conclude that no online algorithm can exceed the competitive ratio\n\n$$\n\\min _{x \\geq(1+f)} \\frac{x-f}{x+f \\frac{x-1-x f}{(x-1)(1+f)}}=\\frac{(1+f)(\\sqrt{f(2-f)}+1)}{(1+f) \\sqrt{f(2-f)}+3 f+1}\n$$\n\nattained at $x^{*}=\\frac{f+2+\\sqrt{f(2-f)}}{2}$ (Note that $x^{*}>(1+f)$ if $f<1$ ). The corresponding instance is:\n\n$$\nX_{1}=1, X_{2}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{f+2+\\sqrt{f(2-f)}}{2} \\text { w.p. } \\frac{2}{f+2+\\sqrt{f(2-f)}} & X_{3}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{f+2+\\sqrt{f(2-f)}}{2}(1+f) \\text { w.p. } \\frac{1-\\sqrt{f(2-f)}}{(1+f)(1-f)} \\\\\n0 & \\text { o.w. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNotice that this instance is well defined only when $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{f(2-f)}}{(1+f)(1-f)} \\geq 0$, which holds when $f<1$. One can verify that (10) is strictly less than our previous $\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ bound when $f<1$, and matches $\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ at $f=1$. Comparing this upper bound with the competitive ratio guarantee of our algorithm in (9) confirms the tightness of the competitive ratio in (10) for $\\frac{1}{3} \\leq f \\leq 1$.\n\nThe above instances with 2 and 3 random variables suggest that as $f$ decreases, we may need more random variables to enforce the worst-case competitive ratio, but all these instances might satisfy a certain indifference property. Expanding on these observations, we now turn to instances with potentially more than three variables and aim to find the hardest possible instance for every $f$ that enforces a similar indifference condition to that of the instances with $n=2$ or $n=3$ random variables.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 3.2.

To imitate the example with $n=3$ variables, we would like to construct instances with the property that, holding a random variable, the optimal online algorithm is indifferent between accepting or rejecting the next. Informally, suppose the algorithm is currently holding $x_{i-1}$. Accepting $x_{i}$ is beneficial only if all future variables are inactive, and the resulting benefit is:\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{i}-(1+f) x_{i-1}\\right) \\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-p_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, accepting $x_{i}$ is costly if any subsequent variable is active; in that case, the cost is:\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}\\left(1-p_{j}\\right)\\right) f \\cdot x_{i}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, if these two quantities are equal, we obtain an instance of the desired type.

A Simple Order-Agnostic Optimal Competitive Algorithm \n\nIn the previous sections, we essentially developed an algorithm for the prophet inequality with buyback problem on monotonic scaled-Bernoulli instances with small activation probabilities. This algorithm relies on our solution to the problem of maximizing the effective probability of accepting Bernoulli random variables-the analog of the online contention resolution scheme problem for the buyback model\u2014on a continuum (Algorithm 1). By applying our \"variable splitting\" reduction (detailed in the proof of Proposition 2), we could extend this algorithm to obtain another algorithm\n\nthat works for any monotonic scaled-Bernoulli instance (which could alternatively be derived by directly solving Dual-Disc-LP). Moreover, using the sequence of reductions from Section 2.1, we could further transform the resulting algorithm into one that applies to general instances.\n\nAs a result of these reductions, in addition to the optimal online policy-which is optimal competitive by definition, but requires full knowledge of the sequence of distributions-we obtain another optimal competitive online algorithm. However, it remains unclear whether this algorithm can be implemented explicitly in polynomial time using the constructs from Section 2. More importantly, it is not yet clear whether such an implementation can be made order-agnostic, relying only on the set of distributions rather than their arrival order.\n\nIn this section, we describe a simple and order-agnostic polynomial-time algorithm, Algorithm 2, that obtains the optimal competitive ratio for a general instance of the problem. Throughout this section, we assume that the instances consist of a sequence of distributions $\\mathcal{D}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{n}$ of independent nonnegative random variables $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}$, with $\\mathcal{D}_{i}$ having a cumulative distribution function $F_{i}$.

Intuition behind the design of Algorithm 2 \n\nAn issue with general instances-even when the random variables are Bernoulli-is that the values may be observed in an arbitrary order, in which case our analysis of Algorithm 1 from Section 2 does not apply. Intuitively, seeing a higher value earlier is advantageous, since we immediately know that any lower value appearing afterwards is useless. This suggests that designing an algorithm for general instances should not be harder than for monotonic instances, a fact formally captured by the reductions in Section 2.1. However, implementing this idea requires substantial technical care.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a sequence of non-monotonic Bernoulli variables. If we observe a variable $X_{i}=v_{i}$ earlier than it would appear in the monotonic order, we can simulate what the algorithm would have done had it seen a monotonic sequence before observing this variable. It might have chosen to accept a lower value $X_{j}=v_{j}<v_{i}$, though we do not yet know if such a variable will appear. Assuming that we are currently holding value $z<v_{j}$, we can simulate accepting $X_{j}$ by accepting $X_{i}=v_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{v_{j}-z}{v_{i}-z}$. In expectation, this mirrors the behavior of the original algorithm.\n\nWhile this idea can be used to handle the case of non-monotonic Bernoulli variables, to handle general instances (possibly with continuous distributions), we need a technique to appropriately embed realized values from any sequence of distributions into a sequence of quantiles. For this, we use the formalism of the Poisson point process (PPP), a probabilistic model in which points on the\n\nreal line are activated according to a given density. In our framework, the PPP represents the observed values, or possibly their quantiles w.r.t. $X_{\\max }$.\n\nOur design of Algorithm 2, formalizes and combines the above high-level ideas in several steps:\n\n- Section 4.1.1: We start by interpreting Algorithm 1 as an algorithm that acts on a particular kind of non-homogeneous PPP; one that captures the quantiles of the observed variables.\n- Section 4.1.2: Next, we explain how based on an observed a sequence of random variables $X_{i}$, we can generate an \"online PPP\" consistent with the distribution of the full instance, such that at each time the maximum value in the PPP is the maximum value $X_{i}$ observed so far.\n- Section 4.1.3: Next, we explain a modification to Algorithm 1 that ensures that it always makes decisions to accept points based only on a comparison with a certain threshold (note that this is true for Algorithm 1 as stated when $t \\geq k_{1}$, but not for $t<k_{1}$ ). While this modification is not strictly speaking necessary, it simplifies the design of Algorithm 2.\n- Section 4.1.4: Finally, we describe Algorithm 2 which can be applied to a general instance of the prophet inequality with buyback problem, by using our online PPP to simulate the behavior of Algorithm 1 (with the modification described just above).\n4.1.1. Scale-invariant Poisson point process We begin by recalling that in our previous discussion of Algorithm 1, we worked with a continuous limit of Bernoulli random variables defined on the interval $(0,1]$, where a random variable corresponding to the interval $[t, t+d t]$ is active independently with probability $\\frac{d t}{t}$. We can formalize this by viewing the set of active points as a Poisson point process (PPP) on $(0,1]$ with rate $\\lambda(t)=\\frac{1}{t}$, or equivalently, with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t, 1])=-\\log t$. Such a PPP is referred to as a scale-invariant Poisson point process (Arratia 2016). ${ }^{10}$ A formal discussion of PPPs is provided in Section EC.4.1. Thus, Algorithm 1 can now be viewed as a procedure that observes points arising from a scale-invariant PPP on $[0,1]$ and accepts or swaps these points in such a way that each active point $t$ is accepted with an effective probability equal to $\\Theta$ times the probability that $t$ is the maximum point of the PPP. (Recall that the effective probability refers to the probability of accepting the point minus $(1+f)$ times the probability of discarding the point.)\n4.1.2. Online PPP generation An algorithm that aims to use Algorithm 1 to solve a general instance of the problem must find a way to embed its sequential observations of random variables $X_{i}$ (arriving in an arbitrary order) into a process whose points are observed in a monotonic order. To achieve this, we generate a PPP in an online fashion such that it globally agrees with the distribution\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ This process has been considered previously in optimal stopping problems; see, for instance, the work of Gnedin (2021).\n\nof $X_{\\max }$ and its maximum at each time captures the maximum observed value so far, $\\max _{1 \\leq j \\leq i} X_{j}$. This embedding allows us to make accept-or-swap decisions based on this evolving maximum value and thereby leverage Algorithm 1, which expects to observe values in a monotonic order.\n\nA technical detail is that, while previously we described PPPs supported on the \"quantile space\" $(0,1]$, it is more convenient in the formulation of Algorithm 2 to work directly with the \"value space\" $(0, \\infty)$ (noting the straightforward correspondence between these spaces via the CDF $F(x)$ ). More formally, we embed the random variables $X_{i}$ into a PPP with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t,+\\infty))=-\\log F(t)$ on $(0,+\\infty)$, where $F$ is the CDF of $X_{\\max }$. By the mapping theorem for PPPs (Kingman 1992), there is a direct correspondence between this PPP and a scale-invariant PPP, allowing points generated in the value-space PPP to be converted to a scale-invariant PPP on $(0,1]$ by applying the CDF $F$.\n\nThe remaining question is how to generate a value-space PPP by adding points in an online fashion, ensuring that at each time the current maximum is consistent with the maximum $X_{i}$ observed so far, and that the PPP at the end has the desired intensity measure $-\\log F(x)$. The cornerstone of our approach is to simultaneously track the current maximum observed value $\\hat{x}$ among $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{i-1}$, as well as a PPP supported on the interval $(0, \\hat{x}]$. When a new random variable $X_{i}$ arrives, we simply ignore it if $X_{i} \\leq \\hat{x}$. On the other hand, if $X_{i}>\\hat{x}$, we explicitly add $X_{i}$ to the PPP to ensure that $X_{\\max }$ appears in the PPP. We then need to generate the portion of the PPP between $\\hat{x}$ and $X_{i}$ by filling in additional points to maintain the intensity measure $-\\log F(t)$ of the point process, as desired.\n\nAn initial attempt might be to generate this portion by sampling from a PPP on $\\left(\\hat{x}, X_{i}\\right]$ with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t,+\\infty))=-\\log F(t)=-\\sum_{r=1}^{n} \\log F_{r}(t)$. However, this approach would clearly generate too many points, exceeding the desired intensity measure (since we already explicitly added $X_{i}$ ). Moreover, conceptually speaking, this approach incorrectly ignores the partial information that we have already observed: namely, that $X_{j} \\leq \\hat{x}$ for all $j<i$. Intuitively, the random variables $X_{j}$ for $j<i$ should not contribute to generating the PPP between $\\hat{x}$ and $X_{i}$. The correct approach is therefore to sample from a PPP on the interval $\\left(\\hat{x}, X_{i}\\right]$ with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t,+\\infty))=-\\sum_{r=i}^{n} \\log F_{r}(t)$, as formally established in Lemma 7. This adjustment prevents artificial inflation of the PPP's density and accurately reflects our partial knowledge from prior observations.\n4.1.3. Making Algorithm 1 threshold-Based We note that while Algorithm 1 makes deterministic acceptance decisions for quantiles $t \\geq k_{1}$, it uses randomized decisions for quantiles $t<k_{1}$ : it accepts each active quantile $t<k_{1}$ with probability $\\frac{t \\varphi(t)}{1-\\frac{t^{2}}{1-\\frac{t^{2}}{2}} \\varphi(s) d s}$. However, for convenience, we prefer to modify the algorithm so that it makes deterministic, threshold-based decisions for $t<k_{1}$ as well.\n\nOne way to convert Algorithm 1 into a threshold-based algorithm is by introducing a randomized threshold $\\tau(0) \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right)$ and then deterministically accepting the first active quantile after this threshold. A calculation shows that the appropriate choice of the randomized threshold $\\tau(0)$-to ensure each quantile $t$ is accepted with probability $\\varphi(t) d t$-is to sample it from a distribution with CDF $G(t):=t \\varphi(t)+\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s$. See the proof of Lemma 8 for more details; the fact that $G(t)$ is a valid CDF follows from Corollary EC.1.\n4.1.4. Flagging points and simulating Algorithm 1 Given the online PPP constructed above, our algorithm (Algorithm 2) aims to simulate Algorithm 1 (with an initial randomized threshold $\\tau(0)$ ) on these points. To achieve this, Algorithm 2 first identifies the values in the value-space PPP corresponding to quantiles that Algorithm 1 would accept. At this point, if our algorithm could simply accept all these values, we were done; This holds because the effective acceptance probability for each quantile of $X_{\\max }$ would match that of Algorithm 1, and linearity of expectation would imply a competitive ratio equal to this effective acceptance probability.\n\nHowever, Algorithm 2 cannot directly accept every PPP point because many of them are \"fictitious\" points added by our own sampling procedure, rather than being \"real\" values corresponding to actual observed variables $X_{i}$. On the positive side, we know that the maximum PPP point at any given time is a real value, as it corresponds to the maximum observed variable $X_{i}$ thus far. Therefore, we can simulate accepting a fictitious point by instead accepting a real variable $X_{i}$ with an appropriate probability. Formally, our algorithm flags points corresponding to quantiles accepted by Algorithm 1, and then simulates the acceptance of these flagged points via accepting actual observed values $X_{i}$.\n\nAs previously discussed (and formalized in Lemma 2), if we currently hold a value $z<X_{i}$ and want to simulate the acceptance of a value $z^{\\prime}<X_{i}$, we can instead accept $X_{i}$ with probability $\\frac{z^{\\prime}-z}{X_{i}-z}$ and act in the future as if we had accepted the value $z^{\\prime}$. This simulation approach is valid because our objective is linear in the variables $X_{i}$ (that we are swapping or holding), and\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text { value held in future }]=\\left(1-\\frac{z^{\\prime}-z}{X_{i}-z}\\right) z+\\left(\\frac{z^{\\prime}-z}{X_{i}-z}\\right) X_{i}=z+\\left(\\frac{z^{\\prime}-z}{X_{i}-z}\\right)\\left(X_{i}-z\\right)=z^{\\prime}\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 4.2.

Here, we will provide an intuitive proof sketch.\nProof sketch. First, note that a PPP with intensity measure $-\\sum_{r=i}^{n} \\log F_{r}(t)$ can be alternatively generated by separately generating independent PPPs with intensity measures $-\\log F_{r}(t)$ for each $r \\in\\{i, \\ldots, n\\}$, and then taking the union of these generated points. Thus, we can fix an $r$ and focus only on the samples generated from the $-\\log F_{r}(t)$ portion of the PPP during a run of Algorithm 2. We then show that these points have the same distribution as a PPP $S_{r}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t,+\\infty))=-\\log F_{r}(t)$.\n\nDuring a run of Algorithm 2, the samples from the $-\\log F_{r}(t)$ portion of the PPP are generated in two stages: In the first stage, a PPP with intensity $-\\log F_{r}(t)$ is generated on the interval $(0, \\hat{x}]$, where $\\hat{x}=\\max \\left(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{r-1}\\right)$. In the second stage, $X_{r}$ is observed. If $X_{r} \\leq \\hat{x}$, it is ignored. If $X_{r}>\\hat{x}$, we explicitly add the point $X_{r}$ along with a PPP on the interval $\\left(\\hat{x}, X_{r}\\right)$ with intensity $-\\log F_{r}(t)$ to the set of points generated in the first stage.\n\nObserve that the distribution of $X_{r}$ matches the distribution of the last sampled point $\\tilde{X}_{r}$ from $S_{r}$. Consequently, the probability that $X_{r}>\\hat{x}$ equals the probability that $\\tilde{X}_{r}>\\hat{x}$. Therefore, we can couple samples of $S_{r}$ where $\\tilde{X}_{r} \\leq \\hat{x}$ with the points generated during the first stage when $X_{r} \\leq \\hat{x}$. Likewise, we can couple samples of $S_{r}$ where $\\tilde{X}_{r}>\\hat{x}$ with the combined points generated in stages one and two when $X_{r}=\\tilde{X}_{r}$. The desired conclusion follows.\n\nNext, we would like to formally establish the link between the values Algorithm 2 actually flags, and the quantiles Algorithm 2 accepts. For each value $v$ Algorithm 2 flags, we can consider the associated quantile of $X_{\\max }, F(v)$. Then:\n\nLemma 8. In the quantile space of $X_{\\max }$, the probability that the algorithm flags a quantile $t$ conditioned on that quantile being sampled by the algorithm is exactly $t \\varphi(t)$.\n\nProof. Throughout the proof, we say quantile \" $t$ is sampled\" if $F^{-1}(t)$ is one of the values added by the Algorithm 2 to the PPP it generates in an online fashion. We also often refer to quantities such as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}(\\text { flagging quantile } t \\mid t \\text { is sampled })\n$$\n\nwhich correspond to Algorithm 2. Here, we are conditioning on an event with zero probability, but this is well-defined for our particular point processes. Formally speaking, these probabilities are Palm probabilities related to a reduced Palm distribution (Palm 1943), but an understanding of this theory is not necessary to follow our argument. As another technical note, the distribution of a scale-invariant PPP conditioned on $t$ being sampled is the same as the distribution of a scale-invariant PPP. Informally, this is because in a PPP, each point in the interval belongs to the PPP independently. Formally speaking, this is a consequence of the Slivnyak-Mecke theorem (Slivnyak 1962, Mecke 1967), but once again, knowing this theorem is not necessary to follow our proof. ${ }^{\\text {II }}$\n\nNow, note that for $t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$ we have that $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\right.$ flagging quantile $t \\mid t$ is sampled $)$ is equal to:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\text { no sampled } s \\in\\left(\\tau_{0}, t\\right) \\mid t \\text { is sampled, } \\tau(0)=\\tau_{0}\\right) d G\\left(\\tau_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\n(Recall that our intial threshold $\\tau(0)$ is a sample from a distribution with $\\operatorname{CDF} G(t)=t \\varphi(t)+$ $\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s$.) The probability that no quantile in $\\left(\\tau_{0}, t\\right)$ is sampled for a scale-invariant PPP is exactly $\\frac{\\tau_{0}}{t}$, and $\\tau(0)$ is independent of the realization of the PPP.

Now if $y\\left(t_{0}+\\epsilon\\right)<t_{0}$, then, for $s<t_{0}+\\epsilon$, we have\n\n$$\ns \\varphi_{0}^{\\prime}(s)+2 \\varphi_{0}(s)=\\varphi_{0}(y(s)) y^{\\prime}(s)=\\varphi(y(s)) y^{\\prime}(s)=s \\varphi^{\\prime}(s)+2 \\varphi(s)\n$$\n\nso $\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(s^{2}\\left(\\varphi_{0}(s)-\\varphi(s)\\right)\\right)=0$, from which we immediately conclude that $\\varphi_{0}(s)=\\varphi(s)$ for $s<t+\\epsilon$. This is a contradiction, which finishes the proof.\n\nSince we have now shown that the values Algorithm 2 flags are basically the same as the quantiles accepted by Algorithm 1 (after applying $F$ ), we must next link the performance of the algorithm to the values it flags. Establishing this link is the goal of Lemma 9.\n\nLemma 9. $\\mathbb{E}[A L G] \\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max _{z \\in S^{\\prime}} z\\right]-f \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{z \\in S^{\\prime}} z-\\max _{z \\in S^{\\prime}} z\\right]$, where $A L G$ is the realized net reward of the algorithm and $S^{\\prime}$ is the (random) set of values the algorithm flags.\n\nProof. First, we define the random variables $\\hat{X}_{i}$ and $\\hat{Z}_{i}$. The variable $\\hat{X}_{i}$ represents the largest value accepted by the algorithm before observing $X_{i}$, and $\\hat{Z}_{i}$ represents the largest value flagged by the algorithm before observing $X_{i}$. (If no values have been accepted or flagged, respectively, these variables equal 0.) For convenience, we set $\\hat{X}_{0}=\\hat{Z}_{0}=0$.\n\nNow, note that:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ALG}=\\hat{X}_{n}-f \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{1}\\left(\\hat{X}_{i+1}>\\hat{X}_{i}\\right) \\hat{X}_{i} \\geq \\hat{X}_{n}-f \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{1}\\left(\\hat{Z}_{i+1}>\\hat{Z}_{i}\\right) \\hat{X}_{i}\n$$\n\nsince if $\\hat{Z}_{i+1}=\\hat{Z}_{i}$, then $\\hat{X}_{i+1}=\\hat{X}_{i}$. Next, note that in case we have $\\hat{Z}_{i+1}>\\hat{Z}_{i}$, then we have:\n\n$$\n\\hat{X}_{i+1}= \\begin{cases}X_{i+1} & \\text { with probability } \\frac{\\hat{Z}_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}{X_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}} \\\\ \\hat{X}_{i} & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow fix an instantiation of the randomness related to the values of $X_{i}$, the numbers generated by the algorithm in the PPP, and $\\tau(0)$, and call this instantiation $\\mathcal{F}$. Conditioned on $\\mathcal{F}$, the $X_{i}$ and $\\hat{Z}_{i}$ are all deterministic. By induction on $j$, we will show that for $j \\in[0, n]$ we have that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{X}_{j} \\mid \\mathcal{F}\\right]=\\hat{Z}_{j}$. The base case is true since $\\hat{X}_{0}=\\hat{Z}_{0}=0$. Let us now assume that the statement is true for $j=i$. If $\\hat{Z}_{i+1}=\\hat{Z}_{i}$, we already said that $\\hat{X}_{i+1}=\\hat{X}_{i}$, so there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{X}_{i+1} \\mid \\mathcal{F}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{\\hat{Z}_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}{X_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}} X_{i+1}+\\left(1-\\frac{\\hat{Z}_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}{X_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}\\right) \\hat{X}_{i} \\mid \\mathcal{F}\\right]=\\frac{\\hat{Z}_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}{X_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}} X_{i+1}+\\left(1-\\frac{\\hat{Z}_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}{X_{i+1}-\\hat{Z}_{i}}\\right) \\hat{Z}_{i}=\\hat{Z}_{i+1}\n$$\n\nWe conclude that:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{ALG} \\mid \\mathcal{F}] \\geq \\hat{Z}_{n}-f \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{1}\\left(\\hat{Z}_{i+1}>\\hat{Z}_{i}\\right) \\hat{Z}_{i}\n$$\n\nOur results simply follows by taking expectation of the above inequality over $\\mathcal{F}$.\nWe are finally ready to establish the competitive ratio of Algorithm 2:\nTHEOREM 4 (Competitive Ratio of Algorithm 2). Algorithm 2 obtains a competitive ratio of at least $\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y_{f}(1)}$, and therefore is an optimal competitive online algorithm.\n\nProof. Note that by Lemma 9, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{ALG}] & \\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\max _{z \\in S^{s}} z\\right]-f \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{z \\in S^{s}} z-\\max _{z \\in S^{s}} z\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{z \\in S^{s}} z\\right]-(1+f) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{z \\in S^{s}} z-\\max _{z \\in S^{s}} z\\right] \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{1} F^{-1}(t) \\operatorname{Pr}(\\text { flagging quantile } t \\mid t \\text { is sampled }) \\frac{d t}{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n-(1+f) \\int_{0}^{1} F^{-1}(t) \\operatorname{Pr}(\\text { unflagging quantile } t \\mid t \\text { is sampled }) \\frac{d t}{t}\n$$\n\nThe last equation follows from the fact that the probability of flagging each quantile can be expressed by conditioning on the event of it being sampled. It follows from Lemma 7 that the chance of there being a sampled quantile $>\\tau(t)$ conditional on the quantile $t$ being sampled is exactly $1-\\tau(t)$. Using Lemma 8 and (Property V), the above is then equal to:\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} F^{-1}(t)(t \\varphi(t)-(1+f) t \\varphi(t)(1-\\tau(t))) \\frac{d t}{t}=\\int_{0}^{1} \\theta_{f} F^{-1}(t) d t=\\theta_{f} \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]\n$$\n\nas desired. This completes our analysis of Algorithm 2.\nFinally, we note that Algorithm 2 can be implemented in polynomial time. The discussion of the running time and this implementation is deferred to Section EC.4.2.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 5. Conclusion \n\nIn this paper, we introduced and studied a version of the prophet inequality problem in which cancellation is possible by paying a penalty $f$ times the value of the discarded item. We constructed an order-agnostic and optimally competitive algorithm for this problem for all $f \\geq 0$, and calculated its competitive ratio through the solution to a particular differential equation, which we derived explicitly. We also use the same differential equation to find worst-case instances for our problem. We finally obtain explicit solutions for the differential equation for $f \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$, providing explicit (simpler) forms for both the algorithm and its competitive ratio in this regime.\n\nOur algorithm allowing cancellations, and taking into account distributional information on the input, obtains a better competitive ratio than the algorithms in the classical prophet inequality setting, and the algorithms in the setting with adversarial inputs. As $f \\rightarrow 0$, our algorithm's competitive ratio goes to 1 significantly faster than the competitive ratio of algorithms with adversarial input. Furthermore, our algorithm, unlike the optimal online algorithm, does not need to know the order in which the random variables will arrive in the future.\n\nFuture research: There are several interesting directions for future research. Firstly, is there a closed-form formula for the optimal competitive ratio $\\alpha(f)$ for every $f>0$ ? We conjecture that this is not the case, but perhaps there is a more explicit description of the behavior of $\\alpha(f)$ than the one provided in this paper. Secondly, future research could extend our model to the multi-item prophet inequality or, more broadly, to the prophet inequality with a matroid constraint. Thirdly, another interesting direction is to adopt our model to the prophet inequality with a matching constraint, or more generally to the prophet inequality for combinatorial auctions. We believe that this model, and our technical framework, might find other interesting applications in revenue management.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# Appendix\n## A.

First, note that by the mapping theorem for PPPs (Kingman 1992), this is the same as showing that the distribution of samples generated during a run of Algorithm 3 is exactly the same as the distribution of a PPP on $(0, \\infty)$ with intensity measure $\\Lambda((t, \\infty))=-\\log F(t)$. Now suppose we are given $0<s_{1}<t_{1}<s_{2}<t_{2}<\\cdots<s_{k}<t_{k}$. We can calculate the probability that a PPP with intensity measure $-\\log F(x)$ generates no points in $B=\\left(s_{1}, t_{1}\\right] \\cup \\cdots \\cup\\left(s_{k}, t_{k}\\right]$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}(\\text { no points in } B)=\\prod_{j=1}^{k} e^{-\\log F\\left(t_{j}\\right)+\\log F\\left(s_{j}\\right)}=\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{F\\left(s_{j}\\right)}{F\\left(t_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNow by R\u00e9nyi's theorem for PPPs (Kingman 1992), it suffices to show that the probability $S$ contains no points in $B$ is exactly $\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{F\\left(s_{j}\\right)}{F\\left(t_{j}\\right)} .{ }^{12}$ The probability that a PPP on $\\left(x^{\\prime}, x\\right]$ with $x^{\\prime}<s<t<x$ and intensity measure $-\\sum_{r=1}^{n} \\log F_{r}(t)$ generates no points in $(s, t]$ is exactly $\\prod_{r=i}^{n} \\frac{F_{r}(s)}{F_{r}(t)}$. Hence:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}(S \\cap B=\\emptyset)=\\sum_{0 \\leq i_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq i_{k} \\leq n} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\max \\left(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{i_{j}}\\right)<s_{j}<t_{j}<X_{i_{j}+1} \\forall j\\right] \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\prod_{r=i_{j}+1}^{n} \\frac{F_{r}\\left(s_{j}\\right)}{F_{r}\\left(t_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nand we would like to show this equals $\\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\prod_{r=1}^{n} \\frac{F_{r}\\left(s_{j}\\right)}{F_{r}\\left(t_{j}\\right)}$.

The study of the single-item buyback setting under adversarial arrivals originates from the work of Babaioff et al. (2008), which established the optimal competitive ratio for deterministic integral algorithms using a modified greedy approach. The follow-up work of Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg (2009) showed that the optimal competitive ratio can be achieved via an an elegant correlated randomization step combined with the greedy algorithm. More recently, Ekbatani et al. $(2022,2023)$ developed an optimal primal-dual fractional algorithm that, together with a lossless randomized rounding, also yields an optimal competitive randomized algorithm. Beyond the single-item case, the buyback setting has been studied for general matroids (Babaioff et al. 2008, Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg 2009), online matchings (Ekbatani et al. 2022), and matroid intersections (Badanidiyuru 2011). It can also be viewed as a special case of unconstrained online allocation with a submodular (though non-monotone) combinatorial valuation (Rubinstein and Singla 2017), where only an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm is currently known. The special case of the buyback model with $f=0$ is also studied in the literature on online resource allocation with free-disposal (Feldman et al. 2009, Devanur et al. 2016, Feng and Niazadeh 2024). Another related problem is prophet inequalities with overbooking (Ezra et al. 2018, Assaf and Samuel-Cahn 2000), which differ by allowing the decision maker to accept more variables than their capacity, whereas here we consider a single-item capacity and a linear cancellation cost. Although \"recourse\" has been studied in various other contexts-e.g., Azar et al. (2003), Buchbinder et al. (2014), Canetti and Irani (1995), Han et al. (2014), Chaudhuri et al. (2009), Constantin et al. (2009)\u2014our focus is specifically on the classic prophet inequality with buyback.\n\nOther related models in dynamic revenue management. Our work is also conceptually related to dynamic revenue management, where offline supplies have soft inventory constraints. Examples include dynamic revenue management with cancellation (on the demand side) and overbooking (e.g., Rothstein 1971, Erdelyi and Topaloglu 2010, Ayd\u0131n et al. 2013, Dai et al. 2019, Freund and Zhao 2021), as well as dynamic inventory control problems (e.g., Levi et al. 2007, Mostagir 2010, Besbes and Muharremoglu 2013, Cheung and SimchiLevi 2019, Agrawal and Jia 2022, Qin et al. 2022). Another related line of research is on revenue management with callable products, first studied by Gallego et al. (2008) in the context of airlines. They proposed a model allowing low-fare tickets to be recalled (bought back) at a certain price once high-fare customers arrive. Gallego and Lee (2018) extended this model to multi-fare consumers, while Gallego and Lee (2020) examined online assortment with callable products and characterized optimal policies for different choice models.\n\nProphet inequalities. Besides the works described, other related noteworthy results in the prophet inequality literature include refined bounds for special cases such as i.i.d. values or independent arrivals in random order (Correa et al. 2017, Abolhassani et al. 2017, Esfandiari et al. 2017), as well as extensions to more general feasibility environments and valuations. These include multi-unit settings (Hajiaghayi et al. 2007, Yan 2011, Alaei 2014, Chawla et al. 2024), matroids (Kleinberg and Weinberg 2012, Anari et al. 2019), matchings (Alaei et al. 2012, Papadimitriou et al. 2021), general downward-closed environments (Rubinstein\n\n2016), and combinatorial valuations (Rubinstein and Singla 2017). For a more comprehensive overview, see Lucier (2017) and Correa et al. (2019).\n\nOnline contention resolution and LP duality. As noted, our generalized flow perspective closely relates to a generalization of the online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) problem under costly recourse. The OCRS problem traces back to the seminal works of Feige (2006) and Chekuri et al. (2011) in the offline setting, and Feldman et al. (2016) in the online setting. Since then, OCRS has been extensively studied within both computer science and operations research. For instance, Alaei (2014) developed an (almost) optimal OCRS for uniform matroids, later refined and extended by Jiang et al. (2022), Dinev and Weinberg (2023), Feng et al. (2022). In a different direction, Lee and Singla (2018) established a duality between prophet inequalities (with respect to ex-ante relaxation) and OCRS, conceptually linked to our LP-based approach and other LP approaches in the literature on prophet inequalities or obtaining competitive ratios against fluid approximations in Bayesian online allocation (Adelman 2004, Alaei et al. 2012, Alaei 2014, Jiang et al. 2023). Moreover, OCRS-based techniques have found diverse applications in prophet inequalities and Bayesian mechanism design. Classic examples include sequential posted pricing (Yan 2011, Hartline and Roughgarden 2009, Chawla et al. 2010), combinatorial auctions (Dutting et al. 2020, Feige et al. 2015), correlations in prophet inequalities (Immorlica et al. 2020), matchings (Ezra et al. 2022a, Pollner et al. 2022), and prophet secretary (Esfandiari et al. 2017, Adamczyk and W\u0142odarczyk 2018).\n\nGeneralized flow with leakage Generalized flows have been studied from the perspective of network flow (Bhaumik and Jensen 1974, Glover and Klingman 1973, Glover et al. 1978) and a generalized max-min relation has been found (Pulat 1989). We do not appeal to this result directly, as it would just result in moving back to our primal LP.\n\nOptimum online policies. A significant portion of the prophet inequality literature focuses on simple, threshold-based algorithms and their competitive ratios against the prophet benchmark. In contrast, recent work has examined the optimal online policy from a computational perspective: Anari et al. (2019) established a PTAS for laminar matroids, while Segev and Singla (2021) developed a PTAS for free-order prophet inequalities and stochastic probing, among others. Nevertheless, finding the optimal online policy can be PSPACE-hard in certain combinatorial settings (e.g., matchings (Papadimitriou et al. 2021)). Additional research explores how knowledge of the order impacts performance versus optimal online policy (Niazadeh et al. 2018, Ezra et al. 2022b, Feng et al. 2024, Braverman et al. 2025, Braun et al. 2024).

Solving the Differential Equation \n\nGiven parameters $f>0$ and $\\theta \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$, let us denote $k_{1}=c_{f}=\\frac{f}{1+f}$.

Hence the one-sided derivatives are not equal, $y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right) \\neq y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)$ and $y(t)$ is not differentiable at $t=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$. More generally, $y(t)$ is not going to be differentiable at points in the form $r_{1}=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}, r_{2}=y\\left(r_{1}\\right), r_{3}=y\\left(r_{2}\\right)$, etc. At these points, we can interpret (EC.2) as holding for the left and right derivatives separately; this is implied by taking a one-sided limit in the equation (EC.2). This will not cause any substantial issues but we need to keep in mind that the derivative changes discontinuously at these points.\n\nSince the differential equation is in the form above, where $y^{\\prime}(y(t))$ depends only on $y(t)$ and $y^{\\prime}(t)$, and not on the value $y(y(t))$, we can write the solution (at least on some interval) explicitly as an integral. As above, let $r_{0}=1$ and $r_{1}=y\\left(r_{0}\\right)=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$. For $t \\in\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right]$, we are given the initial segment\n\n$$\ny(t)=1+c_{f}-\\frac{1}{\\theta}+\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}\n$$\n\nand we can also write\n\n$$\ny(y(t))=y\\left(r_{1}\\right)-\\int_{y(t)}^{r_{1}} y^{\\prime}(x) d x=r_{2}-\\int_{t}^{r_{0}} y^{\\prime}(y(x)) y^{\\prime}(x) d x\n$$\n\nwhich determines $y(t)$ for $t \\in\\left[r_{2}, r_{1}\\right]$ where $r_{2}=y\\left(r_{1}\\right)$. Note that the integrand is provided by the differential equation (EC.2):\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(y(x)) y^{\\prime}(x)=\\frac{y(x)-c_{f}}{x-c_{f}}\\left(2 y^{\\prime}(x)-\\frac{y(x)}{x-c_{f}}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $x \\in\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right]$ hence $y(x)$ and $y^{\\prime}(x)$ is given explicitly by (EC.1) and we can calculate $y(y(t))$.\nInductively, as long as $y(t)$ is increasing and differentiable for $t \\in\\left(r_{k+1}, r_{k}\\right)$, we define $r_{k+2}=y\\left(r_{k+1}\\right)<$ $y\\left(r_{k}\\right)=r_{k+1}$ and\n\n$$\ny(y(t))=r_{k+2}-\\int_{t}^{r_{k}} \\frac{y(x)-c_{f}}{x-c_{f}}\\left(2 y^{\\prime}(x)-\\frac{y(x)}{x-c_{f}}\\right) d x\n$$\n\nfor $t \\in\\left[r_{k+1}, r_{k}\\right]$, which defines $y(t)$ for $t \\in\\left[r_{k+2}, r_{k+1}\\right]$. We can continue inductively (going backwards in terms of $t$ ) as long as $y(t)$ is increasing and $y(t) \\geq c_{f}$.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure EC. 1 Different possible outcomes of the construction, for different values of $\\theta$\n\nClassification of outcomes. Depending on the choice of $\\theta$, this process could terminate in several possible ways:\n\n- The solution $y(t)$ is defined for all $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, such that $y\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0, y(t)$ is continuous and increasing on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, and there is a finite sequence of \"breakpoints\" $1=r_{0}>r_{1}>r_{2}>\\ldots>r_{n}$, such that $r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)$, $r_{n}<c_{f}$.\n- The solution is not in the form above, i.e. either it can be defined for $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ but not in a continuous increasing way, or $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)>0$, or the solution breaks down at some point and cannot be extended to $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nThere are several reasons why the solution might break down: At some point, we might obtain $y^{\\prime}(t)=0$ (note that we divide by $y^{\\prime}(t)$ in the differential equation). Or possibly, there is an infinite sequence of breakpoints $r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)<r_{i}$ which never reaches $r_{n}<c_{f}$. At this point we do not aim to classify the reasons why the solution might break down; all these cases are considered a failure.\n\nThe first case is what we call a \"complete successful solution\". As we prove later, this means that there is an algorithm for the buyback problem achieving a factor of $\\theta$.\n\nDefinition 1. We call $y(t)$ a complete successful solution, if $y(t)$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, with $y\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0$, satisfying (EC.1) for $t \\in\\left[2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}, 1\\right]$ and (EC.2) whenever $y(t) \\geq c_{f}$, except for a finite number $n$ of breakpoints $r_{0}=1, r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)<r_{i}$ such that $r_{n}<c_{f}$.\n\nA formally weaker notion (which we show in fact to be equivalent), is the following.\n\nDefinition 2.

{"section_id": 20, "text": "# EC.2.1. Characterization of successful solutions \n\nThe key lemmas that help us distinguish between success and failure are the following.\nLemma EC.1. Let $\\theta \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$ be such that on every interval $\\left[t_{1}, 1\\right]$ where the solution $y(t)$ can be defined, if $y^{\\prime}(t)$ is defined then\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}\n$$\n\nThen $y(t)$ can be defined on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ so that it is a complete successful solution. In particular, the recurrence $r_{0}=1, r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)$ reaches $r_{n} \\leq c_{f}$ in $n \\leq 1+\\frac{1}{f}$ steps.\n\nWe note that we always have $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ on the initial segment, $t \\in\\left(r_{1}, r_{0}\\right)$, because\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)-y(t)=\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}-1-c_{f}+\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\geq-\\frac{1+2 f}{1+f}+\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nSo the assumption is always satisfied at least for $t_{1}=r_{1}=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$. However, the solution can be typically extended to $t<t_{1}$, and that's where the assumption plays a non-trivial role.\nProof of Lemma EC.1. Let us inductively define a solution $y(t)$, starting from the initial segment $\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right]$ where $r_{0}=1, r_{1}=y(1)=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$. If $2-\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\leq c_{f}$, we are done since the initial segment already covers the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ and we have a complete successful solution. (This happens for $f \\geq 1$ and $\\theta=\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$.)\n\nOtherwise, as long as $y(t)$ satisfies $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ on an interval $\\left(r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right), r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)>c_{f}$, we can use the differential equation (EC.2) to extend the solution to another interval $\\left[r_{i+2}, r_{i+1}\\right]$, where $r_{i+2}=y\\left(r_{i+1}\\right)$. Note that the assumption together with (EC.2) implies that $y^{\\prime}(y(t)) \\geq \\frac{y(t)-c_{f}}{t-c_{f}}>0$, so for $y(t)>c_{f}$ we obtain $y^{\\prime}(y(t))>0$, and the function is strictly increasing. By induction, we can continue this process and define $y(t)$ on $\\left[r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right]$ as long as $r_{i}>c_{f}$.\n\nInductively, we prove furthermore that $\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ is non-decreasing in $t$, as long as $t>c_{f}$. On each interval $\\left(r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right)$, we can differentiate with respect to $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}\\right)=\\frac{y^{\\prime}(t)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)-y(t)}{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nby assumption. Therefore $\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ is non-decreasing for every $t>c_{f}$ where the solution can be defined. In particular, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}} \\leq \\frac{y(1)}{1-c_{f}}=(1+f)\\left(2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right) \\leq 1\n$$\n\nusing the assumption $\\theta \\leq \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ in the last inequality. Therefore, for every $t$ where the solution can be defined, we have $y(t) \\leq t-c_{f}$. In at most $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1}{c_{f}}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+f}{f}\\right\\rfloor$ steps, we reach a point $r_{n} \\leq c_{f}$ and we terminate. The union\n\nof intervals $\\left[r_{n}, r_{n-1}\\right], \\ldots,\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right]$ covers $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ and hence the solution is well-defined and strictly increasing on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nFinally, we prove that $y\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0$ : If $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)>0$, then by continuity of $y(t), \\lim _{t \\rightarrow c_{f}}, \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}=+\\infty$. However, this contradicts the fact that $\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ is non-decreasing for $t>c_{f}$.\n\nIn other words, if we try to extend the solution as far as possible, then the solution can fail only if at some point, $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$.\n\nThe next lemma shows a converse to this in some sense: If a solution is successful, then it must indeed satisfy $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$, otherwise if at some point we obtain $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$, then the solution fails because the curve at this point is aiming for a value $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)>0$ and cannot reach $y\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0$ anymore. This is essentially because if $y(t)$ is successful, then it must be convex, as the lemma also states. This will be crucial in the analysis.\n\nLemma EC.2. If $y(t)$ is a successful solution on $\\left[t_{0}, 1\\right], t_{0} \\geq c_{f}$, then $y(t)$ can be extended to a complete successful solution on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, which is moreover convex, satisfies $y(t)<t$ for all $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, and\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}\n$$\n\nfor all $t \\in\\left(c_{f}, 1\\right)$ where $y(t)>0$ and $y^{\\prime}(t)$ exists.\nNote that this lemma implies that a successful solution for $\\theta$ exists if and only if a complete successful solution exists; the notions only differ in the domain where $y(t)$ is defined.\n\nThe proof of Lemma EC. 2 is more involved.

Then $y(t)$ is convex for $t \\in\\left[t_{1}, 1\\right]$.\nProof. Consider $r_{0}=1$ and $r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right)$ as before (for $i=1, \\ldots, k+1$ such that $r_{n-1} \\geq t_{1}, r_{n}=y\\left(r_{n-1}\\right)<t_{1}$ ). We proceed by induction on $k$, proving that $y(t)$ is convex on each interval $\\left[r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right]$, and also the one-sided derivatives at $r_{i}$ satisfy $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i}\\right) \\leq y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i}\\right)$.\n\nThe initial segment is\n\n$$\ny(t)=1-\\frac{1}{\\theta}+c_{f}+\\frac{\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}\n$$\n\non $\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right]$ which is a convex function. We have $y(1)=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$ and $y^{\\prime}(1)=2$.\nLet us first consider the case where $2-\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\leq c_{f}$. In this case, the initial segment covers the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ and hence there is no need to solve the differential equation. The conclusion that $y(t)$ is convex is satisfied trivially for $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nIn the following, we can assume that $2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}>c_{f}$. The right derivative at $r_{1}=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}$ is:\n\n$$\ny_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)=\\frac{2\\left(r_{1}-c_{f}\\right)}{1-c_{f}}=\\frac{2\\left(2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}-c_{f}\\right)}{1-c_{f}}>0\n$$\n\nwhile the left derivative $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow r_{1}^{-}} y^{\\prime}(t)$ is given by the differential equation:\n\n$$\ny_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)=y_{-}^{\\prime}(y(1))=\\frac{y(1)-c_{f}}{1-c_{f}}\\left(2-\\frac{y(1)}{y^{\\prime}(1)\\left(1-c_{f}\\right)}\\right)=\\frac{2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}-c_{f}}{1-c_{f}}\\left(2-\\frac{2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}}{2\\left(1-c_{f}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nComparing the expressions for $y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)$ and $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)$, since $2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}>c_{f}$, we have $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\leq y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{1}\\right)$.\nNow we proceed by induction, using the differential equation and Proposition EC.3. We assume that $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq$ $\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ on the interval $\\left[t_{2}, 1\\right]$. This implies that $y(t)$ is strictly increasing, the sequence of points $r_{0}>r_{1}>r_{2}>\\ldots$\n\nis well-defined, and assuming inductively that $y^{\\prime \\prime}(t) \\geq 0$ on the interval $\\left(r_{i}, r_{i-1}\\right)$, we also get $y^{\\prime \\prime}(t) \\geq 0$ on $\\left(r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right)$ from Proposition EC.3. Since the sequence of breakpoints reaches $r_{n}<t_{1}$ after a finite number of iterations, this implies that $y^{\\prime \\prime}(t) \\geq 0$ for all $t \\geq t_{1}$ except for the breakpoints $r_{i}$ (note that Proposition EC. 3 applies to the second derivative at $y(t)$, given the assumptions at $t$ ).\n\nHence $y^{\\prime \\prime}(t) \\geq 0$ at each point of $\\left(t_{1}, 1\\right)$ except for the points $r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots$ where $y$ is not differentiable. Here we need to check the one-sided derivatives: By induction, $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i}\\right) \\leq y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i}\\right)$, using the differential equation and the inductive hypothesis that $y_{-}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i-1}\\right) \\leq y_{+}^{\\prime}\\left(r_{i-1}\\right)$. Therefore, $y(t)$ is convex on $\\left[t_{1}, 1\\right]$.\n\nFinally, we can prove Lemma EC.2.\nProof of Lemma EC.2. Suppose $y(t)$ is a solution on an interval $\\left[t_{0}, 1\\right]$ such that $y\\left(t_{0}\\right) \\leq 0, y(t)$ is continuously increasing on $\\left[t_{0}, 1\\right]$, with a finite number of breakpoints $r_{0}=1, r_{1}=y\\left(r_{0}\\right), r_{i+1}=y\\left(r_{i}\\right), r_{n}<t_{0}$. Suppose for a contradiction that $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for some $t \\in\\left(t_{0}, 1\\right)$ where $y(t)>0$. Let\n\n$$\nt_{2}=\\sup \\left\\{t \\in\\left(t_{0}, 1\\right): y(t)>0, y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for all $t \\in\\left(t_{2}, 1\\right]$, wherever $y^{\\prime}(t)$ is defined, we obtain from Proposition EC. 4 that $y(t)$ is convex on $\\left[t_{1}, 1\\right]$ where $t_{1}=\\max \\left\\{t_{0}, y\\left(t_{2}\\right)\\right\\}$, and in particular $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y\\left(t_{2}\\right)}{t_{2}-c_{f}}$ for $t \\in\\left(t_{1}, t_{2}\\right)$ wherever $y$ is differentiable. Furthermore, for every $t \\in\\left(t_{1}, t_{2}\\right)$, if $y(t) \\geq t_{0}$ and $y^{\\prime}(t)$ is defined, we have $y^{\\prime}(y(t)) \\leq y^{\\prime}(t)$ by Proposition EC. 2 (here we need the fact that $y^{\\prime}(t)>0$ ). By induction, since $y\\left(y\\left(\\ldots\\left(t_{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)$ reaches a value $\\leq t_{0}$ in a finite number of steps, we have $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y\\left(t_{2}\\right)}{t_{2}-c_{f}}$ for all $t \\in\\left(t_{0}, t_{2}\\right)$ where $y$ is differentiable (which is all but finitely many points). By integration, $y\\left(t_{2}\\right)-y\\left(t_{0}\\right)=\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{2}} y^{\\prime}(t) d t<\\left(t_{2}-t_{0}\\right) \\frac{y\\left(t_{2}\\right)}{t_{2}-c_{f}} \\leq y\\left(t_{2}\\right)$, which means $y\\left(t_{0}\\right)>0$, a contradiction.\n\nThus we conclude that $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for every $t \\in\\left(t_{0}, 1\\right)$ where $y(t)>0$ and $y$ is differentiable. This also implies that we can extend $y(t)$ to the interval $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ by solving the differential equation for $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, t_{0}\\right]$; the condition $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ implies that $y(t)$ is still going to be strictly increasing for $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, t_{0}\\right]$. Hence, $y(t)$ is strictly increasing on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nFurther, Proposition EC. 4 in this case implies that $y(t)$ is convex on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ : Assume that $y\\left(t_{2}\\right)=c_{f}$ for some $t_{2} \\in\\left(c_{f}, 1\\right]$ (if not, then $y(1)<c_{f}$, which means that $y(t)$ on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ is defined by the initial segment, which we know to be convex). Then we apply Proposition EC. 4 with this value of $t_{2}$ and $t_{1}=y\\left(t_{2}\\right)=c_{f}$ : We have $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for all $t \\in\\left[t_{2}, 1\\right]$ where $y$ is differentiable, and therefore $y(t)$ is convex on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.\n\nFinally, Proposition EC. 1 implies that $y(t)<t$ for all $t \\in\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 22, "text": "# EC.2.3.

To prove this, we parameterize the solution in a different way: We introduce a variable $x$\n\nsuch that the interval $[0,1]$ corresponds to the initial segment $\\left[r_{1}, r_{0}\\right],[1,2]$ corresponds to the next segment $\\left[r_{2}, r_{1}\\right]$, etc. Formally, the relationship between the variables $x$ and $t$ is\n\n- $t(x)=1-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right) x$ for $x \\in[0,1]$,\n- $t(x)=y(t(x-1))$ for $x>1$.\n(We caution the reader that in the following, $t(\\cdots)$ denotes a function rather than multiplication of $t$ and $(\\cdots)$.)\nNote that while $y(t)$ is increasing in a successful solution, $t(x)$ should be decreasing: On the initial segment $[0,1]$, we have $t^{\\prime}(x)=-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right)<0$ by definition, and as long as $y^{\\prime}(t(x))>0$, we have $t^{\\prime}(x+1)=$ $y^{\\prime}(t(x)) t^{\\prime}(x)<0$ by induction.\n\nOur problem can now be formulated as follows: (using the identities $t(x+1)=y(t(x)), t(x+2)=y(y(t(x))$, $\\left.t^{\\prime}(x+1)=y^{\\prime}(t(x)) t^{\\prime}(x), t^{\\prime}(x+2)=y^{\\prime}(y(t(x))) t^{\\prime}(x+1)\\right)$ :\n\n- Initial parameterization: $t(x)=1-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right) x$ for $x \\in[0,1]$,\n- Initial function segment: $t(x+1)=y(t(x))=1-\\frac{1}{\\theta}+c_{f}+\\frac{\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right) x-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}{1-c_{f}}$ for $x \\in[0,1]$,\n- Differential equation: for $x>0$,\n\n$$\nt^{\\prime}(x+2)=\\frac{t(x+1)-c_{f}}{t(x)-c_{f}}\\left(2 t^{\\prime}(x+1)-\\frac{t(x+1)}{t(x)-c_{f}} t^{\\prime}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nConversely, given $t(x)$, we can reconstruct $y(t)$ as follows: Assuming that $t(x)$ is strictly decreasing on $[0, \\xi-1]$, if $t_{1} \\in[t(\\xi-1), 1]$ then there is a unique point $x_{1} \\in[0, \\xi-1]$ such that $t\\left(x_{1}\\right)=t_{1}$.

We call a solution $t(x)$ for $x \\in[0, \\xi]$ strongly monotonic, if there is $\\alpha>0$ such that for all $x \\in(0, \\xi) \\backslash \\mathbb{Z}, t^{\\prime}(x) \\leq-\\alpha$.\n\nStrong monotonicity of $t(x)$ is implied by a similar property for $y(t)$, as the following statement shows.\nProposition EC.5.

Suppose that $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\beta>0$ everywhere except for the breakpoints; we can assume w.l.o.g. that $\\beta \\in(0,1)$.\nLet $\\xi>0$ be such that $t(x)=y(t(x-1))$ defined as above satisfies $t(\\xi)=y\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ (this construction is valid because we reach $t(\\xi)=y\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ after finitely many breakpoints).

For $x>0$, we have\n\n$$\nt^{\\prime}(x+1)=y^{\\prime}(t(x)) t^{\\prime}(x)\n$$\n\nHence, by induction, assuming that $y^{\\prime}(t(x)) \\geq \\beta$, we obtain $t^{\\prime}(x+1) \\leq \\beta t^{\\prime}(x)$ for every non-integer $x \\in$ $(0, \\xi-1)$. We assumed that $\\beta \\in(0,1)$; so if $n=\\lceil\\xi\\rceil$, we have $t^{\\prime}(x) \\leq-\\beta^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right)<0$. Hence we can set $\\alpha=\\beta^{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta}-1\\right)$.\n\nNow we can prove our stability result for $t(x)$.\nLemma EC.3. Fix $f>0$. Let $\\theta \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ be such that for some $\\alpha, \\xi>0$ the system above has a strongly monotonic solution $t(x)$ defined on $[0, \\xi]$. Then for fixed $f$, the solution depends continuously on $\\theta$ : For any $\\epsilon>0$ there is $\\delta>0$ such that if $|\\tilde{\\theta}-\\theta|<\\delta$, there is a solution $\\tilde{t}(x)$ for parameter $\\tilde{\\theta}$ such that for all $x \\in[0, \\xi],|\\tilde{t}(x)-t(x)|<\\epsilon$ and for all $x \\in(0, \\xi) \\backslash \\mathbb{Z},\\left|\\tilde{t}^{\\prime}(x)-t^{\\prime}(x)\\right|<\\epsilon$. In particular, for any $\\tilde{\\theta}$ sufficiently close to $\\theta$, the solution $\\tilde{t}(x)$ is still strongly monotonic.\n\nProof. We prove inductively that for $x \\in[i, i+1]$, the solution $t(x)$ depends continuously on $\\theta$ : For any $\\epsilon>0$, there is $\\delta_{i}>0$ such that if $|\\tilde{\\theta}-\\theta|<\\delta_{i}, t(x)$ is the solution corresponding to $y^{(\\theta)}(t)$ for parameter $\\theta$, and $\\tilde{t}(x)$ is the solution corresponding to $y^{(\\tilde{\\theta})}(t)$, then $|\\tilde{t}(x)-t(x)|<\\epsilon$ and $\\left|\\tilde{t}^{\\prime}(x)-t^{\\prime}(x)\\right|<\\epsilon$.\n\nFor $x \\in[0,1]$ and $x \\in[1,2]$, we have explicit expressions for which one can verify directly that $t(x)$ and $t^{\\prime}(x)$ behave continuously in $\\theta$, hence the statement is valid in the base case.\n\nFor the inductive step, we appeal to the differential equation (EC.4). By the inductive hypothesis, $t(x), t(x+$ 1), $t^{\\prime}(x)$ and $t^{\\prime}(x+1)$ depend continuously on $\\theta$. We note that as long as $t(x+1) \\geq c_{f}$, we have $t(x) \\geq c_{f}+\\beta$ for some $\\beta>0$. This implies that the behavior is continuous in the denominator of (EC.4). Hence $t^{\\prime}(x+2)$ also depends continuously on $\\theta$ : for every $\\epsilon>0$ there is $\\delta_{i}>0$ such that if $|\\tilde{\\theta}-\\theta|<\\delta_{i}$ then $\\left|\\tilde{t}^{\\prime}(x+2)-t^{\\prime}(x+2)\\right|<\\epsilon$ for non-integer $x$, and by integration also $\\left|\\tilde{t}(x+2)-t(x+2)\\right|<\\epsilon$.

Existence of an optimal solution \n\nOur goal is to prove that there is $\\theta^{*}$ for which there is a complete successful solution with $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$. First, let us prove that is $y^{(\\theta)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)<0$, then $\\theta$ is suboptimal.\n\nLemma EC.4. If $\\theta \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$ is such that there is a complete successful solution for $\\theta$ such that $y^{(\\theta)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)<0$, then there is $\\tilde{\\theta}>\\theta$ for which there is also a successful solution $y^{(\\tilde{\\theta})}(t)$.\n\nProof. Consider a complete successful solution $y(t)$ for parameter $\\theta$, and the corresponding solution $t(x)$ as above. By Lemma EC.2, $y(t)$ is strictly increasing and convex on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, with a positive derivative everywhere except for finitely many breakpoints, and $y\\left(c_{f}\\right)<0$. Pick some point $t_{0}>c_{f}$ such that $y\\left(t_{0}\\right)<0$, and $t_{0}$ is not a breakpoint (which exists by the continuity of $y(t)$ ). We claim that the derivative $y^{\\prime}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ is strictly positive: Again by continuity, there is a point $t_{1} \\in\\left(t_{0}, 1\\right]$ such that $y\\left(t_{1}\\right)=t_{0}>c_{f}$. By Lemma EC.2, we have $y^{\\prime}\\left(t_{1}\\right) \\geq \\frac{y\\left(t_{1}\\right)}{t_{1}-c_{f}}$. The differential equation (EC.2) implies that $y^{\\prime}\\left(y\\left(t_{1}\\right)\\right)=y^{\\prime}\\left(t_{0}\\right)=\\beta>0$. Moreover, $y(t)$ is convex for $t \\in\\left[t_{0}, 1\\right]$, so wherever the derivative is defined for $t \\geq t_{0}$, we have $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\beta$.\n\nBy Proposition EC.5, this means that $t(x)$ is strongly monotonic on $[0, \\xi]$, where $t(\\xi-1)=t_{0}$ and $t(\\xi)=$ $y\\left(t_{0}\\right)<0$. I.e., $t^{\\prime}(x) \\leq-\\alpha<0$ for all $x \\in(0, \\xi)$ where $t^{\\prime}(x)$ is defined. By Lemma EC.3, for any $\\epsilon>0$, for $\\tilde{\\theta}$\n\nsufficiently close to $\\theta$, we obtain a solution $\\tilde{t}(x)$ such that $\\left|\\tilde{t}(x)-t(x)\\right|<\\epsilon$ and $\\left|\\tilde{t}^{*}(x)-t^{\\prime}(x)\\right|<\\epsilon$ wherever defined. In particular, for $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{2} \\min \\left\\{\\alpha,|t(\\xi)|, t_{0}-c_{f}\\right\\}, \\tilde{t}(x)$ is still strongly monotonic.\n\nTranslating back to the formalism of $y(t)$, we obtain a solution $\\tilde{y}(t)$ defined on $\\left[\\tilde{t}_{0}, 1\\right]$ where $\\tilde{t}_{0}=\\tilde{t}(\\xi-1) \\geq$ $t_{0}-\\epsilon>c_{f}$, and $y\\left(\\tilde{t}_{0}\\right)=\\tilde{t}(\\xi) \\leq t(\\xi)+\\epsilon<0$. Hence, this solution is successful.\n\nWe prove next that if $\\theta^{*}$ is a limit point of values $\\theta$ for which a successful solution exists, then it also exists for $\\theta^{*}$.\n\nLemma EC.5. If $\\theta^{*} \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$ is such that for every $\\delta>0$, there is $\\theta \\in\\left(\\theta^{*}-\\delta, \\theta^{*}\\right)$ such that $y^{(\\theta)}(t)$ is a successful solution, then $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}(t)$ is a successful solution.\n\nProof. Suppose for a contradiction that $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}(t)$ is not a complete successful solution. However, it is welldefined on the initial segment $\\left[2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}, 1\\right]$, and it satisfies $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$. Therefore, the solution can be extended to $\\left[r_{2}, r_{1}\\right]$, where $r_{1}=2-\\frac{1}{\\theta}, r_{2}=y\\left(r_{1}\\right)$, using the differential equation. As long as $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ on an interval $\\left(r_{i+1}, r_{i}\\right)$, we can use the differential equation to extend the solution to $\\left[r_{i+2}, r_{i+1}\\right]$. However, at some point we obtain $y^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$, otherwise the solution is successful by Lemma EC.1. Let $\\left(r_{k+1}, r_{k}\\right)$ be the first interval on which this happens; this implies that $y^{\\prime}(t) \\geq \\frac{y(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for all $t>r_{k}$, and this in turn implies that $y^{\\prime}(t)>0$ for all $t>r_{k+1}$, using the differential equation.\n\nLet us consider now the corresponding function $t(x)$ defined on $[0, k]$, such that $t(k)=r_{k}$, and $y(t(x))=$ $t(x+1)$ for all $x \\in[0, k]$. By Proposition EC.5, $t(x)$ is strongly monotonic. Therefore, by Lemma EC.3, the solution $\\tilde{t}(x)$ for $\\tilde{\\theta}$ sufficiently close to $\\theta$ is still strongly monotonic and arbitrarily close to $t(x)$. Hence, the corresponding solution $\\tilde{y}(t)$ still satisfies $\\tilde{y}^{\\prime}(t)<\\frac{\\tilde{y}(t)}{t-c_{f}}$ for some $t>c_{f}$ and hence it cannot be successful by Lemma EC.2. So there exists $\\delta>0$ such that no solution corresponding to $\\theta \\in\\left(\\theta^{*}-\\delta, \\theta^{*}\\right)$ is successful, which is a contradiction with the assumptions of the lemma.\n\nFinally, we can prove that there exists $\\theta^{*}$ such that there is a complete successful solution with $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$, which implies our optimal algorithm.\n\nTheorem EC.1. For every $f>0$, there exists $\\theta^{*} \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$ such that there is a complete successful solution $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}(t)$ on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$ such that $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$.\n\nProof. Given $f>0$, define $S \\subseteq\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ to be the set of values $\\theta$ such that there is a successful solution $y^{(\\theta)}(t)$. This set is nonempty, because for every $f>0$, a successful solution exists for $\\theta=1 / 2$. Also, $\\theta \\leq \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$ for every $\\theta \\in S$, because we know that a successful solution cannot exist for $\\theta>\\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}$. In particular, $S$ is bounded away from 1 .\n\nConsider $\\theta^{*}=\\sup S$. By the above, we have $\\theta^{*} \\in\\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1+f}{1+2 f}\\right]$. We claim that $\\theta^{*} \\in S$ : If $\\theta^{*} \\notin S$, then for every $\\delta>0$, there is $\\theta \\in\\left(\\theta^{*}-\\delta, \\theta^{*}\\right), \\theta \\in S$, i.e. there is a successful solution for $\\theta$. By Lemma EC.5, there is also a successful solution for $\\theta^{*}$, hence $\\theta^{*} \\in S$.\n\nBy Lemma EC.2, we can assume that $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}(t)$ is a complete successful solution on $\\left[c_{f}, 1\\right]$, which means $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right) \\leq 0$. Let us assume for a contradiction that $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)<0$. Then by Lemma EC.4, there exists $\\theta^{\\prime}>\\theta^{*}$ such that there is also a successful solution for $\\theta^{\\prime}$. But this means that $\\theta^{\\prime} \\in S$ which contradicts $\\theta^{*}=\\sup S$.\n\nHence we have a complete successful solution for $\\theta^{*}$ such that $y^{\\left(\\theta^{*}\\right)}\\left(c_{f}\\right)=0$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 24, "text": "# EC.3. Omitted Proofs\n## EC.3.1. Proof of Lemma 1\n\nWe prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose that there exists an instance with distributions $\\mathcal{D}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{n}$, such that the best achievable competitive ratio is strictly less than $\\alpha(f)$; say less than $\\alpha(f)-3 \\delta$ for some $\\delta>0$. We define discrete distributions $\\mathcal{D}_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{D}_{n}^{\\prime}$ as follows: Given $X_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{D}_{i}$ and $X_{\\max }=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq n} X_{i}$, let $M \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]$ and $M^{\\prime} \\triangleq \\inf \\left\\{v: \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_{\\max }-v\\right)_{*}\\right] \\leq \\delta M\\right\\}$. Since $\\lim _{v \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_{\\max }-v\\right)_{*}\\right]=0$, the value $M^{\\prime}$ is well defined. We also define $\\mathcal{V} \\triangleq\\left\\{\\delta(1+\\delta)^{k} M: 0 \\leq k \\leq\\left\\lceil\\log _{1+\\delta} \\frac{M^{\\prime}}{\\delta M}\\right\\rceil\\right\\}$, and $X_{i}^{\\prime} \\triangleq \\min \\left\\{v \\in \\mathcal{V}: v \\geq \\min \\left(X_{i}, M^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\}$; in other words, $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ is obtained by rounding $X_{i}$ up to the nearest value in $\\mathcal{V}$ (and rounding down to $\\max \\left\\{v \\in \\mathcal{V}\\right\\}$ if it is greater than $M^{\\prime}$ ). It is obvious that $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a discrete random variable. Let us denote the distribution of the discrete random variable $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ by $\\mathcal{D}_{i}^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe claim that $X_{\\max }^{\\prime}=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq n} X_{i}^{\\prime}$ does not differ significantly from $X_{\\max }$. On the one hand, capping each variable $X_{i}$ at $\\max \\left\\{v \\in \\mathcal{V}\\right\\}$ decreases $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]$ by at most $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_{\\max }-M^{\\prime}\\right)_{*}\\right] \\leq \\delta M$, or equivalently shrinks $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]$ by a multiplicative factor of $1-\\delta$. On the other hand, rounding up each $X_{i}$ to a value in the form of $\\delta(1+\\delta)^{k} M$ implies that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }^{\\prime}\\right] \\leq(1+\\delta) \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]+\\delta M \\leq(1+2 \\delta) \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]$. We therefore conclude that\n\n$$\n(1+2 \\delta) \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right] \\geq \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }^{\\prime}\\right] \\geq(1-\\delta) \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right]\n$$\n\nAssume now that there is a policy that achieves a competitive ratio of $\\alpha(f)$ for any discretized instance. We further assume that this policy never swaps a held value $x$ with $y$ if $y<(1+f) x$. This is a property of any meaningful policy for the problem; If not satisfied, just consider a modified (and weakly better) policy in this argument that exactly follows the original policy but it does not swap the held value $x$ with the current revealed value $y$ if $y<(1+f) x$. Then we can apply this policy to any instance, with values discretized to $\\mathcal{V}$ as above. Assume that we eventually accept the value $X_{\\tau}^{\\prime}$ and pay the buyback cost $c^{\\prime}$ in the discretized instance, so that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\tau}^{\\prime}-c^{\\prime}\\right] \\geq \\alpha(f) \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }^{\\prime}\\right]$. Therefore, we eventually accept the value $X_{\\tau}$ and pay the buyback cost $c$ in the original instance. Since values were rounded up by at most a factor of $1+\\delta$ and an additive error of $\\delta M$, we have $X_{\\tau}^{\\prime} \\leq(1+\\delta) X_{\\tau}+\\delta M$. The buyback cost in the discretized instance satisfies $c^{\\prime} \\geq c$, because the original values are smaller, except for values above $M^{\\prime}$-but a variable of value above $M^{\\prime}$ will never be bought back in the discretized instance.

Let us attempt to define the behavior of a policy $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ on the instance $I_{2}$ given a policy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ on the instance $I_{1}$.\n\nFirst of all, we let $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ copy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ until the random variables $X_{i+1}$ and $X_{i}$ arrive. Suppose both polices hold value $x$ before observing the variables $X_{i}$ and $X_{i+1}$.\n\nCase 1: In instance $I_{2}$, we observe $X_{i+1}=0$. We proceed to $X_{i}$ and let $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ copy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$. Note the performance of the policy $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ exactly matches the performance of the policy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$.\n\nCase 2: In instance $I_{2}$, we observe $X_{i+1}=v_{i+1}$. In this case, we let $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ simulate what would have happened if $X_{i}$ appeared first. $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ generates a duplicate sample $X_{i}^{\\prime}$, and observes the last acceptance of $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ on $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $X_{i+1}$. If this last accepted value is $v$ (equaling either $v_{i}$ or $v_{i+1}$, or perhaps it equals $x$ signifying that $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ does not accept the values $v_{i}$ or $v_{i+1}$ ), $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ accepts $X_{i+1}$ with probability $\\frac{v-x}{v_{i+1}-x}$. After this decision, $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ ignores $X_{i}$ and proceeds to copy $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ once again, assuming it is holding $v$.\n\nWe claim that this yields a policy which performs at least as well as $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$. To prove this, we couple the instantiation of $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ in $I_{2}$ with $X_{i}$ in $I_{1}$. Then $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ clearly outperforms $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ if the last accepted value $v$ of $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ is either $x$ or $v_{i+1}$, as they obtain exactly the same net reward (including the buyback cost) in the future and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ may only pay an additional buyback cost compared to $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ during processing $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $X_{i+1}$.\n\nThe only non-trivial case is when $X_{i}^{\\prime}=v_{i}, X_{i+1}=v_{i+1}$, and $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ accepts $X_{i}^{\\prime}$ and then rejects $X_{i+1}$. But in this case, after $X_{i}$ and $X_{i+1}, \\mathcal{P}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ hold the same value in expectation, because:\n\n$$\nx \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{v-x}{v_{i+1}-x}\\right)+v_{i+1} \\cdot \\frac{v-x}{v_{i+1}-x}=\\frac{x\\left(v_{i+1}-v\\right)+v_{i+1}(v-x)}{v_{i+1}-x}=v\n$$\n\nSince the expected net reward (including the buyback cost) is linear in the accepted values, the linearity of expectation implies that the expected net reward of $\\mathcal{P}_{2}$ equals the expected net reward of $\\mathcal{P}_{1}$ in this case, both during processing these two random variables and in the future.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 26, "text": "## EC.3.3.

Now define:\n\n$$\n\\forall t \\in(0,1]: \\varphi(t)=\\frac{\\Theta}{(1+f) \\tau(t)-f}\n$$\n\nwith $\\Theta=\\theta_{f}=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}$. Notice that for $t \\in[y(1), 1]$ we have $\\varphi(t)=\\Theta$.\nWe now show that $\\{\\varphi, y\\}$ satisfy all the Properties I-VI. First, Property I, Property II, and Property V are direct consequences of our definition. Now substituting $t$ with $\\tau(t)$ in Diff-EQ we get that for $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, y(1)\\right]$.\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime}(t)=\\frac{t-c_{f}}{\\tau(t)-c_{f}}\\left(2-\\frac{t \\tau^{\\prime}(t)}{\\tau(t)-c_{f}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis equation is also correct for $t \\geq y(1)$ using the boundary condition in Diff-EQ. We use Eq. (EC.5) to establish Property IV and Property VI. Notice that a necessary and sufficient condition to establish these properties is to verify the equation at a boundary value and then demonstrate that the derivative of the left-hand side is equal to the derivative of the right-hand side. For Property IV, notice that for $t=1$ :\n\n$$\n\\Theta=1-(1-y(1)) \\Theta=1-\\int_{y(1)}^{1} \\varphi(s) d s\n$$\n\nDifferentiating both sides of Property IV for $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$, we must prove:\n\n$$\nt \\varphi^{\\prime}(t)+\\varphi(t)=-\\varphi(t)+\\varphi(y(t)) y^{\\prime}(t)\n$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{t \\tau^{\\prime}(t)}{(1+f)\\left(\\tau(t)-c_{f}\\right)^{2}}+\\frac{1}{(1+f)\\left(\\tau(t)-c_{f}\\right)}=-\\frac{1}{(1+f)\\left(\\tau(t)-c_{f}\\right)}+\\frac{y^{\\prime}(t)}{(1+f)\\left(t-c_{f}\\right)}\n$$\n\nbut this is simply a rearrangement of Eq. (EC.5). To show Property VI, for $s \\geq k_{1}$, we now know that\n\n$$\ns \\varphi^{\\prime}(s)+\\varphi(s)=-\\varphi(s)+\\varphi(y(s)) y^{\\prime}(s) \\Rightarrow s^{2} \\varphi^{\\prime}(s)+2 s \\varphi(s)=s \\varphi(y(s)) y^{\\prime}(s)\n$$\n\nUsing this equation, we have that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(s^{2} \\varphi(s)\\right)=s^{2} \\varphi^{\\prime}(s)+2 s \\varphi(s)=s \\varphi(y(s)) y^{\\prime}(s)=\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(\\int_{0}^{y(t)} \\varphi(s) \\tau(s) d s\\right)\n$$\n\nIntegrating both sides from $k_{1}$ to $t$ implies Property VI.\nFinally, we would like to establish Property III, that is, we want to prove for $t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{t \\Theta}{(1+f)\\left(\\tau(t)-c_{f}\\right)} \\leq 1-\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\Theta}{(1+f)\\left(\\tau(s)-c_{f}\\right)} d s\n$$\n\nBut notice that right-hand-side is decreasing in $t$ and the left-hand-side is increasing in $t$ by Theorem 1. Thus the gap is decreasing and proving the inequality for all $t$ reduces to proving it for $k_{1}$. However, we have already proved that both sides are equal for $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$, which completes the proof of Property III.\n\nCorollary EC.1. We have established a stronger result than (Property III): not only is $1-\\int_{0}^{t} \\varphi(s) d s-$ $t \\varphi(t)$ always positive in $t \\in\\left[0, k_{1}\\right]$, but it is also decreasing in that interval and equals zero at $t=k_{1}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 29, "text": "# EC.3.6. Proof of Proposition 4 \n\nRecall the definition of $\\tau(t)=y^{-1}(t)$ (which is well-defined because of Property I). First, we would like to propose assignment for the functions $g$ and $h$ in terms of $\\varphi$ and $y$. To discover these assignments, we argue informally using our interpretation of the problem from Section 2.3:\n\n- Clearly, $g(s, t)=0$ whenever $t \\leq \\tau(s)$. For $t>\\tau(s)$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(s, t) d s d t & =\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\text { Algorithm } 1 \\text { selects } t \\text { while holding } s \\mid t \\text { is non-zero }\\right] \\frac{d t}{t} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\left(\\text { Algorithm } 1 \\text { selects } s\\right) \\cap\\{\\text { all } r \\in[\\tau(s), t) \\text { are zero }\\}\\right] \\frac{d t}{t} \\\\\n& =\\varphi(s) d s \\frac{\\tau(s)}{t} \\frac{d t}{t}=\\frac{\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)}{t^{2}} d s d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, the third equality holds because the probability that all $r \\in[\\tau(s), 1)$ are zero $(\\equiv \\tau(s))$ is equal to the probability that all $r \\in[t, 1)$ are zero $(\\equiv t)$, times the probability that all $r \\in[\\tau(s), t)$ are zero. Therefore:\n\n$$\ng(s, t)= \\begin{cases}0 & t \\leq \\tau(s) \\\\ \\frac{\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)}{t^{2}} & t>\\tau(s)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n- Furthermore, for $t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$, we clearly have $h(t)=\\varphi(t)$. For $t \\in\\left(k_{1}, 1\\right]$ similar to above we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(t) d t & =\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\text { Algorithm } 1 \\text { selects } t \\text { as its first pick } \\mid t \\text { is non-zero }\\right] \\frac{d t}{t} \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\text { Algorithm } 1 \\text { picks nothing in }\\left(0, k_{1}\\right] \\cap\\left(\\text { all } s \\in\\left[k_{1}, t\\right) \\text { are zero }\\right)\\right] \\frac{d t}{t} \\\\\n& =\\left(1-\\int_{0}^{k_{1}} \\varphi(s) d s\\right) \\frac{k_{1}}{t} \\frac{d t}{t}=\\frac{k_{1}^{2}}{t^{2}} d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe final equality uses Property IV with $t=k_{1}$. Combining the two cases yields:\n\n$$\nh(t)= \\begin{cases}\\varphi(t) & t \\leq k_{1} \\\\ \\frac{k_{1}^{2} \\varphi\\left(k_{1}\\right)}{t^{2}} & t>k_{1}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBefore we verify that these functions $h$ and $g$ form a feasible solution for Dual-Cont-LP, we start by noticing that for all $t \\in\\left(0, k_{1}\\right]$ we have $h(s)=\\varphi(s)$ by construction. Moreover, for any $t \\in\\left[k_{1}, 1\\right]$,\n\n$$\nh(t)+\\int_{0}^{t} g(s, t) d s=\\frac{k_{1}^{2} \\varphi\\left(k_{1}\\right)}{t^{2}}+\\int_{0}^{y(t)} \\frac{\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)}{t^{2}} d s=\\varphi(t)\n$$\n\nwhere the last equality holds because of Property VI. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\varphi(t)=h(t)+\\int_{0}^{t} g(s, t) d s, \\quad \\forall t \\in(0,1]\n$$\n\nFurthermore, by integrating $g(s, \\cdot)$ from $s$ to $t$, we have $\\int_{s}^{t} g(s, r) d r=0$ when $t \\leq \\tau(s)$. For $t>\\tau(s)$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{s}^{t} g(s, r) d r=\\int_{\\tau(s)}^{t} \\frac{\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)}{r^{2}} d r=\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau(s)}-\\frac{1}{t}\\right)=\\varphi(s)\\left(1-\\frac{\\tau(s)}{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore we conclude that:\n\n$$\n\\int_{s}^{t} g(s, r) d r= \\begin{cases}0 & t \\leq \\tau(s) \\\\ \\varphi(s)\\left(1-\\frac{\\tau(s)}{t}\\right) & t>\\tau(s)\\end{cases}, \\quad \\forall 0<s \\leq t \\leq 1\n$$\n\nNow, we will verify that the above solution fulfills each inequality in Dual-Cont-LP individually. Specifically, we will show (A), (B), and (C).\n\nTo show (A), we consider two case. First, notice that the inequality is true for $t \\leq k_{1}$ by Property III. Second, the inequality for $t \\geq k_{1}$ follows since the derivative of both sides is equal to $-\\frac{\\varphi\\left(k_{1}\\right) k_{1}^{2}}{t^{2}}=-h(t)$ for $t>k_{1}$, and that at $t=k_{1}$ both sides are equal because:\n\n$$\nk_{1} h\\left(k_{1}\\right)=k_{1} \\varphi\\left(k_{1}\\right)=1-\\int_{0}^{k_{1}} \\varphi(s) d s=1-\\int_{0}^{k_{1}} h(s) d s\n$$\n\nwhich holds due to Property IV and the fact that $y\\left(k_{1}\\right)=0$.\nTo show (B), we also consider two cases. If $t \\leq \\tau(s)$ the left hand side is 0 and the right hand side has only positive terms therefore is positive. For $t>\\tau(s)$, using (EC.8) and (EC.9), we have:\n\n$$\nh(s)+\\int_{0}^{s} g(r, s) d r-\\int_{s}^{t} g(s, r) d r=\\varphi(s)-\\varphi(s)\\left(1-\\frac{\\tau(s)}{t}\\right)=t \\frac{\\varphi(s) \\tau(s)}{t^{2}}=\\operatorname{tg}(s, t)\n$$\n\nand therefore the two sides of (B) are indeed equal.\nFinally, to show (C), by using (EC.8) and (EC.9) we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(s)+\\int_{0}^{s} g(r, s) d r-(1+f) \\int_{s}^{1} g(s, r) d r & =\\varphi(s)-(1+f) \\varphi(s)(1-\\tau(s)) \\\\\n& =(1+f) \\varphi(s)\\left(\\tau(s)-c_{f}\\right)=\\Theta=\\frac{1}{2-y(1)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last two equalities we use Property V.

If $S^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{j}^{\\prime} \\geq T\\right)$, for independent random variables $X_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, X_{n}^{\\prime}$, and $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\forall j ; X_{j}^{\\prime}<T\\right]=$ $e^{-\\lambda}$, then $S^{\\prime}$ is stochastically dominated by a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda$. In particular, for any $\\ell \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[S^{\\prime} \\leq \\ell\\right] \\geq e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\ell} \\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{k!}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $p_{i}=\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{i}^{\\prime} \\geq T\\right]$, and let $Y_{i}$ be a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda_{i}=-\\log \\left(1-p_{i}\\right)$, where $Y_{i}=0$ whenever $X_{i}^{\\prime}<T$. (Note that $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[Y_{i}=0\\right]=e^{-\\lambda_{i}}=1-p_{i}=\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{i}^{\\prime}<T\\right]$.) Hence, $Y_{i} \\geq \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{i}^{\\prime} \\geq T\\right)$, and $S^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{j}^{\\prime} \\geq T\\right) \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{j}$ with probability 1 . Finally, note that $Y=\\sum_{j=1}^{n} Y_{j}$ is also a Poisson random variable, with mean $\\lambda=-\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\log \\left(1-p_{j}\\right)=-\\log \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1-p_{j}\\right)=-\\log \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\forall j ; X_{j}^{\\prime}<T\\right]$.\n\nEC.5.2.2. Analysis for small buyback factors Consider now the case of small $f$ (e.g. $f \\in(0,1 / 2)$ ). We can use Lemmas EC. 7 and EC. 8 to get a good bound on the algorithm's performance in this regime. We note that this bound beats the optimal randomized algorithm for the buyback problem with no information, for all $f$ (Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg 2009). ${ }^{13}$\n\nTHEOREM EC.3. There is an algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio of at least\n\n$$\n\\max _{0 \\leq x \\leq 1} \\frac{(1-x) \\cdot x^{\\frac{f}{1+f}}}{1-x+x^{\\frac{2 f+1}{f+1}}} \\geq \\frac{1}{\\frac{f}{1+f}+\\left(2+\\frac{1}{f}\\right)^{\\frac{f}{1+f}}}\n$$\n\nWe remark that the last expression in the theorem follows from plugging in $x=\\frac{f}{1+2 f}$. For $f \\in\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, it is easy to see that this is $1-\\Theta\\left(f \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\right)\\right)$, indeed, $\\left(2+\\frac{1}{f}\\right)^{\\frac{f}{1+f}}<\\left(\\frac{2}{f}\\right)^{f}=e^{f \\ln \\frac{2}{f}}<1+2 f \\ln \\frac{2}{f}$, so the competitive ratio is at least $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1+f}+1+2 f \\ln \\frac{2}{f}}>\\frac{1}{1+2 f \\ln \\frac{2}{f}}>1-2 f \\ln \\frac{4}{f}$.\nProof. From Lemmas EC. 7 and EC.8, we get: If $Z$ is a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda$ (with $e^{-\\lambda}=$ $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max }<T\\right]$ ), and $0 \\leq A \\leq 1$ is any random variable (possibly correlated with $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ ), then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[A L G] & \\geq T \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{X_{\\max }}{(1+f)^{S^{\\prime}}}-T\\right)_{+}\\right] \\\\\n& \\geq T \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[A \\cdot\\left(\\frac{X_{\\max }}{(1+f)^{Z}}-T\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =T \\cdot\\left(\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right]-\\mathbb{E}[A]\\right)+\\mathbb{E}\\left[A \\cdot \\frac{X_{\\max }}{(1+f)^{Z}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right]=1-e^{-\\lambda}$. Now, take $A=c \\cdot \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right)$ to get that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[A L G] & \\geq T \\cdot\\left(\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right]-\\mathbb{E}[A]\\right)+\\mathbb{E}\\left[A \\cdot \\frac{X_{\\max }}{(1+f)^{Z}}\\right] \\\\\n& =T\\left(1-e^{-\\lambda}\\right)(1-c)+c \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{(1+f)^{Z}}\\right] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max } \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =T\\left(1-e^{-\\lambda}\\right)(1-c)+c e^{\\frac{-\\lambda f}{1+f}} \\cdot \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max } \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{(1+f)^{Z}}\\right]=e^{\\frac{-\\lambda f}{1+f}}$ follows from an elementary computation for the Poisson random variable $Z$. Since\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max }\\right] \\leq T \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[X_{\\max }<T\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max } \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right)\\right]=T e^{-\\lambda}+\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{\\max } \\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\n${ }^{13}$ The bound presented here is worse than the classical prophet inequality when $f \\rightarrow \\infty$ (in which case our bound tends to $1 / 3$ ) as we are aiming primarily to match the asymptotic upper bound of $1-\\Theta\\left(f \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\right)\\right)$ we obtained earlier.\n\nsetting\n\n$$\n\\left(1-e^{-\\lambda}\\right)(1-c)=c e^{\\frac{-\\lambda f}{1+f}} e^{-\\lambda}\n$$\n\nguarantees a competitive ratio of $c e^{\\frac{-\\lambda f}{1+f}}$. Letting $x=e^{-\\lambda}$, and solving for $c$, we get\n\n$$\nc=\\frac{1-x}{1-x+x^{\\frac{2 f+1}{f+1}}}\n$$\n\nwhich means we are guaranteed a competitive ratio of\n\n$$\n\\max _{0 \\leq x \\leq 1} \\frac{(1-x) \\cdot x^{\\frac{f}{1+f}}}{1-x+x^{\\frac{2 f+1}{f+1}}}\n$$\n\nas desired.\nWe remark that with $A=\\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right) \\mathbb{1}(Z \\leq 1)$, we could have obtained another, different lower bound on the competitive ratio, better for medium values of $f$. Another reasonable option is $A=\\mathbb{1}\\left(X_{\\max } \\geq T\\right) c_{2}^{\\mathcal{Z}}$, which can recover approximately the correct result near both $f=0$ and $f=\\infty$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 36, "text": "# EC.6. Numerical Experiment \n\nIn this section we experiment the performance of Algorithm 2 and compare it with different benchmarks.\n\nSettings: Each instance of the experiment consists of $n=7$ distributions, where each distribution follows a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). The hyperparameters of these distributions, location $\\mu$, scale $\\sigma$, and shape $\\psi$, are sampled independently at the beginning of each simulation from uniform distributions (to generate enough heterogeneity in our randomized instances). In particular\n\n$$\n\\mu \\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(0,16), \\quad \\sigma \\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(0,4), \\quad \\psi \\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(-1,0.5)\n$$\n\nOnce the hyperparameters of the GPD distributions are sampled and fixed for a given instance, we generate 500 independent realizations of the seven random variables to run a Monte Carlo simulation. Algorithm 2 and benchmarks are then applied to each realization. Since both the sampled values and the decision-making process of the algorithms involve randomness, multiple runs per instance are necessary to obtain robust performance estimates. To evaluate performance, we compute the ratio of the average net reward of each algorithm (the final value minus the buyback cost) to the average of $X_{\\max }$ over the 500 realizations. We then aggregate these results across 100 sampled instances and visualize them using box-and-whisker plots for different values of $f$ in Figure EC.2.\n\nBenchmarks: In the graphs, five algorithms are compared, as explained below from left to right:\n\n- ALG: This is basically Algorithm 2, the main algorithm of this paper, with the theoretical guarantee establishing that it is optimal competitive (Theorem 4 and Theorem 3). ${ }^{14}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ We make a slight modification to our algorithm to make it more practical. It particular, if the algorithm considers accepting a random variable $X_{i}$ with probability $p \\in(0,1]$, and $X_{i}$ corresponds to a quantile of $X_{\\max }$ larger than $y_{f}(1)$, we boost $p$ to 1 (in some sense, this is the analog of forcing the algorithm to accept really high values).\n\n- BHK: The optimal deterministic algorithm tailored for adversarial arrivals, introduced by Babaioff et al. (2008). This algorithm is essentially a greedy algorithm with some margins: it will swap the held value $x$ with the current value $y$ if $y>\\gamma \\cdot x$, where parameter $\\gamma>(1+f)$ is tuned properly as a function of $f$.\n- BK: The optimal randomized algorithm for adversarial arrivals, proposed by Badanidiyuru and Kleinberg (2009). This algorithm is essentially a greedy algorithm similar to BHK with $\\gamma=1$, but with the difference that it first rounds the values down to a specific randomized grid before running the greedy algorithm.\n- Median: The classic algorithm for the prophet inequality. This algorithm accepts the first value greater than the median of $X_{\\max }$ and never buys back.\n- Threshold Greedy: This algorithm, introduced and analyzed in Section EC.5, accepts a value greater than the $\\frac{f}{1+2 f}$-quantile of $X_{\\max }$ for the first time, and switches to new variables if the margin is positive, i.e., if the value is greater than $1+f$ times the previously accepted value.\n\nResults: The results are shown in Figure EC.2. As observed, Algorithm 2 consistently ranks among the best algorithms under random instances, while also benefiting from the theoretical guarantee it provides. Notably, the advantage of Algorithm 2 over algorithms tailored for adversarial arrivals becomes more apparent for larger values of $f$. In this regime, the algorithm performs similarly to the median algorithm, which is optimal for $f=\\infty$. On the other hand, for small values of $f$, while the median algorithm performs poorly, Algorithm 2 significantly outperforms it by efficiently utilizing the buyback option.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure EC. 2 The results of the numerical experiments for different values of $f \\in\\{0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,1,2,3,5,7,10\\}$.

revenue management focuses on\nsettings with irrevocable decisions, where once a decision is made upon the\narrival of a new input, it cannot be canceled later. Motivated by modern\napplications -- such as cloud spot markets, selling banner ads, or online hotel\nbooking -- we introduce and study \"prophet inequalities with cancellations\"\nunder linear cancellation costs (known as the buyback model). In the classic\nprophet inequality problem, a sequence of independent random variables $X_1,\nX_2, \\ldots$ with known distributions is revealed one by one, and a decision\nmaker must decide when to stop and accept the current variable in order to\nmaximize the expected value of their choice. In our model, after accepting\n$X_j$, one may later discard $X_j$ and accept another $X_i$ at a cost of $f\n\\times X_j$, where $f\\geq 0$ is a parameter. The goal is to maximize the\nexpected net reward: the value of the final accepted variable minus the total\ncancellation cost. We aim to design online policies that are competitive\nagainst the optimal offline benchmark.\n  Our first main result is an optimal prophet inequality for all parameters $f\n\\ge 0$. We fully characterize the worst-case competitive ratio of the optimal\nonline policy against the optimal offline via the solution to a certain\ndifferential equation (for which we provide a constructive solution). Our\nsecond main result is to design and analyze a simple and polynomial-time\nrandomized adaptive policy that achieves this optimal competitive ratio.\nImportantly, our policy is order-agnostic (\\`a la [Samuel-Cahn, 1984]), as it\nonly needs the set of distributions and not their arrival order. These results\nare obtained by novel techniques related to factor-revealing LPs and\ngeneralized flow, reductions to a differential equation, and embedding of\nproblem instances into specific Poisson point processes.", "updated": "2025-04-21T03:46:07Z", "published": "2024-03-31T02:02:21Z"}
