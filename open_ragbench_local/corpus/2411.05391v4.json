      "text": "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nInterest in classification is ubiquitous across fields like medicine, epidemiology, or machine learning [2]. Given past data, the general goal is to find a rule to classify future examples. In medicine and epidemiology classification often involves distinguishing between disease and non-disease states. This can then be crucial for guiding individual treatments or informing public health actions. Classifiers are evaluated with metrics like the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), the Youden index, or other metrics, all aiming to evaluate aspects of diagnostic accuracy $[6,2]$. In particular, the Youden index for a classifier is defined as\n\n$$\n\\text { Youden }=T P R+T N R-1\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, binary classifiers are often built using logistic regression with a threshold probability. As there is no direct analog of an R-squared for logistic regression, various pseudo-R-squared metrics were introduced to judge the quality of the logistic model [3]. Tjur's $R^{2}$ coefficient [8] measures a model's discriminatory power in logistic regression through the average difference in predicted probabilities between the binary outcomes, making it a popular tool to evaluate a models predictive capacity [3]. Another common tool in model evaluation assessing prediction models are scoring rules [1], which compare probabilistic predictions to observed outcome. In practice, an average over scoring rules is considered.\n\nLet\n\n$$\n[n]=\\{1, \\cdots, n\\}\n$$\n\nbe the set of the first $n$ natural numbers. To be more concrete, assume data $\\mathcal{X}=\\left\\{\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right) \\mid i \\in[n]\\right\\}$ are given, where the $x_{i}$ are the predictors and $y_{i}$ the binary\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 62C99, 62H17, 62P10., 62J12,\n    Key words and phrases.

After fitting a logistic regression model, we denote the predicted probability of observation $i$ being 1 by $\\hat{p}_{i}$. Furthermore let $\\mathcal{X}_{1}=\\left\\{i \\mid\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{X}, y_{i}=1\\right\\}$ and $\\mathcal{X}_{0}=\\left\\{i \\mid\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{X}, y_{i}=0\\right\\}$. Then the Tjur's $R^{2}$ is given by\n\n$$\nR_{T j u r}^{2}\\left(\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{X}_{1}\\right|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{X}_{1}} \\hat{p}_{i}-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{X}_{0}\\right|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{X}_{0}} \\hat{p}_{i}\n$$\n\nAn equivalence between the Youden index and Tjur $R^{2}$ for a logistic regression with the classification as independent variable was claimed in [5] and recently shown not to hold [4]. Denote all possible distributions on the set $\\{0,1\\}$ by $\\Delta_{1}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{1}=\\left\\{\\left(p_{0}, p_{1}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{2} \\mid p_{0}+p_{1}=1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nA real-valued scoring rule for binary outcomes is a function that maps a probability on the binary set and a binary outcome to the reals, i.e.\n\n$$\nS(\\cdot, \\cdot): \\Delta_{1} \\times\\{0,1\\} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nThese are determined by the two functions $S(\\cdot, 0): \\Delta_{1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, S(\\cdot, 1): \\Delta_{1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},[1, \\S$ 3.1]. Furthermore we say $S(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is continuous, if both $S(\\cdot, 0)$ and $S(\\cdot, 1)$ are. The average over the scoring rule $S(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is given as\n\n$$\nA v_{S}\\left(\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in[n]} S\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, y_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nAs a generalisation of Tjur's $R^{2}$ (1.3), we consider a generalised evaluation over a scoring rule $S(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ as\n\n$$\nE v_{S}\\left(\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{X}_{1}\\right|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{X}_{1}} S\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, 1\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{X}_{0}\\right|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{X}_{0}} S\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}, 0\\right)\n$$\n\nThis generalises Tjur's $R^{2}$ of (1.3) as we obtain (1.3) if $S(\\hat{p}, 0)=S(\\hat{p}, 1)=\\hat{p}$ in (1.6).\n\nOur main question of interest is the investigation of a potential equivalence between\n(1) the Youden index for $2 \\times 2$ contingency tables and\n(2) a probability prediction obtained trough a logistic regression with the state of the classifier evaluated via either average real scoring rule (1.5) or Tjur $R^{2}$-like metric (1.6) for a real continuous scoring rule.\nWe will show that such a correspondences cannot hold, even when we take a difference between the average predictions over 0 s and 1 s measured with a continuous scoring function from (1.6).\n\nAcknowledgments.

Notation and setting \n\nConsider data $\\mathcal{X}=\\left\\{\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right) \\mid i \\in 1, \\cdots, n\\right\\}$ where the $x_{i}$ are the predictors and $y_{i}$ the binary outcomes.

This logistic regression with maximum-likelihood estimate will hence give the following prediction probabilities\n\n$$\ng_{p}\\left(x_{i}\\right):= \\begin{cases}\\frac{a}{a+b}, & \\text { if } f_{c}\\left(x_{i}\\right)=1 \\\\ \\frac{c}{c+d}, & \\text { if } f_{c}\\left(x_{i}\\right)=0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe are interested in the question of whether there exists a real scoring rule such that an equality like\n\n$$\n\\text { Youden }=A v_{S}\\left(\\left(\\hat{p_{i}}, y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\text { Youden }=E v_{S}\\left(\\left(\\hat{p_{i}}, y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)\n$$\n\nholds. We will show impossibility results for both, hence that such a real scoring rule cannot exist.\n\nRemark 2.1. In fact, in the case of (2.3), we will show this for the space of continuous function $\\Delta_{1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. As there is a homeomorphism $\\Delta_{1} \\simeq[0,1]$, it is sufficient to show this for all continuous functions $[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, whose set we denote by $\\mathcal{C}([0,1], \\mathbb{R})$. $\\mathcal{C}([0,1], \\mathbb{R})$ is an infinite dimensional vector space containing the identity function which inserted in (1.6) for $S(\\cdot, 0)$ and $S(\\cdot, 0)$ gives Tjur's $R^{2}$. However, it also contains, e.g., any univariate polynomial of an arbitrary degree.\n\nBefore going further, we remark the following.\nRemark 2.2. The expressions of Youden index (1.1) is only defined for $a+c \\neq 0$ and $b+d \\neq 0$. We restrict to this in the following, and denote the set of elements we exclude by $\\mathcal{C}$ and the one we consider by $\\mathcal{A}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathcal{C}:=\\left\\{(a, b, c, d) \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 0}^{4} \\mid a+c=\\text { or } b+d=0\\right\\} \\\\\n\\mathcal{A}=\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 0}^{4} \\backslash \\mathcal{C}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTo be more concrete, we write out the expression of $A v_{S}\\left(\\left(g_{p}\\left(x_{i}\\right), y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)$ and $E v_{S}\\left(\\left(g_{p}\\left(x_{i}\\right), y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)$, where the first is given by\n\n$$\nA v_{S}\\left(\\left(g_{p}\\left(x_{i}\\right), y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)=\\frac{1}{a+b+c+d}\\left(a \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}, 1\\right)+c \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{c}{c+d}, 0\\right)+b \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}, 0\\right)+d \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{c}{c+d}, 1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nand the second by\n\n$$\nE v_{S}\\left(\\left(g_{p}\\left(x_{i}\\right), y_{i}\\right)_{i \\in[n]}\\right)=\\frac{1}{a+c}\\left(a \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}, 1\\right)+c \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{c}{c+d}, 0\\right)\\right)-\\frac{1}{b+d}\\left(b \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}, 0\\right)+d \\cdot S\\left(\\frac{c}{c+d}, 1\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe question we want to answer is the following. Is there a real-valued continuous scoring function $S(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ such that either\n\n- the evaluation in (1.5) equals the Youden index (2.1), or\n- the evaluation in (2.5) equals the Youden index (2.1),\nfor all $(a, b, c, d) \\in \\mathcal{A}$ ?",

However, in a broader context, the question remains open as to whether classification evaluation measures $[6,2]$ can equal probabilistic prediction evaluation measures [3] when applied to the maximum likelihood estimate, where the classification result serves as independent variable and the true outcome as dependent variable.\n\nPotential evaluation measures of interest include pseudo- $R^{2}$ metrics, or other widely used evaluation functions [8, 3]. Establishing such a correspondence could provide new insights into classification evaluation measures and inspire the development of novel approaches in this area. Since our result only establishes the impossibility of equating the Youden index with a average score or a Tjur $R^{2}$-like metric, it represents just a first step in exploring these relationships.",
