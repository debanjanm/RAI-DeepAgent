InTRODUCTION \n\nIn this paper, we study two prototypical geometric wave equations on $(1+n)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$. As customary in this context, Einstein summation convention is employed, Greek indices $\\mu, \\nu$ take values in $\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and are raised and lowered with respect to the Minkowski metric $\\eta=\\operatorname{diag}(-1,1, \\ldots, 1)$.\n\nThe one model we consider are wave maps with domain manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ and target manifold the $n$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which is embedded as a Riemannian submanifold in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. These are maps $U: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{S}^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that solve the wave maps equation\n\n$$\n\\partial^{\\mu} \\partial_{\\mu} U+\\left\\langle\\partial^{\\mu} U, \\partial_{\\mu} U\\right\\rangle U=0\n$$\n\nwhere $\\langle., .\\rangle$ denotes the Euclidean scalar product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\nThe other model we consider are Yang-Mills connections represented on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{s o}(n)$ of skew-symmetric $(n \\times n)$-matrices. These are $\\mathfrak{s o}(n)$-valued connection 1-forms $A_{\\mu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{s o}(n)$ with associated curvature 2 -form\n\n$$\nF_{\\mu \\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}+\\left[A_{\\mu}, A_{\\nu}\\right]\n$$\n\nthat solve the Yang-Mills equation\n\n$$\n\\partial^{\\mu} F_{\\mu \\nu}+\\left[A^{\\mu}, F_{\\mu \\nu}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nwhere the Lie bracket $[., .$.$] is given by the commutator for (n \\times n)$-matrices.\nThe wave maps equation (1.1) and Yang-Mills equation (1.2) are nonlinear time evolution equations of wave type and as such, their solution theory is concerned with the respective Cauchy problem. A central question of the Cauchy problem is whether solutions exist for all time or develop singularities for given initial data. Properties of these equations, which are important for their analysis, are conservation laws, symmetries, and special solutions. In this respect, we first recall that the wave maps and Yang-Mills equation both appear as Euler-Lagrange equations derived from geometric action functionals with Lagrange densities\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U]=\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle\\partial^{\\mu} U, \\partial_{\\mu} U\\right\\rangle \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A]=\\frac{1}{4}\\left\\langle F_{\\mu \\nu}, F^{\\mu \\nu}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $\\langle., .\\rangle$ denotes the Euclidean scalar product on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product for $(n \\times n)$-matrices, respectively. The energy-momentum tensor is defined by its components\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U]_{\\mu \\nu}=\\left\\langle\\partial_{\\mu} U, \\partial_{\\nu} U\\right\\rangle-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U] \\eta_{\\mu \\nu} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A]_{\\mu \\nu}=\\left\\langle F_{\\mu}{ }^{\\alpha}, F_{\\nu \\alpha}\\right\\rangle-\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A] \\eta_{\\mu \\nu}\n$$\n\nand is divergence-free along the flow. In particular, this implies a conservation law for the positive definite energies\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U](t)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U]_{00}(t, .)=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\sum_{\\mu=0}^{n}\\left\\langle\\partial_{\\mu} U(t, .), \\partial_{\\mu} U(t, .)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A](t)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A]_{00}(t, .)=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\sum_{0 \\leq \\mu<\\nu \\leq n}\\left\\langle F_{\\mu \\nu}(t, .), F_{\\mu \\nu}(t, .)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nMoreover, the wave maps equation and Yang-Mills equation have a scaling symmetry. That is, if $U$ solves Eq. (1.1) then so does\n\n$$\nU_{\\lambda} \\quad \\text { given by } \\quad U_{\\lambda}(t, x):=U\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}, \\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n\nand if $A_{\\mu}$ solve Eq. (1.2), then so do\n\n$$\nA_{\\lambda \\mu} \\quad \\text { given by } \\quad A_{\\lambda \\mu}(t, x):=\\lambda^{-1} A_{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}, \\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $\\lambda>0$. It follows that the energies (1.3), (1.4) exhibit the scaling\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{WM}}\\left[U_{\\lambda}\\right](t)=\\lambda^{n-2} E_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U]\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad E_{\\mathrm{YM}}\\left[A_{\\lambda}\\right](t)=\\lambda^{n-4} E_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A]\\left(\\frac{t}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $\\lambda>0$. Depending on the scaling behaviour of the energies in different space dimensions, the respective model is called\nenergy-subcritical if $n=1$ for wave maps and $n \\leq 3$ for Yang-Mills,\nenergy-critical if $n=2$ for wave maps and $n=4$ for Yang-Mills,\nenergy-supercritical if $n \\geq 3$ for wave maps and $n \\geq 5$ for Yang-Mills.\nIt is precisely the whole range of energy-supercritical dimensions that we are concerned with here. Following the scaling heuristics in this regime, the shrinking of large solutions to smaller scales is energetically favorable, and thereby the formation of a singularity is anticipated. An important role in the blowup dynamics is played by self-similar solutions, which are by definition invariant under the respective scaling transformation (1.5), (1.6). Before we come to such explicitly known solutions, we mention that self-similar blowup is already observed within the class of corotational or equivariant solutions, see [109, p. 109] and [59, p. 136] for general definitions. A map $U: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{S}^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is called corotational if there is a function $\\widetilde{\\psi}: \\mathbb{R} \\times[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\nU(t, x)=\\binom{|x|^{-1} \\sin (|x| \\widetilde{\\psi}(t,|x|)) x}{\\cos (|x| \\widetilde{\\psi}(t,|x|))}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, a connection 1-form $A_{\\mu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{s o}(n)$ is called equivariant if there is a function $\\widetilde{\\psi}: \\mathbb{R} \\times[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\nA_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}(t, x)=\\widetilde{\\psi}(t,|x|)\\left(x^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-x^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nAn additional important symmetry for the Yang-Mills equation is the gauge symmetry. However, imposing the equivariant ansatz automatically fixes a gauge and eliminates this symmetry. The gauge symmetry is briefly explained in Section 1.3, where we discuss related works on the well-posedness theory for both equations.\n1.1. Singularity formation and blowup stability. In any energy-supercritical dimension, the wave maps equation (1.1) and Yang-Mills equation (1.2) have a finite-time blowup solution with self-similar profile given in closed form by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_{T}^{*}(t, x) & =U^{*}(T-t, x) \\quad \\text { where } \\quad U^{*}(t, x)=\\frac{1}{(n-2) t^{2}+|x|^{2}}\\binom{2 \\sqrt{n-2} t x}{(n-2) t^{2}-|x|^{2}} \\\\\nA_{T \\mu}^{*}(t, x) & =A^{*}{ }_{\\mu}(T-t, x) \\quad \\text { where } \\quad A^{*}{ }_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}(t, x)=\\frac{x^{i}}{\\alpha_{n} t^{2}+\\beta_{n}|x|^{2}} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-\\frac{x^{j}}{\\alpha_{n} t^{2}+\\beta_{n}|x|^{2}} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor any blowup time $T>0$, respectively, with coefficients\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha_{n} & =\\frac{1}{12} \\frac{3(n-2)(n-4)+(n+2) \\sqrt{3(n-2)(n-4)}}{n-1} \\\\\n\\beta_{n} & =\\frac{1}{4} \\frac{3(n-2)-\\sqrt{3(n-2)(n-4)}}{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nsee [7]. Note that the solutions (1.9), (1.10) are smooth in the whole domain away from the blowup event $(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$. Moreover, both solutions are corotational in the sense of (1.7), (1.8) with profile\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\psi}^{*}(t, r)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\frac{4}{r} \\arctan \\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{n-2} t+\\sqrt{(n-2) t^{2}+r^{2}}}\\right)} & \\text { for wave maps, } \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha_{n} t^{2}+\\beta_{n} r^{2}} & \\text { for Yang-Mills. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe existence of a self-similar corotational wave map from $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime into the 3 -sphere was first proved by J. Shatah [108]. The explicit solution corresponding to (1.9) in case $n=3$ was later found by N. Turok and D. Spergel [134]. The existence of self-similar solutions for the Yang-Mills equation in dimensions $5 \\leq n \\leq 8$ is due to T. Cazenave, J. Shatah and A. S. Tahvildar-Zadeh [12]. For $n=5$, the explicit blowup solution (1.10) was found by P. Bizo\u0144 in [6]. In the lowest energy-supercritical dimensions, he also proved the existence of a countable family of smooth self-similar solutions [5], [6], with the \"ground state\" corresponding to the explicit solution from above. For wave maps, this existence result was extended to $3 \\leq n \\leq 6$ in [1]. The explicit ground state solutions in all higher dimensions were found much more recently in [7]. P. Bizo\u0144 et al. also performed numerical studies in [9], [4], [8], [7] on singularity formation, where they observed that corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang-Mills connections with large data blow up in finite time and exhibit the same blowup as described by the profiles (1.13). This led to the conjecture that these self-similar blowup solutions are universal in the sense that the generic large data Cauchy evolution blows up and converges to them.\n\nA first step to explain this phenomenon rigorously is to prove that the blowup solutions (1.9), (1.10) are stable under perturbations of their initial data. A stability theory has been initiated by the first author in [29], [30] and focused on wave maps in dimension $n=3$ and Yang-Mills in dimension $n=5$. Nevertheless, a complete proof of stability hinged on the linear stability of the blowup profiles, which is equivalent to the difficult mode stability problem, see [31] for an introduction. This was solved in [32], [36], [20] for wave maps and in [22] for Yang-Mills. The underlying spectral methods were further developed by I. Glogi\u0107 and applied to prove mode stability of the blowup profiles (1.13) in all higher dimensions [21], [55]. Subsequently, the stability results were extended to all odd space dimensions as well, see [13] and [55]. Blowup stability for wave maps at optimal regularity in dimensions $n=3,4$ was proved by the first author and D. Wallauch [38], [37]. We also mention the original works [15], [88] on blowup for the related Skyrme model.\n\nNote, however, that the above results prove stability within a backward light cone and actually none of them uses that the explicit blowup solutions (1.9), (1.10) feature a natural continuation after the blowup time. This naturally points to the question whether these solutions are also stable in spacetime regions beyond light cones. To address this, \"hyperboloidal similarity coordinates\" have been devised in [2] to prove the nonlinear stability of the wave maps blowup in dimension $n=3$ under small localized perturbations in spacetime regions that extend even beyond the time of blowup. An implementation of this novel stability theory to higher dimensions requires to evolve the wave flow near self-similar blowup in such curvilinear coordinate systems. This is technically challenging and has so far only been achieved in odd space dimensions and in radial symmetry, where it was implemented for the Yang-Mills blowup [34]. The underlying functional setting also found application in a proof of co-dimension one radial stability of an explicit blowup solution for the quadratic wave equation [14]. In a recent complementary approach, I. Glogi\u0107 [54], [56] showed in any dimension that the wave maps and Yang-Mills blowup is nonlinearly stable along the hyperplanes $\\{t\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ up to $t=T$ in the whole region $(0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n1.2. Statement and discussion of the main results. The main goal of this paper is to prove stability of the blowup mechanism described by the self-similar solutions $U_{T}^{*}$ and $A_{T \\mu}^{*}$ given in Eqs. (1.9) and (1.10) in spacetime regions beyond light cones that are of the form\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)=\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}|0<t<T+\\kappa|x|\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor any fixed $-1 \\leq \\kappa<1$ and some suitable parameter $T>0$. The key to access these regions is to utilize flexible coordinate systems.\n\nDefinition 1.1. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N},-1 \\leq \\kappa<1, r>0$, and $\\varepsilon>0$. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ be such that\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. Sketch of similarity coordinates centered around $(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ for $n=1$. The gray-shaded part depicts $\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$, which exhausts the exterior of the future light cone of $(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ as $\\kappa \\rightarrow 1$. The region covered by the coordinate grid is the image region $\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$. Here, the spacelike curves correspond to the hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(t)$ whose flat part is determined by the parameter $r>0$ in condition (h1). The dotted region shows $\\Lambda_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$.\n(h1) $\\quad h(\\xi)=-1$ for $|\\xi|<r+\\varepsilon$,\n(h2) $|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1$ for $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\n(h3) $\\quad\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ is positive semidefinite for $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\n(h4) there is an $R \\geq r+\\varepsilon$ with $h(\\xi)=\\kappa R$ for $|\\xi|=R$.\nLet $T>0$. We define similarity coordinates\n\n$$\n\\chi_{T}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}, \\quad \\chi_{T}(\\tau, \\xi)=\\left(T+T \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), T \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nin the image region\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa):=\\chi_{T}\\left((0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nElementary geometric properties of similarity coordinates are studied in Appendix A and a sketch is given in Figure 1. Comprehensive examples of such coordinate systems are provided in Lemma A.9. Let us comment on their central features for our stability analysis.\n\nRemark 1.1. The function $h$ that appears in similarity coordinates is called a height function and it determines the geometry of the coordinate system. The convexity condition (h3) on the height function ensures that $\\chi_{T}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image, see Lemma A.2. In particular, we get from Lemma A. 6 the explicit image region\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)=\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\mid T+\\operatorname{Th}\\left(\\frac{x}{T}\\right)<t<T+\\kappa|x|\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThus, the parameter $-1 \\leq \\kappa<1$ in condition (h4) determines the spacetime region which is covered by a coordinate cylinder in similarity coordinates. For example,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\kappa=-1 \\text { yields a cover of the backward light cone of }(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\\\\n& \\kappa=0 \\text { yields an image contained in }(0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$0<\\kappa<1$ allows to reach the region beyond the blowup time $t=T$ and to approach the complement of the future light cone of $(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$.\n\nRemark 1.2. Similarity coordinates are adapted to the scaling symmetries of the respective nonlinear wave equations and are therefore well-suited for the study of self-similar solutions.\n\nAnother important feature is that due to the bound (h2) on the gradient of the height function, the level sets\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(t):=\\chi_{T}\\left(\\{\\tau(t)\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{n}\\right), \\quad \\tau(t)=\\log \\frac{T}{T-t}\n$$\n\nthrough $(t, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ for $0 \\leq t<T$, are spacelike hypersurfaces that foliate the image region $\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$ according to Lemmas A. 3 and A.4.\n\nRemark 1.3. The additional condition (h1) that the height function is constant in $\\mathbb{B}_{r+\\varepsilon}^{n}$ implies for $T \\geq 1-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r+\\varepsilon}$ that the region $\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa) \\backslash \\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$, which is not covered by the coordinate grid, is contained in\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{T}^{1, n}(r)=\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa) \\mid 0<t<|x|-r\\right\\}\n$$\n\ni.e. the exterior of the domain of influence of $\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{n}$ in $\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$. We also get that the spacelike hypersurfaces from the previous remark contain a flat portion\n\n$$\n\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{\\frac{(T-t)}{T}}^{n} \\subset \\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(t)\n$$\n\nThis allows us to collect initial data at $t=0$ directly along the initial hypersurface $\\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(0)$, which will come into play later in Section 4.4.\n\nNow, the statements of the stability theorems for wave maps and Yang-Mills connections are as follows. Their content is discussed in the remarks below.\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Stable blowup for corotational wave maps).

Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 characterize for corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang-Mills connections in all energy-supercritical dimensions the dynamics for large data near the self-similar blowup solutions $U_{1}^{*}$ and $A_{1 \\mu}^{*}$ in regions $\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$ beyond light cones and partially even past the blowup time $T$. The perturbations of the data at $t=0$ are assumed to be supported in a ball $\\mathbb{B}_{r}^{n}$ of arbitrary but fixed radius $r>0$. Based on this radius, similarity coordinates are chosen and according to Remarks 1.1 to 1.3, the spacetime domain is decomposed into\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)=\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa) \\cup \\Lambda_{T}^{1, n}(r) \\quad \\text { with foliation } \\quad \\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)=\\bigcup_{t \\in(0, T)} \\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(t)\n$$\n\nThen, in the image region $\\mathrm{X}_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$, the solutions $U, A_{\\mu}$ exhibit along the spacelike hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_{T}^{1, n}(t)$ as $t \\rightarrow T$ the asymptotic behaviour of the respective blowup solutions $U_{T}^{*}, A_{T \\mu}^{*}$. In the complementary region $\\Lambda_{T}^{1, n}(r)$, the solutions are simply obtained from finite speed of propagation. In particular, the solutions are smooth in $\\Omega_{T}^{1, n}(\\kappa)$ and hence no other singularities than $(T, 0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ form outside the backward light cone of this blowup point.\n\nRemark 1.5. The convergence towards the blowup is quantified in Sobolev norms along the hypersurfaces, which are classically defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|U\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\Sigma_{T^{*}}^{1, n}(t)\\right)} & :=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left\\|U^{i} \\circ \\chi_{T}(\\tau(t), .)\\right\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{n}\\right)} & & \\text { for } U: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{S}^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\\\\n\\|A\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\Sigma_{T^{*}}^{1, n}(t)\\right)} & :=\\sum_{i, j=1}^{n} \\sum_{\\mu=0}^{n}\\left\\|A_{\\mu}{ }^{i j} \\circ \\chi_{T}(\\tau(t), .)\\right\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{n}\\right)} & & \\text { for } A_{\\mu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{s o}(n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince no Sobolev norms above the scaling critical regularity $k=n / 2$ for wave maps and $k=n / 2-1$ for Yang-Mills is distinguished for the stability problem, we prove our results for all integer regularities for which we have an elementary local Lipschitz estimate of the effective\n\nnonlinearity in Lemma 4.1. In fact, due to the flexibility of the coordinate system, we manage to significantly improve the topology used in [2], [34] in hyperboloidal similarity coordinates.\n\nRemark 1.6. The previous works [2], [34] on stability past the blowup were only accessible in odd space dimensions. The dimensional limitation was due to a technically challenging adaptation of the \"descent method\" for the wave equation, which is entirely avoided in this paper. Instead, our current functional analytic approach relies on energies and commuting operators for the wave operator. Not only is this available in all space dimensions, we are also able to control the free wave flow without any symmetry assumptions in similarity coordinates. We outline this in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.2, the general theory is developed in Appendix B and concluded in Theorem B.1.\n\nRemark 1.7. Moreover, unlike in [2], [34], where the size of the support of the perturbations is dictated by a small parameter, here we can freely choose the support of the perturbations as large as we please.\n\nRemark 1.8. The condition $F^{n+1} \\geq-1+\\varepsilon_{r}$ for the $(n+1)$-st component of the initial datum ensures that its image has positive distance from the north pole in $\\mathbb{S}^{n}$. This is of technical nature and lets us prove radial lemmas for Sobolev norms of corotational maps, see Lemma 5.2.\n\nRemark 1.9. We finally remark that the question whether the stable blowup in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 can be meaningfully continued beyond the Cauchy horizon of the blowup event appears to be difficult and has to be addressed in another project.\n1.3. Review of the theory for wave maps and Yang-Mills. In the following, we present some of the main contributions to the rich theory of the wave maps and Yang-Mills equation. As nonlinear geometric wave equations, they share many interesting features and their solution theory is very much influenced by a great interplay of ideas, techniques and methods from the field of nonlinear dispersive equations. The details and cross references are contained in the literature, for an overview we also refer to the survey articles [75], [122].\n1.3.1. Results for the wave maps equation. Let $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. A wave map $U: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow M$ is defined as a critical point of the action functional\n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{WM}}[U]=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{1, n}} \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathrm{q}}\\left(U^{*} g\\right)\n$$\n\nWave maps were originally introduced as a \"nonlinear sigma model\" in classical field theory [47] and appear in many more applications. In Minkowski coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^{1, n}$ and local coordinates on $M$, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations\n\n$$\n\\partial^{\\mu} \\partial_{\\mu} \\Psi^{i}+\\Gamma^{i}{ }_{j k}(\\Psi) \\partial^{\\mu} \\Psi^{j} \\partial_{\\mu} \\Psi^{k}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Psi=\\left(\\Psi^{1}, \\ldots, \\Psi^{n}\\right)$ is the chart representation of the wave map $U$ and $\\Gamma^{i}{ }_{j k}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the metric $g$. This is the intrinsic formulation of the wave maps equation. In case $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a submanifold of Euclidean space with second fundamental form $A_{p}: \\mathrm{T}_{p} M \\times \\mathrm{T}_{p} M \\rightarrow$ $\\mathrm{T}_{p} M^{\\perp}$ at $p \\in M$, the extrinsic formulation of the wave maps equation reads\n\n$$\n\\partial^{\\mu} \\partial_{\\mu} U+A_{U}\\left(\\partial^{\\mu} U, \\partial_{\\mu} U\\right)=0\n$$\n\nIn the following qualitative overview, we oriented ourselves to a large extent on the modern exposition of the theory of wave maps in D.-A. Geba's and M. G. Grillaki's textbook [46]. Surveys on wave maps can be found in [77], [130].\n\nTo begin with, the wave maps equation constitutes a system of semilinear wave equations for which classical energy methods yield local well-posedness for data in Sobolev spaces $H^{s}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\times$ $H^{s-1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ of high enough regularity $s>n / 2+1$. Note that $s=n / 2$ is the scaling critical regularity for homogeneous Sobolev spaces $\\dot{H}^{s}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\times \\dot{H}^{s-1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$. One of the earliest results on global existence and regularity for wave maps were given in $(1+1)$ dimensions by C. H. Gu [58] and J. Ginibre and G. Velo [53]. The Cauchy problem for $(1+1)$-dimensional wave maps\n\nwas also studied by M. Keel and T. Tao [68], who proved local well-posedness for all data above scaling regularity $s>1 / 2$ and global well-posedness for all data if $s \\geq 1$, whereas at the scaling critical regularity $s=1 / 2$ well-posedness fails because of discontinuity of the data-to-solution map [118]. Wave maps in $(1+2)$ dimensions were extensively studied in corotational symmetry by J. Shatah and A. S. Tahvildar-Zadeh [107], [111] for targets that satisfy a geodesic convexity condition, as well as in radial symmetry for parallelizable targets by D. Christodoulou and A. S. Tahvildar-Zadeh [17], [18] and later by M. Struwe [115], [117] for general targets. In those settings, global existence of smooth solutions was established for smooth data of any size and the asymptotic behavior of those solutions was described. The work [107] also gives a local well-posedness result for corotational wave maps at optimal regularity for all $n \\geq 2$. The corotational results on blowup from that time are commented on in Section 1.1. We refer to J. Shatah's and M. Struwe's textbook [109] for further notes on early results.\n\nFor the small data global well-posedness theory without symmetry restrictions, several advanced techniques were developed. Building on their works [69], [72], S. Klainerman together with S. Selberg [74] and M. Machedon [71] exploited the \"null structure\" of the wave maps nonlinearity to prove local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces for $s>n / 2$ in all dimensions $n \\geq 2$, In this context, the difficulties that arise on the way from local to global well-posedness at optimal regularity are known as the \"division problem\". This was solved in the seminal works [128], [129] by D. Tataru and resulted in global well-posedness for small data in scaling critical homogeneous Besov spaces, also see [11]. The result in Sobolev spaces has to be addressed in view of the ill-posedness result [27] due to failure of uniform continuity of the solution operator in scaling critical spaces. Passing from Besov spaces to Sobolev spaces leads to what is called the \"summation problem\", which was solved in a weak global existence result in scaling critical homogeneous Sobolev space for small data wave maps with spherical target by T. Tao in [119] for $n \\geq 4$ and in [120] for $n=2,3$. The underlying techniques from harmonic analysis were further improved to cover more general target manifolds. Subsequently, global existence for small critical data was obtained for bounded parallelizable targets in dimensions $n \\geq 5$ by S. Klainerman and I. Rodnianski [73] and for compact Lie groups and symmetric spaces in dimensions $n \\geq 4$ by A. Nahmod, A. Stefanov and K. Uhlenbeck [89]. The low-dimensional cases $n=2,3$ are considered to be more difficult and were treated by J. Krieger [80], [81] for two-dimensional targets. A systematically different approach was pursued by J. Shatah and M. Struwe [110] in dimensions $n \\geq 4$ for targets with bounded curvature. The most comprehensive small data global well-posedness and regularity result was given by D. Tataru [131] for target manifolds which admit a uniform isometric embedding into Euclidean space.\n\nThis leads to the investigation of large data wave maps and the question whether they are global or blow up in finite time. In energy-supercritical dimensions, it has been known from the early theory of corotational wave maps that the Cauchy problem admits for several target geometries finite time blowup in the form of smooth self-similar solutions. In the energy-critical dimension $n=2$, it was known that a singularity can only form if the energy of the solution concentrates in a backward light cone at the origin. In particular, this scenario rules out self-similar blowup for energy-critical wave maps. M. Struwe [116] used this to show that if a corotational wave map develops a singularity, it converges up to a rescaling to a static wave map, i.e. a harmonic map. This indicates that the respective blowup mechanism for energy-critical and supercritical wave maps is substantially different. At that time, however, the existence of blowup solutions in $(1+2)$ dimensions had been observed only numerically for corotational wave maps into the 2 -sphere, see e.g. the work [10] of P. Bizo\u0144, T. Chmaj and Z. Tabor. The first rigorous construction of blowup for energy-critical wave maps into the 2 -sphere is due to I. Rodnianski and J. Sterbenz [102] for high equivariance classes. Their construction uses modulation of the harmonic ground state and provides a stable blowup mechanism. Parallel to this work, J. Krieger, W. Schlag and D. Tataru [78] constructed corotational wave maps into the 2 -sphere which blow up in finite time at a prescribed polynomial blowup rate, also see [44]. Stability of the latter solutions for sufficiently small rates was established in corotational\n\nsymmetry by J. Krieger together with S. Miao [82] and recently together with W. Schlag [83] for general smooth perturbations. A construction of stable blowup solutions for all equivariance classes along with a description of the asymptotics is given in the work [100] of P. Rapha\u00ebl and I. Rodnianski.\n\nIn $(1+2)$ dimensions, the energy provides a conserved quantity that controls the scaling critical Sobolev norm and thus makes a large data global well-posedness theory accessible. Major contributions to global existence, regularity and scattering for large data energy-critical wave maps are due to T. Tao in a series of preprints [123], [124], [125], [126], [127] and J. Krieger and W. Schlag [84] in cases where the target has negative sectional curvature. The latter employed the method of \"concentration compactness\" and obtained from this also asymptotic bounds and scattering. The large data theory for energy-critical wave maps with compact target was established by J. Sterbenz and D. Tataru [113], [114]. Their result proves a dichotomy between global regularity and scattering on the one hand, and on the other hand a blowup scenario, where the solution converges up to the symmetries of Minkwoski spacetime to a nontrivial finite energy harmonic map. More precisely, in the case where the compact target manifold does not admit a nontrivial harmonic map with finite energy, the solution is global and scatters for all data in the energy space. In the other case, global regularity and scattering holds for all data with energy below the minimal energy among all nontrivial harmonic maps. This settles the threshold conjecture for wave maps. A refined version of the threshold theorem for wave maps with topological degree zero can be found in A. Lawrie's and S.-J. Oh's work [87].\n\nA characterization of the global dynamics for $(1+2)$-dimensional wave maps into the 2 -sphere are subject to the soliton resolution, which asserts that any wave map in the energy space decomposes asymptotically into a finite sum of solitons and a radiation term. This decomposition along a sequence of times was proved by R. C\u00f4te [23] in the corotational case and by H. Jia and C. Kenig [65] for arbitrary equivariance classes. For energies that rule out multi soliton configurations, R. C\u00f4te, C. Kenig, A. Lawrie and W. Schlag [24], [25] proved the resolution for continuous times. Examples where a single soliton configuration is attained are provided in the fundamental works on the construction of blowup. For the asymptotic configuration of two solitons, constructions and a full classification of the possible dynamics of equivariant wave maps at the energy threshold is provided in the works of J. Jendrej and A. Lawrie [60], [62], [63], [64], the corotational case is treated by C. Rodriguez [103]. They prove that solutions with twice the energy of the harmonic ground state either scatter in both time directions or converge to a two-bubble state in one time direction and scatter in the other. Recently, the soliton resolution conjecture has been proved for corotational wave maps by T. Duyckaerts, C. Kenig, Y. Martel and F. Merle [40], who used the \"channel of energy\" method, and independently by J. Jendrej and A. Lawrie [61] for all higher equivariance classes. Versions of the soliton resolution without symmetry restrictions are available in [39] and [57]. More detailed explanations, overviews and cross references on the soliton resolution conjecture can be found in the cited works.\n\nTo close our discussion on wave maps, we come back to results in energy-supercritical dimensions $d \\geq 3$. B. Dodson and A. Lawrie [28] proved for wave maps into the 3 -sphere a scattering result in the scaling critical norm, which rules out the existence of type II blowup. The existence of finite time blowup in the form of self-similar solutions as well as their stability theory have already been discussed in Section 1.1. Further existence results of self-similar solutions are given in [66] and [48], [49]. Global solutions into the 3 -sphere with infinite scaling critical Sobolev norm have been constructed in the work [16] by J. Krieger and E. Chiodaroli. For energy-supercritical wave maps, blowup is also possible for negatively curved target geometries [12]. In this situation, the first author and I. Glogi\u0107 [33] have constructed stable self-similar blowup in dimensions $n \\geq 8$. A new \"type II\" blowup mechanism has been discovered by T. Ghoul, S. Ibrahim and V. T. Nguyen [50] for all $n \\geq 7$, which demonstrates that blowup is not necessarily always self-similar. Lastly, we mention that the threshold between blowup and scattering in dimensions $n=3,4,5,6$ is numerically studied in [1] and conjectured to be given by the first excited state of the countable family of self-similar solutions.\n\n1.3.2. Results for the Yang-Mills equation. In their work [135], C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills developed the foundations of a gauge theory for the strong nuclear interaction. The mathematical theory is implemented as a non-Abelian gauge theory on principal fiber bundles over spacetime and can be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic interaction. The geometric setup on principal fiber bundles is treated e.g. in the textbook [59].\n\nAs common, we give a more pragmatic setup here. Let $G$ be a matrix group and $\\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra with Lie bracket $[A, B]=A B-B A$. We also assume that there is an inner product $\\langle., .\\rangle$ on $\\mathfrak{g}$ which is invariant under the adjoint action of $G$ by conjugation. For $\\mu=0,1, \\ldots, n$, let $A_{\\mu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ be Lie algebra-valued connection 1-forms and define by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{D}_{\\mu} S=\\partial_{\\mu} S+\\left[A_{\\mu}, S\\right]\n$$\n\na metric-compatible connection for sections $S: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ over the vector bundle $\\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\times \\mathfrak{g}$. The local curvature 2 -form $F_{\\mu \\nu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ associated to this connection is defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{D}_{\\mu} \\mathrm{D}_{\\nu} S-\\mathrm{D}_{\\nu} \\mathrm{D}_{\\mu} S=\\left[F_{\\mu \\nu}, S\\right]\n$$\n\nand given by\n\n$$\nF_{\\mu \\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}-\\left[A_{\\mu}, A_{\\nu}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe say that $A_{\\mu}: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ is a Yang-Mills connection if it is a critical point of the action functional\n\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{YM}}[A]=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{1, n}}\\left\\langle F_{\\mu \\nu}, F^{\\mu \\nu}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe associated Euler-Lagrange equations are the Yang-Mills equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =\\mathrm{D}^{\\mu} F_{\\mu \\nu} \\\\\n& =\\partial^{\\mu} \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}\\left(\\partial^{\\mu} A_{\\mu}\\right)+\\partial^{\\mu}\\left[A_{\\mu}, A_{\\nu}\\right]+\\left[A^{\\mu}, \\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}\\right]-\\left[A^{\\mu}, \\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}\\right]+\\left[A^{\\mu},\\left[A_{\\mu}, A_{\\nu}\\right]\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand they constitute a system of scaling invariant nonlinear wave equations. This system possesses a gauge symmetry. That is, let $O: \\mathbb{R}^{1, n} \\rightarrow G$ and consider the gauge transformation\n\n$$\nA_{\\mu} \\mapsto \\bar{A}_{\\mu}:=O A_{\\mu} O^{-1}-\\partial_{\\mu} O O^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe curvature 2-form associated to the connection 1-forms $\\bar{A}_{\\mu}$ is then given by $\\bar{F}_{\\mu \\nu}=O F_{\\mu \\nu} O^{-1}$. Since the inner product on $\\mathfrak{g}$ is invariant under conjugation, the Yang-Mills action functional is invariant under gauge transformations. Thus, if $A_{\\mu}$ is a Yang-Mills connection then $\\bar{A}_{\\mu}$ is again a Yang-Mills connection, which also follows from the computation $\\overline{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\nu} \\bar{F}_{\\mu \\nu}=O\\left(\\mathrm{D}^{\\mu} F_{\\mu \\nu}\\right) O^{-1}$. This implies for the Cauchy problem that certain constraint equations on $A_{\\mu}$ have to be imposed to make it well-posed. Examples of gauges that have been used in the study of the Yang-Mills equation are the\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { temporal gauge } & A_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\text { Coulomb gauge } & \\partial^{i} A_{i}=0 \\\\\n\\text { Lorenz gauge } & \\partial^{\\mu} A_{\\mu}=0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nsee the references for more details. We also note that $s=n / 2-1$ is the scaling critical Sobolev index.\n\nAn early local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces for Yang-Mills connections in $(1+3)$ dimensions in the temporal gauge was obtained by I. Segal [105]. This local existence result was extended to all space dimensions for the more general Yang-Mills-Higgs equation by J. Ginibre and G. Velo in the temporal gauge [51] and Lorenz gauge [52]. For $n=1,2$ they also obtained global solutions. The classical global well-posedness and regularity result for Yang-Mills-Higgs in $(1+3)$-dimensions was established by D. M. Eardley and V. Moncrief [41], [42] in the temporal gauge.\n\nIn $(1+3)$ dimensions, local and global well-posedness for data with finite energy is due to S. Klainerman and M. Machedon [70]. Their approach combined a temporal gauge and a local Coloumb gauge to reveal a null structure in the equations. Low regularity local well-posedness\n\nwas first proved in [121] in the temporal gauge for small data and in [106], [133] in the Lorenz gauge. Low regularity global well-posedness in the temporal gauge is considered in the recent work [45]. Finite energy global well-posedness of the Yang-Mills system in $(1+3)$-dimensions was revisited in a new approach via the Yang-Mills heat flow by S.-J. Oh [90], [91].\n\nIn $(1+4)$ dimensions, S. Klainerman and D. Tataru [76] proved small data local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces strictly above scaling for a model equation. The global problem was treated by J. Sterbenz [112] in Besov spaces. Small data global well-posedness in even dimensions $n \\geq 6$ for scaling critical gauge covariant Sobolev norms was proved by J. Krieger and J. Sterbenz in [85]. Based on progress for the related Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equation, small energy global well-posedness for the Yang-Mills equation in $(1+4)$ dimensions in the Coulomb gauge was solved by J. Krieger and D. Tataru [86]. The works [92], [94] of S.-J. Oh and D. Tataru on the threshold conjecture and dichotomy theorem also contain local well-posedness at optimal regularity in the temporal gauge in any dimension $n \\geq 4$.\n\nIn the energy-critical dimension $n=4$, static energy minimizing solutions to the Yang-Mills equation exist. They are called \"instanton\" and play a key role in the description of singularity formation. Numerics on blowup were carried out in the equivariant case by P. Bizo\u0144 et al. in [4], [6], [3]. They observed that singularities form via a collapse to the rescaled profile of the instanton and conjectured that large solutions exhibit this universal blowup behavior. The rigorous construction of equivariant blowup solutions is due to J. Krieger, W. Schlag and D. Tataru [79]. Stable equivariant blowup has been constructed by P. Rapha\u00ebl and I. Rodnianski in $[100]$.\n\nThe large data theory without symmetry restrictions in the energy-critical dimension $n=4$ has been significantly advanced in the line of works [96], [94], [92], [95] by S.-J. Oh and D. Tataru. Their technique is based on the Yang-Mills heat flow and constructs a global \"caloric\" gauge. The first main result of their work is a proof of the threshold conjecture, which asserts global well-posedness and scattering for data with energy below twice the instanton. This was shown before in the equivariant case in [26]. The second part of their work establishes a dichotomy theorem, which states that local solutions either extend globally and scatter, or bubble off a soliton.

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# 1.4. Notation. Throughout this paper, we employ Einstein summation convention. \n\n1.4.1. Sets and relations. The sets of natural, real and complex numbers are denoted by $\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, respectively. The $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted by $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $|\\cdot|$ is the Euclidean norm. The open ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ of radius $R>0$ is given by $\\mathbb{R}_{R}^{d}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}| | x \\mid<R\\right\\}$. The $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is denoted by $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ and $\\eta=\\operatorname{diag}(-1,1, \\ldots, 1)$ is the Minkowski metric. For $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set $\\mathbb{H}_{\\omega}=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\operatorname{Re}(z)>\\omega\\}$ is an open right-half plane and $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}_{\\omega}=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\geq \\omega\\}$ is a closed right-half plane in the complex plane.\n\nIf $a_{\\lambda}, b_{\\lambda} \\geq 0$ are nonnegative real numbers which are indexed by a parameter $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$, we define a relation $a_{\\lambda} \\lesssim b_{\\lambda}$ if there exists a constant $C>0$ such that the inequality $a_{\\lambda} \\leq C b_{\\lambda}$ holds uniformly for all $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda$. As usual,\n\n$$\na_{\\lambda} \\gtrsim b_{\\lambda} \\quad: \\Leftrightarrow \\quad b_{\\lambda} \\lesssim a_{\\lambda} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad a_{\\lambda} \\simeq b_{\\lambda} \\quad: \\Leftrightarrow \\quad a_{\\lambda} \\lesssim b_{\\lambda} \\text { and } a_{\\lambda} \\gtrsim b_{\\lambda}\n$$\n\n1.4.2. Derivatives and function spaces. The Jacobian matrix of a map $f: \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is denoted by $\\partial f$ and has entries $(\\partial f)^{j}{ }_{i}=\\partial_{i} f^{j}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, m$ and $j=1, \\ldots, n$.

Remarks on the analysis of the free wave flow. The linearized part is arranged as a perturbation of $\\mathbf{L}_{0}$. Therefore, it is feasible to base the functional analytic framework for the stability problem on the free wave flow in similarity coordinates. For this, we employ the theory of strongly continuous semigroups, particularly the Lumer-Phillips generation theorem. This requires us to realize the map $\\mathbf{L}_{0}$ as a densely defined dissipative operator on a Hilbert space. However, semigroup theory alone does not provide a compatible Hilbert space structure. Nevertheless, it is instructive to note that the dissipative estimate in the assumptions of the Lumer-Phillips theorem dictates the exponential growth estimate for the semigroup in its conclusion. This observation suggests that energy estimates for the wave operator in similarity coordinates can inform a proper choice of inner products that are tailored to the dissipative properties of $\\mathbf{L}_{0}$. In Section 2.2, we manage to construct an energy that exhibits such estimates. With these ideas, a general theory of the wave evolution in similarity coordinates is then developed in Appendix B. The main result in Theorem B. 1 gives the generation of the free wave flow in similarity coordinates together with sharp growth bounds.\n2.1.2. Remarks on the analysis of the linearized wave flow. In Section 3, we turn to the wellposedness of the linearized equation associated to the abstract Cauchy problem. Based on Theorem B. 1 and perturbation theory for semigroups, we infer in Proposition 3.2 directly that $\\mathbf{L}$ generates in any radial Sobolev space $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right):=H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\times H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k-1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ a strongly continuous semigroup $\\mathbf{S}:[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ which propagates this flow. Ultimately, it is the stable part of this semigroup which accounts for the stability of the family of self-similar blowup solutions. Appropriate notions of stability are provided in terms of the growth bound of a semigroup, which is tied to spectral properties of its generator via spectral mapping theorems. Accordingly, we are led to characterize the unstable spectrum of $\\mathbf{L}$. By exploiting coordinate invariance of the linearized operator $\\square+\\mathcal{V}_{T}$, we draw an equivalence of this spectral problem to the classical mode stability problem. Fortunately, this difficult nonself-adjoint spectral problem has been solved for the respective blowup solutions in the works [21], [55] in the corotational case. With this, we prove that the unstable spectrum of $\\mathbf{L}$ consists precisely of the eigenvalue $1 \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{L})$, which is induced by time translation invariance of Eq. (2.1). Moreover, this eigenvalue is isolated and simple with associated Riesz projection $\\mathbf{P}_{1}$. In Proposition 3.6, we pin down the unstable part of the linearized wave evolution exactly to the one-dimensional eigenspace of the eigenvalue $1 \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{L})$ by showing\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{S}(\\tau)\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right)+\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} \\mathbf{P}_{1}, \\quad\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}(\\tau)\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right)\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)} \\lesssim \\mathrm{e}^{-\\omega \\tau}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\tau \\geq 0$. This gives a complete dynamical description of the linearized wave flow around the self-similar blowup solution in spacetime regions even beyond the blowup event.\n2.1.3. Remarks on the analysis of the nonlinear wave flow. In Section 4, we prove mapping properties of the nonlinearity $\\mathbf{N}$ in order to give a mild formulation of the abstract nonlinear evolution equation (2.11) with Duhamel's principle, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{S}(\\tau) \\mathbf{u}(0)+\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mathbf{S}\\left(\\tau-\\tau^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathbf{N}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nVia a Lyapunov-Perron-type argument, we carry the decaying part of the linear flow over to the nonlinear flow for modified initial data. Note that by definition of the variable $\\mathbf{u}=\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}\\right)$,\n\nthe initial datum $\\mathbf{u}(0)$ is obtained from an evaluation process along the initial hypersurface $\\Sigma_{T}^{1, d}(0)$. Owed to property (h1) of the height function, we have $\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d} \\subset \\Sigma_{T}^{1, d}(0)$. Hence the spacetime region, where we perturb the blowup solution $\\psi_{1}^{\\sigma}$, is contained in the initial hypersurface. Consequently, we obtain together with finite speed of propagation for semilinear wave equations the correct data for the abstract stability problem. In this way, the blowup time $T>0$ enters our analysis through the initial datum. By adjusting this blowup time appropriately, we construct from the modified solution a stable mild solution to the original Cauchy problem in the image region of similarity coordinates. Mapping properties of the semigroup $\\mathbf{S}$ allow us to upgrade mild solutions to jointly smooth classical solutions of Eq. (2.11). In Section 5, an application of this stability theory and the radial lemmas for corotational Sobolev norms proved in [97] ultimately yield Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.\n2.2. Energy topologies. To derive an energy as described in Section 2.1.1, let us fix $R, T>0$ and recall from Lemmas A. 3 and A. 4 that the image region $\\mathrm{X}_{T, R}^{1, d}$ of similarity coordinates $\\chi_{T}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ introduced in Definition 2.1 is foliated by the spacelike hypersurfaces\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau):=\\chi_{T}(\\{\\tau\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}), \\quad \\tau>0\n$$\n\nand the components of the future-directed timelike unit normal vector field along $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau)$ are given by\n\n$$\nN^{0} \\circ \\chi_{T}(\\tau, .)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w}}, \\quad N^{i} \\circ \\chi_{T}(\\tau, .)=\\frac{\\partial^{i} h}{\\sqrt{w}}\n$$\n\nThe integral along $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau)$ of a continuous and bounded function $\\varphi: \\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is well-defined by\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau)} \\varphi:=\\int_{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\left(\\varphi \\circ \\chi_{T}(\\tau, .)\\right) \\sqrt{\\operatorname{det} \\gamma_{T}(\\tau)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{det} \\gamma_{T}(\\tau)=\\left(T \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}\\right)^{2 d} w$ is the determinant of the first fundamental form of $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(\\tau)$.

However, because the stability problem in Theorem 2.1 is energy-supercritical, i.e. $\\frac{d}{2}-s-1>0$, we need an exponential growth estimate better than in (2.18) for a viable perturbation theory around self-similar blowup. To achieve this, scaling effects suggest to pass on to higher Sobolev norms. More concretely, the idea is to come up with differential operators that satisfy commutation relations with the wave operator in similarity coordinates and use them to construct higher energies which control higher-order Sobolev norms and exhibit improved growth bounds. These constructions are delicate and therefore carried out in detail in the Appendices B. 2 and B.3.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 3. EXISTENCE AND STABILITY OF THE LINEARIZED FLOW IN SIMILARITY COORDINATES \n\nIn this section, we prove the existence of the linearized corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang-Mills flow in similarity coordinates and determine its stability.\n3.1. Generation of the linearized flow. As explained in Section 2.1, the linear theory is built on the theory of the free wave flow in similarity coordinates from Appendix B. We begin with introducing the underlying function spaces.\n\nDefinition 3.1. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $R>0$. We define the Hilbert space\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)=H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\times H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k-1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the following, we implicitly fix $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ as in Definition 2.1 and let $R_{0}>0$ be determined as in Lemma A.5. We also tacitly impose case distinctions through the parameters\n\n$$\ns=1 \\quad \\text { for wave maps } \\quad \\text { and } \\quad s=2 \\quad \\text { for Yang-Mills }\n$$\n\nWith this, we obtain from our generation theorem B. 1 immediately a semigroup and generator for the free dynamics.\n\nProposition 3.1. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $R \\geq R_{0}$. Then, the linear map $\\mathbf{L}_{0}: C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2} \\rightarrow C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ given in Definition 2.3 has an extension to a densely defined closed operator $\\mathbf{L}_{0}: \\mathfrak{D}\\left(\\mathbf{L}_{0}\\right) \\subset$ $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ which is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $\\mathbf{S}_{0}:[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ with the property that for any $0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$ there exists a constant $M_{d, k, R, h, \\varepsilon} \\geq 1$ such that the growth estimate\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{0}(\\tau) \\mathbf{f}\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\leq M_{d, k, R, h, \\varepsilon} \\mathrm{e}^{\\omega_{d, k, s, \\varepsilon} \\tau}\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}, \\quad \\omega_{d, k, s, \\varepsilon}=\\max \\left\\{\\frac{d}{2}-s-k,-s+\\varepsilon\\right\\}\n$$\n\nholds for all $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ and all $\\tau \\geq 0$.\nProof. Let $\\overline{\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}^{\\top}}: \\mathfrak{D}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}^{\\top}}\\right) \\subset \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ be the generator of the semigroup $\\mathbf{S} \\upharpoonright$ : $[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ from item 2 of Theorem B.1. Then, the operator\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}_{0}:=\\overline{\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}^{\\top}} \\upharpoonright-s \\mathbf{I}, \\quad \\mathfrak{D}\\left(\\mathbf{L}_{0}\\right)=\\mathfrak{D}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}^{\\top}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis the generator of the rescaled semigroup given by $\\mathbf{S}_{0}(\\tau):=\\mathrm{e}^{-s \\tau} \\mathbf{S} \\upharpoonright(\\tau)$ which exhibits the asserted growth estimate. This operator coincides on $C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ with the map from Definition 2.3.\n\nThe potential which arises from the linearization around the self-similar blowup solution is realized as a compact linear operator in radial Sobolev spaces.\nLemma 3.1. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\frac{d}{2}-s>1$ and $R>0$. Then, the linear map $\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}: C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2} \\rightarrow$ $C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ given in Definition 2.4 has a unique extension to a bounded linear operator $\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime} \\in$ $\\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ and this operator is compact.\n\nProof. The map $\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}$ from Definition 2.4 represents a densely defined bounded linear operator on $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$. Hence, there is a unique extension $\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$. Compactness of the extended operator follows from compactness of the embedding $H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\hookrightarrow H_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k-1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$, see e.g. [98, proof of Lemma 3.1] for more details.\n\nThe generator of the linearized dynamics is implemented in this functional analytic setting as follows.\n\nDefinition 3.2. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\frac{d}{2}-s>1$ and $R \\geq R_{0}$. We define the linear operator $\\mathbf{L}: \\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbf{L}) \\subset \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ by\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{L}_{0}+\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}, \\quad \\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbf{L})=\\mathfrak{D}\\left(\\mathbf{L}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis setup allows for a short proof of the existence of the linearized flow in similarity coordinates.\n\nProposition 3.2. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\frac{d}{2}-s>1$ and $R \\geq R_{0}$. Then, the operator $\\mathbf{L}: \\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbf{L}) \\subset$ $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $\\mathbf{S}:[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ with the following properties.\n(1) For any $0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$ and for the constants $M_{d, k, R, h, \\varepsilon} \\geq 1$ and $\\omega_{d, k, s, \\varepsilon}$ from Proposition 3.1, the estimate\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}(\\tau) \\mathbf{f}\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\leq M_{d, k, R, h, \\varepsilon} \\mathrm{e}^{\\left(\\omega_{d, k, s, \\varepsilon}+M_{d, k, R, h, \\varepsilon}\\left\\|\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}\\right)} \\tau\\right\\| \\mathbf{f} \\|_{R^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}\n$$\n\nholds for all $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ and all $\\tau \\geq 0$.\n(2) For any $0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$, the set $\\sigma(\\mathbf{L}) \\cap \\overline{\\mathbb{H}}_{\\omega_{d, k, s, \\varepsilon}}$ consists of finitely many isolated eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{L}$ with finite algebraic multiplicity.\n\nProof. By Lemma 3.1, the operator $\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{L}_{0}+\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}$ is a bounded perturbation of the generator of the semigroup from Proposition 3.1. Hence, the Bounded Perturbation Theorem [43, p. 158] yields the first item. Since $\\mathbf{L}_{V}^{\\prime}$ is compact, we can apply the spectral mapping theorem [55, Theorem B.1] and infer the second item of the proposition.\n3.2. Spectral analysis of the generator. The growth estimate in Proposition 3.2 contains no information about the stable and unstable dynamics in the linearized evolution. Together with the spectral mapping theorem [55, Theorem B.1], however, the second item states that any growth additional to the one described in Proposition 3.1 is caused by finitely many eigenvalues in a right half-plane. So the next goal is to characterize this part of the spectrum of the generator. For this, we prepare some technical lemmas for which we recall from Definition B. 1 graphical similarity coordinates\n\n$$\n\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}, \\quad \\chi(\\tau, \\xi)=\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nand from Definition B. 6 the Laplace-Beltrami operator\n\n$$\n\\left(\\square_{\\chi} v\\right)(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{2 \\tau}\\left(c^{00}(\\xi) \\partial_{\\tau}^{2}+c^{i 0}(\\xi) \\partial_{\\xi^{i}} \\partial_{\\tau}+c^{i j}(\\xi) \\partial_{\\xi^{j}} \\partial_{\\xi^{j}}+c^{0}(\\xi) \\partial_{\\tau}+c^{i}(\\xi) \\partial_{\\xi^{i}}\\right) v(\\tau, \\xi)\n$$\n\nThe next lemma links the generator of the linearized flow to the wave equation with self-similar potential\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{V}(t, x):=\\mathcal{V}_{0}(t, x)=F^{\\prime}\\left(x, \\psi^{*}(-t, x)\\right)\n$$\n\nvia a convenient transition relation.\nLemma 3.2. Let $v \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)$ be radial and define $\\mathbf{u} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ with components\n\n$$\nu_{1}(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{-s \\tau} v(\\tau, \\xi), \\quad u_{2}(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{-s \\tau} \\frac{1}{c(\\xi)}\\left(\\partial_{\\tau}+\\xi^{i} \\partial_{\\xi^{i}}\\right) v(\\tau, \\xi)\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau, \\cdot)=\\mathbf{L u}(\\tau, \\cdot)-\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n\\mathrm{e}^{-(s+2) \\tau} \\frac{c}{w}\\left(\\left(\\square_{\\chi}+\\mathcal{V} \\circ \\chi\\right) v\\right)(\\tau, \\cdot)\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nProof. By the scaling property (F2) of the nonlinearity, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-(s+2) \\tau}(\\mathcal{V} \\circ \\chi)(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{-s \\tau} V(\\xi)\n$$\n\nNow, the transition relation follows from Lemma B.1.\nWe give a criterion for the existence of spectral points in a right half-plane in terms of smooth mode solutions to the wave equation with self-similar potential in similarity coordinates.\nProposition 3.3. Let $d, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $1<\\frac{d}{2}-s<k$ and $R \\geq R_{0}$. Let $\\mathbf{L}: \\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbf{L}) \\subset \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ be the operator from Definition 3.2.

Since $1 \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{L})$ is an eigenvalue by Lemma 3.3 and $\\sigma(\\mathbf{L}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ is a closed subset, the assertion of the proposition follows.\n\nNext, we determine the roles of the unstable eigenvalue and symmetry mode in the linearized wave evolution. For this, we employ the Riesz projection from spectral theory.\n\nDefinition 3.3. Consider the assumptions of Proposition 3.3.

Hence, it yields a decomposition of the Hilbert space into two closed complementary invariant subspaces for the generator. We also mention that this decomposition separates the unstable eigenvalue from the spectrum, see [67, p. 178, Theorem 6.17] for the general theory. In our setting, this leads to the following explicit subspace.\n\nProposition 3.5. Consider the assumptions of Proposition 3.3. Then, $1 \\in \\sigma(\\mathbf{L})$ is a simple eigenvalue whose geometric and algebraic eigenspaces are both spanned by the symmetry mode $\\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}$ from Lemma 3.3, that is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ran}\\left(\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right)=\\operatorname{ker}(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{L})=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nProof.

If $\\mathbf{I}-\\left.\\mathbf{L}\\right|_{\\operatorname{ran}\\left(\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right)}=\\mathbf{0}$ then $(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{L}) \\mathbf{P f}=\\mathbf{0}$ for all $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ and therefore the other inclusion $\\operatorname{ran}\\left(\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right) \\subseteq \\operatorname{ker}(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{L})$ follows.\n\nNow, let us assume that $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{L} \\upharpoonright_{\\operatorname{ran}\\left(\\mathbf{P}_{1}\\right)} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$.

Let $M>0$. Then, there is a $t_{+} \\in(0, \\infty]$ such that for all $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\leq M$ there exists a unique local-in-time mild solution $\\mathbf{u} \\in C\\left(\\left[0, t_{+}\\right), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ in the sense of Definition 4.1 to the abstract Cauchy problem (4.17). If $t_{+}<\\infty$, then\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{t_{<} \\rightarrow t_{+}}\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}=\\infty\n$$\n\nProof. See [99, p. 185 f., Theorem 1.4].\nWe prove that for smooth initial data the mild solution is in fact a jointly smooth classical solution. This crucially uses mapping properties of the linearized flow in Sobolev spaces, which are inherited from our construction of the free wave flow in Theorem B.1.\n\nProposition 4.2. Suppose $\\mathbf{u} \\in C\\left([0, \\infty), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ is a mild solution to the abstract Cauchy problem in the sense of Definition 4.1 for some smooth initial datum $\\mathbf{f} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$. Then $\\mathbf{u} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{(0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ and it is the unique classical solution to the abstract Cauchy problem.\nProof. First, consider $k_{d}=\\frac{d}{2}$ for wave maps and $\\frac{d-1}{2} \\leq k_{d} \\leq \\frac{d}{2}$ for Yang-Mills. Let $\\mathbf{u} \\in$ $C\\left([0, \\infty), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k_{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{S}(\\tau) \\mathbf{f}+\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mathbf{S}\\left(\\tau-\\tau^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathbf{N}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\tau \\geq 0$. By uniqueness, $\\mathbf{u}$ coincides with the local mild solution in $C\\left(\\left[0, t_{+}\\right), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ from Proposition 4.1 on its maximal interval of existence. To show that this solution is actually a global one, we assume to the contrary that $t_{+}<\\infty$. Then, since $\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}$ is uniformly bounded on $\\left[0, t_{+}\\right]$, we can exploit the nonlinear estimates from Lemma 4.2 to obtain from the above fixed-point equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} & \\lesssim\\|\\mathbf{S}(\\tau) \\mathbf{f}\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}+\\int_{0}^{\\tau}\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}\\left(\\tau-\\tau^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathbf{N}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime} \\\\\n& \\lesssim 1+\\int_{0}^{\\tau}\\left\\|\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\tau \\in\\left[0, t_{+}\\right)$. Thus, Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality shows that $\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}$ is uniformly bounded on the maximal interval of existence, which contradicts the blowup alternative in Proposition 4.1. Therefore, $\\mathbf{u} \\in C\\left([0, \\infty), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k_{d}+1}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$. Now, for any mild solution in $C\\left([0, \\infty), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ with $k>\\frac{d}{2}$, we conclude from the fixed-point equation together with the restriction property [54, Lemma C.1] satisfied by the semigroups $\\mathbf{S}:[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ from Proposition 3.2 and the second part of Lemma 4.2 that $\\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ for all $k>\\frac{d}{2}$ and all $\\tau \\geq 0$. Now, Sobolev embedding yields $\\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$ for all $\\tau \\geq 0$. To prove that this solution is classical and jointly smooth on $(0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}$, we first use [99, p. 189, Theorem 1.6] to infer that the mild solution is classical in the sense of Definition 4.1. So, the fixed-point equation can be differentiated with respect to $\\tau$, which gives\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{S}(\\tau) \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{f}+\\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mathbf{S}\\left(\\tau-\\tau^{\\prime}\\right) \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{N}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime}+\\mathbf{N}(\\mathbf{u}(\\tau))\n$$\n\nand so the restriction property [54, Lemma C.1] and smoothness of $\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)$ give $\\partial_{\\tau} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)$ for all $\\tau \\geq 0$. By induction, we conclude for any $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that $\\partial_{\\tau}^{\\ell} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)$. An application of Schwarz's theorem [104, p. 235, Theorem 9.41] yields $\\mathbf{u} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{(0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}$.\n4.3. Stabilized evolution. Our next goal is to prove the existence of global-in-time stable solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem (4.17). For this, we incorporate the decay of the linearized wave flow on the stable subspace into a function space for our main fixed-point argument.\nDefinition 4.2. Let $\\omega>0$ be the growth constant from Proposition 3.6. We define a Banach space $\\left(\\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right),\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathfrak{X}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}\\right)$ by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) & \\left.=\\left\\{\\mathbf{u} \\in C\\left([0, \\infty), \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right) \\mid\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\lesssim \\mathrm{e}^{-\\omega \\tau} \\text { for all } \\tau \\geq 0\\right\\} \\\\\n\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_{\\mathfrak{X}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} & \\left.:=\\sup _{\\tau \\in[0, \\infty)}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\omega \\tau}\\|\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this setting, the Lyapunov-Perron method provides an approach for suppressing the linear instabilities in the nonlinear evolution by means of a correction term.\nDefinition 4.3. Let $\\mathbf{P}_{1} \\in \\mathfrak{L}\\left(\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\\right)$ be the spectral projection from Definition 3.3. We define\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}: \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\times \\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right), \\quad \\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{f}, \\mathbf{u})=\\mathbf{P}_{1} \\mathbf{f}+\\mathbf{P}_{1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau^{\\prime}} \\mathbf{N}\\left(\\mathbf{u}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\tau^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nModifying the initial data by subtracting the correction term leads for small data to a well-posed global-in-time nonlinear evolution of exponentially stable solutions.\n\nProposition 4.3.

For now, let $\\delta_{0}>0$ and $C_{0}>1$ be arbitrary but fixed and $0<\\delta \\leq \\delta_{0}$ and $C \\geq C_{0}$. We set\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{B}_{\\delta}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathfrak{X}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) \\mid\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|_{\\mathfrak{X}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\leq \\delta\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor a closed ball in our Banach space.

Hence, there are $\\delta_{0}>0$ and $C_{0}>1$ such that the map\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathbf{f}}: \\mathfrak{B}_{\\delta} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{B}_{\\delta}, \\quad \\mathbf{u} \\mapsto \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathbf{f}}(\\mathbf{u})\n$$\n\nis well-defined and a contraction for any $\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|_{\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{\\delta}{C}$.

Data along the initial hypersurface. The initial data in Theorem 2.1 are prescribed at time $t=0$ and have to be transported to data for the abstract Cauchy problem (4.17) along an initial hypersurface at $\\tau=0$ in similarity coordinates. We achieve this by adapting our coordinate system in such a way that the initial hypersurface directly picks up the perturbations for the blowup data.\nLemma 4.3. Let $r>0, \\varepsilon>0$ and $R \\geq r+\\varepsilon, T \\geq 1-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r+\\varepsilon}$. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ and $\\chi_{T}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ be as in Definition 2.1 with the additional property $h \\equiv-1$ in $\\mathbb{B}_{r+\\varepsilon}^{d}$. Consider the domain\n\n$$\n\\Lambda^{1, d}(r)=\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d} \\mid 0 \\leq t \\leq|x|-r\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand the spacelike hypersurface\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0)=\\chi_{T}\\left(\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d} \\subset \\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0) \\backslash\\left(\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d}\\right) \\subset \\Lambda^{1, d}(r)\n$$\n\nProof. Note that $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0)=\\left\\{\\left(t_{0}(x), x\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d} \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{B}_{R T}^{d}\\right\\}$ is the graph of the function given by $t_{0}(x)=T+\\operatorname{Th}\\left(\\frac{x}{T}\\right)$. If $|x|<r$, then $|x| / T<r / T \\leq r+\\varepsilon$ and therefore $h\\left(\\frac{x}{T}\\right)=-1$. So $t_{0}(x)=0$ for all $|x|<r$ which yields the inclusion $\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d} \\subset \\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0)$. Moreover, the assumptions on $h$ imply the inequality\n\n$$\n0 \\leq t_{0}(x)=T+\\operatorname{Th}\\left(\\frac{x}{T}\\right)<T+T\\left(\\frac{|x|-r}{T}-1\\right)=|x|-r\n$$\n\nfor all $|x| \\geq r$, which yields the other inclusion $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0) \\backslash\\left(\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d}\\right) \\subset \\Lambda_{r}^{1, d}$.\nNow, if\n\n$$\n\\psi(0, \\cdot)=\\psi_{1}^{*}(0, \\cdot)+f \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left(\\partial_{0} \\psi\\right)(0, \\cdot)=\\left(\\partial_{0} \\psi_{1}^{*}\\right)(0, \\cdot)+g\n$$\n\nare data at $t=0$ for the semilinear wave equation (2.1) and the perturbations $f, g$ are supported in $\\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d}$, then the corresponding solution $\\psi$ has to coincide with $\\psi_{1}^{*}$ in $\\Lambda_{r}^{1, d}$ by finite speed of propagation. Therefore, the solution $\\psi$ is known along the initial hypersurface $\\Sigma_{T, R}^{1, d}(0)$ from Lemma 4.3 beforehand. Evaluating the corresponding rescaled evolution variables $u_{1}, u_{2}$ from Eq. (2.8) at $\\tau=0$ then yields precisely the correct data for the abstract Cauchy problem, which are provided by the following initial data operator.\nDefinition 4.4. Let $r>0, \\varepsilon>0$ and $R \\geq r+\\varepsilon$. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ be as in Definition 2.1 with $h \\equiv-1$ in $\\mathbb{B}_{r+\\varepsilon}^{d}$. We define the map\n$\\mathbf{U}:\\left(C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right) \\cap C_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{r}^{d}\\right)\\right)^{2} \\times\\left[1-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r+\\varepsilon}, 1+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{r+\\varepsilon}\\right] \\rightarrow C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}}_{R}^{d}\\right)^{2}, \\quad \\mathbf{U}(\\boldsymbol{f}, T)=\\boldsymbol{f}_{T}+\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{T}^{1}-\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{T}^{T}$,\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{f}_{T}(\\xi)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nT^{s} f(T \\xi) \\\\\nT^{s+1} g(T \\xi)\n\\end{array}\\right], \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{T}^{1}(\\xi) & =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nT^{s} \\psi_{1}^{*}(T+\\operatorname{Th}(\\xi), T \\xi) \\\\\nT^{s+1}\\left(\\partial_{0} \\psi_{1}^{*}\\right)(T+\\operatorname{Th}(\\xi), T \\xi)\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Psi}_{T}^{T}(\\xi) & =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nT^{s} \\psi_{T}^{*}(T+\\operatorname{Th}(\\xi), T \\xi) \\\\\nT^{s+1}\\left(\\partial_{0} \\psi_{T}^{*}\\right)(T+\\operatorname{Th}(\\xi), T \\xi)\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis initial data operator takes the following form.\nLemma 4.4.

Stable global wave evolution. The parameter for the blowup time has entered through the initial data operator from Definition 4.4 in the analysis of the stability problem in similarity coordinates. By adjusting this parameter, we can remove the correction term which has stabilized the evolution in Proposition 4.3.

Proof of the main results \n\nHere, we employ similarity coordinates to transform the solution of the abstract Cauchy problem into a solution of the nonlinear stability problem for the corotational wave maps equation and equivariant Yang-Mills equation in spacetime regions beyond light cones.\n5.1. Proof of Theorem 2.1. In the final step of our construction, we extend the solution in the image region of similarity coordinates by the solution outside of this region via finite speed of propagation. To ensure that the resulting map is smooth and solves the Cauchy problem, we recall the following version of finite speed of propagation for semilinear wave equations, also see Figure 2 for an illustration.\nLemma 5.1.

There are smooth even functions $\\widetilde{f}, \\widetilde{g} \\in C_{\\mathrm{ev}}^{\\infty}([0, \\infty))$ such that the initial data in the theorem are given by\n\n$$\na_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}(x)=\\widetilde{f}\\left(|x|\\right)\\left(x^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-x^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right), \\quad b_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}(x)=\\widetilde{g}(|x|)\\left(x^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-x^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nin $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then [97, Theorem 1.3] yields\n\n$$\n\\left\\|(a, b)\\right\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\times H^{k-1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)} \\simeq\\left\\|(\\widetilde{f}(|\\cdot|), \\widetilde{g}(|\\cdot|))\\right\\|_{H^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n+2}\\right) \\times H^{k-1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n+2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nAccording to Theorem 2.1, let $\\psi \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega_{T^{*}}^{1, n+2}(\\kappa)\\right)$ be the unique solution to the Cauchy problem\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\quad(\\square \\psi)(t, x)+(n-2)\\left(3 \\psi(t, x)^{2}-|x|^{2} \\psi(t, x)^{3}\\right)=0 \\quad \\text { in } \\Omega_{T^{*}}^{1, n+2}(\\kappa) \\\\\n& \\psi(0, .)=\\psi_{1}^{*}(0, .)+\\widetilde{f}(|.|) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\partial_{0} \\psi(0, .)=\\partial_{0} \\psi_{1}^{*}(0, .)+\\widetilde{g}(|.|) \\quad \\text { in } \\mathbb{R}^{n+2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe solution $\\psi$ is radially symmetric with radial profile $\\widetilde{\\psi}$ and we set\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A_{\\mu}: \\Omega_{T^{*}}^{1, n}(\\kappa) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{s o}(n), \\quad A_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}(t, x)=\\widetilde{\\psi}(t,|x|)\\left(x^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-x^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right), \\\\\n& F_{\\mu \\nu}: \\Omega_{T^{*}}^{1, n}(\\kappa) \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{s o}(n), \\quad F_{\\mu \\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu} A_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu} A_{\\mu}+\\left[A_{\\mu}, A_{\\nu}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor $\\mu, \\nu=0,1, \\ldots, n$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial^{\\mu} F_{\\mu 0}{ }^{i j}+\\left[A^{\\mu}, F_{\\mu 0}\\right]^{i j} & =0 \\\\\n\\partial^{\\mu} F_{\\mu \\ell}{ }^{i j}+\\left[A^{\\mu}, F_{\\mu \\ell}\\right]^{i j} & =-\\left(-\\widetilde{\\psi}_{t t}+\\widetilde{\\psi}_{r r}+\\frac{n+1}{r} \\widetilde{\\psi}_{r}+(n-2)\\left(3 \\widetilde{\\psi}^{2}-r^{2} \\widetilde{\\psi}^{3}\\right)\\right)\\left(x^{i} \\delta_{\\ell}^{j}-x^{j} \\delta_{\\ell}^{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas well as $A_{\\mu}(0,)=A_{1 \\mu}^{*}(0,)=a_{\\mu}$ and $\\partial_{0} A_{\\mu}(0,)==\\partial_{0} A_{1 \\mu}^{*}(0,)+b_{\\mu}$. Hence $A_{\\mu}$ is a smooth Yang-Mills connection. To infer the stability estimate, we compute\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(A_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}-A_{T^{*}}{ }_{\\mu}{ }^{i j}\\right) \\circ \\chi_{T^{*}}(\\tau, \\xi) & =T^{*} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}\\left(\\psi-\\psi_{T^{*}}^{*}\\right) \\circ \\chi_{T^{*}}(\\tau, \\xi)\\left(\\xi^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-\\xi^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau}}{T^{*}} \\widetilde{u}_{1}(\\tau,|\\xi|)\\left(\\xi^{i} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{j}-\\xi^{j} \\delta_{\\mu}{ }^{i}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{u}_{1}(\\tau, \\rho)=\\left(T^{*} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\widetilde{\\psi}-\\widetilde{\\psi}_{T^{*}}^{*}\\right) \\circ\\left(T^{*}+T^{*} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\widetilde{h}(\\rho), T^{*} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\rho\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $(\\tau, \\rho) \\in[0, \\infty) \\times[0, R]$. This gives with the definition of corotational Sobolev norms and [97, Theorem 1.3]\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\left\\|\\left(A-A_{T^{*}}^{*}\\right) \\circ \\chi_{T^{*}}(\\tau,

{"section_id": 8, "text": "# Appendix A. Similarity Coordinates \n\nIn this section, we study coordinate systems on Minkowski spacetime $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ that are adapted to self-similar solutions of nonlinear wave equations. This property can be formalized quite generally by defining that a map $\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ is a similarity variable if there exists a function $\\lambda: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\chi(\\tau, \\xi)=\\lambda(\\tau, \\xi) \\chi(0, \\xi)\n$$\n\nfor all $(\\tau, \\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. If $\\tau$ is interpreted as a time variable and $\\xi$ is interpreted as a space variable, this expresses that moving forward along the new time coordinate while the new space coordinate is kept fix, occurs via scaling of an initial reference point. Instead of studying similarity variables in the above generality, we will choose exponential time\n\n$$\n\\lambda(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}\n$$\n\nfor the scaling factor, which becomes convenient for the transformation of differential operators later on. Also, we require compatibility with the wave evolution, that is, hypersurfaces of constant coordinate time shall be spacelike. Since spacelike hypersurfaces in Minkowski spacetime are the image of a graph, we focus on similarity variables of the following form.\n\nDefinition A.1. Let $h \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$. We define graphical similarity variables by\n\n$$\n\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}, \\quad \\chi(\\tau, \\xi)=\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nWe remark that by a spacetime translation, graphical similarity variables may be centred around any given event in spacetime. When similarity variables define a coordinate system on their image, we call them similarity coordinates. The function $h$ is referred to as a height function. One of the simplest examples of a height function is given by\n\n$$\nh(\\xi)=-1\n$$\n\nyielding standard similarity coordinates. It is even possible to cover the whole complement of a future light cone with similarity coordinates. This is demonstrated in [2] with hyperboloidal similarity coordinates and a height function of the form\n\n$$\nh(\\xi)=\\alpha \\sqrt{1+\\alpha^{-2}|\\xi|^{2}}-\\alpha-\\beta\n$$\n\nfor some $\\alpha \\geq 1, \\beta>0$. The examples in Eqs. (A.1) and (A.2) already bear the characterising properties of height functions in order to yield similarity coordinates on the complement of a cone, which we discuss next.\nA.1. Geometry of graphical similarity coordinates. We impose a convexity condition on the height function in Definition A. 1 and introduce an auxiliary function to determine the geometry of graphical similarity variables.\n\nLemma A.1. Let $h \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $h(0)<0$ and with positive semidefinite Hessian $\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Consider the smooth map $F \\in C^{\\infty}\\left((0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ given by\n\n$$\nF(\\alpha, \\beta, \\xi)=\\alpha h\\left(\\alpha^{-1} \\xi\\right)-\\beta\n$$\n\nThen, for each $(\\beta, \\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ the map $F(., \\beta, \\xi):(0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly monotonously decreasing and the scaling relation\n\n$$\nF(\\alpha, \\lambda \\beta, \\lambda \\xi)=\\lambda F\\left(\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha, \\beta, \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nholds for all $\\lambda>0$.\nProof. First, consider the smooth function $c \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ given by\n\n$$\nc(\\xi)=\\xi^{i}\\left(\\partial_{i} h\\right)(\\xi)-h(\\xi)\n$$\n\nLet $z \\geq 0$. Then\n\n$$\n\\partial_{z} c(z \\xi)=z \\xi^{i} \\xi^{j}\\left(\\partial_{i} \\partial_{j} h\\right)(z \\xi) \\geq 0 \\quad \\text { implies } \\quad c(\\xi) \\geq c(0)=-h(0)>0\n$$\n\nfor all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We find\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\alpha} F(\\alpha, \\beta, \\xi)=-c\\left(\\alpha^{-1} \\xi\\right) \\leq h(0)<0\n$$\n\nso $F(., \\beta, \\xi)$ is strictly monotonously decreasing. The scaling relation follows from\n\n$$\nF(\\alpha, \\lambda \\beta, \\lambda \\xi)=\\alpha h\\left(\\alpha^{-1} \\lambda \\xi\\right)-\\lambda \\beta=\\lambda\\left(\\left(\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha\\right) h\\left(\\left(\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha\\right)^{-1} \\xi\\right)-\\beta\\right)=\\lambda F\\left(\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha, \\beta, \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nIf the height function satisfies the assumptions of Lemma A.1, then graphical similarity variables provide a coordinate system on their image.\n\nLemma A.2. Let $h \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $h(0)<0$ and positive semidefinite Hessian $\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then, the image $\\mathrm{X}^{1, d} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ of similarity variables $\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ is open and\n\n$$\n\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{X}^{1, d}, \\quad \\chi(\\tau, \\xi)=\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\nis a diffeomorphism with inverse\n\n$$\n\\chi^{-1}: \\mathrm{X}^{1, d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\quad \\chi^{-1}(t, x)=\\left(-\\log h^{+}(t, x), h^{+}(t, x)^{-1} x\\right)\n$$\n\nfor a positive function $h^{+} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathrm{X}^{1, d}\\right)$. Moreover, if $(t, x) \\in \\mathrm{X}^{1, d}$, then for any $\\lambda>0$ also $(\\lambda t, \\lambda x) \\in \\mathrm{X}^{1, d}$ and\n\n$$\nh^{+}(\\lambda t, \\lambda x)=\\lambda h^{+}(t, x)\n$$\n\nProof. According to the inverse function theorem, it suffices to show that $\\chi$ is an injective local diffeomorphism. The assumptions on $h$ yield with Taylor's theorem\n\n$$\nh(\\xi)-\\xi^{i}(\\partial_{i} h)(\\xi)=h(0)-\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\xi^{i} \\xi^{j}\\left(\\partial_{i} \\partial_{j} h\\right)((1-z) \\xi)(1-z) \\mathrm{d} z \\leq h(0)<0\n$$\n\nand hence the Jacobian determinant\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}(\\partial \\chi)(\\tau, \\xi)=\\mathrm{e}^{-(d+1) \\tau}\\left(\\xi^{i}\\left(\\partial_{i} h\\right)(\\xi)-h(\\xi)\\right)\n$$\n\nvanishes nowhere. So $\\chi$ is a local diffeomorphism. To show that $\\chi$ is injective, suppose that $\\left(\\tau_{1}, \\xi_{1}\\right),\\left(\\tau_{2}, \\xi_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with $\\chi\\left(\\tau_{1}, \\xi_{1}\\right)=\\chi\\left(\\tau_{2}, \\xi_{2}\\right)$. This gives\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau_{1}} h\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right)=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau_{2}} h\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right), \\quad \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau_{1}} \\xi_{1}=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau_{2}} \\xi_{2}\n$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$\nh\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right)=\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2}} h\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\left(\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2}\\right)} \\xi_{1}\\right) \\quad \\text { or equivalently } \\quad F\\left(1,0, \\xi_{1}\\right)=F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau_{1}-\\tau_{2}}, 0, \\xi_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nin terms of the function $F$ from Lemma A.1. Strict monotonicity of $F$ in the first argument yields $\\tau_{1}=\\tau_{2}$ and so $\\chi$ is injective. Next, let $(\\tau, \\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and set $(t, x)=\\chi(\\tau, \\xi)$. That is,\n\n$$\nt=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), \\quad x=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\n$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} x\\right)-t=0\n$$\n\nIn terms of the function $F$ from Lemma A.1, this condition means that $F(., t, x)$ has a unique zero $\\alpha=h^{+}(t, x)>0$ which satisfies\n\n$$\n\\tau=-\\log h^{+}(t, x), \\quad \\xi=\\frac{1}{h^{+}(t, x)} x\n$$\n\nFinally, note that $(t, x)=\\chi(\\tau, \\xi)$ gives $(\\lambda t, \\lambda x)=\\chi(\\tau-\\log \\lambda, \\xi)$. Then $h^{+}(\\lambda t, \\lambda x)$ is the unique zero of $F(., \\lambda t, \\lambda x)$ and the scaling condition in Lemma A. 1 yields\n\n$$\n0=F\\left(h^{+}(\\lambda t, \\lambda x), \\lambda t, \\lambda x\\right)=\\lambda F\\left(\\lambda^{-1} h^{+}(\\lambda t, \\lambda x), t, x\\right)\n$$\n\nso by uniqueness $\\lambda^{-1} h^{+}(\\lambda t, \\lambda x)=h^{+}(t, x)$.\nSome geometric quantities of Minkowski spacetime are computed in similarity coordinates in [34, Appendix A]. Next, let us also study the time slices of graphical similarity variables.\n\nLemma A.3. Let $h \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then, for all $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$ the level set\n\n$$\n\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)=\\chi\\left(\\{\\tau\\} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nis a smooth spacelike hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$. The matrix of the first fundamental form of $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$ and its inverse matrix have components\n\n$$\n\\gamma(\\tau)_{i j}=\\mathrm{e}^{-2 \\tau}\\left(\\delta_{i j}-\\left(\\partial_{i} h\\right)\\left(\\partial_{j} h\\right)\\right), \\quad \\gamma(\\tau)^{i j}=\\mathrm{e}^{2 \\tau}\\left(\\delta^{i j}+\\frac{\\left(\\partial^{i} h\\right)\\left(\\partial^{j} h\\right)}{1-|\\partial h|^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nrespectively, and metric determinant\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det} \\gamma(\\tau)=\\mathrm{e}^{-2 d \\tau}\\left(1-|\\partial h|^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, for all $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n\n$$\n\\nu(\\tau)=\\frac{(1, \\partial h)}{\\sqrt{1-|\\partial h|^{2}}} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}\\right)\n$$\n\ndefines the components of a future-directed timelike unit normal vector field for $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$.\n\nProof. For each $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the smooth map\n\n$$\n\\chi(\\tau, \\cdot): \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}, \\quad \\xi \\mapsto\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(\\xi), \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\xi\\right)\n$$\n\ndefines a chart for $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$. Hence, $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$ is a $d$-dimensional smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$. The components of the pullback of the Minkowski metric $\\eta$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ under $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$ are given by\n\n$$\n\\gamma(\\tau)_{i j}=\\eta\\left(\\partial_{i} \\chi(\\tau, \\cdot), \\partial_{j} \\chi(\\tau, \\cdot)\\right)=\\mathrm{e}^{-2 \\tau}\\left(\\delta_{i j}-\\left(\\partial_{i} h\\right)\\left(\\partial_{j} h\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nIf $(\\partial h)(\\xi)=0$, this matrix is a multiple of the identity matrix. If $(\\partial h)(\\xi) \\neq 0$, the matrix has the $(d-1)$-fold eigenvalue $\\mathrm{e}^{-2 \\tau}$ with eigenvectors orthogonal to $(\\partial h)(\\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and the simple eigenvalue $\\mathrm{e}^{-2 \\tau}\\left(1-|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|^{2}\\right)$ with eigenvector $(\\partial h)(\\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Since $|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1$, the matrix is positive definite and thus $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$ is a smooth spacelike hypersurface. The product of these eigenvalues gives the formula for the metric determinant. The inverse of the matrix $\\gamma(\\tau)$ can be computed from a Neumann series. Finally, we have\n\n$$\n\\eta\\left(\\partial_{i} \\chi(\\tau, \\cdot), \\nu(\\tau)\\right)=0, \\quad \\eta(\\nu(\\tau), \\nu(\\tau))=-1\n$$\n\nfor $i=1, \\ldots, d$.\nIt follows that the image of similarity coordinates is foliated by its time slices. This foliation also covers future lightlike infinity in the following sense.\nLemma A.4. Let $h \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\nh(0)<0, \\quad|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1, \\quad\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi) \\text { is positive semidefinite, }\n$$\n\nfor all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Let $\\tau \\neq \\tau^{\\prime}$. Then $\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)$ is not asymptotic to $\\Sigma^{1, d}\\left(\\tau^{\\prime}\\right)$.\nProof. Note that for fixed $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$, each level set\n\n$$\n\\Sigma^{1, d}(\\tau)=\\left\\{\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} \\xi\\right), \\xi\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d} \\mid \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfrom Lemma A. 3 is the graph of the function $\\xi \\mapsto \\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} \\xi\\right)=F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, 0, \\xi\\right)$, where $F$ is defined in Lemma A.1. We show that none of these graphs are asymptotic to each other. As in the proof of Lemma A.1, we compute\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, 0, \\xi\\right)=\\xi^{i}\\left(\\partial_{i} h\\right)\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} \\xi\\right)-h\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} \\xi\\right) \\geq-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} h(0)\n$$\n\nfor all $(\\tau, \\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and conclude for $\\tau \\neq \\tau^{\\prime}$ that\n\n$$\nF\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, 0, \\xi\\right)-F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau^{\\prime}}, 0, \\xi\\right) \\geq-h(0)\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau^{\\prime}}-\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}\\right)>0\n$$\n\nfor all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\nA.2. Radially symmetric height functions. So far, we have formulated conditions for graphical similarity variables to yield a coordinate system on their image. Here, we describe the image in case the height function is radially symmetric. We begin with locating the backward light cone of the origin in similarity coordinates.\nLemma A.5. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with $h(0)<0$ and $|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and with radial profile $\\widetilde{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{ev}}^{\\infty}([0, \\infty))$. Then, the function\n\n$$\n[0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, \\quad \\rho \\mapsto \\widetilde{h}(\\rho)^{2}-\\rho^{2}\n$$\n\nis strictly monotonously decreasing and has a unique simple zero $R_{0}>0$.\nProof. The assumptions imply $0 \\leq \\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho)<1$ and $\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)<\\rho$. This gives $\\widetilde{h}(\\rho) \\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho)-\\rho<0$ for all $\\rho>0$ and so $\\rho \\mapsto \\widetilde{h}(\\rho)^{2}-\\rho^{2}$ is strictly monotonously decreasing. Since $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho)-1<0$ and $\\widetilde{h}(0)<0$, we have $\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)-\\rho<0$ for all $\\rho \\geq 0$. Because $\\widetilde{h}(0)+\\rho<\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)+\\rho<2 \\rho$ and $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho)+1>1$, there is a unique $R_{0}>0$ such that $\\widetilde{h}\\left(R_{0}\\right)+R_{0}=0$. This is the unique zero of $\\widetilde{h}^{2}(\\rho)-\\rho^{2}=(\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)+\\rho)(\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)-\\rho)$.\n\nThe image of similarity coordinates with a radially symmetric height function is the complement of a cone.\n\nLemma A.6. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\nh(0)<0, \\quad|(\\partial h)(\\xi)|<1, \\quad\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi) \\text { is positive semidefinite, }\n$$\n\nfor all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and with radial profile $\\widetilde{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{ev}}^{\\infty}([0, \\infty))$. Let $R>0$. Then, graphical similarity coordinates $\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ have the image regions\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\chi\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right) & =\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}|\\kappa| x \\mid>t\\right\\} \\\\\n\\chi\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) & =\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}\\left|\\kappa_{R}\\right| x \\mid>t\\right\\} \\\\\n\\chi\\left((0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right) & =\\left\\{(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}\\left|\\kappa_{R}\\right| x \\mid>t>\\widetilde{h}(|x|)\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\kappa=\\lim _{\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty} \\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\kappa_{R}=\\frac{\\widetilde{h}(R)}{R}\n$$\n\nProof. Lemma A. 2 yields that $\\chi: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ are coordinates on their image. Now, suppose $(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ with $(t, x)=\\chi(\\tau, \\xi)$ for some $(\\tau, \\xi) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. If $x=0$ then $\\xi=0$ and $t=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\widetilde{h}(0)<0$. If $x \\neq 0$, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{t}{|x|}=\\frac{\\widetilde{h}(|\\xi|)}{|\\xi|}\n$$\n\nSince the map $(0, \\infty) \\ni \\rho \\mapsto \\rho^{-1} \\widetilde{h}(\\rho)$ is strictly monotonously increasing by Lemma A. 1 with\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\widetilde{h}(\\rho)}{\\rho}=\\lim _{\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty} \\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho)=: \\kappa \\in[0,1]\n$$\n\nwe get $\\kappa|x|>t$. If additionally $0<|\\xi|<R$ and $\\tau>0$ we conclude from strict monotonicity that $\\kappa_{R}|x|>t$. On the other hand, fix $(t, x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ with $\\kappa|x|>t$ and consider the map $\\tau \\mapsto F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, t, x\\right)=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau} \\widetilde{h}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau}|x|\\right)-t$. By Lemma A.1, this map is strictly monotonously increasing and we have\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\tau \\rightarrow-\\infty} F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, t, x\\right)=-\\infty \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\lim _{\\tau \\rightarrow \\infty} F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, t, x\\right)=\\kappa|x|-t>0\n$$\n\nso there exists a unique $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $F\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\tau}, t, x\\right)=0$. Then $\\tau$ and $\\xi:=\\mathrm{e}^{\\tau} x$ satisfy $\\chi(\\tau, \\xi)=(t, x)$. If we are given $\\kappa_{R}|x|>t>\\widetilde{h}(|x|)$, then Eq. (A.4) and strict monotonicity imply $\\tau>0$ and $|\\xi|<R$.\n\nThe previous lemma also shows that coordinate cylinders get mapped to complements of cones. On such regions, we consider the transition diffeomorphism between radial similarity coordinates.\n\nLemma A.7. Let $\\chi, \\bar{\\chi}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{1, d}$ be graphical similarity coordinates with respective radially symmetric height functions $h, \\bar{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ as in Lemma A.6. Let $R, \\bar{R}>0$ such that $\\chi\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)=\\bar{\\chi}\\left(\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$. Then, there is a positive function $h_{+} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ such that the transition diffeomorphism $\\chi^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\chi}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{\\bar{R}}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\left(\\chi^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\chi}\\right)(\\bar{\\tau}, \\bar{\\xi})=\\left(\\bar{\\tau}-\\log h_{+}(\\bar{\\xi}), h_{+}(\\bar{\\xi})^{-1} \\bar{\\xi}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. By Lemma A.6, the transition diffeomorphism $\\chi^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\chi}: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{\\bar{R}}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{B}_{\\bar{R}}^{d}$ is well-defined. By Lemma A.2, there is a positive radially symmetric function $h^{+} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\chi^{-1} \\circ \\bar{\\chi}\\right)(\\bar{\\tau}, \\bar{\\xi})=\\left(\\bar{\\tau}-\\log h^{+}(\\bar{h}(\\bar{\\xi}), \\bar{\\xi}), h^{+}(\\bar{h}(\\bar{\\xi}), \\bar{\\xi})^{-1} \\bar{\\xi}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow set $h_{+}(\\bar{\\xi})=h^{+}(\\bar{h}(\\bar{\\xi}), \\bar{\\xi})>0$. Since $h, \\bar{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$, also $h_{+} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$.\n\nA.3. Construction of height functions. Similarity coordinates with a radially symmetric height function as in Lemma A. 6 can be concretely implemented in various ways. To give some examples, we first translate positive semidefiniteness of a radial function to nonnegativity of the second derivative of its radial profile.\n\nLemma A.8. Let $h \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with radial profile $\\widetilde{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{vv}}^{\\infty}([0, \\infty))$. Then, the Hessian matrix $\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ is positive semidefinite for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ if and only if $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\rho) \\geq 0$ for all $\\rho \\geq 0$.\n\nProof. We have for the second partial derivatives of $h$ the identity\n\n$$\n\\left(\\partial_{i} \\partial_{j} h\\right)(\\xi)=(D \\widetilde{h})(|\\xi|) \\delta_{i j}+\\left(D^{2} \\widetilde{h}\\right)(|\\xi|) \\xi_{i} \\xi_{j}\n$$\n\nin terms of the operation $(D \\widetilde{h})(\\rho)=\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho) / \\rho$. Now, suppose that $\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ is positive semidefinite for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then\n\n$$\n0 \\leq v^{\\top}\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi) v=(D \\widetilde{h})(|\\xi|)|v|^{2}+\\left(D^{2} \\widetilde{h}\\right)(|\\xi|)(\\xi \\cdot v)^{2}\n$$\n\nfor all $v, \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $v^{\\top}$ denotes the transpose vector. Thus $(D \\widetilde{h})(|\\xi|) \\geq 0$ and $\\left(D^{2} \\widetilde{h}\\right)(|\\xi|) \\geq 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, hence also\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\rho)=(D \\widetilde{h})(\\rho)+\\rho^{2}\\left(D^{2} \\widetilde{h}\\right)(\\rho) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nfor all $\\rho \\geq 0$. Conversely, suppose that $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\rho) \\geq 0$ for all $\\rho \\geq 0$. Since $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(0)=0$, it follows that also $\\widetilde{h}^{\\prime}(\\rho) \\geq 0$ for all $\\rho \\geq 0$. Hence $\\left(\\partial^{2} h\\right)(\\xi)$ is positive semidefinite for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n\nWe end this section with the presentation of an exemplary class of radially symmetric height functions. The associated similarity coordinates have the convenient property to coincide with standard similarity coordinates in a backward light cone, whereas beyond they can be arranged to extend to any possible image according to Lemma A.6.\n\nLemma A.9. Let $0<\\bar{\\kappa}<1, \\bar{r}>0$ and $0<\\varepsilon<\\bar{r}$. Then, there is a function $\\bar{h} \\in C_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ with positive semidefinite Hessian $\\left(\\partial^{2} \\bar{h}\\right)(\\xi)$ and bounded gradient $|(\\partial \\widetilde{h})(\\xi)|<1$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ which satisfies\n\n$$\n\\bar{h}(\\xi)= \\begin{cases}\\bar{\\kappa}(|\\xi|-\\bar{r})-1 & \\text { if }|\\xi| \\geq \\bar{r}+\\varepsilon \\\\ -1 & \\text { if }|\\xi| \\leq \\bar{r}-\\varepsilon\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProof.

Indeed, since $\\bar{h} \\equiv-1$ in $[0,1]$, Eq. (B.16) reduces in $(0,1)$ precisely to [98, Eq. (2.8)], which has for $\\lambda=\\frac{d}{2}$ a smooth solution given in [98, Eq. (2.13)]. Since Eq.

Solutions in case $\\ell=0$ are smooth and even, so if $\\mathbf{F}$ is radially symmetric, also the mode solution to problem (B.14) is radially symmetric.

By density and boundedness this extends to $\\mathfrak{H}_{\\mathrm{rad}}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$.\n\n(3) The semigroup is established in the spaces $\\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. So [54, Theorem C.1] gives $\\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in \\mathfrak{H}^{k}\\left(\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Hence $\\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}}_{R}^{d}\\right)^{2}$ for all $\\tau \\geq 0$ by Sobolev embedding. Using [43, p. 50, 1.3 Lemma], we have\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\overline{\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\tau \\geq 0$. By induction, $\\partial_{\\tau}^{\\ell} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau)=\\mathbf{L}_{\\chi}^{\\ell} \\mathbf{u}(\\tau) \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{B}}_{R}^{d}\\right)^{2}$ for all $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Schwarz's theorem [104, p. 235, Theorem 9.41] implies $\\mathbf{u} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left((0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{B}_{R}^{d}\\right)^{2}$. Finally, the transition lemma B. 1 yields that $u$ solves the Cauchy problem.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[1] Pawe\u0142 Biernat, Piotr Bizo\u0144, and Maciej Maliborski.
