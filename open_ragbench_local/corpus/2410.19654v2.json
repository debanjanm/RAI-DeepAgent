      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nWe study some properties of the growth rate of languages defined by sets of forbidden factors. Given an alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$ and a set of factors $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$, we denote by $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ the set of words over $\\mathcal{A}$ that do not contain any occurrences of factors from $\\mathcal{F}$. For all $n$, we let $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ be the set of words from $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ of length $n$. The growth rate $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ of $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|^{1 / n}\n$$\n\nThe so-called topological entropy of the corresponding subshift is given by $\\log \\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ (see for instance [1]).\n\nA sequence $\\left(s_{n}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is submultiplicative if $s_{n+m} \\leqslant s_{n} s_{m}$ for every $n, m \\geqslant 1$. Fekete's lemma states that for every submultiplicative nonnegative sequence $\\left(s_{n}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, we have $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{s_{n}}=\\inf _{n} \\sqrt[n]{s_{n}}$. The sequence $\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is submultiplicative, so for every $n$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant \\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})^{n}\n$$\n\nWe also later use the version for a supermultiplicative positive sequence $\\left(s_{n}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, which states that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{s_{n}}=\\sup _{n} \\sqrt[n]{s_{n}}$ (a sequence $s_{n}$ is supermultiplicative if $s_{n+m} \\geqslant s_{n} s_{m}$ for every $n, m \\geqslant 1$ ). The two versions can be seen to be dual forms of each other. Although it is quite obvious by definition that $\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is submultiplicative, some insight is required to prove a weak form of supermultiplicativity of the same sequence.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *LIRMM, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, CNRS, 161 Rue Ada, 34095, Montpellier, France\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ UET, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, 144 Xuan Thuy Street, Hanoi, 100000, Vietnam\n\nWhen the set $\\mathcal{F}$ is finite, the growth rate is given by the spectral radius of the matrix associated with the finite automaton that accepts this language. Using elementary linear algebra, this implies all sorts of nice properties. For instance, $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ is computable and even algebraic. It also entails more precise versions of (1): There are computable constants $c, t \\geqslant 0$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\sim c n^{t} \\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})^{n}$.\n\nHowever, when $\\mathcal{F}$ is infinite, the situation is obviously more complicated and more interesting. The motivation behind this work stems from the following result.\nTheorem 1 $\\left([2,3,1]^{1}\\right)$. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet and let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$be a set of factors. Suppose there exists $\\beta>1$ such that\n\n$$\n|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant \\beta+\\sum_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\beta^{1-|f|}\n$$\n\nthen for all $n \\geqslant 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant \\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\n$$\n\nIn particular, this implies\n\n$$\n\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F}) \\geqslant \\beta\n$$\n\nThe different proofs of this result rely on similar ideas that we also adapt in this article. The first occurrence of this idea seems to be by Golod and \u0160afarevi\u010d in an algebraic context [4]. Almost forty years later, Bell and Goh discovered that the same idea could be used in combinatorics on words [5]. Miller's proof seems to be independent of Golod and \u0160afarevi\u010d's article, but relies on a similar idea. A similar idea was also independently rediscovered by Kolpakov [6, 7], and improved by Shur [8, 9] (see [10], for a survey on this topic in relation to the growth of power-free languages).\n\nThe readers should note that (2) as well as other equations in the article involve $|f|$ for $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$. A small issue is that different sets $\\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden factors may give the same language $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$. Therefore, most bounds in this article depend on the choice of $\\mathcal{F}$. However, it is not hard to see that we can always choose $\\mathcal{F}$ to be minimal, in the sense that each factor in $\\mathcal{F}$ avoids all the other factors in $\\mathcal{F}$. For a given language $\\mathcal{L}$, this choice of $\\mathcal{F}$ always gives the best bounds among all the choices. However, there are other ways to improve this choice of $\\mathcal{F}$. For instance, it is known that the growth of infinitely extendable words from $\\mathcal{L}$ is the same as the growth of $\\mathcal{L}$ which can be used to obtain even better bounds.\n\nThe condition of this theorem is general enough to solve open problems about specific languages (see for instance, $[3,1]$ ). Extensions of the technique behind this proof were also used by the second author to study other related problems, in particular in the context of avoidability of powers $[11,12,13]$. However, for any particular language, it is hard to say how good the lower bound is, and it says nothing about the computability of $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$. However, by making the inequality (2) strict, we can actually prove the following weak form of supermultiplicativity for $\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\right)_{n}$, whose corollaries include a lower bound on $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$.\nTheorem 2. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet and let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$be a set of factors. Suppose there exists $\\beta>1$ such that\n\n$$\n|\\mathcal{A}|>\\beta+\\sum_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\beta^{1-|f|}\n$$\n\nthen there exists $C>0$ for all $n, m \\geqslant 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+m}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant C \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{m}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ To be precise the proof in [2] only implies that $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F}) \\geqslant 1$ under these hypotheses.\n\nTheorem 2 is in fact a corollary of Theorem 3, which also provides an explicit expression $C=1-\\sum_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}}(|f|-1) \\beta^{-|f|}$ (the deduction is given in Corollary 8). Subshifts with property (3) are called boundedly supermultiplicative shifts in [14] and this property also plays a central role in [15]. The condition of our approach is more explicit in terms of constants than the condition given by Pavlov [15, Theorem 4.3]. The difference in techniques allows us to conclude for all $n, m$ instead of only sufficiently large $n, m$ as in Pavlov's approach. We discuss this comparison in more detail in Section 2.4.\n\nInequalities (1) and (3) imply that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|^{1 / n} \\cdot C^{1 / n} \\leqslant \\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F}) \\leqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|^{1 / n}\n$$\n\nUnder the assumption that $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ and $C$ can be computed (or that some positive lower bound on $C$ can be computed), the growth rate $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ can also be computed.\n\nWith more information about the set $\\mathcal{F}$, one can improve the conclusions of Theorem 1. In particular, in the case of $p$-powers or patterns, we have a stronger version of this theorem [3]. Similarly, we can also obtain a stronger version of our result in the setting of avoidability of $p$-powers. In particular, it allows us to prove (4) for the language of square-free words over an alphabet of size 5 for some constant $C$. The particular attention given to $p$-powers is motivated by the fact that this subject received a lot of attention in combinatorics on words since the seminal work of Thue [16].\n\nWe use a similar technique once more to give a partial resolution to a conjecture by Shur about the growth of the number of circular-square-free words [17]. Circular words can be seen as cyclically ordered finite sequences of letters. That is, we interpret the word as written on a circle, and we read factors along this circle. More formally, we say that two words $u$ and $v$ are conjugate if there are words $s, t$ such that $u=s t$ and $v=t s$. The cyclic word $\\hat{u}$, is the set of conjugates of the word $u$, and we say that $\\hat{u}$ avoids a factor $f$ if for all conjugates $v \\in \\hat{u}$, we have $v$ avoids $f$. In [17], Shur proved that the number of square-free circular words of length $n$ and minimal squares of length $2 n$ (squares that do not contain another square as a proper factor) grows at the same rate [17, Proposition 1]. In the same article, Shur wrote:\n\nFrom computer experiments, we learn that the growth rate for the set of ternary square-free circular words is approximately 1.3. This growth rate obviously cannot exceed the growth rate for the set of ternary square-free ordinary words. For the latter one, a nearly exact value is now known [18]. It is $1.30176 \\ldots$, so it is quite intriguing whether the two considered growth rates coincide.\n\nThe question of estimating the number of ternary square-free circular words was also explicitly asked in [19]. We prove in Theorem 14 that Shur's conjecture is true for any alphabet of size at least 5 , but we leave open the cases of the alphabets of size 4 and 3 . The question of $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words has also been studied in a context more general than squares [20, 21], so we also provide a general sufficient condition on $\\mathcal{F}$ in Theorem 16 that ensures the existence of $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words.\n\nAs already mentioned, all of these proofs rely on similar ideas, some of which can already be found in the proof of Theorem 1. We start Section 2 by reproducing the proof of Theorem 1. We then state and prove Theorem 3, and we discuss a few consequences and applications. In Section 3, we prove a version of this result tailored to the context of avoidability of $p$-powers. Finally, in Section 4 we provide our partial solution to Shur's conjecture and our general condition for the existence of $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words.",

Miller [2] gave simple sufficient conditions in terms of $i$ and $|\\mathcal{A}|$ such that $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F}) \\geqslant 1$. He also proved that these conditions are optimal in the sense that for every $(i,|\\mathcal{A}|)$ that does not respect the condition, there is a choice of $\\mathcal{F}$ such that $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})=0$. The second author improved this result by providing lower bounds on $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ for each of these cases [12].

The first three pairs of cells of this table are empty, because there is no $\\beta$ satisfying equation (10). In these three cases the corresponding subshift is empty for some choices of $\\mathcal{F}$ as already argued in $[2,1]$. As we will see, the case $|\\mathcal{A}|=3$ and $i=2$ is also optimal. Over the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}=\\{0,1,2\\}$, consider the set $\\mathcal{F}=01^{*} 2:=\\{02,012,0112,01112, \\ldots\\}$. It is not hard to see that $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ is exactly the set of words that contain no 2 after a 0 , that is,\n\n$\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})=\\left\\{u 0 v: u \\in\\{1,2\\}^{*}, v \\in\\{0,1\\}^{*}\\right\\} \\cup\\{1,2\\}^{*}$.

Indeed, $\\mathcal{F}$ was constructed to ensure that the different crucial inequalities from the proofs are tight.\n\nWhen $C$ is known and if we can compute $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ for any $n$, then we can compute arbitrarily good approximations of $\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$. Therefore, a simple inspection of Table 1 implies the following.\n\nCorollary 7.

However, in this setting, there is a more efficient way to use the same ideas. In this section, we provide a version of these two theorems tailored to $p$-power-free words. The proof of the following result resembles the proof of Theorem 1. A similar result was also provided in $[13]$.\n\nTheorem 10. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet and let $p>1$.

This concludes our induction.\n\nRemark 1. The proof of Theorem 11 is slightly more complicated than the corresponding general result in Theorem 3. Indeed, our proof of Theorem 11 requires an inductive argument for the cases $p<2$ (for $p \\geqslant 2$, we could have directly adapted the proof from Theorem 3). On the other hand, using a similar inductive argument in the proof of Theorem 3 does not improve the bounds.\n\nFor the sake of illustration, we provide the following two corollaries of these two theorems for the case of square-free words, that is, $p=2$.\nCorollary 12. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet with $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 4$. Let\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{|\\mathcal{A}|+\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{A}|^{2}-4|\\mathcal{A}|}}{2}\n$$\n\nthen for all $n \\geqslant 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant \\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n$$\n\nProof. We have\n\n$$\n\\beta=\\frac{|\\mathcal{A}|+\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{A}|^{2}-4|\\mathcal{A}|}}{2}=\\max \\left\\{x: x+\\frac{x}{x-1} \\leqslant|\\mathcal{A}|\\right\\}>1\n$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$\n|\\mathcal{A}|-\\sum_{\\ell \\geqslant 1} \\beta^{1-\\ell}=|\\mathcal{A}|-\\frac{\\beta}{\\beta-1} \\geqslant \\beta\n$$\n\nWe can then apply Theorem 10 to conclude.\n\nCorollary 13. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet with $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 5$ and let $\\beta=\\frac{|\\mathcal{A}|+\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{A}|^{2}-4|\\mathcal{A}|}}{2}$. Then for all $n, m \\geqslant 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+m}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant C \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{m}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nC=1-\\frac{1+\\beta}{(\\beta-1)^{2}}>0\n$$\n\nProof. We first verify that $C>0$. For $|\\mathcal{A}|=5$, explicit computation of $C$ yields approximately 0.3262 . Since $C$ is an increasing function of $\\beta$, which is an increasing function of $|\\mathcal{A}|$, we have $C>0$ for all $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 5$.\n\nBy Corollary 12, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant \\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|$, for all $n \\geqslant 0$.

      "text": "# 4 Square-free circular words and $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words \n\nLet $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)$ be the set of words $w$ such that $\\hat{w}$ is a square-free circular word over the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$, and for all $n, \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)$ consists of those of length $n$.\n\nThe main idea behind our proof is that there are so many square-free words of a given length that only a fraction of them can fail to be square-free circular words.\n\nTheorem 14. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet. Suppose there exists $\\beta>1$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant$ $\\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|$ for all $n \\geqslant 0$ and let\n\n$$\nC:=1-\\frac{1+\\beta}{(\\beta-1)^{2}}>0\n$$\n\nthen for all $n \\geqslant 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant C \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n$$\n\nProof. Let $n \\geqslant 0$ and $\\mathfrak{B}=\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2) \\backslash \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)$, which implies\n\n$$\n\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|=\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|-|\\mathfrak{B}|\n$$\n\nFor any $w \\in \\mathfrak{B}, w$ is square-free and there exists words $p, v, s$ such that $w=p v s, p$ and $s$ are non-empty, and $s p$ is a square. For all $i, j$, we let $\\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}$ be the set of words from $\\mathfrak{B}$ that can be written $w=p v s$ where $s p$ is a square of period $i$ and $|s|=j$. This implies\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{B}=\\bigcup_{\\substack{i \\geq 1 \\\\ j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 2 i-1\\}}} \\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}\n$$\n\nwhich itself implies\n\n$$\n|\\mathfrak{B}| \\leqslant \\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} \\sum_{j=1}^{2 i-1}\\left|\\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}\\right|\n$$\n\nFix $i, j$ and without loss of generality, we assume $j \\geqslant i$, the other case being symmetric. For $w \\in \\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}$, we write $w=p v s$ where $|s|=j$ and $s p$ is a square of period $i$. Let $s=s^{\\prime} s^{\\prime \\prime}$ such that $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ is the suffix of $s$ of length $i$ (which is well-defined since $|s|=j \\geqslant i$ ). Since $s^{\\prime} s^{\\prime \\prime} p$ is a square of period $i$, we have $s^{\\prime \\prime}=p s^{\\prime}$. That is, for any word $w \\in \\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}$, the word $w$ is uniquely determined by its prefix of length $|w|-i$. Since this prefix is necessarily square-free, this implies\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}\\right| \\leqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n-i}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\leqslant \\frac{\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|}{\\beta^{i}}\n$$\n\nUsing this with equations (20) and (21), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| & =\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|-|\\mathfrak{B}| \\\\\n& \\geqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|-\\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} \\sum_{j=1}^{2 i-1}\\left|\\mathfrak{B}_{i, j}\\right| \\\\\n& \\geqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\left[1-\\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} \\sum_{j=1}^{2 i-1} \\beta^{-i}\\right] \\\\\n& \\geqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\left[1-\\sum_{i \\geqslant 1}(2 i-1) \\beta^{-i}\\right] \\\\\n& \\geqslant\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\left[1-\\frac{1+\\beta}{(\\beta-1)^{2}}\\right] \\\\\n& =C\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich concludes our proof.\nWe obtain more explicit bounds by combining this result with Corollary 12.\nCorollary 15. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet with $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 5$. Let\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\frac{|\\mathcal{A}|+\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{A}|^{2}-4|\\mathcal{A}|}}{2}, \\text { and } C:=1-\\frac{1+\\beta}{(\\beta-1)^{2}}\n$$\n\nthen $C>0$ and\n\n$$\n\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant C\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n$$\n\nProof. By Corollary 12, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant \\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\n$$\n\nSo by definition of $C$, we can apply Theorem 14, and we get $\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant C \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|$, with $C=1-\\frac{1+\\beta}{(\\beta-1)^{2}}$, as desired.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable 2: The values of $C$ given by Corollary 15\n\nWe give in Table 2 of the corresponding values of $C$ for small values of $|\\mathcal{A}|$. It is not hard to verify that the $C$ given in Corollary 15 behaves like $1-\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|}-o\\left(\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{A}|}\\right)$, as $|\\mathcal{A}|$ goes to infinity.\n\nWe have proven that over any alphabet of size at least 5 the number of square-free circular words has the same growth rate as the number of square-free words. The question remains open for alphabets of size 3 and 4 . It was first proven by Currie [22] that there are square-free circular ternary words of all lengths other than $5,7,9,10,14,17$. The existence of these six lengths implies that we cannot hope for the existence of a positive constant $C$ such that for all $n,\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\{0,1,2\\}, 2)\\right| \\geqslant C\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\{0,1,2\\}, 2)\\right|$. If it is possible to use the same technique for the case of ternary words, it probably requires handling all these cases, which probably entails a computer assisted proof. It might be easier to deal with the alphabet of size 4 , but we do not know how to do it.\n\nRemark 2. The supermultiplicativity (resp. submultiplicativity) of $\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}$ and the fact that $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)$ are within a constant multiple of each other imply that the sequence $\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}$ is also supermultiplicative (resp. submultiplicative). We wonder whether one could find a more direct proof for any of these properties for $\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}$ (in this case even submultiplicativity is not as obvious as for the sequence $\\left.\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, 2)\\right|\\right)_{n \\geqslant 0}\\right)$. We also wonder the same thing for $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words.\n$\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words We now state a version of Theorem 14 in the general setting of $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular words. For any set $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$, let $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ be the set of words $w$ such that $\\hat{w}$ is a $\\mathcal{F}$-free circular word over the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$, and for all $n, \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ contains those of length $n$.\n\nTheorem 16. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet and let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$be a set of factors. Suppose there exists $\\beta>1$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n+1}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant \\beta\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|$ for all $n \\geqslant 0$, and such that\n\n$$\nC:=1-\\sum_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}}(|f|-1) \\beta^{-|f|}>0\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\geqslant C \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\n$$\n\nThe explicit version of submultiplicativity and supermultiplicativity of $\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\right)_{n}$ can be written as\n\n$$\nC^{2}\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{m}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\leqslant\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n+m}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\leqslant C^{-2}\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{m}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|\n$$\n\nThe proof of Theorem 16 is an assemblage of the ideas of the proof of Theorem 3 and of the proof of Theorem 14, and it is left to the reader. The remarks of Subsection 2.3 also apply to this result, which can be translated into the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 17. Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be an alphabet and let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^{+}$be a set of factors. Suppose there exists $\\beta \\geqslant 1$ such that\n\n$$\n|\\mathcal{A}|>\\sum_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\beta^{1-|f|}+\\beta\n$$\n\nthen the growth rate $\\hat{\\alpha}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ of the language $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})=\\alpha\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right) \\geqslant \\beta\n$$\n\nCircular-free, supermultiplicativity and the Restivo-Salemi property Note that $C$ from Theorem 16 (resp. Corollary 15) is the same as in Theorem 3 (resp. Corollary 13). However, these constants are not optimal in general, but the optimal constants might be equal as well for many well-behaved languages. Roughly speaking, these two constants give a lower bound on the probability that two valid words can be concatenated without creating a forbidden factor. In Theorem 3 the two words are taken independently, while in Theorem 16 these two words are the prefix and suffix of the same word. Our intuition is that for a random $p$-free word the prefix and suffix of length $n$ are almost independent if the word is long enough. This motivates the following definitions and problem. For any infinite language $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})$, we let\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{C}_{t}=\\frac{\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{2 t}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|}{\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{t}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right| \\cdot\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{t}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\hat{C}_{t}=\\frac{\\left|\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{t}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|}{\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{t}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|}\n$$\n\nProblem 1. For which set $\\mathcal{F}$ is it true that $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\widetilde{C}_{t}=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\hat{C}_{t}$ ? In particular, when are these limits well-defined?\n\nWe believe that this should be true for many reasonable sets $\\mathcal{F}$. In particular, we conjecture that this should be true for $p$-power free words. These two quantities are also related to $C_{t}$, where for all $t$,\n\n$$\nC_{t}=\\frac{\\left|\\mathcal{L}_{n}(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})\\right|}{\\alpha(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{F})^{n}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we have $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\widetilde{C}_{t}=\\frac{1}{\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} C_{t}}$, whenever the two limits are well-defined.\nIt appears that this question might be related to whether or not the language has the Restivo-Salemi property. For any language $\\mathcal{L}$, we let $e(\\mathcal{L})$ be the set of words that are infinitely extendable in both directions, that is, $e(\\mathcal{L})=\\left\\{w \\in \\mathcal{L}: \\forall n, \\exists u, v \\in \\mathcal{A}^{n}, u w v \\in \\mathcal{L}\\right\\}$. Following [18], we say that a language has the Restivo-Salemi property, ${ }^{2}$ if for all $u, v \\in$ $e(\\mathcal{L})$ there exists $w \\in \\mathcal{A}^{*}$ such that $u w v \\in e(\\mathcal{L})$. In particular, Shur conjectured that any language defined by avoidance of $p$-powers has the Restivo-Salemi property [18]. Recent progress on this conjecture include the cases $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 2$ and $p=3$ [24] and $|\\mathcal{A}| \\geqslant 3$ and $p \\geqslant 5$ [25]. The kind of random-like structural properties of a language that imply the Restivo-Salemi property might be related to the ones that imply the equality in Problem 1. The technique in this article could also be useful to solve some of the missing cases of Shur's conjecture on the Restivo-Salemi property of $p$-power free languages, but we leave this open as we were not able to make any progress ourselves on this problem.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The name is motivated by the problems presented by Salemi and Restivo [23].",
