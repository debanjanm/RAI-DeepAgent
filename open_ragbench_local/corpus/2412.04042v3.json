Unfortunately, computing the crossing number of a given graph, that is, the minimum number of crossings over all drawings of the graph, is NP-hard [28], even for graphs that become planar after removal of a single edge [15]. On the other hand, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the natural parameter, that is, the number of crossings [30,34]. Many variants of the crossing number have been studied; see Schaefer's survey [45]. Two variants with geometric restrictions have attracted considerable attention: 2-layer crossing minimization and circular (or convex, or 1-page) crossing minimization, where the placement of the vertices is restricted to two parallel lines (called layers) and to a circle, respectively. In both cases, edges are drawn as straight-line segments. Circular crossing minimization is NP-hard, but admits FPT-algorithms with respect to the natural parameter $[6,35]$. In practice, often the so-called sifting heuristic is used [7]. Circular crossing minimization can be seen as a special case of a book embedding problem, where vertices must lie on a straight line, the spine of the book, and each edge must be drawn on one of a given number of halfplanes called pages whose intersection is the spine. In this setting, crossing minimization is interesting even if the order of the vertices along the spine is given $[8,39]$.\n\nThe 2-layer variant comes in two settings: one-sided crossing minimization (OSCM) and two-sided crossing minimization (TSCM). In OSCM, the input consists of a (bipartite) graph and a linear order for the vertices on one side of the bipartition; the task is to find a linear order for the vertices on the other side that minimizes the total number of crossings. In TSCM, the linear orders on both layers can be chosen freely. OSCM is an important step in the so-called Sugiyama framework for drawing hierarchical graphs [47], that is, graphs where each vertex is assigned to a specific layer. OSCM was the topic of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE ${ }^{1}$ ) 2024. Both OSCM and TSCM are NP-hard; OSCM even for the disjoint union of 4 -stars [40] and for trees [20]. On the positive side, OSCM admits a subexponential FPT-algorithm; it runs in $O\\left(k 2^{\\sqrt{2 k}}+n\\right)$ time [36]. TSCM also admits an FPT-algorithm; it runs in $2^{O(k)}+n^{O(1)}$ time [37].\n\nIn the context of beyond-planar graphs, a local version of the crossing number has also received considerable attention [19, 23]. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. The local crossing number of a graph is the smallest $k$ such that the graph is $k$-planar. The recognition of 1-planar graphs has long been known to be NP-hard [29]. Later, it turned out that the recognition of $k$-planar graphs is NP-hard for every $k$ [48]. Hence, it is unlikely that FPT- or XP-algorithms exist with respect to the natural parameter $k$. On the other hand, recognizing 1-planar graphs is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to tree-depth and cyclomatic number [5]. The problem remains NP-hard, however, for graphs of bounded bandwidth (and hence, pathwidth and treewidth). The local crossing number has also been studied in the context of book embeddings [1,38].\n\nIn this paper, we study the above-mentioned geometric restrictions, but with respect to the local crossing number. The resulting graph classes are called 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs; see Figure 1. The former were studied by Angelini, Da Lozzo, F\u00f6rster, and Schneck [3]. Among others, they gave bounds on the edge density of these graphs and characterized 2-layer $k$-planar graphs with the maximum edge density for $k \\in\\{2,4\\}$. They concluded that \"the general recognition and characterization of 2-layer $k$-planar graphs\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ https://pacechallenge.org/2024/\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n(a)\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n(b)\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n(c)\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n(d)\n\nFigure 1 Drawings of the same bipartite graph with optimal local crossing number in different settings: (a) planar drawing, (b) 2-layer 2-planar drawing without restriction, (c) 2-layer 3-planar drawing where the vertex order on the upper layer is fixed, (d) outer 1-planar drawing.\nremain important open problems\". According to Schaefer's survey [45] on crossing numbers, Kainen [33] introduced the \"local outerplanar crossing number\", which minimizes, over all circular drawings, the largest number of crossings along any edge. Outer $k$-planar graphs have been studied by Pach and T\u00f3th [41], who showed that any outer $k$-planar graph with $n$ vertices has at most $4.1 \\sqrt{k} n$ edges. For $k \\leq 3$, they established a better bound $(k+3)(n-2)$, which is tight for $k \\in\\{1,2\\}$. For $k \\geq 5$, the constant factor was later improved to $\\sqrt{243 / 40} \\approx 2.46[2]$.\n\nWe study the parameterized complexity of the two recognition problems with respect to the natural parameter $k$. For $k=0$, the two classes of graphs are exactly the caterpillars and outerplanar graphs, respectively, which can be recognized in linear time. There are also linear-time algorithms for recognizing outer 1-planar graphs $[4,31]$. The authors of [31] posed the existence of polynomial-time algorithms for recognizing outer 2-planar graphs as an open problem. A partial answer has been given by Hong and Nagamochi [32], showing that full outer 2-planar graphs can be recognized in linear time. Outer $k$-planar drawings are full if no crossing appears on the boundary of the outer face. The authors of [17] generalized this result and showed that, for every integer $k$, full outer $k$-planarity is testable in $O(f(k) \\cdot n)$ time, for a computable function $f$. They also showed that outer $k$-planar graphs can be recognized in quasi-polynomial time, which implies that, for every integer $k$, testing outer $k$-planarity is not NP-hard unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.\n\nParameterized complexity We assume that the reader is familiar with basic concepts in parameterized complexity theory (see $[18,21,26]$ for definitions of these concepts). Zehavi [49] gives a survey specifically on the parameterized analysis of crossing minimization problems. The class XNLP consists of all parameterized problems that can be solved non-deterministically in time $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ and space $f(k) \\log n$, where $f$ is some computable function, $n$ is the input size, and $k$ is the parameter. A parameterized problem $L_{2} \\subseteq \\Sigma^{*} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ is said to be XNLP-hard if for any $L_{1} \\in$ XNLP, there is a parameterized logspace reduction from $L_{1}$ to $L_{2}$, that is, there is an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ and computable functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the following: Given $\\left(x_{1}, k_{1}\\right) \\in \\Sigma^{*} \\times \\mathbb{N}$, the algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ computes $\\left(x_{2}, k_{2}\\right) \\in \\Sigma^{*} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\left(x_{1}, k_{1}\\right) \\in L_{1}$ if and only if $\\left(x_{2}, k_{2}\\right) \\in L_{2}, k_{2} \\leq g\\left(k_{1}\\right)$, and $\\mathcal{A}$ runs in space $O\\left(f\\left(k_{1}\\right)+\\log \\left|x_{1}\\right|\\right)$. A parameterized problem is said to be XNLP-complete if it is XNLP-hard and belongs to XNLP. The class XNLP contains the class $\\mathrm{W}[t]$ for every $t \\geq 1$ [14]. Moreover, Pilipeczuk and Wrochna [42] conjectured that an XNLP-hard problem does not admit an algorithm that runs in $n^{f(k)}$ time and $f(k) \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ space for a computable function $f$, where $n$ is the size of the instance and $k$ is the parameter. We refer to $[14,24]$ for more information.\n\nRecently, the authors of [10] showed the first graph-drawing problem to be XNLP-complete, namely ordered level planarity, parameterized by the number of levels. Ordered level planarity\n\nis a restricted version of level planarity, where for each level, the vertices on that level are given in order (and the problem is to route the edges in a y-monotone and crossing-free way).\n\nOur contribution We present XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs, which implies that both recognition problems can be solved in polynomial time for every fixed $k$; see Sections 4.1 and 5.1, respectively. This solves the open problem regarding the recognition of outer 2-planar graphs posed by the authors of [31]. We complement these results by showing that recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs is $\\mathbf{X N L P}$-complete even for trees (Section 4.2) and that recognizing outer $k$-planar graphs is $\\mathbf{X N L P}$-hard (Section 5.3). This implies that both problems are $\\mathrm{W}[t]$-hard for every $t$ [14] and that it is unlikely that they admit FPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is specified; see Figure 1c and Section 3.1. We prove that two edge-weighted versions of this problem are NP-hard; see Section 3.2. Finally, we show that the local circular crossing number cannot be approximated even for graphs that are almost trees (that is, graphs with feedback vertex number 1); see Section 5.2. We conclude with open problems; see Section 6.\n\nThe proofs of statements marked with a (clickable) $\\star$ are in the appendix.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-0.jpeg":

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Preliminaries \n\nLet $G$ be a graph. We let $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ denote the sets of vertices and edges of $G$, respectively. For a vertex $v$ of $G$, let $N_{G}(v)$ be the set of neighbors of $v$ in $G$, and let $\\delta_{G}(v)$ be the set of edges incident to $v$. For $U \\subseteq V(G)$, we define $N_{G}(U)=\\left(\\bigcup_{v \\in U} N_{G}(v)\\right) \\backslash U$, $N_{G}[U]=N_{G}(U) \\cup U$, and $\\delta_{G}(U)=\\bigcup_{v \\in U} \\delta_{G}(v)$. We may omit the subscript $G$ when it is clear from the context. The subgraph of $G$ induced by $U \\subseteq V(G)$ is denoted by $G[U]$. A vertex is called a leaf if it has exactly one neighbor.\n\nWe use $[\\ell]$ as shorthand for $\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\ell\\}$. Let $n=|V(G)|$, and let $\\sigma: V(G) \\rightarrow[n]$ be a linear order of the vertices of $G$ (i.e., a bijection between $V(G)$ and $[n]$ ). For $\\{u, v\\} \\in E$, the stretch of edge $\\{u, v\\}$ in $\\sigma$ is defined as $[\\sigma(u)-\\sigma(v)]$. The bandwidth of $\\sigma$ (with respect to $G$ ) is the maximum stretch of an edge of $G$ in $\\sigma$. The bandwidth of $G$, denoted by bw $(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a linear order $\\sigma$ of $V$ with bandwidth at most $k$.\n\nWe define a circular drawing of a graph $G$ to be a cyclic order $D=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ of $V(G)$. We say that an edge $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$ with $i<j$ pierces a pair of (not necessarily adjacent) vertices $\\left\\{v_{i^{\\prime}}, v_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ with $i^{\\prime}<j^{\\prime}$ if either $1 \\leq i<i^{\\prime}<j<j^{\\prime} \\leq n$ or $1 \\leq i^{\\prime}<i<j^{\\prime}<j \\leq n$ holds. In particular, if $\\left\\{v_{i^{\\prime}}, v_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ is an edge of $G$, we say that $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$ crosses $\\left\\{v_{i^{\\prime}}, v_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$. For an edge $e$, let $\\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e)$ denote the number of edges that cross $e$ in $D$. A circular drawing $D$ is $k$-planar (or an outer $k$-planar drawing) if every edge crosses at most $k$ edges in $D$. Since whether two edges cross is determined only by the cyclic vertex order, in this paper, we allow the edges to be drawn arbitrarily.\n\nLet $G$ be a bipartite graph with $V(G)=X \\cup Y, X \\cap Y=\\emptyset$, and $E(G) \\subseteq X \\times Y$. A 2-layer drawing of $G$ is a pair $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ of (strict) linear orders $<_{X}$ and $<_{Y}$ defined on $X$ and on $Y$, respectively. A crossing in $D$ is defined by a pair of edges $\\{x, y\\}$ and $\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ with distinct endpoints $x, x^{\\prime} \\in X$ and distinct endpoints $y, y^{\\prime} \\in Y$ such that $x<_{X} x^{\\prime}$ and $y^{\\prime}<_{Y} y$. The notation $\\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e)$ is defined as above. Moreover, for two distinct edges $e$ and $e^{\\prime}$, let $\\operatorname{cr}_{D}\\left(e, e^{\\prime}\\right)=1$ if $e$ crosses $e^{\\prime} ; \\operatorname{cr}_{D}\\left(e, e^{\\prime}\\right)=0$ otherwise. For distinct $x, x^{\\prime} \\in X$, we say that $x$ is to the left of $x^{\\prime}$ in $D$ if $x<_{X} x^{\\prime}$. Equivalently, we say that $x^{\\prime}$ is to the right of $x$. The leftmost (resp. rightmost) of $X$ in $D$ is the smallest (resp. largest) vertex in $X$ under the linear order $<_{X}$. We also use these notions for vertices in $Y$. For an integer $k \\geq 0$, a\n\n2-layer drawing $D$ of $G$ is said to be $k$-planar if, for each edge $e$ of $G, \\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e) \\leq k$. For (not necessarily disjoint) vertex sets $A, B \\subseteq X \\cup Y$ and 2-layer drawings $D_{A}$ of $G[A]$ and $D_{B}$ of $G[B]$, we say that $D_{A}$ is compatible with $D_{B}$ (or equivalently $D_{B}$ is compatible with $D_{A}$ ) if, for every pair $\\left\\{z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq A \\cap B$ of vertices that both are in the same set of the bipartition $Z \\in\\{X, Y\\}$, we have that $z<_{Z} z^{\\prime}$ in $D_{A}$ if and only if $z<_{Z} z^{\\prime}$ in $D_{B}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3 Recognizing 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs - The One-Sided Case \n\nIn this section, we design an FPT-algorithm for recognizing 2-layer $k$-planar graphs when the order of the vertices on one layer is given as input. The problem is defined as follows.\n\nProblem: One-Sided $k$-Planarity\nInput: A bipartite graph $(X \\cup Y, E)$, an integer $k \\geq 0$, and a linear order $<_{X}$ of $X$.\nQuestion: Does $Y$ admit a linear order $<_{Y}$ such that $\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $(X \\cup Y, E)$ ?\n\nDegree reduction. Let $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph, and let $k$ be a non-negative integer. We describe two simple reduction rules that yield an equivalent instance of OneSided $k$-Planarity where every vertex in $X$ has degree at most $2 k+2$.\n\n- Observation 1 (*). Let $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph that contains a vertex with more than $2 k+2$ non-leaf neighbors. Then $G$ is not 2-layer $k$-planar.\n- Lemma 2 (*). Let $\\left(G,<_{X}, k\\right)$ be an instance of One-Sided $k$-Planarity. If $G$ contains a vertex $v \\in X$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(v)>2 k+2$ and with a leaf neighbor $y \\in Y$, then $\\left(G,<_{X}, k\\right)$ is a YES-instance if and only if $\\left(G-y,<_{X}, k\\right)$ is a YES-instance.\n\nHence, in the following, we assume that every vertex in $X$ has degree at most $2 k+2$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "### 3.1 An FPT-Algorithm\n\nLet $n$ be the number of vertices in $G$. In this section, we prove the following result.\n\n- Theorem 3. One-Sided $k$-Planarity can be solved in time $2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{O(1)}$, that is, ONE-Sided $k$-Planarity is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $k$.\n\nWe assume that $G$ has no isolated vertices; otherwise, we simply remove them. For a 2-layer drawing $D$ of a subgraph $G^{\\prime}$ of $G$, we say that $D$ respects $<_{X}$ if, for every $x, x^{\\prime} \\in V\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$, it holds that $x$ is to the left of $x^{\\prime}$ in $D$ if and only if $x<_{X} x^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe first give a simpler algorithm with running time $2^{O\\left(k^{\\ell} \\log k\\right)} n^{O(1)}$. Let $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{|X|}$ be the vertices of $X$ appearing in this order in $<_{X}$. If $|X|<2 k+1$, then $|Y| \\leq 2 k(2 k+2)$, and we can simply enumerate all the possible 2-layer drawings in time $2^{O\\left(k^{\\ell} \\log k\\right)} n^{O(1)}$. Thus, we assume $|X| \\geq 2 k+1$. Let $\\ell=2 k$. For $i \\in[|X|-\\ell]$, let $X_{\\leq i}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell}\\right\\}$ and $X_{i}=\\left\\{x_{i}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell}\\right\\}$. Correspondingly, let $G_{\\leq i}=G\\left[N\\left[X_{\\leq i}\\right]\\right]$ and $G_{i}=G\\left[N\\left[X_{i}\\right]\\right]$. Our algorithm recursively decides whether $G_{\\leq i}$ admits a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing that extends a prescribed partial drawing $D$ of $G_{i}$. To be more precise, let $D$ be a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G_{i}$ that respects $<_{X}$. Given $i \\in[|X|-\\ell]$, a partial drawing $D$ of $G_{i}$ respecting $<_{X}$, and a function $\\chi: \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right) \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$, we define a Boolean value $\\operatorname{draw}(i, D, \\chi)$ to be true if and only if $G_{\\leq i}$ admits a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D_{\\leq i}$ such that\n\n- $D_{\\leq i}$ is compatible with $D$ and\n\nfor every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right)$, it holds that $\\chi(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i}}(e)$.\nOur goal is to compute $\\operatorname{draw}(|X|-\\ell, D, \\chi)$ for some partial drawing $D$ of $G_{|X|-\\ell}$ and $\\chi$, which is done by the following dynamic programming algorithm.\n\nFor the base case $i=1$, we compute the table entries by brute force: For each possible 2 layer $k$-planar drawing $D$ of $G_{1}$ respecting $<_{X}$ and for every function $\\chi: \\delta\\left(X_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$, we set $\\operatorname{draw}(1, D, \\chi)=$ true if $\\chi(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e)$ for every $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{1}\\right)$; otherwise, we set $\\operatorname{draw}(1, D, \\chi)=$ false. Now we show that, in any 2-layer $k$-planar drawing, if two edges have endpoints in $X$ that are far apart, then the edges do not cross.\n\nLemma 4 (*). If $e=\\left(x_{p}, y\\right)$ and $f=\\left(x_{q}, y^{\\prime}\\right)$ are distinct edges such that $p+\\ell<q$, then, in every 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ of $G$, it holds that $y<_{Y} y^{\\prime}$ or that $y=y^{\\prime}$.\n\nThis suggests the following recurrence for the dynamic program.\n\nLemma 5. Let $2 \\leq i \\leq|X|-\\ell$, let $D$ be a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G_{i}$ respecting $<_{X}$, and let $\\chi: \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right) \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$ such that $\\chi(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e)$ for every $e \\in \\delta\\left(x_{i+\\ell}\\right)$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{draw}(i, D, \\chi)=\\bigvee_{D_{i-1}, \\chi_{i-1}} \\operatorname{draw}\\left(i-1, D_{i-1}, \\chi_{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the $D_{i-1}$ are taken over all 2-layer $k$-planar drawings of $G_{i-1}$ that are compatible with $D$, and the $\\chi_{i-1}$ are taken over all functions $\\delta\\left(X_{i-1}\\right) \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$ that satisfy\n\n$$\n\\chi_{i-1}(e)=\\chi(e)-\\sum_{f \\in \\delta\\left(x_{i+\\ell}\\right)} \\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e, f)\n$$\n\nfor every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right) \\cap \\delta\\left(X_{i-1}\\right)$.\nProof. Suppose that $\\operatorname{draw}(i, D, \\chi)=$ true. Then, there is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D_{\\leq i}$ of $G_{\\leq i}$ that is compatible with $D$ and, for every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right)$, it holds that $\\chi(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i}}(e)$. We need to show that there exists a triplet $t=\\left(i-1, D_{i-1}, \\chi_{i-1}\\right)$ such that $\\operatorname{draw}(t)=$ true. Let $D_{\\leq i-1}$ and $D_{i-1}$ be subdrawings of $D_{\\leq i}$ induced by $G_{\\leq i-1}$ and $G_{i-1}$, respectively. Then $D_{\\leq i-1}$ is compatible with $D_{i-1}$. By Lemma 4, edges incident to $x_{i+\\ell}$ do not cross edges incident to $x_{i-1}$. Thus, for every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(x_{i-1}\\right)$, we have $\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i}}(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i-1}}(e)$. Moreover, every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right) \\cap \\delta\\left(X_{i-1}\\right)$ has exactly $\\chi(e)-\\sum_{f \\in \\delta\\left(x_{i+\\ell}\\right)} \\operatorname{cr}_{D}(e, f)$ crossings in $D_{\\leq i-1}$. Define $\\chi_{i-1}$ by setting $\\chi_{i-1}(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i-1}}(e)$ for every edge $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i-1}\\right)$. Then, by definition, $\\operatorname{draw}\\left(i-1, D_{i-1}, \\chi_{i-1}\\right)=$ true since $D_{\\leq i-1}$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G_{\\leq i-1}$ compatible with $D_{i-1}$ and, for every $e \\in \\delta\\left(X_{i-1}\\right)$, it trivially holds that $\\chi_{i-1}(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{\\leq i-1}}(e)$.\n\nWe omit the converse direction, which readily follows by reversing the above argument.\nOur algorithm evaluates the recurrence of Lemma 5 in a dynamic programming manner. To see the runtime bound, observe that, for each $i \\in[|X|-\\ell]$, the number of possible 2-layer $k$-planar drawings of $G_{i}$ is upper bounded by $\\left|N\\left(X_{i}\\right)\\right|!\\leq((\\ell+1) \\cdot(2 k+2))!=2^{O\\left(k^{2} \\log k\\right)}$ and the number of possible functions from $\\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right)$ to $\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$ is upper bounded by $(k+1) \\mid \\delta\\left(X_{i}\\right) \\mid=$ $2^{O\\left(k^{2} \\log k\\right)}$. Hence, we can evaluate the recurrence in time $2^{O\\left(k^{2} \\log k\\right)} n^{O(1)}$.\n\nWe can improve the exponential dependency of our running time as follows. Instead of fixing the \"window size\" to $2 k+1$, for every $i$, we dynamically take the smallest $\\ell_{i}$ such that $\\delta\\left(\\left\\{x_{i}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell_{i}}\\right\\}\\right)$ consists of at least $2 k+1$ edges. It is easy to verify that Lemma 4 (and hence Lemma 5) still holds for this dynamic window size. Since the degree of every vertex in $X$ is at most $2 k+2$, we have that $\\left|\\delta\\left(\\left\\{x_{i}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell_{i}}\\right\\}\\right)\\right| \\leq 4 k+2$. This improves the running time to $2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{O(1)}$, completing the proof of Theorem 3.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 3.2 NP-Hardness of the Weighted Version \n\nWe can generalize One-Sided $k$-Planarity to weighted settings. Let $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph, and let $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_{>0}$ be an edge-weight function.

Although we believe that Outer $k$-Planarity is NP-hard, we can only show the following weaker hardness.\n\n- Theorem 6 (*). The weighted One-Sided $k$-Planarity is (weakly) NP-hard under (1).\n\nProof (sketch). The claim is shown by performing a reduction from Partition, which is known to be (weakly) NP-hard [27]. The problem asks, given a set of $n$ integers $A=$ $\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$, whether the set can be partitioned into two subsets of equal sum. We construct a bipartite graph $G$ consisting of a path of length 2 with two edges $e_{0}$ and $e_{n+1}$ of weight 1 , and $n$ isolated edges with weight proportional to the integers in $A$. By appropriately defining the order $<_{X}$ on $X$, we can ensure that each isolated edge crosses either $e_{0}$ or $e_{n+1}$; see Figure 2. Setting $k$ properly induces two balanced subsets of $A$.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2 The graph $G$ and $<_{X}$ we construct. $\\sum$ is the sum of weights of edges that cross $e_{0}$.\n\nWe remark that there is another reasonable definition of crossings in a weighted graph: A 2-layer drawing is defined to be $k$-planar if, for each edge $e \\in E$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{f \\text { crosses } e \\text { in } D} w(e) \\cdot w(f) \\leq k\n$$\n\nBy making $w\\left(e_{0}\\right)$ and $w\\left(e_{n+1}\\right)$ sufficiently large, a similar reduction will work.\n\n- Remark 7.

{"section_id": 7, "text": "### 4 Recognizing 2-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs - The Two-Sided Case\n\nThe algorithm in Theorem 3 exploits the prescribed order $<_{X}$ on $X$, which is not specified in the two-sided case. This difference is reflected by the parameterized complexity of the two problems. The two-sided case turns out to be XNLP-hard, meaning that it is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable. On the other hand, we design a polynomial-time algorithm for the two-sided case, provided that $k$ is fixed. We use this algorithm also to show that the problem is contained in XNLP. Formally, the problem is defined as follows.\n\nProblem: Two-Sided $k$-Planarity\nInput: A bipartite graph $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ and an integer $k \\geq 0$.\nQuestion: Does $G$ admit a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing?", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 4.1 An XP-Algorithm \n\nTo solve Two-Sided $k$-Planarity, we extend the algorithm for One-Sided $k$-Planarity presented in Section 3. Let $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph, let $n$ be the number of vertices of $G$, and let $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We assume that $G$ is connected; otherwise, the problem can be solved independently for each connected component. Moreover, by applying Observation 1 and applying Lemma 2 first to $X$ and then to $Y$, we assume that every vertex has degree at most $2 k+2$. Our algorithm employs a dynamic programming approach analogous to that presented in Section 3. Instead of a \"window\", we specify a subset $X_{i} \\subseteq X$ of $\\ell+1=2 k+1$ vertices, which plays the same role as the window $\\left\\{x_{i}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell}\\right\\}$. However, this subset does not specify the graph $G_{\\leq i}$ on the left of the window, preventing us from defining the same type of subproblems as there. We overcome this obstacle by applying an idea similar to that of Saxe [44] for recognizing bandwidth- $k$ graphs. To properly define the subproblems, we observe that $N\\left[X_{i}\\right]$ separates the subdrawings of the components of $G\\left[V(G) \\backslash N\\left[X_{i}\\right]\\right]$ into left and right parts.\n\n- Lemma 8. Let $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ be a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G$, and let $S \\subseteq X$ be a set of $\\ell+1$ vertices that appears consecutively in $D$. Let $x$ and $x^{\\prime}$ be the leftmost vertex and the rightmost vertex of $S$ in $D$, respectively. Then, for each component $C$ of $G[V(G) \\backslash N[S]]$, the vertices in $C \\cap X$ are either entirely to the left of $x$ or entirely to the right of $x^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $C$ has two vertices $u, v \\in X \\backslash S$ such that $u$ is to the left of $x$ and $v$ is to the right of $x^{\\prime}$ in $D$. Let $P$ be a path between $u$ and $v$ in $G[C]$. We can assume that $P$ has exactly two edges, $e$ and $f$. Observe that each edge incident to a vertex in $S$ crosses either $e$ or $f$. Since each vertex in $S$ has at least one incident edge, at least one of $e$ and $f$ involves more than $k$ crossings.\n\nSuppose that $G$ has a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$. For a family $\\mathcal{D} \\subseteq 2^{V(G)}$, we use $\\mathcal{D}^{X}$ as shorthand for $\\bigcup_{C \\in \\mathcal{D}} C \\cap X$. Let $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{|X|}$ be the vertices of $X$ appearing in this order in $<_{X}$. For $1 \\leq i \\leq|X|-\\ell$, let $\\mathcal{C}_{i}$ be the set of connected components in $G\\left[V(G) \\backslash N\\left[\\left\\{x_{i}, \\ldots, x_{i+\\ell}\\right\\}\\right]\\right]$. By Lemma 8 , we have $\\mathcal{C}^{X}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right\\}$ for some $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{i}$.\n\nNow, we can formally define our subproblems. Let $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=\\ell+1$, let $D$ be a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G[N[S]]$, let $\\chi: \\delta(S) \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$, and let $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{S}$, where $\\mathcal{C}_{S}$ is the set of components in $G[V(G) \\backslash N[S]]$. We define a Boolean value $\\operatorname{draw}(S, D, \\chi, \\mathcal{C})$ to be true if and only if there is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D^{*}$ of $G\\left[N\\left[S \\cup \\mathcal{C}^{X}\\right]\\right]$ such that\n\n- $D^{*}$ is compatible with $D$ and\n- for every edge $e \\in \\delta(S)$, it holds that $\\chi(e)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D^{*}}(e)$.\n\nHence, $G$ has a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing if and only if $\\operatorname{draw}\\left(S, D, \\chi, \\mathcal{C}_{S}\\right)=$ true for some $S \\subseteq X, D, \\chi$, and $\\mathcal{C}_{S}$.\n\nTo compute the values $\\operatorname{draw}(S, D, \\chi, \\mathcal{C})$ for $S \\subseteq X$ with $|S|=\\ell+1, D, \\chi$, and $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{S}$, we first compute the base cases where $\\mathcal{C}=\\emptyset$ and then the other cases in ascending order of $\\left|S \\cup \\mathcal{C}^{X}\\right|$. This can be done by using a recurrence similar to the one in Lemma 5.\n\nTo see the running time bound of the above algorithm, observe that the number of possible choices for $S, D, \\chi$, and $\\mathcal{C}$ is at most\n\n$$\n\\sum_{S \\subseteq X}|S|!\\cdot|N(S)|!\\cdot(k+1)^{[\\delta(S)|} \\cdot 2^{|\\mathcal{C}_{S}|}=n^{\\ell+1} \\cdot 2^{O\\left(k^{2} \\log k\\right)} \\cdot 2^{|\\mathcal{C}_{S}|}\n$$\n\nThe third factor can be bounded by $2^{O\\left(k^{3}\\right)}$ as follows: Since $G$ is connected, each connected component of $G[V(G) \\backslash N[S]]$ contains at least one vertex in $N(N(S)) \\backslash S$. This implies that the number of components in $G[V(G) \\backslash N[S]]$ is at most $|N(N(S)) \\backslash S| \\leq(2 k+2)(2 k+1)^{2}$.\n\nTheorem 9. Two-Sided $k$-Planarity can be solved in time $2^{O\\left(k^{3}\\right)} n^{2 k+O(1)}$, that is, Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is polynomial-time solvable when $k$ is fixed.\n\nThe above algorithm easily turns into a non-deterministic algorithm that runs in polynomial time and space $k^{O(1)} \\log n$, which implies the following.\n\n- Corollary 10 ( $\\star$ ). Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is in XNLP.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# 4.2 XNLP-Completeness \n\nTo complement the positive result in the previous subsection, we show that Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is XNLP-hard even on trees. In contrast to our result, TSCM can be solved in polynomial time on trees [46].\n\n- Theorem 11 ( $\\star$ ). Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is XNLP-complete w.r.t. $k$ even on trees.\n\nProof (sketch). Membership in XNLP follows from Corollary 10. We prove the claim by showing a parameterized logspace reduction from BANDwIDTH, which is known to be XNLPhard even on trees $[11,14]$. Let $T$ be a tree. We subdivide each edge $e$ of $T$ once by introducing a vertex $w_{e}$, and we add $\\ell$ leaves adjacent to each original vertex of $T$ for some $\\ell=\\Theta\\left(b^{2}\\right)$. Let $G$ be the graph obtained in this way. Next, we show that $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq b$ if and only if $G$ has a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing for some $k=\\Theta\\left(b^{3}\\right)$.\n\nLet $X=V(T)$, let $Y=V(G) \\backslash X$, and let $\\sigma$ be a vertex order of $T$ with bandwidth $b$. Define a vertex order $<_{X}$ on $X$ by setting $<_{X}=\\sigma$. Since the stretch of each edge in $\\sigma$ is at most $b$, there are at most $b-1$ vertices between its endpoints. This implies that we can place the vertices in $Y$ so that there will be only $O\\left(b^{3}\\right)$ crossings per edge; see Figure 3. Conversely, in any 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G$, the endpoints of every edge $e=\\{u, v\\}$ of $T$ are close to each other, as each vertex between $u$ and $v$ causes at least $\\ell$ crossings on the path $(u, w_{e}, v)$. Hence, the order on $X$ turns into a vertex order of $T$ with bandwidth at most $b$.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3 A minimum-bandwidth order of $T$ and the 2-layer drawing of $G$ that we

{"section_id": 10, "text": "## 5 Recognizing Outer $k$-Planar Graphs\n\nIn this section, we discuss the parameterized complexity of recognizing outer $k$-planar graphs.\n\nProblem: Outer $k$-Planarity\nInput: A graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and an integer $k$.\nQuestion: Does $G$ admit an outer $k$-planar drawing?", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "### 5.1 An XP-Algorithm\n\nIn this subsection, we show our main result, an XP-algorithm for Outer $k$-Planarity with respect to $k$. Note that a graph is outer $k$-planar if and only if its biconnected components are outer $k$-planar; this can be shown in a similar manner as [32, Theorem 4] for $k=2$. Hence, we assume the input graph to be biconnected.\n\nTheorem 12. Outer $k$-Planarity can be solved in time $2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{3 k+O(1)}$, that is, Outer $k$-Planarity is polynomial-time solvable when $k$ is fixed.\n\nLet $G$ be the input graph, let $\\vec{e}=(u, v)$ be an ordered pair of two distinct vertices of $G$, and let $R$ be a subset of $V(G) \\backslash\\{u, v\\}$ such that there are at most $k$ edges between $R$ and $L$, where $L=V(G) \\backslash(\\{u, v\\} \\cup R)$. Let $C$ be the set of these edges. Let $\\tau$ be a linear order of $C$, let $c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{\\ell}$ denote the vertices of $C$ in the order given by $\\tau$, and let $\\chi: C \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$. Let $G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}$ be the graph obtained by adding $\\ell$ vertices $t_{1}^{\\tau}, t_{2}^{\\tau}, \\ldots, t_{\\ell}^{\\tau}$ to the induced subgraph $G[\\{u, v\\} \\cup R]$ and by connecting $t_{i}^{\\tau}$ and the endpoint of $c_{i}$ in $R$ for every $i \\in[\\ell]$. Then we define a Boolean value $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)$ to be true if and only if $G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}$ admits an outer $k$-planar drawing $D$ with the following properties:\n(P1) the cyclic order of $D$ contains $\\left(u, t_{1}^{\\tau}, t_{2}^{\\tau}, \\ldots, t_{\\ell}^{\\tau}, v\\right)$ as a consecutive subsequence, and (P2) for every edge $c_{i} \\in C$, it holds that $\\chi\\left(c_{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D}\\left(c_{i}\\right)$.\nClearly, the graph $G$ admits an outer $k$-planar drawing if and only if there exists a vertex pair $\\vec{e}$ such that $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, V(G) \\backslash\\{u, v\\}, f_{\\emptyset}, f_{\\emptyset})=$ true, where $f_{\\emptyset}$ is the empty function.\n\nWe evaluate the recurrence as follows. For every base case, namely where $R=\\emptyset$, $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)$ is true since $C$ is also empty.\n\nWhen $R \\neq \\emptyset$, we compute $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)$ for smaller sets of type $R$. In this case, with the same technique as that used in [25, Lemma 6], we can show the following.\n\nLemma 13 (*). If $G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}$ admits an outer $k$-planar drawing $D$ with properties P1 and P2, there is $w \\in R$ such that vertex pairs $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{v, w\\}$ are pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D$.\n\nHence, we can compute $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)$ by checking all the ways to split the instance at the vertex $w$. Let $\\left\\{R_{1}, R_{2}\\right\\}$ be a partition of $R \\backslash\\{w\\}$, let $L_{1}=V\\left(G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}\\right) \\backslash\\left(\\{u, w\\} \\cup R_{1}\\right)$ and let $L_{2}=V\\left(G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}\\right) \\backslash\\left(\\{v, w\\} \\cup R_{2}\\right)$. For $i \\in[2]$, let $C_{i}$ be the set of edges between $R_{i}$ and $L_{i}$, let $\\ell_{i}=\\left|C_{i}\\right|$, let $\\tau_{i}$ be a linear order of $C_{i}$, and let $\\chi_{i}: C_{i} \\rightarrow\\{0, \\ldots, k\\}$ be a function. We say that $w, R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}, R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}$ are consistent if the following holds ( $\\mathrm{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}$ is defined below):\n\n- there are at most $k$ edges between $L_{1}$ and $R_{1}$ and at most $k$ edges between $L_{2}$ and $R_{2}$, - for every edge $c$ between $L$ and $R_{i}, \\chi_{i}(c)=\\chi(c)-\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c)$ holds for $i \\in[2]$,\n- for every edge $c$ between $L$ and $\\{w\\}, \\chi(c)=\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c)$,\n- for every edge $c$ between $\\{v\\}$ and $R_{1}, \\chi_{1}(c)+\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c) \\leq k$,\n- for every edge $c$ between $\\{u\\}$ and $R_{2}, \\chi_{2}(c)+\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c) \\leq k$, and\n- for every edge $c$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}, \\chi_{1}(c)+\\chi_{2}(c)+\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c) \\leq k$.\n\nInformally, the value $\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c)$ is the number of crossings on $c$ inside the \"triangle\" consisting of $\\{u, v, w\\}$. To define it formally, let us consider a circular drawing $D_{H}=$ $\\left(u, t_{1}^{\\tau}, \\ldots, t_{\\ell}^{\\tau}, v, t_{\\ell_{2}}^{\\tau_{2}}, \\ldots t_{1}^{\\tau_{2}}, w, t_{\\ell_{1}}^{\\tau_{1}}, \\ldots, t_{1}^{\\tau_{1}}\\right)$ of a graph $H$. For each edge $c \\in(E \\cap\\{u, v\\}) \\cup C \\cup$ $C_{1} \\cup C_{2}$, the graph $H$ contains an edge $f(c)$ defined as follows. If $c=\\{u, v\\}, f(c)$ simply connects $u$ and $v$. Suppose that $c$ is incident to exactly one vertex $x \\in\\{u, v, w\\}$. This implies that $c$ is contained in exactly one of $C, C_{1}$, and $C_{2}$, which also means that $c$ is contained in the domain of exactly one $\\tau^{\\prime} \\in\\left\\{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}\\right\\}$. Then $f(c)$ connects $x$ and $t_{\\tau^{\\prime}(c)}^{\\tau^{\\prime}}$. Otherwise, $c$ is contained in exactly two of $C, C_{1}$, and $C_{2}$, since $c$ is not contained in $C \\cap C_{1} \\cap C_{2}$. Similarly to the previous case, $c$ is contained in the domains of distinct $\\tau^{\\prime}, \\tau^{\\prime \\prime} \\in\\left\\{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}\\right\\}$. Then $f(c)$ connects $t_{\\tau^{\\prime}(c)}^{\\tau^{\\prime}}$ and $t_{\\tau^{\\prime \\prime}(c)}^{\\tau^{\\prime \\prime}}$. Now we define $\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c)=\\operatorname{cr}_{D_{H}}(f(c))$.\n\nWe are ready to state Lemma 14, which formalizes the above idea of splitting an instance $((u, v), R, \\tau, \\chi)$ at a vertex $w$ in $R$ into two subinstances $\\left((u, w), R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left((w, v), R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}\\right)$; see Figure 4, where some edges are curved for better visualization.\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4 An image of Lemma 14. The red boxes are the crossings considered in $\\mathrm{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}$.\n\nLemma 14. For $\\vec{e}=(u, v)$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)=\\bigvee_{\\substack{w, R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}, R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2} \\\\ \\text { consistent }}} \\operatorname{draw}\\left((u, w), R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}\\right) \\wedge \\operatorname{draw}\\left((w, v), R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Suppose that draw $(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)=$ true, that is, there is an outer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(u, t_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, t_{\\ell}^{*}, v, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{r}\\right)$ of $G_{\\tau, e, R}$ that satisfies properties P1 and P2. We assume that edges are drawn as straight-line segments in $D$. By Lemma 13 there is a vertex $w \\in R$ for some $w=v_{i}$ such that both $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{v, w\\}$ have at most $k$ piercing edges. The vertices $u, v, w$ divide the circumference into the three arcs $\\rho_{\\bar{u}}, \\rho_{\\bar{v}}, \\rho_{\\bar{w}}$, where $\\rho_{\\bar{\\varepsilon}}$ is the arc between vertices other than $x$ that does not pass through $x$ for each $x \\in\\{u, v, w\\}$. Then, following the line through $u$ and $w$, we can take a curve $\\rho_{1}$ between $u$ and $w$, inside the circle, such that it crosses exactly the piercing edges, does not pass through any crossing between piercing edges, and separates $v$ and the segment representing the edge $\\{u, w\\}$ (if it exists). We can take a curve $\\rho_{2}$ between $v$ and $w$ similarly. Let $R_{1}=\\left\\{v_{i+1}, \\ldots, v_{r}\\right\\}$ and $R_{2}=\\left\\{v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{i-1}\\right\\}$. We then define a linear order $\\tau_{1}$ on the edges between $R_{1}$ and $L_{1}:=V\\left(G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}\\right) \\backslash\\left(\\{u, w\\} \\cup R_{1}\\right)$ in such a way that $\\tau_{1}$ orders those edges in ascending order of the distance between $u$ and the crossing with the curve $\\rho_{1}$. Similarly, $\\tau_{2}$ is defined in such a way that $\\tau_{2}$ orders the edges $R_{2}$ and $L_{2}:=V\\left(G_{\\tau, \\vec{e}, R}\\right) \\backslash\\left(\\{v, w\\} \\cup R_{2}\\right)$ in ascending order of the distance between $w$ to the crossing with the curve $\\rho_{2}$. If we cut the drawing $D$ along the curves as Figure 4, the drawing $D$ can be decomposed into three subdrawings $D_{H}, D_{1}$, and $D_{2}: D_{H}$ is the drawing inside the region surrounded by arcs $\\rho_{\\bar{w}}, \\rho_{2}$, and $\\rho_{1} ; D_{1}$ is the drawing inside the region surrounded by arcs $\\rho_{\\bar{v}}$ and $\\rho_{1} ; D_{2}$ is the drawing inside the region surrounded by arcs $\\rho_{\\bar{u}}$ and $\\rho_{2}$. Since each crossing on the edges between $R_{1}$ and $L_{1}$ is contained in exactly one of $D_{H}$, $D_{1}, D_{2}$, we have $\\chi_{1}(c)=\\chi(c)-\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c)$ for each edge $c$ between $L$ and $R_{1}$, and we have $\\chi_{1}(c)+\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c) \\leq k$ for each edge $c$ between $\\{v\\}$ and $R_{1}$. As $D_{1}$ is a circular drawing of $G_{\\tau_{1},(u, w), R_{1}}$ that satisfies P1 and P2, we have $\\operatorname{draw}\\left((u, w), R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}\\right)=$ true, and similarly, we have $\\operatorname{draw}\\left((w, v), R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}\\right)=$ true. Since each edge $c$ between $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ satisfies $\\chi_{1}(c)+\\chi_{2}(c)+\\operatorname{cr}_{\\tau, \\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2}}(c) \\leq k$, we conclude that $w, R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}, R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}$ are consistent.\n\nSuppose that there are consistent $w, R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}, R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}$ such that $\\operatorname{draw}\\left((u, w), R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}\\right)=$ $\\operatorname{draw}\\left((w, v), R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}\\right)=$ true. Let $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ be circular drawings of $G_{\\tau_{1},(u, w), R_{1}}$ and $G_{\\tau_{2},(w, v), R_{2}}$, respectively, that satisfy P1 and P2. Let $\\sigma_{1}=(w, \\ldots, u)$ and $\\sigma_{2}=(v, \\ldots, w)$ be\n\nthe linear orders of $\\{w, u\\} \\cup R_{1}$ and $\\{v, w\\} \\cup R_{2}$ obtained from $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ by removing the vertices $t_{i}^{\\tau_{1}}$ and $t_{j}^{\\tau_{2}}$ for $i \\in\\left[\\ell_{1}\\right]$ and $j \\in\\left[\\ell_{2}\\right]$, respectively. Then we obtain a cyclic order $\\sigma$ of $G_{\\tau, e, R}$ by concatenating $\\sigma_{2}, \\sigma_{1},\\left(u, t_{1}^{\\tau}, \\ldots, t_{f}^{\\tau}, v\\right)$ in this order, identifying the two occurrences of each of $w, u, v$ with each other. It is not difficult to see that, by combining $D_{H}, D_{1}$, and $D_{2}$ as in Figure 4, we obtain a drawing $D$ with linear order $\\sigma$ that satisfies P1 and P2. In other words, $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\tau, \\chi)=$ true.\n\nNa\u00efvely, the number of $R$ 's to consider is $\\Theta\\left(2^{n}\\right)$, which does not give an XP-algorithm. However, the following lemma assures that it is not so large.\n\n- Lemma 15 (*). Let $G$ be a biconnected graph that admits an outer $k$-planar drawing $D$. Let $\\{u, v\\}$ be a pair of distinct vertices of $G$ that has at most $k$ piercing edges in $D$. Then the number of $R$ 's such that $\\operatorname{draw}((u, v), R, \\tau, \\chi)=$ true for some $\\tau$ and $\\chi$ is at most $2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}$, where $m=|E(G)|$. Moreover, such $R$ 's can be enumerated in $2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}$ time.\n\nProof (sketch). We show that, given the set of edges piercing $\\{u, v\\}$, there are $2^{O(k)}$ possibilities for $R$ that are separated by these piercing edges. Since $R$ is a union of components in the graph obtained from $G[V(G) \\backslash\\{u, v\\}]$ by deleting the piercing edges, it suffices to show that there are only $O(k)$ components in this graph. The proof shares the same underlying idea with Lemma 8 , but it is more involved as the maximum degree is no longer bounded. The upper bound can be obtained by considering that there are at most $k$ piercing edges of $\\{u, v\\}$ and the number of components in $G[V(G) \\backslash\\{u, v\\}]$ is at most $2 k+3$.\n\nWith Lemma 15 and the fact that $m=O(\\sqrt{k} n)$ [41], the number of combinations of arguments $\\{e, R, \\sigma, \\chi\\}$ to consider is at most\n\n$$\nn^{2} \\cdot 2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)} \\cdot k!\\cdot(k+1)^{k}=2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{k+O(1)}\n$$\n\nTo compute the value $\\operatorname{draw}(\\vec{e}, R, \\sigma, \\chi)$ as in Lemma 14, we guess at most\n\n$$\nn \\cdot\\left(2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{k+O(1)}\\right)^{2}=2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{2 k+O(1)}\n$$\n\npossible combinations of $w, R_{1}, \\tau_{1}, \\chi_{1}, R_{2}, \\tau_{2}, \\chi_{2}$. For each guess, checking the consistency takes $n^{O(1)}$ time. Hence, the total running time to fill the table is $2^{O(k \\log k)} n^{3 k+O(1)}$.

{"section_id": 12, "text": "# 5.2 NP-Hardness of Approximation \n\nIn this subsection, we show an inapproximability result for Outer $k$-Planarity even for graphs that are almost trees, whereas trees can be drawn without any crossings.\n\n- Theorem 16. For any fixed $c \\geq 1$, there is no polynomial-time c-approximation algorithm for Outer $k$-Planarity unless $\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{NP}$, even for graphs with feedback vertex number 1.\n\nOur proof is by reduction from BANDWIDTH on trees, which is NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor [22]. In other words, given a tree $T$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm to distinguish between the cases $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq b$ and $\\operatorname{bw}(T)>c b$ for any constant $c \\geq 1$, unless $\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{NP}$.\n\nLet $T$ be a tree, and let $n$ denote $|V(T)|$. We construct a graph $G$ from $T$ by adding a vertex $w$ and making it adjacent to all vertices of $T$. Clearly, $G$ has feedback vertex number 1 since $G[V(G) \\backslash\\{w\\}]$ is a tree.\n\nLemma 17 (*). If $G$ is outer $k$-planar, then $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq k-1$.\n\nLemma 18 (*). Let $b \\geq 1$. If $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq b$, then $G$ is outer $(5 b-5)$-planar.\nProof (sketch). From a vertex order $\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ of $T$ with bandwidth at most $b$, we construct a circular drawing $D$ of $G$ as $D=\\left(w, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$. Each edge $\\left\\{w, v_{i}\\right\\}$ incident to $w$ has at most $2 b-2$ crossings in $D$ since these crossing edges lie between vertices that are \"close\" to $v_{i}$. For other edge $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\} \\in E(T)$ with $i<j$, it only crosses (1) edges incident to $w$ and (2) edges in $T$. There are at most $b-1$ edges of (1) since the stretch of $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$ is at most $b$, and at most $4 b-4$ edges of (2) since these edges lie between vertices that are \"close\" to $v_{i}$ or $v_{j}$. Hence, each edge has at most $5 b-5$ crossings in total.\n\nSuppose that there is a polynomial-time $c$-approximation algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ for Outer $k$ Planarity. Let $T$ be a tree, and let $b=\\operatorname{bw}(T)$. By Lemma 18, $\\mathcal{A}$ would output an outer $5 b c$-planar drawing $D$ of $G$. By Lemma 17, $D$ can be transformed into a linear order of $V(T)$ with bandwidth at most $5 b c$. Thus, we can find a $5 c$-approximate solution for BANDWIDTH in polynomial time, which is impossible under $\\mathrm{P} \\neq \\mathrm{NP}$.

However, if we allow parallel edges, we can reduce from (the exact version of) BANDWIDTH by making the edges incident to $w$ so thick that we can ignore the $O(b)$ increase in the crossing numbers. The following theorem is shown by emulating those parallel edges with rigid structures.\n\n- Theorem 19 (*). Outer $k$-Planarity is XNLP-hard when parameterized by $k$.\n\nProof (sketch). As in Theorem 11, we give a parameterized logspace reduction from BANDwIDTH on trees. The idea of the reduction is similar to that used in Theorem 16. Instead of connecting $w$ with each $v_{i}$, we replace each vertex $v_{i}$ with a clique path gadget that appears consecutively in any outer $k$-planar drawing for some $k=\\Theta\\left(b^{4}\\right)$ and connect $w$ with sufficiently many vertices in the gadget. Since there are many edges between $w$ and each gadget, two adjacent gadgets are placed closely in any outer $k$-planar drawing.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "## 6 Open Problems\n\nWe conclude with a number of problems that we have left open in this paper.\n\n- Is One-Sided $k$-Planarity NP-hard?\n- We conjecture that Outer $k$-Planarity is XALP-complete (see [13] for the definition).\n- Can we extend the algorithm for Two-Sided $k$-Planarity to obtain an XP-algorithm for $\\ell$-layer $k$-planarity parameterized by $\\ell+k$ ?\n- Another way to extend $k$-planarity is to consider min-k-planarity, which is also called weak $k$-planarity $[9,16]$. In a min- $k$-planar drawing, in every crossing, at least one of the two edges must have at most $k$ crossings. Can 2-layer min- $k$-planar graphs and outer min- $k$-planar graphs be recognized by XP-algorithms with respect to $k$ ?\n- Two-Sided $k$-Planarity can be seen as a restricted version of Outer $k$-Planarity for bipartite graphs where the vertices of the two sets of the bipartition must not interleave in the cyclic vertex order. This can be generalized as follows: For $k \\geq 3$, can we efficiently recognize $k$-partite graphs that admit a $k$-planar straight-line drawing on the regular $k$-gon?

Let $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph that contains a vertex with more than $2 k+2$ non-leaf neighbors. Then $G$ is not 2-layer $k$-planar.\n\nProof. Suppose that $G$ admits a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D$. Let $v$ be a vertex of $G$ with more than $2 k+2$ non-leaf neighbors. Without loss of generality, we assume that $v \\in X$. Let $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{d} \\in Y$ be the non-leaf neighbors of $v$ appearing in this order in $D$, and let $e_{i}$ denote the edge $\\left\\{v, y_{i}\\right\\}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq d$. Since $y_{k+2}$ is not a leaf, it has an incident edge other than $e_{i}$. This edge has a crossing with either each of $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{k+1}$ or each of $e_{k+3}, \\ldots, e_{d}$, contradicting the $k$-planarity of $D$. Hence, we have the following observation.\n\n- Lemma 2 (*). Let $\\left(G,<_{X}, k\\right)$ be an instance of One-Sided $k$-Planarity. If $G$ contains a vertex $v \\in X$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(v)>2 k+2$ and with a leaf neighbor $y \\in Y$, then $\\left(G,<_{X}, k\\right)$ is a YES-instance if and only if $\\left(G-y,<_{X}, k\\right)$ is a YES-instance.\n\nProof. The forward implication is immediate since $G-y$ is a subgraph of $G$.\nNow suppose that $G-y$ has a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D^{\\prime}=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$. Let $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{d}$ be the neighbors of $v$ appearing in this order in $<_{Y}$, and, for $i \\in[d]$, let $e_{i}=\\left\\{v, y_{i}\\right\\}$. Observe that $e_{k+2}$ has no crossings, as otherwise there is an edge that has a crossing with either each of $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{k+1}$ or each of $e_{k+3}, \\ldots, e_{d}$. Moreover, $y_{k+2}$ is a leaf, as otherwise every edge incident to $y_{k+2}$ and different from $e_{k+2}$ involves more than $k$ crossing. Thus, we can insert $y$ immediately to the left of $y_{k+2}$ in $D^{\\prime}$ without introducing a new crossing. Hence, the resulting drawing is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G$.\n\n- Lemma 4 (*). If $e=\\left(x_{p}, y\\right)$ and $f=\\left(x_{q}, y^{\\prime}\\right)$ are distinct edges such that $p+\\ell<q$, then, in every 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ of $G$, it holds that $y<_{Y} y^{\\prime}$ or that $y=y^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $y>_{Y} y^{\\prime}$, which means that $e$ and $f$ cross. For every $t$ with $p<t<q$, there is at least one edge incident to vertex $x_{t}$, as $X$ contains no isolated vertices. Each of these at least $\\ell=2 k$ edges crosses $e$ or $f$ (which cross each other). Thus, $e$ or $f$ has more than $k$ crossings - a contradiction.\n\n- Theorem 6 (*). The weighted One-Sided k-Planarity is (weakly) NP-hard under (1).\n\nProof. We perform a polynomial-time reduction from Partition, which is (weakly) NPhard [27]. An instance of this problem is a set $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ of $n$ positive integers, and the task is to partition $A$ into two sets $B$ and $B^{\\prime}$ such that $\\operatorname{sum}(B)=\\operatorname{sum}\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right)$, where $\\operatorname{sum}(S)$ denotes the sum of the all integers in a set $S$.\n\nWe construct a bipartite graph $G=(X \\cup Y, E)$ and a linear order $<_{X}$ on $X$ as follows. The vertex set $X$ consists of $n+2$ vertices $x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}, x_{n+1}$, which appears in this order on $<_{X}$. The other vertex set $Y$ consists of $n+1$ vertices $y_{\\text {mid }}, y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n}$. The edge set $E$ consists of $e_{0}=\\left\\{x_{0}, y_{\\text {mid }}\\right\\}, e_{n+1}=\\left\\{x_{n+1}, y_{\\text {mid }}\\right\\}$ and $e_{i}=\\left\\{x_{i}, y_{i}\\right\\}$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We set $w\\left(e_{0}\\right)=w\\left(e_{n+1}\\right)=1$ and set $w\\left(e_{i}\\right)=2 a_{i}$ for every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. Lastly, we set $k$ to $\\operatorname{sum}(A)+1$.\n\nSuppose that there is a partition $\\left\\{B, B^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ of $A$ such that $\\operatorname{sum}(B)=\\operatorname{sum}\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{sum}(A) / 2$. Let $j(1)<\\cdots<j(b)$ and $j^{\\prime}(1)<\\cdots<j^{\\prime}\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)$ be the indices of elements of $B$ and $B^{\\prime}$, respectively. We then construct $<_{Y}$ as\n\n$$\ny_{j(1)}<\\cdots<y_{j(b)}<y_{\\text {mid }}<y_{j^{\\prime}(1)}<\\cdots<_{Y} y_{j^{\\prime}\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)}\n$$\n\nand show that $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing. We first consider the edge $e_{0}$. It crosses exactly the edges $e_{j(1)}, \\ldots, e_{j(b)}$ and the sum of their weights is at most $\\sum_{i=1}^{b} w\\left(y_{j(i)}\\right)=2 \\cdot \\operatorname{sum}(B)=\\operatorname{sum}(A) \\leq k$. We can show the same bound for $e_{n+1}$. Next, we consider an edge $e_{j(i)}$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq b$. It crosses $e_{0}$ and some of $e_{j^{\\prime}(1)}, \\ldots, e_{j^{\\prime}(b)}$, and it does not cross $e_{j(t)}$ for any $t$. Hence the sum of weights is at most $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{b^{\\prime}} w\\left(y_{j^{\\prime}(i)}\\right)=1+\\operatorname{sum}(A)=k$. We can show the same bound for $e_{j^{\\prime}(i)}$ and therefore $D$ is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing.\n\nConversely, suppose that there is a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$. Observe that, for any $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, the edge $e_{i}$ must cross either $e_{0}$ or $e_{n+1}$. Let $J$ denote the indices of edges that cross $e_{0}$ and $B=\\left\\{a_{j} \\mid j \\in J\\right\\}$. We define $J^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$ in a similar manner with $e_{n+1}$. It is clear that $\\left\\{B, B^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ is a partition of $A$. By the $k$-planarity of $D$, considering $e_{0}$, $\\sum_{j \\in J} w\\left(e_{j}\\right) \\leq k$ holds, which implies that $2 \\cdot \\operatorname{sum}(B) \\leq \\operatorname{sum}(A)+1$. As $\\operatorname{sum}(A)$ must be an even number, $\\operatorname{sum}(B) \\leq \\operatorname{sum}(A) / 2$ holds. We also obtain a bound $\\operatorname{sum}\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq \\operatorname{sum}(A) / 2$ in the same way. Therefore, we have $\\operatorname{sum}(B)=\\operatorname{sum}\\left(B^{\\prime}\\right)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 17, "text": "# - Corollary 10 (*). Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is in XNLP. \n\nProof. We show that Two-Sided $k$-Planarity can be solved in polynomial time and $k^{O(1)} \\log n$ space. The idea of the algorithm is almost analogous to those used in $[12,14]$. This can be done by non-deterministically guessing table indices $S, D, \\chi$, and $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_{S}$ of our dynamic programming and keeping track of table entries to check a certificate of a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing of $G$ without enumerating possible indices. It is easy to see that $S, D$, and $\\chi$ are encoded with $k^{O(1)} \\log n$ bits. Moreover, as seen in the proof of Theorem $9, \\mathcal{C}$ can be represented by a subset of $N(N(S)) \\backslash S$, which allows us to encode it with $k^{O(1)} \\log n$ bits as well. Therefore, the algorithm runs in polynomial time and uses $k^{O(1)} \\log n$ bits of space in total.\n\n- Theorem 11 (*). Two-Sided $k$-Planarity is XNLP-complete w.r.t. $k$ even on trees.\n\nProof. We perform a parameterized logspace reduction from BANDwIDTH, where given a graph $G$ and an integer $b$, the goal is to decide whether $\\operatorname{bw}(G) \\leq b$. This problem is known to be XNLP-hard when parameterized by $b$, even on trees $[11,14]$.\n\nLet $T$ be a tree with $n=|V(T)|$ and let $b$ be a non-negative integer. From the instance $(T, b)$ of Bandwidth, we construct an instance $(G, k)$ of Two-Sided $k$-Planarity as follows. Let $\\ell=2 b^{2}$. Starting with $T$, we subdivide each edge $e \\in E(T)$ by introducing a vertex $w_{v}$. Then, for each original vertex $v$ in $T$, we add $\\ell$ leaves that are adjacent to $v$. The leaves that are added in the above construction are called pendant vertices, and the edges incident to the pendant vertices are called pendant edges; other edges are called non-pendant edges. We let $G$ denote the graph obtained from $T$ in this way and set $k:=\\ell(b-1) / 2+2 b-2$. Observe that the graph $G$ is also a tree. Let $X=V(T)$ and $Y=V(G) \\backslash X$. It is not hard to verify that the construction of $G$ can be done in polynomial time and $O(\\log n)$ space, as we only subdivide each edge of $T$ once and add pendant vertices.\n\nSuppose that $G$ has a 2-layer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$. We claim that the bandwidth of the linear order $\\sigma$ on $V(T)$ naturally obtained from $<_{X}$ is at most $b$. Suppose for a contradiction that there exists an edge $e \\in E(T)$ whose stretch with respect to $\\sigma$ exceeds $b$. Then, in the drawing $D$, the two edges incident to $w_{v}$ cross at least $\\ell b$ pendant edges in total. This implies that $2 k \\geq \\ell b$. However,\n\n$$\n2 k=\\ell(b-1)+4 b-4=\\ell b+4 b-\\ell-4=\\ell b+2 b(2-b)-4<\\ell b\n$$\n\nfor $b \\geq 0$, which leads to a contradiction.\nConversely, suppose that $\\operatorname{bw}(G) \\leq b$. Let $\\sigma$ be a linear order of $V(T)$ with bandwidth at most $b$. We construct a 2-layer drawing $D=\\left(<_{X},<_{Y}\\right)$ of $G$ from $\\sigma$ and then show that $D$ is $k$-planar. We set $<_{X}$ to the linear order obtained from $\\sigma$ and sort the pendant vertices in $Y$ according to the order of their neighbors in $\\sigma$. For each $\\{u, v\\} \\in E(T)$, let $P_{u v}$ be the set of pendant edges incident to some vertex $x$ satisfying $u<_{X} x<_{X} v$. We then insert the vertex $w_{\\{u, v\\}}$ so that $\\left\\{u, w_{\\{u, v\\}}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{v, w_{\\{u, v\\}}\\right\\}$ cross exactly the same number of pendant edges of $P_{u v}$. This can be done as $P_{u v}$ has an even number of pendant edges. Note that no pendant edges outside of $P_{u v}$ cross either $\\left\\{u, w_{\\{u, v\\}}\\right\\}$ or $\\left\\{v, w_{\\{u, v\\}}\\right\\}$. The above construction yields a 2-layer drawing $D$ of $G$, and we show that $D$ is $k$-planar.\n\nWe first consider a pendant edge $e$, which is incident to a vertex $x \\in X$. Clearly, $e$ does not cross any other pendant edges. Moreover, for $f=\\{u, v\\} \\in E(T), e$ crosses exactly one of $\\left\\{u, w_{f}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{v, w_{f}\\right\\}$ incident to $w_{f}$ if $u<_{X} x<_{X} v ; e$ never crosses other non-pendent edges. As the stretch of $f$ is at most $b$, we have $\\sigma(x)-\\sigma(u) \\leq b-1$ and $\\sigma(v)-\\sigma(x) \\leq b-1$. Now, consider the vertex set $S_{x}=\\left\\{x^{\\prime}:\\left|\\sigma(x)-\\sigma\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\leq b-1\\right\\}$. Since $T$ is a tree, $T\\left[S_{x}\\right]$ is a forest, and hence $T\\left[S_{x}\\right]$ has at most $\\left|S_{x}\\right|-1=2 b-2$ edges. Thus, $e$ crosses at most $2 b-2$ non-pendant edges in $D$.\n\nWe next consider a non-pendant edge incident to a vertex $w_{e} \\in Y$ for some $e=\\{u, v\\}$. We only count the number of crossings involving $f:=\\left\\{u, w_{e}\\right\\}$ as the other case is symmetric. The edge $f$ crosses exactly $\\left|P_{u v}\\right| / 2 \\leq \\ell(b-1) / 2$ pendant edges. Similarly to the previous case, $f$ crosses at most $2 b-2$ non-pendant edges. Hence, there are at most $\\ell(b-1) / 2+2 b-2 \\leq k$ crossings involving $f$ in $D$. Therefore, $D$ is $k$-planar.\n\n- Lemma 13 (*). If $G_{\\tau, \\mathcal{E}, R}$ admits an outer $k$-planar drawing $D$ with properties P1 and P2, there is $w \\in R$ such that vertex pairs $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{v, w\\}$ are pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D$.\n\nProof. The claim can be shown by following the proof of [25, Lemma 6]. In that lemma, the authors considered a maximal outer $k$-planar graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and its outer $k$-planar drawing $D_{G}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$. By maximality, $G$ contains the edge $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{i+1}\\right\\}$ for every $i \\in[n-1]$ and the edge $\\left\\{v_{n}, v_{1}\\right\\}$. The authors called the cycle consisting of these edges the outer cycle. They showed that the outer cycle admits a triangulation such that each edge of the triangulation is pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D_{G}$.\n\nThe authors showed the existence of such a triangulation by showing that if the vertex pair $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{r}\\right\\}$ with $i+1<r$, which they call an active link in the proof, is pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D_{G}$, then there exists an index $j$ with $i<j<r$ such that both $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{v_{j}, v_{r}\\right\\}$ are pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D$. As $\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{n}\\right\\}$ is not pierced, starting from $\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{n}\\right\\}$, we can recursively construct a desired triangulation.\n\nSince they did not use the maximality of $G$ to show the existence of such an index $j$, we can apply the proof directly. Property P1, which requires the cyclic order of $D$ to contain $\\left(u, t_{1}^{r}, t_{2}^{r}, \\ldots, t_{r}^{r}, v\\right)$ as a consecutive subsequence, assures that $\\{u, v\\}$ has $\\ell \\leq k$ piercing edges. Hence, by treating $v$ and $u$ as $v_{i}$ and $v_{r}$, respectively, we obtain in the same manner a vertex $w \\in R\\left(=v_{j}\\right)$ such that $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{v, w\\}$ are also pierced by at most $k$ edges in $D$.\n\nLemma 15 (*). Let $G$ be a biconnected graph that admits an outer $k$-planar drawing $D$. Let $\\{u, v\\}$ be a pair of distinct vertices of $G$ that has at most $k$ piercing edges in $D$. Then the number of $R$ 's such that $\\operatorname{draw}((u, v), R, \\tau, \\chi)=\\operatorname{true}$ for some $\\tau$ and $\\chi$ is at most $2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}$, where $m=|E(G)|$. Moreover, such $R$ 's can be enumerated in $2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}$ time.\n\nProof. We first bound the number of disjoint paths between two vertices in $G$.\n\n$\\triangleright$ Claim 20. Let $G$ be an outer $k$-planar graph, and let $u$ and $v$ be two distinct vertices of $G$. Then, there are at most $2 k+3$ (internally) vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and $v$ in $G$.\n\nProof. Let $D=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ be an outer $k$-planar drawing of $G$. In the following, we assume that $u=v_{1}$ and $v=v_{i}$ for some $i$.\n\nWe first consider the case where there is an edge $\\{l, r\\}$ that pierces $\\{u, v\\}$ in $D$. Then, observe that each path between $u$ and $v$ that contains neither $l$ nor $r$ must cross the piercing edge $\\{l, r\\}$. Due to the $k$-planarity of $D$, there can be at most $k$ such paths, and hence, there are at most $k+2$ vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and $v$ in $G$.\n\nSuppose otherwise that no edge pierces $\\{u, v\\}$ in $D$. We say that a path is non-trivial if it has at least two edges. Observe that each non-trivial path between $u$ and $v$ is contained in either $X:=\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{i}\\right\\}$ or $Y:=\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{n}, \\ldots, v_{i}\\right\\}$ since there is no piercing edge. Suppose that there are $k+2$ disjoint non-trivial paths between $u$ and $v$ in $G[X]$. Let $v_{j}$ be the neighbor of $u=v_{1}$ in one of these paths such that all the other $k+1$ neighbors are between $v_{2}$ and $v_{j-1}$. Since these paths are non-trivial, the $k+1$ paths other than the one staring with $\\left\\{u, v_{j}\\right\\}$ must cross the edge $\\left\\{u, v_{j}\\right\\}$, contradicting the $k$-planarity of $D$. Thus, there are at most $k+1$ disjoint non-trivial paths between $u$ and $v$ in $G[X]$. By applying the same argument to $G[Y]$, there are at most $2 k+2$ disjoint non-trivial paths between $u$ and $v$ in $G$, which implies the claimed upper bound.\n\nWe now turn to the bound on the number of $R$ 's such that $\\operatorname{draw}((u, v), R, \\tau, \\chi)=$ true for some valid $\\tau$ and $\\chi$. To this end, we first remove the vertices $u$ and $v$ from $G$ and let $H$ be the remaining graph. Let $H_{1}, H_{2}, \\ldots, H_{c}$ be the connected components of $H$. Since $G$ is biconnected, we have $N_{G}\\left(H_{i}\\right)=\\{u, v\\}$ for every $i \\in[c]$. Moreover, by Claim 20, there are at most $2 k+3$ vertex-disjoint paths between $u$ and $v$. Hence, we have $c \\leq 2 k+3$.\n\nLet $H_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, H_{d}^{\\prime}$ be the connected components of the graph obtained from $H$ by deleting the edges $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{\\ell}$ that pierce $\\{u, v\\}$. Since each $R$ that is separated from $L=V(G) \\backslash(\\{u, v\\} \\cup R)$ in $H$ by removing the piercing edges $\\left\\{e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{\\ell}\\right\\}$ is a union of these components, there are $2^{d}$ possibilities for such $R$ 's. Clearly, for every $i \\in[\\ell]$, the piercing edge $e_{i}$ connects at most two of the components. Hence there are at most $2 k$ components that contain at least one end vertex of a piercing edge. Moreover, for each $H_{i}^{\\prime}$ that does not contain an end vertex of a piercing edge, we have $H_{i}^{\\prime}=H_{j}$ for some $j$. In other words, by not only removing $u$ and $v$ but also the $\\ell \\leq k$ edges piercing $\\{u, v\\}$, the number of resulting components increases by at most $2 k$. Therefore, we have $d \\leq c+2 k$, which implies that the number of possible $R$ 's is at most\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{k}\\binom{m}{\\ell} \\cdot 2^{d}=2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}\n$$\n\nThe above argument readily turns into an algorithm for enumerating such $R$ 's in time $2^{O(k)} m^{k+O(1)}$ as well.\n\n- Lemma 17 (*). If $G$ is outer $k$-planar, then $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq k-1$.\n\nProof. Let $D=\\left(w, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ be an outer $k$-planar drawing of $G$. We define $\\sigma: v_{i} \\mapsto i$ and show that $\\sigma$ is a linear order of $V(T)$ of bandwidth at most $k-1$. Observe that if $G$ contains the edge $e=\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\}$ with $i<j$, then $e$ crosses each edge $\\left\\{w, v_{\\ell}\\right\\}$ with $i<\\ell<j$. This implies that $j-i-1 \\leq k$. Hence, the stretch of $e$ is at most $k-1$.\n\n- Lemma 18 (*). Let $b \\geq 1$. If $\\operatorname{bw}(T) \\leq b$, then $G$ is outer $(5 b-5)$-planar.\n\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5 The figure depicts edges $e=\\left\\{w, v_{i}\\right\\}$ and $f \\in E(T)$ in $D$.\n\nProof. Let $\\sigma$ be a linear order of $V(T)$ with bandwidth at most $b$. Assume that $\\sigma\\left(v_{i}\\right)=i$, that is, $\\sigma$ is specified by the sequence $\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$. We then define a drawing $D$ of $G$ as $D=\\left(w, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ and show that $D$ is $(5 b-5)$-planar. To this end, we classify the edges in $G$ into two types, namely the edges incident to $w$ and the edges in $T$, and show that each type has at most $5 b-5$ crossings in $D$.\n\nLet $e=\\left\\{w, v_{i}\\right\\}$ be an edge incident to $w$. Since $e$ does not cross any other edges incident to $w$, it crosses edges in $T$ only. Suppose that $f=\\left\\{v_{j}, v_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\} \\in E(T)\\left(j<j^{\\prime}\\right)$ crosses $e$ in $D$. Then, the end vertices $v_{j}, v_{j^{\\prime}}$ of $f$ satisfies $j<i<j^{\\prime}$. As the stretch of $f$ is at most $b$, we have $i-j \\leq b-1$ and $j^{\\prime}-i \\leq b-1$. See Figure 5 for an illustration. Now, consider the vertex set $S_{i}=\\left\\{v_{i^{\\prime}}:\\left|i-i^{\\prime}\\right| \\leq b-1\\right\\}$. Since $T$ is a tree, $T\\left[S_{i}\\right]$ is a forest, and hence $T\\left[S_{i}\\right]$ has at most $\\left|S_{i}\\right|-1 \\leq 2 b-2$ edges. Thus, $e$ crosses at most $2 b-2$ edges in $D$.\n\nLet $f=\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\} \\in E(T)$ with $i<j$. The edge $f$ crosses exactly $j-i-1 \\leq b-1$ edges incident to $w$ in $D$. Moreover, $f$ crosses an edge $f^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i^{\\prime}}, v_{j^{\\prime}}\\right\\} \\in E(T)$ if and only if $i^{\\prime}<i<j^{\\prime}$ or $i^{\\prime}<j<j^{\\prime}$. Similarly to the previous discussion, there are at most $2 b-2$ edges $f^{\\prime}$ satisfying $i^{\\prime}<i<j^{\\prime}$. This implies that there are at most $4 b-4$ edges in $E(T)$ that cross $e$. Hence, there are at most $5 b-5$ crossings involving $f$ in $D$.\n\n- Theorem 19 (*). Outer $k$-Planarity is XNLP-hard when parameterized by $k$.\n\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 11, we show the claim by reducing from BANDWIDTH.\nFirst, we define a gadget called a clique path, denoted $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$, for every integer $t>1$ and every odd number $\\ell>1$. Let $H_{1}, H_{2}, \\ldots, H_{\\ell-1}$ be cliques of $t$ vertices and, for $i \\in[\\ell-1]$, let $v_{i, 1}, v_{i, 2}, \\ldots, v_{i, t}$ be the vertices of $H_{i}$. Then, $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$ is obtained by identifying $v_{i, t}$ and $v_{i+1,1}$ for each $i \\in[\\ell-2]$; see Figure 6. We call the $\\ell$ vertices $v_{1,1}, v_{2,1}, \\ldots, v_{\\ell-1,1}, v_{\\ell-1, t}$ anchor points. As $\\ell$ is odd, $(\\ell-1) / 2$ is an integer, and the vertex $v_{(\\ell-1) / 2, t}$ (and hence $v_{(\\ell+1) / 2,1}$ ) separates $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$ evenly: Each connected component after removing $v_{(\\ell-1) / 2, t}$ has exactly $(\\ell-1) / 2$ anchor points. We refer to this vertex as the middle vertex of $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$. By appropriately choosing $t, \\ell$, and $k$, the vertices of $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$ appear consecutively in any outer $k$-planar drawing. Intuitively, the clique path behaves as a single vertex, and its anchor points emulate the end vertices of $\\ell$ parallel edges.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6 The clique path $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$ with $\\ell$ anchor points.\n\nNow we construct an instance $(G, k)$ of Outer $k$-Planarity from an instance $(T, b)$ of BANDWidth. Without loss of generality, we assume that $b \\geq 3$. We let $t=4\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)+2$, $\\ell=4 b^{3}+1$, and $k=((t-2) / 2)^{2}=4\\left(b^{2}+1\\right)^{2}=4 b^{4}+8 b^{2}+4$. Let us note that a clique of $t$ vertices admits an outer $k$-planar drawing. Moreover, each vertex in the clique is incident to an edge that has exactly $k$ crossings in any outer $k$-planar drawing. Starting with an empty graph $G$, we add a clique path $\\mathrm{CP}(t, \\ell)$ for each vertex $v \\in V(T)$ and denote it by $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$. Then, we add a vertex $w$ with edges connecting to all anchor points in $G$. Lastly, for each edge $\\{u, v\\} \\in E(T)$, we add an edge between the middle vertices of $\\mathrm{CP}_{u}$ and $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$.\n\nSuppose that there is a linear order $\\left(v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right)$ of $V(T)$ with bandwidth at most $b$. Then, we construct a cyclic order of $V(G)$ by aligning $\\left(w, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{1}}, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{2}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{n}}\\right)$ in this order, where the inner order of the vertices of each clique path $\\mathrm{CP}_{v_{i}}$ is\n\n$$\n\\left(v_{1,1}, v_{1,2}, \\ldots, v_{1, t}, v_{2,1}, \\ldots, v_{2, t}, \\ldots, v_{\\ell-1,1}, \\ldots, v_{\\ell-1, t}\\right)\n$$\n\nObserve that the edges of a clique in a clique path only cross the edges in the same clique, and their crossing numbers are at most $((t-2) / 2)^{2}=k$. Thus, in the rest of the proof, we can ignore the crossings involved in the edges of the cliques. As in the proof of Lemma 18, $G$ has two types of edges: The edges incident to $w$ and the edges between two middle vertices, which corresponds to edges of $T$. Following the same analysis as in Lemma 18, each edge of the first type crosses at most $2 b-2$ edges in $D$. Let $e$ be an edge of the second type that connects the middle vertices of $\\mathrm{CP}_{u}$ and $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$ for some $u, v \\in V(T)$. This edge $e$ crosses at most $4 b-4$ edges of the second type in $D$. Moreover, there are at most $2(\\ell-1) / 2+\\ell(b-1)=\\ell b-1$ anchor points between the middle vertices in $D$, each of which has an incident edge of the first type that crosses $e$. Hence, $e$ crosses at most $\\ell b+4 b-5=4 b^{4}+5 b-5<k$ edges in total. Therefore, $D$ is an outer $k$-planar drawing of $G$.\n\nTo show the other direction, we first observe that the vertices in each clique path $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$ appear consecutively as (3) in any outer $k$-planar drawing of $G$. We say that two circular drawings $D=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{h}\\right)$ and $D^{\\prime}=\\left(v_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, v_{h}^{\\prime}\\right)$ of a graph are isomorphic if the mapping $v_{i} \\mapsto v_{i}^{\\prime}$ is an automorphism of the graph.\n$\\triangleright$ Claim 21. Let $D$ be an outer $k$-planar drawing of $G$. Then, for each $v \\in V(T)$, the vertices in the clique path $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$ appear consecutively as (3) in $D$, which is unique up to isomorphism.\n\nProof. Let $D^{*}=\\left(w, u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{h}\\right)$ be the subdrawing of $D$ induced by $w$ and the vertices in $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$. In the following, $D$ and $D^{*}$ are considered to be linear orders starting from $w$. For each $u_{j}$, there is an incident edge that crosses exactly $k$ edges of the same clique $H_{i}$ in $D^{*}$. We call such edges critical edges in $H_{i}$. Observe that if an edge $e=\\left\\{u_{p}, u_{q}\\right\\}$ with $p<q$ is a critical edges in $H_{i}$, there are exactly $(t-2) / 2$ vertices in $H_{i}$ between $u_{p}$ and $u_{q}$, not including $u_{p}$ or $u_{q}$. This also implies that $e$ is a unique critical edge incident to $u_{p}$ and $u_{q}$.\n\nWe now claim that the vertices in a clique $H_{i}$ of $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$ appear consecutively in $D$. Suppose otherwise. Then there are two vertices $u_{p}$ and $u_{q}$ with $p<q$ that belong to the same clique $H_{i}$ such that at least one vertex $w^{\\prime} \\notin V\\left(H_{i}\\right)$ appears between them in $D$. We choose the largest $p$ and the smallest $q$ satisfying the above condition. Note that the vertex $w^{\\prime}$ may not belong to $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$. As $w^{\\prime} \\notin V\\left(H_{i}\\right)$, there is a path between $w$ and $w^{\\prime}$ that avoids vertices in $H_{i}$. Let $e$ and $e^{\\prime}$ be the (possibly identical) critical edges of $H_{i}$ incident to $u_{p}$ and $u_{q}$, respectively. If one of the critical edges $e$ and $e^{\\prime}$ jumps over $w^{\\prime}$, at least one edge of $P$ crosses this critical edge, which violates the $k$-planarity of $D$. Thus, the other end of $e$ appears before $w^{\\prime}$ in $D$ and the other end of $e^{\\prime}$ appears after $w^{\\prime}$ in $D$, that is, it holds that $e=\\left\\{u_{p}, u_{p^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ for some $p^{\\prime}<p$ and $e^{\\prime}=\\left\\{u_{q}, u_{q^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ for some $q<q^{\\prime}$. Since both $e$ and $e^{\\prime}$ are critical edges in $H_{i}$, there are exactly $(t-2) / 2$ vertices between $u_{p}$ and $u_{p^{\\prime}}$ and exactly $(t-2) / 2$ vertices between $u_{q}$ and $u_{q^{\\prime}}$, which are disjoint. This contradicts the fact that $H_{i}$ has $t$ vertices.\n\nWe next claim that the vertices in $\\mathrm{CP}_{v}$ appear consecutively as (3) in $D$. Suppose otherwise. Since all the vertices in $H_{i}$ are consecutive in $D$ for all $i$, they must be ordered as (3) except for two extreme anchor points $v_{1,1}$ and $v_{\\ell-1, t}$. Suppose that $u_{1} \\neq v_{1,1}$. Let $e$ be the critical edge incident to $u_{1}$. Since $e$ cannot cross the edge $\\left\\{w, v_{1,1}\\right\\}$ in $D$ due to its criticality, the other end of $e$ appears before $v_{1,1}$. By considering the critical edge $e^{\\prime}$ incident to $v_{1, t}$, we can derive a contradiction similar to the one above.\n\nNow suppose that $G$ has an outer $k$-planar drawing $D=\\left(w, w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{N}\\right)$, where $N=$ $|V(G)|$. By Claim 21, the vertices in each clique path appear consecutively in $D$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, that is, $D$ is of the form $\\left(w, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{1}}, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{2}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{CP}_{v_{n}}\\right)$. Let $\\sigma$ be the linear order on $V(T)$ defined as $\\sigma\\left(v_{i}\\right)=i$ for $v_{i} \\in V(T)$. Consider an edge $\\left\\{v_{i}, v_{j}\\right\\} \\in E(T)$ with $i<j$. As we discussed in the proof of Theorem 16, the edge between the middle vertices of $\\mathrm{CP}_{v_{i}}$ and $\\mathrm{CP}_{v_{j}}$ must cross the edges that connect $w$ and anchor points between the middle vertices. The number of such anchor points is at most $k$ due to the $k$-planarity of $D$. Since there are at least $\\ell(j-i-1)+\\ell-1$ anchor points between them, we have $\\ell(j-i)-1 \\leq k$. Therefore, it holds that $j-i \\leq(k+1) / \\ell=b+\\left(8 b^{2}-b+4\\right) /\\left(4 b^{3}+1\\right)$, which is strictly less than $b+1$ if $b \\geq 3$.", "tables": {}, "images": {"img-7.jpeg":

"id": "2412.04042v3", "authors": ["Yasuaki Kobayashi", "Yuto Okada", "Alexander Wolff"], "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.CC", "cs.CG"], "abstract": "The crossing number of a graph is the least number of crossings over all\ndrawings of the graph in the plane. Computing the crossing number of a given\ngraph is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the\nnatural parameter. Two well-known variants of the problem are 2-layer crossing\nminimization and circular crossing minimization, where every vertex must lie on\none of two layers, namely two parallel lines, or a circle, respectively. Both\nvariants are NP-hard, but FPT with respect to the natural parameter.\n  Recently, a local version of the crossing number has also received\nconsiderable attention. A graph is $k$-planar if it admits a drawing with at\nmost $k$ crossings per edge. In contrast to the crossing number, recognizing\n$k$-planar graphs is NP-hard even if $k=1$.\n  In this paper, we consider the two above variants in the local setting. The\n$k$-planar graphs that admit a straight-line drawing with vertices on two\nlayers or on a circle are called 2-layer $k$-planar and outer $k$-planar\ngraphs, respectively. We study the parameterized complexity of the two\nrecognition problems with respect to $k$. For $k=0$, both problems can easily\nbe solved in linear time. Two groups independently showed that outer 1-planar\ngraphs can also be recognized in linear time [Hong et al., Algorithmica 2015;\nAuer et al., Algorithmica 2016]. One group asked whether outer 2-planar graphs\ncan be recognized in polynomial time.\n  Our main contribution consists of XP-algorithms for recognizing 2-layer\n$k$-planar graphs and outer $k$-planar graphs. We complement these results by\nshowing that both recognition problems are XNLP-hard. This implies that both\nproblems are W$[t]$-hard for every $t$ and that it is unlikely that they admit\nFPT-algorithms. On the other hand, we present an FPT-algorithm for recognizing\n2-layer $k$-planar graphs where the order of the vertices on one layer is\nspecified.", "updated": "2025-04-11T06:47:11Z", "published": "2024-12-05T10:31:08Z"}
