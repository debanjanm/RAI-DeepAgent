InTRODUCTION\n\nThe $F$-pure threshold, introduced by Takagi and Watanabe in [TW04], is a numerical invariant associated to rings with $F$-pure singularities. $F$-pure singularities are an example class of $F$-singularities, which are classes of singularities defined in positive characteristic using the Frobenius map. Suppose $R$ is a reduced $F$-finite $F$-pure ring of characteristic $p>0$, and let $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq R$ be a nonzero ideal. For a real number $t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, the pair $\\left(R, \\mathfrak{a}^{t}\\right)$ is called $F$-pure if for every $q=p^{e} \\gg 0$, there exists an element $f \\in \\mathfrak{a}^{\\lceil(q-1) t\\rfloor}$ (where $\\lfloor(q-1) t\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number $(q-1) t$ ) such that the map $R \\rightarrow R^{1 / q}$ which sends 1 to $f^{1 / q}$ splits as an $R$-module homomorphism. The $F$-pure threshold of $\\mathfrak{a}$ is defined to be\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{a}):=\\sup \\left\\{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0} \\mid\\left(R, \\mathfrak{a}^{t}\\right) \\text { is } F \\text {-pure }\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal homogeneous ideal of $R$, we will simply refer to $\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{m})$ as the $F$-pure threshold of $R$.\n\nThe $F$-pure threshold has been calculated for the determinantal rings of generic matrices [STV17, Proposition 4.3], Hankel matrices [CMSV18, Theorem 4.5], and is trivial for skew-symmetric matrices (see section 2.1 for an explanation). However, to the author's knowledge, $\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{m})$ has been unknown for the symmetric matrix case. We provide an answer in Theorem 2.6, as well as a proof that the symmetric determinantal ring is $F$-pure, a fact not clearly stated in the literature.\n\nNote. At the time of writing this article, the author was notified of the recent paper [CSV24], which includes a proof of the more general property of $F$-regularity for symmetric determinantal rings, and mentions the same conclusion of Proposition 2.5 in this article. Our work is independent of that paper.\n\nAcknowledgements. I would like to thank Irena Swanson, Vaibhav Pandey, and my advisor Uli Walther for providing helpful discussions.

Symmetric Determinantial Rings \n\nSuppose that $X=\\left(x_{i j}\\right)$ is a symmetric $n \\times n$ generic matrix (i.e., $x_{i j}=x_{j i}$ ), let $\\mathbb{k}[X]=\\mathbb{k}\\left[x_{i j} \\mid 1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq n\\right]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $\\mathbb{k}$ with the entries of $X$ as its variables, and $I_{t}(X)$ be the ideal generated by the $t$-minors of $X$. For an integer $1 \\leq t \\leq n$ let $R=\\mathbb{k}[X] / I_{t}(X)$ be the symmetric determinantal ring. A formula for the $a$-invariant of $R$ has been given by Barile in [Bar94]. When $R$ is given the standard grading this is given as follows:\n\n$$\na(R)= \\begin{cases}-(t-1) \\frac{n}{2}, & \\text { if } n \\equiv t(\\bmod 2) \\\\ -(t-1) \\frac{n+1}{2}, & \\text { if } n \\not \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIn [Con94] it is shown that the graded canonical module of $R$ is\n\n$$\n\\omega_{R}= \\begin{cases}R\\left(-(t-1) \\frac{n}{2}\\right), & \\text { if } n \\equiv t(\\bmod 2) \\\\ \\mathfrak{p}\\left(-(t-1) \\frac{n-1}{2}\\right), & \\text { if } n \\not \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime ideal generated by the $t-1$ minors of the first $t-1$ rows of $X$. In [Got79] and [Got77] Goto shows that $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if $n \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)$, and the divisor class group of $R$ is $\\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $[\\mathfrak{p}]$.\nLemma 2.1. [DSMnNnB23, (4.2)] Suppose $S$ is a polynomial ring over a field of characteristic $p>0$, and let $I \\subset S$ be a prime ideal of $h=\\operatorname{height}(I)$. Then $I^{(h(p-1))} \\subseteq$ $\\left(I^{[p]}:_{S} I\\right)$, i.e., $I^{(h(p-1))+1} \\subseteq I^{[p]}$.\nProof. To show the containment $I^{(h(p-1))+1} \\subseteq I^{[p]}$, it is enough to show it locally at all the associated primes of $S / I^{[p]}$. However, since the Frobenius map is flat, the set of associated primes of $S / I^{[p]}$ is the same as for $S / I$, which consists only of $I$ since it is prime. In the regular local ring $\\left(S_{I}, I S_{I}\\right)$ the symbolic power of $I S_{I}$ coincides with its ordinary power since $I S_{I}$ is a maximal ideal. Hence it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left(I S_{I}\\right)^{(h(p-1))} I=\\left(I S_{I}\\right)^{h(p-1)} I=\\left(I S_{I}\\right)^{h(p-1)+1}\n$$\n\nSince $\\left(S_{I}, I S_{I}\\right)$ has dimension $h=\\operatorname{height}(I)$, its unique maximal ideal $I S_{I}$ is generated by $h$ elements $g_{1}, \\ldots, g_{h}$. The power $\\left(I S_{I}\\right)^{h(p-1)+1}$ is generated by $g_{1}^{a_{1}} \\cdots g_{h}^{a_{h}}$ such that $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{h}=h(p-1)+1$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one $a_{i} \\geq p$, hence it follows that $\\left(I S_{I}\\right)^{h(p-1)+1} \\subseteq I^{[p]} S_{I}$.\nProposition 2.2. Over a field of characteristic $p>0$ the symmetric determinantal ring $R$ is $F$-pure.\nProof. Let $I_{t}=I_{t}(X)$, and $S=\\mathbb{k}[X]$ be the polynomial ring in $n(n+1) / 2$ many variables. We will apply Fedder's criterion: $R$ is $F$-pure if and only if $\\left(I_{t}^{[p]}:_{S} I_{t}\\right) \\nsubseteq \\mathfrak{m}_{S}^{[p]}$, where $\\mathfrak{m}_{S}=\\left(x_{i j}\\right)$ is the maximal homogeneous ideal of $S$. Thus, in order to show that $R$ is $F$-pure, we need to find an element $f \\in\\left(I_{t}^{[p]}:_{S} I_{t}\\right) \\backslash \\mathfrak{m}_{S}^{[p]}$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{D}=d_{1} \\cdots d_{n}$ be a product of $i$-minors $d_{i}$ of the $i \\times i$ submatrices in the bottomleft corner of $X$ (for $i=1, \\ldots, n$ ), whose diagonals are the $n$ distinct diagonals of $X$ (see Example 2.3 below). Our proposed element will be $f=\\mathfrak{D}^{p-1}$. The leading term of $\\mathfrak{D}$ with respect to the diagonal term ordering\n\n$$\nx_{11}>x_{12}>\\cdots>x_{1 n}>x_{21}>\\cdots>x_{n-1 n}>x_{n n}\n$$\n\nis in $(\\mathfrak{D})=\\prod_{1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq n} x_{i j}$, which is the product of all the distinct variables of $X$, hence it is a squarefree monomial. This implies $\\mathfrak{D}^{p-1} \\notin \\mathfrak{m}_{S}^{[p]}$.\n\nNext, we need to show $\\mathfrak{D}^{p-1} I_{t} \\subseteq I_{t}^{[p]}$, i.e., $\\mathfrak{D}^{p-1} \\in\\left(I_{t}^{[p]}:_{S} I_{t}\\right)$. It suffices to prove this containment after localizing at the prime ideal $I_{t}$. If one can show that $\\mathfrak{D}$ belongs to the symbolic power $I_{t}^{(h)}$, where $h=\\operatorname{height}\\left(I_{t}\\right)$, then it would follow\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{D}^{p-1} I_{t} S_{I_{t}} \\subseteq\\left(\\left(I_{t} S_{I_{t}}\\right)^{(h)}\\right)^{p-1} I_{t} S_{I_{t}}=\\left(I_{t} S_{I_{t}}\\right)^{h(p-1)+1} \\subseteq I_{t}^{[p]} S_{I_{t}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(I_{t} S_{I_{t}}\\right)^{(h)}=\\left(I_{t} S_{I_{t}}\\right)^{h}$, because $I_{t} S_{I_{t}}$ is the (unique) maximal ideal of $S_{I_{t}}$, and the last containment follows from Lemma 2.1. We will now show $\\mathfrak{D} \\in I_{t}^{(h)}$. In [Kut74, Theorem 1], Kutz has shown that $\\operatorname{dim} R=n(t-1)-\\frac{1}{2}(t-1)(t-2)$, hence it follows\n\n$$\nh=\\operatorname{dim} S-\\operatorname{dim} R=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-n(t-1)+\\frac{(t-1)(t-2)}{2}\n$$\n\nIn general, suppose $\\Delta$ is a product $\\delta_{1} \\cdots \\delta_{u}$ of $a_{i}$-minors $\\delta_{i}$ of $X$, where the vector $\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{u}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{u}$ is called the shape of $\\Delta$. With the previous notation, the symbolic power $I_{t}^{(k)}$ is described by\n\n$$\n\\left[\\Delta \\in I_{t}^{(k)}\\right] \\Longleftrightarrow\\left[a_{i} \\leq n \\forall i \\text { and } \\gamma_{t}(\\Delta):=\\sum_{i=1}^{u} \\max \\left\\{0, a_{i}-t+1\\right\\} \\geq k\\right]\n$$\n\n(see [JMnV15, Proposition 4.3].) We must show $\\gamma_{t}(\\mathfrak{D}) \\geq h$. Observe that the product $\\mathfrak{D}=d_{1} d_{2} \\cdots d_{n}$ has shape $(1,2, \\ldots, n)$, and note that $i-t+1>0 \\Leftrightarrow i>t-1$, hence $\\max \\{0, i-t+1\\}=i-t+1$ for $t \\leq i \\leq n$. Thus, one has\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\gamma_{t}(\\mathfrak{D}) & =\\sum_{i=t}^{n}(i-t+1) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=t}^{n} i+\\sum_{i=t}^{n}(1-t) \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-\\frac{t(t-1)}{2}+(n-t+1)(1-t) \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-n(t-1)+\\frac{(t-1)(t-2)}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\ni.e., $\\gamma_{t}(\\mathfrak{D})=$ height $\\left(I_{t}\\right)=h$, so it follows that $\\mathfrak{D} \\in I_{t}^{(h)}$.\n\nExample 2.3. For the $3 \\times 3$ symmetric matrix\n\n$$\nX=\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}\nx_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} \\\\\nx_{12} & x_{22} & x_{23} \\\\\nx_{13} & x_{23} & x_{33}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nthe $i$-minors $d_{i}(i=1,2,3)$ of the $i \\times i$ botom-left corner of $X$ are\n\n$$\nd_{1}=x_{13}, \\quad d_{2}=\\left|\\begin{array}{ll}\nx_{12} & x_{22} \\\\\nx_{13} & x_{23}\n\\end{array}\\right|, \\quad d_{3}=|X|\n$$\n\nwhich have leading terms in $\\left(d_{1}\\right)=x_{13}, \\operatorname{in}\\left(d_{2}\\right)=x_{12} x_{23}$, and in $\\left(d_{3}\\right)=x_{11} x_{22} x_{33}$, hence $\\mathfrak{D}=d_{1} d_{2} d_{3}$ has squarefree leading term $x_{11} x_{12} x_{13} x_{22} x_{23} x_{33}$.\n\nLemma 2.4. [Gri, Lemma 1.71] Let $Q$ be a primary ideal of a Noetherian ring $R$. If $P$ is a prime ideal that contains $Q$, then $Q R_{P} \\cap R=Q$.\n\nProposition 2.5. Over a field $\\mathbb{k}$ of arbitrary characteristic, let $\\mathfrak{p}$ be the prime ideal of $R=\\mathbb{k}[X] / I_{t}(X)$ generated by the $t-1$ minors of the first $t-1$ rows of $X$. Then the second symbolic power $\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)}$ is principally generated by the $(t-1)$-minor in the top left-hand corner of $X$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ represent the $(t-1)$-minor in the top left corner of $X$. By Proposition (1) of [Got77] the radical of the principal ideal $(d)=d R$ is the prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$. To see that $(d)$ is primary note that $R$ is a Cohen-Macaulay domain by [Kut74, Theorem 1], and $d \\in R$ is a nonzero divisor, hence $R /(d)$ is Cohen-Macaulay, so all associated primes of $(d)$ are minimal. Since $\\sqrt{(d)}=\\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, it follows that $(d)$ is $\\mathfrak{p}$-primary.\n\nBy Proposition (2) of [Got77], the local ring $R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a discrete valuation ring with valuation $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, and $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(d)=2$. Let $(d) R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ be the extension of $(d)$ in $R$ to $R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$. This is a nonzero proper ideal in $R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ by the valuation of $d$. Since every proper nontrivial ideal of a DVR $R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ is a power of the unique maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{p} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$, we have $(d) R_{\\mathfrak{p}}=\\mathfrak{p}^{m} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}=\\{a \\in$ $\\left.R_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\mid v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(a) \\geq m\\right\\}$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. From $v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(d)=2$, it follows that $(d) R_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}^{2} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$. Also, $d \\in \\mathfrak{p}^{m} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ implies $2=v_{\\mathfrak{p}}(d) \\geq m$, so $m$ is either 1 or 2 . However, $\\mathfrak{p}^{m} R_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}^{2} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$ can only mean $m=2$, so it follows $(d) R_{\\mathfrak{p}}=\\mathfrak{p}^{2} R_{\\mathfrak{p}}$.\n\nSince $d \\in \\mathfrak{p}$, one has $(d) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}$, and it follows from Lemma 2.4 and our previous discussion that $(d)=(d) R_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\cap R=\\mathfrak{p}^{2} R_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\cap R=\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)}$.\n\nTheorem 2.6. The F-pure threshold of the symmetric determinantial ring $R=\\mathbb{k}[X] / I_{t}(X)$ over an $F$-finite field $\\mathbb{k}$ is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{m})=\\frac{n(t-1)}{2}\n$$\n\nWhen $\\mathbb{k}$ has characteristic zero, the log canonical threshold of $\\mathfrak{m}$ shares the same value.\nProof. The ring $R=\\mathbb{k}[X] / I_{t}$ is Gorenstein if and only if $n \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)$, hence it follows from [DSNnB18, Theorem 5.2] and equation (2.1) that $\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{m})=-a(R)=(t-1) \\frac{n}{2}$, when $n \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)$. Now, suppose $R$ is non-Gorenstein, i.e., $n \\not \\equiv t(\\bmod 2)$. Its $a$-invariant and graded canonical module are respectively $a(R)=-(t-1) \\frac{n+1}{2}$ and $\\omega_{R}=\\mathfrak{p}\\left(-(t-1) \\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)$ (see (2.2)). Since the class group $\\mathrm{Cl}(R)$ is cyclic of order 2, the ring $R$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein, so we will apply [STV17, Proposition 4.5]. We determine the generating degree $D$ of $\\omega_{R}^{(2)}$. First, note that $\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)}$ is principally generated by a $(t-1)$ minor, by Proposition 2.5, hence as graded modules $\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)} \\cong R(-(t-1))$. The second\n\nsymbolic power of $\\omega_{R}$ is then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{R}^{(2)}=\\left(\\mathfrak{p}\\left(\\frac{-(t-1)(n-1)}{2}\\right)\\right)^{(2)} & =\\mathfrak{p}^{(2)}\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{-(t-1)(n-1)}{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =R(-(t-1))(-(t-1)(n-1)) \\\\\n& =R(-(t-1)-(t-1)(n-1)) \\\\\n& =R(-(t-1) n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is generated in degree $D=(t-1) n$. It follows that $\\operatorname{fpt}(\\mathfrak{m})=D / c=n(t-1) / 2$.\nIn characteristic zero, one has by [MTW05, Theorem 3.4] that the log canonical threshold of $R$ is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{lct}(\\mathfrak{m})=\\lim _{p \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{fpt}\\left(\\mathfrak{m}_{R_{p}}\\right)=\\frac{n(t-1)}{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathfrak{m}_{R_{p}}$ is the image of $\\mathfrak{m}$ in $R_{p}$, the prime reduction modulo $p$ of $R$.\n2.1. Ring of Pfaffians. Let $X=\\left(x_{i j}\\right)$ be an $n \\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix (i.e., $x_{i i}=0, x_{i j}=-x_{j i}$ for $i<j), \\mathbb{k}[X]$ be the polynomial ring in the entries of $X$, and $\\operatorname{Pf}_{2 t}(X)$ be the ideal generated by the $2 t$-Pfaffians of $X$. The ring of Pfaffians $R=$ $\\mathbb{k}[X] / \\operatorname{Pf}_{2 t}(X)$ is Gorenstein [Avr79] and strongly $F$-regular [Bata01]. Its $a$-invariant has been computed in [BH92, Corollary 1.7], and assuming it is standard graded, is given by $a(R)=-n(t-1)$, if $2 t \\leq n$. By [DSNnB18, Theorem 5.2] we immediately get the following.\n\nProposition 2.7.
