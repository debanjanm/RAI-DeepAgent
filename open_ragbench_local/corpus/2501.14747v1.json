This study contributes to the discourse by examining the interplay of technological, economic, and demographic factors on environmental sustainability. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), energy consumption, and urbanization on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the United States from 1990 to 2022. Employing the ARDL framework integrated with the STIRPAT model, the findings reveal a dual narrative: while AI innovation mitigates environmental stress, economic growth, energy use, FDI, and urbanization exacerbate environmental degradation. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) confirm mixed integration levels among variables, and the ARDL bounds test establishes long-term co-integration. The analysis highlights that AI innovation positively correlates with $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reduction when environmental safeguards are in place, whereas GDP growth, energy consumption, FDI, and urbanization intensify $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR validate the ARDL findings. Additionally, Pairwise Granger causality tests reveal significant one-way causal links between $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and economic growth, AI innovation, energy use, FDI, and urbanization. These relationships emphasize the critical role of AI-driven technological advancements, sustainable investments, and green energy in fostering ecological sustainability. The study suggests policy measures such as encouraging green FDI, advancing AI technologies, adopting sustainable energy practices, and implementing eco-friendly urban development to promote sustainable growth in the USA.\n\n\nKeywords: AI Innovation, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Emission, Energy Use, FDI, STIRPAT", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "## Introduction\n\nThe environment is crucial for supporting life on Earth; nevertheless, the increasing global pollution and waste have emerged as a significant problem in recent years [1,2]. The majority of climate-altering and planet-warming substances emitted into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)$ [3]. The United States (USA) distinguishes itself among these nations through its evolution as a dominant force in consumption as well as production [4]. In 2020, the USA emitted 5,416 metric tons (MT) of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, or almost $16 \\%$ of global emissions [5]. However, in 2021, the United States reinforced its dedication to the Paris Agreement, adopting an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution to reach a $50-52 \\%$ drop in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 [6,7]. The United States consumes the largest quantity of fossil fuel annually, totaling 913.3 million tons of oil, which is $50 \\%$ greater than China's consumption, the second highest globally [8,9]. Alleviating the adverse effects of global climate change has emerged as a worldwide priority, with a crucial component of this effort being the reduction of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions [10,11]. In accordance with the UN 2030 universal sustainable development objective, the advancement of renewable energy is prioritized above everything else. Consequently, the USA has considerable accountability for the climate crisis and global warming, being one of the foremost emitters of GHGs; thus, assessing its environmental sustainability is a critical issue. In this context, our research question is\n\nto examine the response of GDP, FDI, energy consumption, urbanization, and AI innovation on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the context of United States.\nSeveral scholars have thoroughly investigated the ecological conditions in the United States, mostly utilizing pollution metrics such as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions [12,13]. By encouraging domestic investment, facilitating technological transfers in the receiving nation, and boosting the development of human capital, foreign direct investment (FDI) enhances economic growth and is therefore essential to economic development [14]. Another viewpoint holds that FDI improves host countries' surroundings by bringing cutting-edge environmental technologies and sustainable practices [15,16]. The environment field is not an exception to the dramatic transformations we have lately experienced in numerous industries as artificial intelligence (AI) has grown more integrated. The United States leads in AI development and will be essential in developing suitable guardrails and regulatory frameworks that promote the responsible use of the technology [17]. The development of AI technologies can help address several global green growth concerns. Furthermore, applying AI can reduce environmental emissions [18]. Businesses are facing pressure to curtail GHG emissions and promote environmentally friendly practices as the global community battles climate change.\nIn 2020, the United States was the second-largest contributor to world pollution, producing 4.7 billion metric tons of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Multiple studies has demonstrated the mixed consequences of GDP on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission in different regions [19,20,21]. After acknowledging this fact, politicians and governments must create plans for resource sustainability and seek solutions that strike a balance between ecological sustainability and GDP [22]. Increased use of clean energy sources is thought to be able to lessen the negative economic effects of climate change [23,24]. Between 2005 and 2022, emissions from the energy sector decreased by $35.9 \\%$, during which the sector represented almost one quarter of total US emissions. Furthermore, the United States' share of GDP in 2015 that went toward renewable energy was $0.2 \\%$, far less than that of other developing nations like South Africa (1.4\\%), China ( $0.9 \\%$ ), India ( $0.5 \\%$ ), and Brazil ( $0.4 \\%$ ) [25]. With a $15.8 \\%$ share of primary energy consumption and $13.8 \\%$ share of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in 2020, the United States is also the world's top primary energy consumer [26].\nThis study enhances existing research in the following manners: Firstly this paper critically analyzes the correlation among AI innovation, foreign direct investment, and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the United States. Secondly, unlike previous studies that solely examined developing nations, this research focuses on one of the world's most industrialized countries with a robust financial system, with the aim of investigating and clarifying the relationship between financial systems and environmental sustainability. Moreover, it is the inaugural investigation of the dynamic interconnections among AI innovation, energy consumption, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Specifically the United States provides an ideal context for investigating the correlation between economic activity and environmental sustainability, given its significant ecological deficit and developed economy. This study reveals that while AI innovation reduces $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, factors such as GDP, FDI, urbanization, and energy consumption exacerbate environmental degradation. This unique contribution is vital for stakeholders as it offers tangible insights into how industrialized countries, like the USA, may harmonize economic growth with environmental sustainability. Additionally, the research corroborates the STIRPAT framework along with sophisticated methods like ARDL in the United States, employing a contemporary dataset from 1990 to 2022. Furthermore, it employs a comprehensive approach and innovative econometric models to offer significant insights that aid the United States in its endeavors to attain SDG-7 and SDG-13, especially in the quest for carbon neutrality. This research offers governments, corporations, and environmental advocates scientifically substantiated ideas for reconciling economic and environmental objectives, chiefly via financial, technological, and industrial modifications.\nThe subsequent portions of this work are organized as follows: Section II examines the pertinent literature, Section III delineates the methodology and data, Section IV showcases the results and analysis, and Section V explores the policy implications and conclusions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# Literature Review \n\nIt is clear from a thorough analysis of earlier research that not many studies have looked into the connection between GDP, energy use, FDI, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, and AI innovation. The bulk of publications concentrated on the effects of trade openness, urbanization, and green energy usage on environmental quality, even though several investigations looked at the ARDL model. The USA hasn't seen much indepth research on ecological degradation, a relatively young discipline. Nevertheless, the research drew upon a few previous studies to guide the selection of variables and methods. This section will address a select few of these questions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "## GDP and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission\n\nNumerous researches have been conducted to ascertain the correlation between environmental and economic activity. For example, Manu and Sulaiman [27] examined the impact of energy consumption and economic growth on Malaysia's $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions utilizing the OLS method for the years 1965 to 2015. Their research demonstrated that $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions diminish as revenue escalates. The favorable relationship between economic expansion and CO 2 emission is found by Saudi et al.[28], and Zubair et al.[29]. Conversely, Sarkar et al. [30] analyzed time-series data from 1980 to 2016 to investigate the relationship among Malaysia's energy use, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, and economic expansion. The empirical evidence indicated that usage of energy and economic expansion substantially elevated $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Malaysia from 1980 to 2016. In order to examine the relationship between GDP and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, Chen et al. [31] used China's annual data from 1990 to 2020 and the QARDL technique. They discovered that China's GDP has a positive effect on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Etokakpan et al. [32] analyzed the relationship between capital formation, globalization, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, and GDP in Malaysia using a dataset from 1980 to 2014 within a multivariate framework. The authors employed an innovative combined co-integration test to ascertain the magnitude of the long-run equilibrium relationship. The empirical findings indicated that GDP adversely affected environmental quality. Multiple researcher such as Wada et al.[33] within Brazil, Rjoub et al. [34] in Turkey and He at al.[35] within Mexico found the same conclusions. On the other hand, Muhammad et al. [36] employed FMOLS and two-stage least squares regression methods to analyze the correlation between GDP growth and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. The findings corroborated the U -shaped link indicated by the EKC theory in high- and upper-middle-income nations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "## AI innovation and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission\n\nThe loss of biodiversity and global warming are complex concerns that require advanced and inventive solutions [37]. Environmental professionals anticipate several benefits from AI tools [38]. Policymakers can use AI innovation to develop scientifically supported plans and strategies for green ecosystems [39. Existing research indicates that investigations on carbon reduction related to AI are in their infancy. A pertinent study by Liu et al. [40] analyzes industrial robot data from 16 sectors in China from 2006 to 2016 to investigate the correlation between AI and energy intensity. The implementation of AI technology in the industrial sector diminishes energy intensity by enhancing industrial output while decreasing energy consumption and environmental degradation. Chen et al. [41] investigate the impact of AI on carbon emissions utilizing panel data from 270 Chinese cities spanning 2011 to 2017. Their empirical findings indicate that AI decreases carbon emissions by optimizing production processes, boosting communication facilities, and advancing green technological innovation. Negi [42] examines the investment trends in artificial intelligence originating from the three leading nations: China, India, and the United States. The paper delineates the measures the government has implemented to integrate artificial intelligence into its existing ecosystem. Green AI can enhance productivity and mitigate its adverse environmental impacts [43].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "## Energy Use and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission\n\nThe primary contributor to climate change is the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases significant quantities of greenhouse gases into the environment [44]. But long-term cost reductions from using\n\nalternative or green energy sources will raise people's overall level of living [45]. Raihan et al. [46] examine the relationship between energy use and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Malaysia from 1990 to 2019. They employed the ARDL and DOLS methodologies, which revealed a positive and significant energy use coefficient in relation to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, indicating a $0.91 \\%$ rise in $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions for every $1 \\%$ increase in energy usage. Adebayo and Kalmaz [47] employed ARDL, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators to reveal a substantial positive correlation between power consumption and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Egypt, utilizing data from 1971 to 2014. Moreover, Adebayo et al. [48] identified a positive correlation between $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and energy consumption by employing the ARDL model for MINT nations, covering the period from 1980 to 2018. Conversely, Raihan and Tuspekova [49] examined the correlation between green energy utilization and CO2 emissions in Peru from 1990 to 2018. Using the DOLS and ARDL methodologies, they found a negative correlation and statistical significance in the utilization of clean energy, suggesting that a $1 \\%$ increase in green power use results in a $0.52 \\%$ reduction in CO 2 emissions over the long term. Multiple researcher such as Abbasi and Adedoyin [50] in China, Balsalobre-Lorente et al.[51] across BRICS countries, Saqib [52] in MENA region corroborated the destructive effect of energy usage on environment quality. On the other hand, Younis et al.[53], Salari et al.[54] concluded that energy consumption boost the environment quality. In the end, energy-efficiency regulations can enhance energy conservation, while increased investment in energy production and the promotion of energy savings will diminish carbon emissions [55].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# FDI and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission \n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) can facilitate the transfer of cleaner technologies and sustainable practices, leading to enduring reductions in emissions [29,56]. Jafri et al. [57] investigate the asymmetric impact of FDI on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions utilizing the NARDL methodology for China from 1981 to 2019. Their findings indicate that a positive shift in FDI has a comparatively greater impact on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions. Moreover, several studies also found the same conclusion in different region [58,59,60,61]. On the other hand, Lin et al. [62] examine the impact of FDI on emission reduction in China from 2004 to 2015, employing geographic Durbin economic models with two-way fixed effects. The findings indicate that FDI facilitates a decrease in emissions nationwide. Furthermore, Eskeland and Harrison [63] contended that FDI typically accompanies energy-efficient technologies and may positively impact the natural world. Similar outcomes were also observed by Wang et al. [64] in China, Pata and Samour [65] within France, and Abbas et al.[66] in developing countries. Conversely, Haug and Ucal [67] shown that spikes in FDI had no statistically significant long-term effects on per capita CO2 emissions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "## Urbanization and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission\n\nEconomic growth and industrialization-driven urbanization are contributing to the rising utilization of fuels that generate greenhouse gas emissions [68].The concluding section of the research examines previous studies on the empirical relationship between urbanization and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission. For instance, Mahmood et al. [69] examine the impact of urbanization on per capita $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Saudi Arabia, analyzing data from the years 1968 to 2014. The findings indicate that urbanization hinders the environment due to its elastic impact on emissions. Parshall et al. [70] examined the substantial impact of urbanization on the circular economy and environmental health in the USA. Raihan et al. [71] explore the impact of urbanization on the load capacity factor in Mexico from 1971 to 2018. This study utilizes the ARDL approach and demonstrates that urbanization decreases Mexico's LCF, thereby degrading the ecology. Sufyanullah et al. [72] examined the impact of urbanization on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in Pakistan. They employed the ARDL model and noted that $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions rise with increased urbanization. Additional studies $[73,74,75,76,77]$ suggest that urbanization increases $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the atmosphere. In comparison, Xu et al. [78] evaluated the impact of urbanization on the ecosystem in Brazil from 1970 to 2017. Unexpectedly, the results of the ARDL methodology indicated that urbanization does not influence the surroundings in Brazil. Moreover, Haseeb et al. [79] revealed analogous findings utilizing FMOLS\n\nfrom 1995 to 2014, suggesting that URB had no significant impact on environmental quality in the BRICS nations. Nonetheless, as highlighted by Martinez et al. [80] urbanization may contribute to addressing climate change due to the heightened knowledge among these groups. Moreover, Diputra and Baek [81] determined that urbanization exerted no substantial impact on emissions in Indonesia.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# Literature Gap \n\nThe current status of research indicates that studies on the USA are scarce. The empirical literature lacks an evaluation of the geographical implications of macroeconomic variables on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the USA.

This study tries to fill in that gap by looking at modern variables using advanced methods from a U.S. point of view. The goal is to find the main and secondary effects of GDP, AI innovation, energy consumption, urbanization, and FDI on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in this area.

This method is a versatile analytical tool that facilitates the understanding of intricate relationships between human societies and the environment, irrespective of the subject matter, including GHG emissions, air pollution,\n\ndeforestation, or biodiversity loss [82]. By using STIRPAT, this study allows for an extensive evaluation of numerous variables that affect $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the context of USA. The IPAT model was proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren [83] and is phrased as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}=\\int \\mathrm{PAT}\n$$\n\nNonetheless, this model proved challenging to evaluate hypothetically [84]. To address these constraints, Dietz and Rosa [85] expanded the IPAT model, resulting in the STIRPAT model. This research can effectively assess the interplay between human activities and environmental outcomes by representing $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions as the ' I ' or impact variable, urbanization as the ' P ', and other variables like AI innovation, GDP, energy consumption, as the ' T ' or technological variables.

Moreover, unlike previous cointegration approaches that necessitated prior identification of a series' integration characteristic, this approach does not mandate any preliminary validation [94].

The Lagrange multiplier test examines residuals for serial correlation to verify that errors do not correlate with time, thereby preventing biased and misleading estimates. The Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey test can yield inaccurate estimates and standard errors due to heteroscedasticity, or the non-constant variance of residuals. The model's stability was assessed by CUSUMSQ studies [105].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 19, "text": "## Results and Discussion\n\nTable 2 lays out the descriptive statistics for the considered variables, derived from 32 observations. The table provides the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for six variables in the USA: LCO2, LGDP, LAI, LENU, LFDI, and LURBA. All examined variables demonstrate positive mean values, with LCO2 showing the highest mean. LFDI has a minimum value of 2.268 , while LURBA has the highest number.\n\nTable 2. Summary Statistics.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nMoreover, all variables have relatively small standard deviations, indicating a tight clustering of data points around the mean with limited temporal variability. Table 3 presents the results of all three stationarity tests (ADF, DF-GLS, and P-P) for log-transformed data in both level I(0) and firstdifference $\\mathrm{I}(1)$ forms. In all three unit root assessments, it seems that only the urbanization variable is stationary at level $\\mathrm{I}(0)$, whereas $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, GDP, AI innovation, energy consumption, and FDI were nonstationary prior to examining their initial differences. This mixed sequence of integration prompts us to proceed with the assessment immediately, using the ARDL methodology.\n\nTable 3.

The F-statistic of 5.3421 is more than the critical value, indicating that the null hypothesis of no co-integration is rejected at the $1 \\%$ significance level. Therefore, we can argue that the parameters of the model exhibit co-integrating relationships. This study cites urbanization, artificial intelligence innovation, foreign direct investment, gross domestic product, and energy consumption as the enduring driving forces. Furthermore, these factors necessitate the system's initial response to a typical stochastic disturbance. In summary, variations in these three parameters influence CO 2 emissions in the United States.\n\nTable 4. Results of ARDL bound test.\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nTable 4 and table 5 adopts the dynamic ARDL model to demonstrate the short- and long-term effects of LGDP, LAI, LENU, LFDI, and LURBA on $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ in the USA. In terms of LGDP, a $1 \\%$ boost in LGDP will increase the LCO2 by $0.028 \\%$ in the long-term run and $0.012 \\%$ in the short run. This suggests that economic expansion alone may notably contribute to environmental degradation in this setting, as GDP has a positive impact on the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission level. A few studies have concluded that a boost in the GDP has a negative impact on the environment. This includes Ahmed et al. [106] in Japan; Raihan and Tuspekova [107] within Kazakhstan; Orhan et al. [108] on India; Ali et al. [109] in Malaysia; Shang et al.\n\n[58] for ASEAN countries. However, Le and Ozturk [110], Zhan et al.[111], Tufail et al.[112] and He et al.[113] discovered the opposite outcome. They also concluded that economic pressures no longer adversely affect the natural world. Likewise, Awosusi et al. [114] demonstrated that there is no significant correlation between CO2 emissions and GDP in MINT economies.\nOn the other hand, the coefficients for LAI indicate a positive correlation with $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, implying a $0.054 \\%$ long-term fall and $0.076 \\%$ short-term cut in LCO2 for every $1 \\%$ rise in PAI. Thus, private investment in artificial intelligence in the United States significantly contributes to environmental sustainability. AI enhances energy efficiency and promotes environmental sustainability by decreasing carbon emissions. Multiple researchers like Nishant et al. [37], Chen et al.[31] and Zhao et al.[115] support this result, stating that AI technologies improve the environmental conditions in different regions. Moreover, Wang et al. [116] discovered that invention patents exhibited no significant correlation with emissions decrease. Conversely, $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ is negatively associated with LENU in both the long and short run, and this relationship is statistically significant. These findings suggest that energy consumption has an adverse impact on the USA ecosystem. Specifically, a $1 \\%$ increase in LENU increases $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ by $0.617 \\%$ in the long run and by $0.321 \\%$ in the short run. The utilization of energy results in increased carbon emissions, as fossil fuels, the predominant energy source, emit substantial $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ during combustion. This result is consistent with the research of Islam et al. [117] in Bangladesh, Kim [118] in OECD countries, Nurgazina et al. [119] in Malaysia, Akbota and Baek [120] within Kazakhstan, and Odugbesan and Adebayo [121] in Nigeria. On the other hand, the findings of Namahoro et al. [122], Bhat [123], and Sharif et al. [4] concluded that energy use can have a negative impact on the environment by increasing the pollution level.\n\nTable 5. Results of ARDL short-run and Long-run.\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nSimilarly, there is an unfavorable correlation between LFDI and $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, with each $1 \\%$ increase in FDI increases the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission by $0.018 \\%$ in the long run and $0.031 \\%$ in the short run. This result is significant at the $1 \\%$ level. One possible reason is that FDI frequently results in elevated industrial activity, increased energy consumption, and intensified resource exploitation; hence, it amplifies environmental deterioration. Nie et al. [124], and Zhang et al. [125] corroborate this result. Conversely, Azam and Raza [126], Shah et al.[127], Pazienza [128] and Pradhan et al. [129] revealed that FDI can mitigate $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and improve biodiversity quality. Additionally, the positive and statistically significant URBA coefficients indicate that both long-term and short-term increases in LURBA negatively affect environmental quality. A $1 \\%$ increase in URBA raises $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ by $0.710 \\%$ in the long run and by $0.641 \\%$ in the short run. These findings suggest that the current urbanization structure in the United States is not conducive to reducing pollution. Several researchers have also observed a similar outcome, including Yuan et al. [130] in China, Ali et al. [131] in Pakistan, Anwar et al. [132] in Asian economies, Sikder et al.[133] in developing economies, and Raihan et al. [71]. However, studies conducted by Wang et al.[76], Acheampong [12], Zhu et al. [134], and Gasimli et al. [135] have demonstrated that urbanization enhances environmental sustainability by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe DOLS, FMOLS, and CCR techniques are supplementary methodologies utilized to evaluate the validity and reliability of the ARDL results. Table 6 outlines the robustness findings.\nIn the FMOLS model, the coefficients for LGDP are statistically significant at the $1 \\%$ level and have positive values. A $1 \\%$ increase in GDP causes the $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ to rise by $0.245 \\%$. Additionally, a $1 \\%$ increment in LAI leads to a $0.034 \\%$ drop in $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission in the USA. Furthermore, a $1 \\%$ boosts in LENU and LFDI and LURBA upsurges $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ by $0.074 \\%, 0.053 \\%$ and $0.231 \\%$, respectively. It indicates that GDP, energy consumption, FDI and urbanization are not good for better for the ecosystem in USA. These findings corroborate the ARDL short and long-run estimation results, with LGDP, LAI, LENU and LFDI significant at the $1 \\%$ level, while LURBA are significant at the $5 \\%$ level. In the DOLS model, a $1 \\%$ spike in LGDP, LENU, LFDI and LURBA results in an average rise of $0.316 \\%, 0.023 \\%, 0.039 \\%$, and $0.143 \\%$ in $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, respectively. Similar to the ARDL findings, a $1 \\%$ rise in LAI leads to a $0.010 \\%$ reduction in $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, and the coefficient for LAI is significant at the $5 \\%$ level.\nIn the CCR model, a $1 \\%$ increase in LGDP, LENU, LFDI and LURBA leading to an average rise of $0.217 \\%, 0.354 \\%, 0.049 \\%$, and $0.205 \\%$ in $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, respectively. However, a $1 \\%$ increase in LAI causes an average $0.037 \\%$ decrease in $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$, confirming the ARDL results except for the LAI case. In this case all the factors are significant at $1 \\%$ level, while LURBA is significant at $5 \\%$ thresholds. These robustness checks confirm that the ARDL model's findings are reliable, as evidenced by the statistically significant values across FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR computations.\n\nTable 6. Results of Robustness check.\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\nTable 7 presents the conclusions of causal relationships among several economic indices. An F-statistic of 3.38423 and a p-value of 0.0102 suggest that LLGDP does not cause Granger-cause $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$. This indicates the rejection of the null hypothesis asserting no correlation between the variables at the $1 \\%$ significance level. Also, p-values below the usual level of significance supported the finding that LAI, LENU, LFDI and LURBA all had a single-direction effect on $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$. Consequently, under these conditions, we dismiss the null hypothesis, asserting the absence of causation. On the other hand, p -values higher than the usual significance level showed that there was no significant causal relationship from $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ to LGDP, LAI, LENU, LFDI and LURBA. The null hypothesis, which posits the absence of causality in these interactions, is not effectively disproved.\n\nTable 7. Results of Pairwise Granger Causality test\n\n![table_6](table_6)\n\nThe results of the diagnostic evaluation are shown in Table 8. The findings indicated that the efficacy of all diagnostic techniques is negligible, and the null hypothesis remains indisputable. The Jarque-Bera test, yielding a p -value of 0.4321 , suggests a normal distribution of the residuals. The Lagrange multiplier analysis indicates the absence of serial correlation in the residuals, yielding a p -value of 0.1021 . Finally, the Breusch-Pagan-Godfrey test indicates that the residuals do not display heteroscedasticity, yielding a pvalue of 0.1283 .\n\nTable 8. The results of diagnostic tests\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\nFurthermore, we use the CUSUM and CUSUM-SQ statistics to seek structural stability in residuals over long and short periods. The CUSUM-SQ plot stays on the critical line, as indicated in the figure 1, indicating that the results are within the critical limits. This shows that the parameters are satisfactory and consistent at the $5 \\%$ level of significance.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1.

{"section_id": 20, "text": "# Conclusion and Policy Implications \n\nThis paper thoroughly examines the impact of AI innovation, economic growth, foreign direct investment, energy consumption, and urbanization on $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the USA from 1990 to 2022. Combining the ARDL framework with the STIRPAT structure, the authors found that while AI innovation reduces stress on the environment, economic growth, energy use, foreign direct investment, and urbanization make these problems worse. The results of the ADF, PP, and DF-GLS tests show that the variables have different levels of integration and no unit root problems. The ARDL boundaries test offers additional evidence of co-integration, signifying solid long-term interactions. The ARDL findings show a positive correlation between AI innovation and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions in the USA, suggesting that AI technologies improve environmental health as long as appropriate environmental safeguards are in place. In contrast, the adverse correlations among GDP, ENU, FDI, URBA, and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions indicate that these elements lead to detrimental environmental consequences. Significant technological advancements, including energy conservation, sustainable foreign direct investment, and urban planning, may stimulate new concepts and the implementation of environmentally friendly practices by enhancing competitiveness and facilitating access to advanced technologies. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR enhance the credibility of the ARDL results, thereby increasing their trustworthiness. Another thing is that Pairwise Granger causality tests show strong one-way links between $\\mathrm{LCO}_{2}$ and LGDP, LAI, LENU, LFDI, and LURBA. These linkages highlight the significant impact of economic transformations, private investments in AI, and advancements in green energy utilization on ecological sustainability dynamics in the USA. The research suggests various policy measures to promote sustainable economic growth in the United States, including the use of foreign direct investment, technological advancements, the implementation of green energy, and the development of sustainable urban infrastructure.\n\nThe findings emphasize the need for targeted policies to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. Promoting AI-driven technologies and green energy initiatives can reduce $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions while fostering innovation. Policies should prioritize sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI) by incentivizing eco-friendly projects and encouraging energy-efficient practices. Urban planning reforms must focus on developing smart, sustainable cities to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization. Additionally, integrating AI in energy management and industrial processes can enhance efficiency and reduce environmental stress. These measures collectively support sustainable economic growth while safeguarding ecological health in the USA.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 21, "text": "# Declaration \n\nEthics approval/declaration: Not applicable.\nConsent to participate: Not applicable.\nConsent for publication: Not applicable.\nAcknowledgment: Not applicable.\nConflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nData availability: Data will be available upon reasonable request from corresponding author.\nAuthors contribution: Azizul Hakim Rafi, Abdullah Al Abrar Chowdhury, and Adita Sultana from contributed equally to the conceptualization, data collection, and analysis of the study.

This study contributes to the\ndiscourse by examining the interplay of technological, economic, and\ndemographic factors on environmental sustainability. This study investigates\nthe impact of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, economic growth, foreign\ndirect investment (FDI), energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions\nin the United States from 1990 to 2022. Employing the ARDL framework integrated\nwith the STIRPAT model, the findings reveal a dual narrative: while AI\ninnovation mitigates environmental stress, economic growth, energy use, FDI,\nand urbanization exacerbate environmental degradation. Unit root tests (ADF,\nPP, and DF-GLS) confirm mixed integration levels among variables, and the ARDL\nbounds test establishes long-term co-integration. The analysis highlights that\nAI innovation positively correlates with CO2 reduction when environmental\nsafeguards are in place, whereas GDP growth, energy consumption, FDI, and\nurbanization intensify CO2 emissions. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and\nCCR validate the ARDL findings. Additionally, Pairwise Granger causality tests\nreveal significant one-way causal links between CO2 emissions and economic\ngrowth, AI innovation, energy use, FDI, and urbanization. These relationships\nemphasize the critical role of AI-driven technological advancements,\nsustainable investments, and green energy in fostering ecological\nsustainability. The study suggests policy measures such as encouraging green\nFDI, advancing AI technologies, adopting sustainable energy practices, and\nimplementing eco-friendly urban development to promote sustainable growth in\nthe USA.", "updated": "2024-12-20T03:03:21Z", "published": "2024-12-20T03:03:21Z"}
