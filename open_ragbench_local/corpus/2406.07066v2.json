Introduction. Understanding how to infer and interpret interactions between measured components of large scale systems is a central question in many scientific fields, including Neuroscience, Statistical Physics, and Social Networks (Strogatz, 2001). This has been done traditionally in the framework of probabilistic graphical models (Lauritzen, 1996), in which the interaction among the components of the system is encoded through a graph, sometimes referred to as the graph of conditional dependencies. For such models, a fundamental question is that of estimating the underlying graph of conditional dependencies or some function of it from data. Over the past three decades, this question has been extensively investigated not only under the assumption that the data is a set of independent and identically distributed observations and the underlying graphical model has pairwise interactions (Bresler, 2015; Montanari and Pereira, 2009; Ravikumar, Wainwright and Lafferty, 2010), but also for time-dependent data (Eichler, 2012; Duarte et al., 2019; Reynaud-Bouret, Rivoirard and Tuleau-Malot, 2013) or graphical models with high-order interactions (Basu and Michailidis, 2015; Lerasle and Takahashi, 2016). In recent years, understating the theoretical guarantees of the proposed methods (e.g., consistency, computational complexity) in the high-dimension setting became a major issue, as now the simultaneous activity of many components can be routinely recorded. In high-dimension, most of the works assume that the underlying graph of dependencies is sparse in a suitable sense, showing that under this assumption the proposed method performs reasonably well. The cases in which the graphs of\n\ndependencies are dense, on the other hand, are much less studied. In this setting we are only aware of the works of (Byol Kim and Kolar, 2021; Delattre and Fournier, 2016) and (Liu, 2020). In these works the focus is not on the estimation of the graph of dependencies of the corresponding graphical model, as we detail in what follows.\n\nIn (Byol Kim and Kolar, 2021), particularly motivated by applications in Genetics and Neuroscience, the authors propose a density ratio approach to estimate the \"difference network\", the difference between two graphs of dependencies. The key assumption in their approach is that this difference network is sparse and, in particular, their method can also be applied when each individual graph is dense as long as their difference is sparse. (Delattre and Fournier, 2016) consider a graphical model with pairwise interactions for which the graph of dependencies is a realization of a weighted Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph with edge probability $p$. Specifically, (Delattre and Fournier, 2016) work with $N$ Hawkes point processes on $[0, T]$ - a class of point processes in which the intensity at any given time is a linear function of the past events - where each pair of these point processes are independently coupled with probability $p$. Moreover, the existing interactions are excitatory and of mean-field type (i.e., the occurrence of an event increases the chance of a new event to occur and the increment scales as $1 / N$ ). The main goal of the paper is not to estimate the random graph of dependencies but rather the density of connections of this graph (the parameter $p$ ) based only on the information present in the $N$ point processes on $[0, T]$. Under some few extra assumptions, the authors show that this can be done with a precision of the order $N^{-1 / 2}+N^{1 / 2} / m_{T}$ (up to some correction factor) where $m_{T}$ denotes the mean number of events per point process. In (Liu, 2020), the author complements the analysis started in (Delattre and Fournier, 2016) by investigating the problem of estimating the density of connections $p$ in the same setting with the difference being that now one has access only to the information present in $K$ Hawkes point processes for some large $K \\leq N$. Under this constraint, (Liu, 2020) proposes an estimator of the parameter $p$ with rate of convergence $K^{-1 / 2}+N /\\left(K^{1 / 2} m_{T}\\right)+N /\\left(K m_{T}^{1 / 2}\\right)$.\n\nIn the present paper, we consider a graphical model which is defined in terms of a system of $N$ interacting $\\{0,1\\}$-valued chains $X=\\left\\{X_{i, t}, t \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 1 \\leq i \\leq N\\right\\}$ and a random matrix $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{i j}\\right)_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq N}$ of i.i.d entries distributed as $\\operatorname{Ber}(p)$. The event $X_{i, t}=1$ indicates that the $i$-th chain sends some signal at time $t$, and $X_{i, t}=0$ otherwise. Let $X_{t}=\\left(X_{1, t}, \\ldots, X_{N, t}\\right)$ be the configuration of the system $X$ at time $t$. The model is defined as follows. Conditionally on $\\theta$, the system $X$ evolves as a stationary Markov chain on the state space $\\{0,1\\}^{N}$ in which the conditional distribution of $X_{t}$ given that $X_{t-1}=x$ is that of $N$ independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p_{\\theta, i}(x), i=1, \\ldots, N$, where\n\n$$\np_{\\theta, i}(x)=\\mu+(1-\\lambda)\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}} \\theta_{i j} x_{j}+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\theta_{i j}\\left(1-x_{j}\\right)\\right), x=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $0<\\lambda<1$ and $0 \\leq \\mu \\leq \\lambda$ are parameters, and $\\mathcal{P}_{+}, \\mathcal{P}_{-}$are subsets of $[N]=\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$ forming a partition. Neither the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ nor the subsets $\\mathcal{P}_{+}$and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}$depend on the random matrix $\\theta$.\n\nThe function $p_{\\theta, i}(x)$ appearing in (1) models the probability of observing a new signal for the $i$-th chain given that the configuration of the system at the precedent time is $x$. The parameter $\\mu$ models the baseline activity of each interacting chain. Note that the probability $p_{\\theta, i}(x)$ depends on the past $x$ only through the values $x_{j}$ for which $\\theta_{i j}=1$, so that the random matrix $\\theta$ encodes the interaction among the chains of the system. In light of this, $\\theta$ can be considered as the proxy for the graph of conditional dependencies of the model. Note also that each chain is either excitatory or inhibitory in the model; the set $\\mathcal{P}_{+}$denotes the set of excitatory chains and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}$the set of inhibitory ones. An excitatory chain increases the probability of future signals to occur whenever it sends any signal, whereas the signals sent\n\nby any inhibitory chain reduce the probability of occurrence of new signals. The increment of this changing is $(1-\\lambda) / N$, implying that the interactions are of mean-field type and that $1-\\lambda$ parametrizes the strength of the interactions.\n\nIn what follows, we denote $r_{+}^{N}=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{+}\\right| / N$ and $r_{-}^{N}=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{-}\\right| / N$ the fraction of excitatory and inhibitory components of the model, respectively, and suppose that there are values $0<$ $r_{+}, r_{-}<1$ satisfying $r_{+}+r_{-}=1$ such that $\\left|r_{+}^{N}-r_{+}\\right| \\vee\\left|r_{-}^{N}-r_{-}\\right| \\leq K N^{-1}$ for some universal constant $K$. One can easily check that a choice satisfying this assumption with $K=1$ is $\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{+}\\right|=\\left\\lceil r_{+} N\\right\\rceil$ and $\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{-}\\right|=N-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{+}\\right|$.\nProblem formulation. The goal of this paper is to address the following statistical question. By observing a sample $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{T}$ of the system $X$, can we estimate the asymptotic density of connections $p$ of the random matrix $\\theta$, knowing only the size of the system $N$ and the asymptotic fraction of excitatory and inhibitory components $r_{+}$and $r_{-}$? This means that we do not assume any prior knowledge on $\\mu, \\lambda, p, \\theta, \\mathcal{P}_{+}, \\mathcal{P}_{-}$, i.e., they are all unknown.\n\nAlthough the estimation problem investigated here is similar to the ones considered in (Delattre and Fournier, 2016; Liu, 2020), our work is different from theirs in at least two substantial ways. First, in their model the interaction between each pair of components can only be excitatory, whereas it can be either excitatory or inhibitory in ours, making the analysis of the estimation problem (especially the study of the random environment) more challenging. Second, a crucial step in the analysis is to study the decay of correlation between $X_{i, t}$ and $X_{j, s}$ (and of products of these), for each fixed realization of the random matrix $\\theta$. In our case, this is done through the study of coalescing random walks defining a backward regeneration representation of the system $X$. Interestingly, we show that this backward regeneration representation allows us to perform perfect simulation of the system $X$. That is, one can exactly sample the system $X$ (conditionally on $\\theta$ ) from its unique stationary distribution. These probabilistic results have an interest in its own. In (Delattre and Fournier, 2016) and (Liu, 2020), on the other hand, the analysis of the model for each realization of the graph of conditional dependence follows a rather different approach, fundamentally based on martingale arguments. Moreover, the question of how to perfectly sample the underlying process is not discussed.\n\nAs will become apparent in our results, we can not only estimate the parameter $p$ but also the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$. In our main result, we show that the parameters $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$ can be simultaneously estimated with rate $N^{-1 / 2}+N^{1 / 2} / T+(\\log (T) / T)^{1 / 2}$, under some extra conditions on the asymptotic fraction $r_{+}$of excitatory components of the model. This convergence rate is consistent with the one found in (Delattre and Fournier, 2016) (up to a $\\log (T)$ factor), because the quantity $m_{T}$ (adapted to our setting) increases linearly in $T$. In Appendix I, we briefly discuss the optimality of our estimation rate by analyzing two related statistical settings in which the observations follow a binomial mixture model. Taken together, the results in Appendix I suggest that our estimation rate may be near optimal. Establishing rigorously such a result in the statistical setting considered in this paper remains an interesting open problem.\n\nWe are particularly motivated by the statistical analysis of neuronal networks. Neurons communicate with each other by firing short electrical pulses, often called spikes. The spiking times of a network of neurons depend on its graph of interaction, a combinatorial structure (typically unknown) encoding the type of interaction (excitatory or inhibitory) between each pair of neurons in the network. An important question in Neuroscience is to understand which features of this graph can be inferred from the spiking times of the recorded neurons. Our results suggest that one such feature is the density of connections in the graph, as long as we know the true fraction $r_{+}$of excitatory neurons in the network. In many situations, this turns out to be the case. For example, in humans and many other mammalian species the value $r_{+}$ is known and ranges from 0.7 to 0.8 .\n\nAnalogously to Delattre and Fournier (2016), our results also hold in the symmetric interaction case, namely when $\\left(\\theta_{i j}\\right)_{1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N}$ are i.i.d. and $\\theta_{i j}=\\theta_{j i}$ for all $1 \\leq i, j \\leq N$. Only a few steps in the proofs need to be adapted when working in this new framework, and all these modifications are located in Appendix F. We have gathered the details at the beginning of that section.\n\nThroughout the paper, the parameter $p$ does not scale with the number of components $N$ of the system $X$, ensuring that the random matrix $\\theta$ remains typically dense. An interesting open question is whether our results extend to sparse regimes, where $p=c / N$ for some positive constant $c>0$ or $p \\sim \\log (N) / N$. In these sparse regimes, the model must be suitably modified, as the normalization factor $N^{-1}$ is no longer appropriate. Furthermore, many of the results concerning the coalescing random walks associated with the backward regeneration representation of the system $X$ (e.g. Proposition 3.5) do not directly apply and require substantial extensions. Such extensions are beyond the scope of this work.\n\nFinally, let us highlight two recent works (Gaitonde, Moitra and Mossel, 2024) and (Chevallier and Ost, 2024), which appeared during the revision of this paper. The work of (Gaitonde, Moitra and Mossel, 2024) deals with the problem of estimating order $k$ graphical models with $N$ sites and bounded degree from dependent trajectories generated by Glauber dynamics. Among their results, the authors show that given $O(N \\log N)$ total site updates from the Glauber trajectory, it is possible to correctly output the conditional dependency structure of the underlying graphical model in time $O\\left(N^{2} \\log N\\right)$, overcoming the known $N^{\\Theta(k)}$ computational barrier of the i.i.d. setting. Our framework differs from theirs in two key aspects. First, the dynamics of their model is reversible, whereas ours is not. Second, their analysis assumes that the chosen site to be updated is always observed at each time step, even when the configuration of the system remains unchanged, an assumption that may be difficult to verify in some real datasets. The work of (Chevallier and Ost, 2024) complements the analysis done in the present paper by addressing the problem of estimating the sets $\\mathcal{P}_{+}$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}$without prior knowledge of the other model parameters. We believe these results could enable us to estimate edge probability $p$ even without knowing the asymptotic fraction of excitatory and inhibitory components $r_{+}$and $r_{-}$of the system $X$. For sake of simplicity, we do not pursue this extension in the present work.\n\nIn the next section we define our model rigorously, introduce some general notation used throughout the paper, state our main results and give some heuristics behind them. At the end of that section, we also provide the organization of the rest of the paper.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 2. Model definition, notation and main results. \n\nModel definition. We consider a system of $N$ interacting chains $X=\\left\\{X_{i, t}, t \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 1 \\leq i \\leq\\right.$ $N\\}$ taking values in $\\{0,1\\}$ denoting the presence or the absence of a signal at a given time. This system evolves in a random environment which is given by the realization of a directed Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random graph via the selection of $N^{2}$ i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables $\\theta_{i j} \\sim$ $\\operatorname{Ber}(p), 1 \\leq i, j \\leq N$ with $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$. Conditionally on the realization of $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{i j}\\right)_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq N}$, the evolution of the system $X$ is that of a stationary Markov chain on the state space $\\{0,1\\}^{N}$ with transition probabilities (which depend on $\\theta$ ) given as follows. Writing $X_{t}=\\left(X_{1, t}, \\ldots, X_{N, t}\\right)$ and $x, y \\in\\{0,1\\}^{N}$, we have, for all $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(X_{t}=y \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N}\\left(p_{\\theta, i}(x)\\right)^{y_{i}}\\left(1-p_{\\theta, i}(x)\\right)^{\\left(1-y_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{\\theta, i}(x)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, t}=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)$ is defined in (1). The existence and uniqueness of a stationary version of the Markov chain having transition probabilities as defined in (2) and (1) is granted by Theorem 3.3 presented in Section 3.\n\nNotation. Throughout the paper, the letters $t, s$ denote some time values whereas the letters $i, j$ denote some spatial values, that is the index of the corresponding component. For a vector $v$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$, the notation $\\bar{v}$ denotes the spatial mean $\\bar{v}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_{i}$. In agreement with the left-hand side of (2), we write $I P_{\\theta}$ to denote the probability measure under which the environment $\\theta$ is kept fixed and the process $X$ is distributed as the unique stationary version of the Markov chain having transition probabilities as defined in (2) and (1). The expectation taken with respect to $I P_{\\theta}$ is denoted by $I E_{\\theta}$. The variance and covariance computed from $I E_{\\theta}$ are denoted $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}$ respectively. Moreover, we write $I P$ to denote the probability measure under which the random environment $\\theta=\\left(\\theta_{i j}\\right)_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq N}$ is distributed as a collection of i.i.d. random variables with distribution $\\operatorname{Ber}(p)$ and the conditional distribution of the process $X$ given $\\theta$ is that of the process $X$ under $I P_{\\theta}$, i.e., the following identity holds $I P(X \\in \\mid \\theta)=I P_{\\theta}(X \\in \\cdot)$. Finally, we denote $I E$ the expectation taken with respect to the probability measure $I P$, and Var and Cov the variance and covariance, respectively, computed from $I E$.\n\nMain results. We are given a sample $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{T}$ of a stationary Markov chain with transition probabilities given by (2) and (1), associated to some realization of the random environment $\\theta$ which is not observed. The goal is to estimate the parameter $p$, the asymptotic density of connections in the underlying random environment. We consider an estimator of $p$ which is a function of three other estimators defined below. In what follows, let $\\bar{X}_{t}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i, t}$ denote the average number of signals emitted by the system at time $t ; Z_{i, t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} X_{i, s}$ denote the number of signals emitted by the $i$-th component of the system in the discrete interval $\\{1, \\ldots, t\\}$ and $\\bar{Z}_{t}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Z_{i, t}$ denote the average number of signals emitted by the system in the interval $\\{1, \\ldots, t\\}$. For notational convenience, we set $\\bar{Z}_{0}:=0$. With this notation, our three main estimators are defined as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\hat{m}=\\frac{\\bar{Z}_{T}}{T}, \\quad \\hat{v}=\\frac{(T+1) N}{T^{3}}\\left[\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{T}{(T+1)}\\left(\\bar{Z}_{T}+\\left(\\bar{Z}_{T}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right] \\text { and } \\\\\n\\tilde{w}=2 \\mathcal{W}_{2 \\Delta}-\\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta}, \\text { with } \\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta}=\\frac{N}{T} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor T / \\Delta\\rfloor}\\left(\\bar{Z}_{k \\Delta}-\\bar{Z}_{(k-1) \\Delta}-\\Delta \\hat{m}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\in\\{1, \\ldots,\\lfloor T / 2\\rfloor\\}$ is a tuning parameter. The estimator $\\hat{m}$ is the spatio-temporal mean of signals emitted by the system in the observed interval $\\{1, \\ldots, T\\}$. As we explain in Section 2.2, the estimator $\\hat{v}$ is related to the empirical variance of the random variables $Z_{1, T}, \\ldots, Z_{N, T}$, i.e., a variance over the spatial components of the system. The estimator $\\hat{w}$ is computed from the empirical variance of the random variables $\\bar{Z}_{\\ell \\Delta}, \\bar{Z}_{2 \\ell \\Delta}-\\bar{Z}_{\\ell \\Delta}, \\ldots, \\bar{Z}_{T}-$ $\\bar{Z}_{T-\\ell \\Delta}$, i.e., the empirical variance of the mean number of signals emitted by the system over different time intervals. For these reasons, the estimators $\\hat{v}$ and $\\hat{w}$ are called spatial variance and temporal variance respectively.\n\nObviously, the three estimators $\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w}$ depend on $N$ and $T$ (as well as the tuning parameter $\\Delta$ for $\\hat{w}$ ). We chose not to specify this dependence in the notation to keep notation as light as possible.\n\nTHEOREM 2.1. There exists a constant $K>0$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1), N \\geq 1, T \\geq 2$ and $1 \\leq \\Delta \\leq\\lfloor T / 2\\rfloor$,\n\n$$\nI P(|\\hat{m}-m| \\geq \\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{K}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T N}}+\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nB^{\\star}(|\\hat{v}-v| \\geq \\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{K}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right) \\\\\nB^{\\star}(|\\hat{w}-w| \\geq \\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{K}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta}}{\\Delta}+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta}{T}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere the vector $(m, v, w)$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nm=\\frac{\\mu+(1-\\lambda) p r_{-}}{1-p(1-\\lambda)\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)} \\\\\nv=(1-\\lambda)^{2} p(1-p)\\left(\\left(m-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+r_{+} r_{-}\\right) \\\\\nw=m(1-m) \\frac{1+4(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} r_{+} r_{-}}{\\left(1-p(1-\\lambda)\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)\\right)^{2}}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe proof of Theorem 2.1 is given at the end of Section 4. The constant $K$ depends only on the parameter $\\lambda$. Let us mention that this constant diverges when $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ (because of the inversion of the linear system, see for instance the bound of Lemma F.3) and $\\lambda \\rightarrow 1$ (because the dependence between the components of the model becomes too weak, see for instance the bounds of Proposition 3.5).\n\nOnce the parameters $(m, v, w)$ are estimated from the sample, one wants to deduce some estimators of the parameters $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$. Here is how one can proceed.\n\nLet $\\Lambda=\\{(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\in(0,1)^{3}: 0<\\mu<\\lambda\\}$ be the open set of admissible parameters. For all $(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\in \\Lambda$, let us define\n\n$$\nD(\\lambda, p)=1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)>0\n$$\n\nthe denominator that appears in the expressions of $m$ and $w$. Then, for $k=1,2,3$, let $\\Psi_{k}$ : $\\Lambda \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be defined by\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\Psi_{1}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)=\\left(\\mu+(1-\\lambda) p r_{-}\\right) / D(\\lambda, p) \\\\\n\\Psi_{2}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)=(1-\\lambda)^{2} p(1-p)\\left[\\left(\\Psi_{1}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+r_{+} r_{-}\\right] \\\\\n\\Psi_{3}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)=\\Psi_{1}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)\\left[1-\\Psi_{1}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)\\right]\\left[1+4(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} r_{+} r_{-}\\right] / D(\\lambda, p)^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFinally, let $\\Psi: \\Lambda \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ be defined by the three coordinate functions above so that Equation (8) rewrites as $(m, v, w)=\\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$. Finally, let us remark that, whatever the value of $r_{+}$, the image $\\Psi(\\Lambda)$ is included in $(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty)^{2}$ (see Proposition G. 1 stated and proved in Appendix G).\n\nThe following proposition gives some information about the inversion of the function $\\Psi$, by means of an auxiliary function $\\kappa:(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty) \\rightarrow(0, \\infty)$ which is defined by\n\n$$\n\\kappa(m, w)=\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{2} \\frac{w}{m(1-m)}\n$$\n\nProposition 2.2. Whatever the value of $r_{+}$, there exist two explicit functions $\\Phi^{(+)}$and $\\Phi^{(-)}$such that the following results hold.\n\n1. For all $(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\in \\Lambda,(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\in\\left\\{\\Phi^{(+)} \\circ \\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p), \\Phi^{(-)} \\circ \\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p)\\right\\}$,\n2. Moreover, if $r_{+} \\geq 1 / 2$ or\n\n$$\n\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}(\\mu, \\lambda, p), \\Psi_{3}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)\\right) \\geq 4 r_{+} r_{-}\n$$\n\nthen $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)=\\Phi^{(-)} \\circ \\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$.\nProposition 2.2 is deduced as a corollary of Proposition G. 3 stated and proved in the Appendix G. Furthermore, the expressions of the functions $\\Phi^{(\\+)}$and $\\Phi^{(-)}$are also given in Appendix G.\n\nRemark 2.3. Note that the system of equations defining $X$ is not symmetric with respect to the sets $\\mathcal{P}_{+}$and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}$. One source of asymmetry is the term $N^{-1} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\theta_{i j}$ which appears in (1) and is denoted by $L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}$ below. This asymmetry partly explains why the inversion of (8) is always feasible when $r_{+} \\geq 1 / 2$, but not when $r_{+}<1 / 2$.\n\nWe are now in position to deduce the following corollary of Theorem 2.1.\nCorollary 2.4. Assume that the condition 2 of Proposition 2.2 is satisfied. Then there exists a constant $K>0$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1), N \\geq 1, T \\geq 2$ and $1 \\leq \\Delta \\leq\\lfloor T / 2\\rfloor$,\n\n$$\nI P\\left(\\left\\|\\Phi^{(-)}(\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w})-(\\mu, \\lambda, p)\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\geq \\varepsilon\\right) \\leq \\frac{K}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta}}{\\Delta}+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta}{T}}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. By definition of $\\Psi$, remark that Theorem 2.1 gives a control of $\\|(\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w})-$ $\\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\|_{\\infty}$. Hence, the result follows from the facts that $\\Phi^{(-)}$is locally Lipschitz (see Proposition G.2) and $\\Phi^{(-)} \\circ \\Psi(\\mu, \\lambda, p)=(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$.\n\nIn practice, a value must be chosen for the tuning parameter $\\Delta$. The question of how to choose $\\Delta$ with respect to $T$ is discussed in Section 5. In what follows we present some heuristic arguments leading to the convergence stated in Theorem 2.1.\n2.1. Heuristics for the spatio-temporal mean. Let us remind that $X$ follows the stationary version of a Markov chain having transition probabilities as defined in (2) and (1), conditionally on the environment $\\theta$. Denote $m^{N}:=\\left(m_{1}^{N}, \\ldots, m_{N}^{N}\\right)=I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{0}\\right]$. Notice that $m^{N}$ depends on the realization of $\\theta$, but we omit to specify this dependence to keep concise notation. Throughout this section, the notation $a \\approx b$ is used to express the fact that $a$ and $b$ are expected to be close to each other as either $N$ or $T$ are large enough. By ergodicity, we must have as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} X_{t} \\rightarrow m^{N}, \\quad I P_{\\theta}-a . s .,\n$$\n\nso that we expect for $T$ large enough that\n\n$$\n\\hat{m}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} X_{i, t} \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{i}^{N}:=\\overline{m^{N}}\n$$\n\nHence, to find the limit of $\\hat{m}$ one needs to understand the asymptotic behavior of $\\overline{m^{N}}$. To that end, observe that by taking first the expectation in both sides of (1) and then using the stationarity, one can check that, for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$,\n\n$$\nm_{i}^{N}=\\mu+(1-\\lambda)\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}} \\theta_{i j} m_{j}^{N}+\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\theta_{i j}\\left(1-m_{j}^{N}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nDenoting $A^{N}(i, j)=N^{-1} \\theta_{i j}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}$and $A^{N}(i, j)=-N^{-1} \\theta_{i j}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}$, we can then write the above system of equations in matrix form as follows:\n\n$$\nm^{N}=\\mu 1_{N}+(1-\\lambda)\\left(A^{N} m^{N}-L^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $1_{N}$ denotes the $N$-dimensional vector with all entries equal to 1 and $L^{N, \\bullet-}=$ $\\left(L_{1}^{N, \\bullet-}, \\ldots, L_{N}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)$ is given by $L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} A^{N}(i, j)$. Therefore, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\left(I_{N}-(1-\\lambda) A^{N}\\right) m^{N}=\\mu 1_{N}-(1-\\lambda) L^{N, \\bullet-}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{N}$ denotes the identify matrix of size $N$. Let us denote $Q^{N}=\\left(I_{N}-(1-\\lambda) A^{N}\\right)^{-1}$. The random matrix $Q^{N}$ is well-defined whenever $\\lambda>0$ (see Appendix F). Granted that $Q^{N}$ is well-defined, we then have that\n\n$$\nm^{N}=\\mu Q^{N} 1_{N}-(1-\\lambda) Q^{N} L^{N, \\bullet-}\n$$\n\nThen, remark that $L^{N, \\bullet-}=A^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}$, where $1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}$is the $N$-dimensional vector with value 1 for the coordinates in $\\mathcal{P}_{-}$and value 0 otherwise. Using the series expansion $Q^{N}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-$ $\\lambda)^{k}\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{k}$, one can deduce that $Q^{N} A^{N}=\\left(Q^{N}-I_{N}\\right) /(1-\\lambda)$. Hence, $(1-\\lambda) Q^{N} L^{N, \\bullet-}=$ $\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}$with $\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}=Q^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}$. Similarly, we denote $\\ell^{N}=Q^{N} 1_{N}$, so that Equation (15) rewrites as\n\n$$\nm^{N}=\\mu \\ell^{N}+1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}-\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}\n$$\n\nNow, let us give some heuristics on the asymptotic behavior of $\\ell^{N}$ and $\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}$. To that end, denote $L^{N}=A^{N} 1_{N}$ and observe that by the definition of $\\ell^{N}$, using once more the series expansion of $Q^{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\ell^{N}=1_{N}+(1-\\lambda) L^{N}+\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}(1-\\lambda)^{k}\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{k} 1_{N}\n$$\n\nNow, by law of large numbers, we expect that, whenever $N$ is large enough, $L_{i}^{N}=$ $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) \\approx p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)$for each $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, and by induction, we expect that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{k} 1_{N}\\right)_{i} \\approx\\left[p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)\\right]^{k-1} L_{i}^{N}\n$$\n\nfor each $1 \\leq i \\leq N$. Hence, for $N$ sufficiently large\n\n$$\n\\ell^{N} \\approx 1_{N}+\\frac{1}{D(\\lambda, p)}(1-\\lambda) L^{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $D(\\lambda, p)$ is defined in (9). Similarly, by definition of $\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\ell^{N, \\bullet-}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}+(1-\\lambda) L^{N, \\bullet-}+\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}(1-\\lambda)^{k}\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{k} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\n$$\n\nUsing the law of large numbers once more, we expect that $L^{N, \\bullet-} \\approx-p r_{-} 1_{N}$ whenever $N$ is large enough, so that by the previous induction, we expect that\n\n$$\n\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{k} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\approx-p r_{-}\\left[p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)\\right]^{k-2} L^{N}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\ell^{N, \\bullet-} \\approx 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}+(1-\\lambda) L^{N, \\bullet-}-\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{2} p r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)} L^{N}\n$$\n\nAll in all, we expect that\n\n$$\nm^{N} \\approx \\mu\\left(1_{N}+\\frac{1-\\lambda}{D(\\lambda, p)} L^{N}\\right)-(1-\\lambda) L^{N, \\bullet-}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{2} p r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)} L^{N}\n$$\n\nNow, remind that $L^{N} \\approx p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) 1_{N}$ and $L^{N, \\bullet-} \\approx-p r_{-} 1_{N}$, so that\n(17) $\\overline{m^{N}} \\approx \\mu\\left(1+\\frac{(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)}{D(\\lambda, p)}\\right)+(1-\\lambda) p r_{-}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)}=m$,\nwhere $m$ is defined in (8). Combining (13) and (17), we expect that for $T$ and $N$ large enough,\n\n$$\n\\hat{m} \\approx \\frac{\\mu+(1-\\lambda) p r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)}=m\n$$\n\nThis heuristics is made precise in Equations (32) and (35).\n2.2. Heuristics for the spatial variance. First note that we can always write that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)-\\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)\\right]=\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\operatorname{IE}_{\\theta}\\left[Z_{i, T}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nThe three terms above are considered from left to right.\nFirst, since the spatial covariance of the model vanishes sufficiently fast (see Lemma 3.7 for a precise statement), the term $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)$ can be estimated from the data via an empirical variance, that is,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(Z_{i, T}-\\bar{Z}_{T}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nSecond, the term $\\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)\\right]$ can also be estimated from the data. Indeed, we expect that the temporal covariance of the model vanishes sufficiently fast (see Lemma 3.7 for a precise statement) so that, for $T$ large enough,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)\\right] \\approx T \\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nGiven the random matrix $\\theta$, we know that $X_{i, 0}$ is a Bernoulli variable with parameter $m_{i}^{N}$ by stationarity of the process, so that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)=m_{i}^{N}-\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nYet, we expect that $T^{-1} Z_{i, T} \\approx m_{i}^{N}$ which implies that we can estimate $\\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)\\right]$ and get\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{Z_{i, T}}{T}-\\left(\\frac{Z_{i, T}}{T}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{\\bar{Z}_{T}}{T}-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\frac{Z_{i, T}}{T}\\right)^{2} \\approx \\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nFinally, we may express the limit of the last term. Since $\\operatorname{IE}_{\\theta}\\left[Z_{i, T}\\right]=T m_{i}^{N}$, we can start from the heuristics (16) and look at its variance. It is easy to check that $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(L_{i}^{N}\\right)=N^{-1} p(1-$ $p)$ and $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)=\\operatorname{Cov}\\left(L_{i}^{N}, L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)=N^{-1} p(1-p) r_{-}$. Hence, we expect that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{Var}\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right) \\approx N^{-1} p(1-p)\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\mu(1-\\lambda)+(1-\\lambda)^{2} p r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)}\\right)^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\quad-2\\left(\\frac{\\mu(1-\\lambda)+(1-\\lambda)^{2} p r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)}\\right)(1-\\lambda) r_{-}+(1-\\lambda)^{2} r_{-}\\right] \\\\\n& =N^{-1}(1-\\lambda)^{2} p(1-p)\\left(m^{2}-2 m r_{-}+r_{-}\\right)=N^{-1} v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $m$ and $v$ are defined in (8) and $D(\\lambda, p)$ is defined in (9). Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{T^{2}} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\operatorname{IE}_{\\theta}\\left[Z_{i, T}\\right]\\right) \\approx v\n$$\n\nCombining Equations (18)-(21), we have\n\n$$\n\\ddot{v}=\\frac{1}{T^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(Z_{i, T}-\\bar{Z}_{T}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{N}{T^{2}} \\bar{Z}_{T}+\\frac{1}{T^{3}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)^{2} \\approx v\n$$\n\nThis heuristics is made precise in Equations (33) and (36).\n2.3. Heuristics for the temporal variance. Let us remark that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta}{N} \\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta}=\\frac{\\Delta}{T} \\sum_{k=1}^{T / \\Delta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{Z}_{k \\Delta}-\\bar{Z}_{(k-1) \\Delta}\\right)-\\Delta T^{-1} \\bar{Z}_{T}\\right]^{2}\n$$\n\nBecause we expect that the temporal covariance of the model vanishes sufficiently fast, we should have (supposing $\\Delta \\ll T$ ) that for $T$ large,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta}{N} \\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta} \\approx \\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\bar{Z}_{\\Delta}\\right]=\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $U_{t}=\\left(U_{1, t}, \\ldots, U_{N, t}\\right)$ for each $t \\geq 1$, with\n\n$$\nU_{i, t}=Z_{i, t}-I E_{\\theta}\\left[Z_{i, t}\\right] \\text { and } \\bar{U}_{t}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} U_{i, t}\n$$\n\nNext, (1) implies that for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$,\n\n$$\nU_{i, t}=M_{i, t}+(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) \\sum_{s=1}^{t}\\left(X_{j, s-1}-I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{j, s-1}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $M_{i, t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t}\\left(X_{i, s}-p_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{s-1}\\right)\\right)$ is a martingale. From the above identity, one can deduce that\n\n$$\nU_{t}=M_{t}+(1-\\lambda) A^{N} U_{t}+R_{t}^{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $M_{t}=\\left(M_{1, t}, \\ldots, M_{N, t}\\right)$ and $R_{t}^{N}=(1-\\lambda) A^{N}\\left(X_{0}-X_{t}\\right)$. From our analysis, we have that the term $R_{t}^{N}$ is negligible (see Lemma E.2), so that it follows from (24) that $U_{t} \\approx M_{t}+$ $(1-\\lambda) A^{N} U_{t}$, or equivalently,\n\n$$\nU_{t} \\approx Q^{N} M_{t}\n$$\n\nHence, introducing the vector $\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{N}=c^{N}=\\left(c_{1}^{N}, \\ldots, c_{N}^{N}\\right)$ where $\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top}$ denotes the transpose of $Q^{N}$, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\bar{U}_{t} \\approx \\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} Q^{N}(i, j) M_{j, t}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_{j}^{N} M_{j, t}\n$$\n\nwhich, in turn, implies that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\bar{U}_{t}\\right] \\approx \\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}\\right]=\\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_{i}^{N} c_{j}^{N} I E_{\\theta}\\left[M_{i, t} M_{j, t}\\right]\n$$\n\nSince the martingales $\\left(M_{i, t}\\right)_{t}$ and $\\left(M_{j, t}\\right)_{t}$ are orthogonal for any $i \\neq j$, i.e. $I E_{\\theta}\\left[M_{i, t} M_{j, t}\\right]=$ 0 , one obtains that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\bar{U}_{t}\\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{N^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(c_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(M_{i, t}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nThen, by means of the quadratic variation and the stationarity of the process, we have\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(M_{i, t}\\right)^{2}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\sum_{s=1}^{t}\\left(X_{i, s}-p_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{s-1}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right]=t I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{i, 1}-p_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{0}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nObserving that, conditionally on $\\theta, X_{i, 1}$ is distributed as a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $m_{i}^{N}$, and using the fact that $p_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{0}\\right) \\approx m_{i}^{N}$, since the spatial covariances are weak, we can deduce (see Lemma E.3) that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{i, 1}-p_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{0}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right] \\approx m_{i}^{N}-\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nCombining (22) and (25)-(27), we expect that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta} \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(c_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\left(m_{i}^{N}-\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, as $N$ is large, we have $m_{i}^{N}-\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2} \\approx m(1-m)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$. Finally, to get the asymptotics of $N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(c_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}$, one can follow the same lines as in Section 2.1 to check that\n\n$$\nc^{N} \\approx 1_{N}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{D(\\lambda, p)} C^{N}\n$$\n\nwith $C^{N}=\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{N}$ and $D(\\lambda, p)$ as defined in (9). Then, by observing that $C_{k}^{N} \\approx p$ for $k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}$and $C_{k}^{N} \\approx-p$ for $k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}$, one can check that $\\left(c_{k}^{N}\\right)^{2} \\approx(1+a)^{2}$ for $k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}$and $\\left(c_{k}^{N}\\right)^{2} \\approx(1-a)^{2}$ for $k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}$, with\n\n$$\na=\\frac{(1-\\lambda) p}{D(\\lambda, p)}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\left(c_{k}^{N}\\right)^{2} & \\approx 1+a^{2}+2 a\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1+(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}\\left(1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{2}\\right)}{(D(\\lambda, p))^{2}}=\\frac{1+4(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} r_{+} r_{-}}{(D(\\lambda, p))^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAll in all, we find that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta} \\approx m(1-m) \\frac{1+4(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} r_{+} r_{-}}{(D(\\lambda, p))^{2}}=w\n$$\n\nThis heuristics is made precise in Equations (34) and (37).\nBy relying on the above heuristics now replacing $2 \\Delta$ by $\\Delta$, we also deduce that $\\mathcal{W}_{2 \\Delta}$ should converge to $w$ so that\n\n$$\n\\hat{w}=2 \\mathcal{W}_{2 \\Delta}-\\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta} \\approx w\n$$\n\nThe reason of estimating $w$ using $\\hat{w}$ instead of $\\mathcal{W}_{\\Delta}$ (or $\\mathcal{W}_{2 \\Delta}$ ) alone is to improve the convergence rate (see the beginning of Appendix E.2).\n\nOrganization of the rest of the paper. The rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.1. Its proof is an immediate consequence of Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 and is presented at the end of Section 4. The proof of Proposition 4.1 is given in Appendix E. It relies on a precise study of the decay of correlation of $X_{i, t}$ and $X_{j, s}$ (and of products of these) conditionally on a fixed realization of the environment $\\theta$. This is done via a backward regeneration scheme presented in Section 3. The proof of Proposition 4.2 is given in Appendix F. It relies on a study of the random matrices $A^{N}$ and $Q^{N}$ and their associated row and column sums. In Section 5, we illustrate the performance of our estimators through simulations. Finally, many other auxiliary results used throughout the paper are proved in appendices.\n3. Backward regeneration scheme. Recall formula (1). First of all, since $\\mu \\leq \\lambda$, let us introduce $\\beta:=\\mu / \\lambda$ such that $0 \\leq \\beta \\leq 1$. Then we may interpret formula (1) in the following way. At any given time $t$, the $i-$ th component first decides to update independently of anything else with probability $\\lambda$. If it does so, then it decides to send a signal $\\left(X_{i, t}=1\\right)$ with probability $\\beta$, else it does not send a signal. Moreover, if the component does not update independently of anything else, then it chooses one of its $N$ neighbors (including $i$ itself) randomly according to the uniform distribution. Suppose it has chosen $j$ as its neighbor. Then there are three possibilities:\n\n- if $\\theta_{i j}=0$, then $X_{i, t}=0$,\n- if $\\theta_{i j}=1$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}$, then $X_{i, t}$ copies the value of $X_{j, t-1}$,\n- if $\\theta_{i j}=1$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}$, then $X_{i, t}$ copies $1-X_{j, t-1}$.\n\nThis interpretation is formalized in Equation (29) below, where the process is constructed via a backward regeneration scheme.\n\nModels like this are called imitation models and have been studied in the one-dimensional frame in (De Santis and Piccioni, 2015). Since $\\lambda>0$, at each time step the probability of making an update which is independent of anything else is strictly positive, and this implies the existence of a unique invariant measure of the system as well as the possibility of perfectly sampling from it, which is formalized in the following section.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 3.1. Backward regeneration representation. \n\nNotation. In what follows, we denote by $z=(i, t)$ some space-time coordinate in $\\mathcal{Z}=$ $\\{1, \\ldots, N\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ and we write $X_{z}$ instead of $X_{i, t}$ for all $z=(i, t) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$.\n\nTo construct the Markov chain $X=\\left\\{X_{i, t}, t \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 1 \\leq i \\leq N\\right\\}$ via a backward regeneration representation, we introduce the following random variables. To each space-time coordinate $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, we associate a couple of independent random variables $\\left(J_{z}, \\xi_{z}\\right)$ taking values in $\\{0,1, \\ldots, N\\} \\times\\{0,1\\}$ such that $I P\\left(J_{z}=0\\right)=\\lambda, I P\\left(J_{z}=k\\right)=(1-\\lambda) \\frac{1}{N}$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq N$, and $I P\\left(\\xi_{z}=1\\right)=1-I P\\left(\\xi_{z}=0\\right)=\\beta$. Moreover, we suppose that the couples $\\left(\\left(J_{z}, \\xi_{z}\\right), z \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\right)$ are independent. By convention, let us define $J_{(0, t)}=0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThen, for any $z=(i, t) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, let us define a backward random walk $I^{z}=\\left(I_{s}^{z}\\right)_{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ taking values in the state space $\\{0,1, \\ldots, N, \\infty\\}$, where $I_{s}^{z}=\\infty$ for all $s>t, I_{t}^{z}=i$ and, as $s$ decreases, $I^{z}$ follows the space coordinates given by the $J$ variables, that is\n\n$$\nI_{s-1}^{z}=J_{\\left(I_{s}^{z}, s\\right)}, \\text { for all } s \\leq t\n$$\n\nBecause of the convention $J_{(0, t)}=0$, the state 0 is a cemetery for the process $I^{z}$. Let us denote $\\tau_{z}^{R}$ the last time that the random walk $I^{z}$ is not in the cemetery state 0 :\n\n$$\n\\tau_{z}^{R}=\\inf \\left\\{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}: I_{s}^{z}>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nReaching the cemetery happens after a finite time, almost surely for all the sites.\n\nProposition 3.1. For any $\\theta$, it holds that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(\\forall z \\in \\mathcal{Z}, \\tau_{z}^{R}>-\\infty\\right)=1$.\nProof. Since $\\mathcal{Z}$ is countable, it suffices to check that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(\\tau_{z}^{R}>-\\infty\\right)=1$ for all $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$. For each $k \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\nI P\\left(\\tau_{z}^{R} \\leq t-k\\right)=I P\\left(I_{t-k}^{z} \\neq 0, \\ldots, I_{t-1}^{z} \\neq 0\\right) \\leq(1-\\lambda)^{k}\n$$\n\nwhere we used the independence between the random variables $J_{\\bar{z}}$ and the fact that $I P\\left(J_{\\bar{z}} \\neq\\right.$ $0)=1-\\lambda$. It follows that $I P\\left(\\tau_{z}^{R}=-\\infty\\right)=\\lim _{k \\rightarrow \\infty} I P\\left(\\tau_{z}^{R} \\leq t-k\\right)=0$.\n\nThe time $\\tau_{z}^{R}$ is called a regeneration time for state $z$. Let us then define the set of regenerating sites by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathcal{Z}: J_{z}=0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nREMARK 3.2. The sites $z=(i, t)$ such that $\\theta_{i J_{z}}=0$ and $J_{z} \\geq 1$ could also be considered as regenerating sites. Since we are interested in results valid for any realization of $\\theta$, we did not include those sites in the definition of $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nObserve that since $I_{\\tau_{z}^{R}-1}^{z}=J_{\\left(I_{\\tau_{z}^{R}}^{z}, \\tau_{z}^{R}\\right)}=0$, we have that $\\left(I_{\\tau_{z}^{R}}^{z}, \\tau_{z}^{R}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{R}$ is a regenerating site.\n\nIn summary, the random walk $I^{z}$ equals $+\\infty$ for all times $u>t$, that is, before it \"starts to live\". Then, the random walk lives in $\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$ until it reaches 0 and thus regenerates. It then remains in state 0 forever.\n\nFor all $z=(i, t) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, we define $X_{z}$ as follows:\n\n$$\nX_{z}=\\xi_{z} \\mathbf{1}_{z \\in \\mathcal{R}}+\\theta_{i J_{z}}\\left(X_{J_{z}, t-1} \\mathbf{1}_{J_{z} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}}+\\left(1-X_{J_{z}, t-1}\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{J_{z} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right) \\mathbf{1}_{z \\notin \\mathcal{R}}\n$$\n\nNote that, if $z \\in \\mathcal{R}$, then $X_{z}$ is sampled according to the Bernoulli random variable $\\xi_{z}$. When $z \\notin \\mathcal{R}$, the random variables $X_{z}$ are defined recursively. On $\\Omega_{0}=\\left\\{\\forall z \\in \\mathcal{Z}, \\tau_{z}^{R}>-\\infty\\right\\}$, this recursion ends in finite time for every site and so the process $X$ constructed via (29) is well-defined. Proposition 3.1 ensures that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(\\Omega_{0}\\right)=1$, implying that the process $X$ is welldefined almost surely. Since the process $X$ is defined in (29) via the i.i.d. couples $\\left(J_{z}, \\xi_{z}\\right)$, one can prove that it is a stationary version of the studied Markov chain.\n\nTHEOREM 3.3. Let $X=\\left(X_{z}\\right)_{z \\in \\mathcal{Z}}$ be the process defined through (29). Then, conditionally on $\\theta, X$ is a stationary Markov chain with transition probability given by (2) and (1).\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3.3 is given in Appendix A.\nREMARK 3.4. The representation (29) is an example of a more general construction that allows to perfectly sample from a process using a clan of ancestors method. This method works under certain structural conditions on the transition probabilities of the process; that is, supposing that it is possible to decompose the transition probabilities into a mixture of more elementary transitions. These ideas go back at least to Ferrari (1990), followed by Ferrari et al. (2000) and Comets, Fern\u00e1ndez and Ferrari (2002). We also refer to Fern\u00e1ndez, Ferrari and Galves (2001) for a comprehensive introduction to this approach.\n\nThe regeneration representation presented in (29) above induces a natural (random) partitioning of the state space $\\mathcal{Z}$ via the equivalence relation of coalescence defined by\n\n$$\nz_{1} \\leadsto z_{2} \\text { if and only if } \\exists s \\in \\mathbb{Z}, I_{s}^{z_{1}}=I_{s}^{z_{2}} \\notin\\{0, \\infty\\}\n$$\n\nThe next section is devoted to a study of this equivalence relation.\n\n3.2. Coalescence of the backward random walks. For any $z_{1}, z_{2} \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, let us define the random time\n\n$$\n\\tau_{z_{1}, z_{2}}^{c}=\\sup \\left\\{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}: I_{s}^{z_{1}}=I_{s}^{z_{2}} \\notin\\{0, \\infty\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nnamely the time at which $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ coalesce (with the convention that $\\tau_{z_{1}, z_{2}}^{c}=-\\infty$ if they do not coalesce, denoted by $z_{1} \\not \\leftrightarrow z_{2}$ ). The coalescence property is related to the dependence between the coordinates of the process $X$. Loosely speaking, if $z_{1}$ does not coalesce with $z_{2}$ then $X_{z_{1}}$ behaves as a copy of itself which is independent of $X_{z_{2}}$. This idea is formalized via a coupling argument in Appendix B.\n\nIn the next result, we provide upper bounds for the probability of events involving the coalescence of two or more backward random walks.\n\nProposition 3.5. Let $z_{k}=\\left(i_{k}, t_{k}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, for $k=1, \\ldots, 4$, be four different sites. There exists a constant $K$ only depending on $\\lambda$ such that the following inequalities hold.\n(i) $I_{B}^{c}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\}\\right) \\leq \\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{2}\\right| \\vee 1}}{1-(1-\\lambda)^{2}} N^{-1}$.\n(ii) $I_{B}^{c}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\}\\right) \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{(\\bar{t}-\\underline{t})} N^{-2}$, where $\\bar{t}=t_{1} \\vee t_{2} \\vee t_{3}$ and $\\underline{t}=t_{1} \\wedge t_{2} \\wedge t_{3}$.\n(iii) $I_{B}^{c}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{z_{3} \\longleftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\}\\right) \\leq K\\left((1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{2}\\right|+\\left|t_{3}-t_{4}\\right|} N^{-2}+(1-\\lambda)^{(\\bar{t}-\\underline{t})} N^{-3}\\right)$, where $\\bar{t}=t_{1} \\vee t_{2} \\vee t_{3} \\vee t_{4}$ and $\\underline{t}=t_{1} \\wedge t_{2} \\wedge t_{3} \\wedge t_{4}$.\n(iv) If $t_{1} \\wedge t_{2} \\geq t_{3} \\vee t_{4}$,\n\n$$\nI_{B}^{c}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3} \\longleftrightarrow z_{4} \\not \\leftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R} \\asymp t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\}\\right) \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{t_{1}+t_{2}-t_{3}-t_{4}} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nThe proof of Proposition 3.5 is given in Appendix C.\nREMARK 3.6. Here are two simple remarks to intuitively understand the upper bounds of Proposition 3.5.\n\n1. The exponent of the factor $(1-\\lambda)$ is the minimal waiting time before coalescence. For instance, in Item (ii), the first-born site (with birth time $\\bar{t}$, remind that time runs backwards) must wait (hence survive) at least $\\bar{t}-\\underline{t}$ time steps before coalescing with the last-born site.\n\nIn that respect, Item (iv) is a bit different because of the event $\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}<t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\}$ which enforces the site $z_{2}$ to survive even if it does not coalesce.\n2. Each coalescence event adds a factor $N^{-1}$. For instance, in Items (ii)-(iv), at least two coalescences are needed.\n\nFor all $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, let us denote $Y_{z}=X_{z}-I E_{\\theta}\\left(X_{z}\\right)$ the centered version of $X_{z}$ and observe that $\\left|Y_{z}\\right| \\leq 1$ almost surely. Since (the absence of) coalescence is related with independence, it is natural to expect that the rates of decay of coalescence probabilities in Proposition 3.5 can be transferred to rates of decay of covariances for the process. Indeed, using Proposition 3.5 and the coupling introduced in Appendix B, we obtain several upper bounds on the covariance of the variables $Y_{z}$ 's (Lemma 3.7) and the products of these variables (Lemma 3.8). This last result is the main result of this section.\n\nLEMMA 3.7. Let $z_{1}=\\left(i_{1}, t_{1}\\right)$ and $z_{2}=\\left(i_{2}, t_{2}\\right)$ two points in $\\mathcal{Z}$. There exists a constant $K$ only depending on $\\lambda$ such that: if $z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[X_{z_{1}}, X_{z_{2}}\\right]\\right|=\\left|\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}\\right]\\right| \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{2}\\right| \\vee 1} N^{-1}\n$$\n\nOtherwise, the quantity above is obviously bounded by 1.\n\nProof. The proof is the same as the one for item 3 of Lemma 3.8 below.\nLemmA 3.8. Let $z_{k}=\\left(i_{k}, t_{k}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{Z}, k=1, \\ldots, 4$, and denote $B=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]$ and $E=\\left\\{z_{k}: k=1, \\ldots, 4\\right\\}$. There exists a constant $K$ only depending on $\\lambda$ such that:\n\n1. If $\\# E=1$, then $|B| \\leq 1$.\n2. If $\\# E=2, z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$ and $z_{3} \\neq z_{4}$, then $|B| \\leq 1$.\n3. If $\\# E=2, z_{1}=z_{2}$ and $z_{3}=z_{4}$, then\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{3}\\right|} N^{-1}\n$$\n\n4. If $\\# E=3$ and $z_{1}=z_{2}$ or $z_{3}=z_{4}$, then\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right|} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nwhere $s_{1} \\leq s_{2} \\leq s_{3}$ is an ordering of $\\left\\{t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}\\right\\}$.\n5. If $\\# E=3, z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$ and $z_{3} \\neq z_{4}$, for instance assume that $z_{1}=z_{3}$ (and so $z_{2} \\neq z_{4}$ ), then\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{2}-t_{3}\\right|} N^{-1}\n$$\n\n6.

Observe that we cannot have $z_{1}=z_{2}$ and $z_{3}=z_{4}$ simultaneously in Item 4 of Lemma 3.8. In particular, in the case $z_{1}=z_{2}$ (resp. $z_{3}=z_{4}$ ), the set of time indices $\\left\\{t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}\\right\\}$ reduces to the set $\\left\\{t_{1}, t_{3}, t_{4}\\right\\}$ (resp. $\\left.\\left\\{t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}\\right\\}\\right)$.\n\nThe proof of Lemma 3.8 is given in Appendix D.\n4. Key steps and proof of Theorem 2.1. In order to quantify the convergence stated in Theorem 2.1, we chose first to study the convergence of our estimators as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ for a fixed environment and then to study the convergence of these temporal limits with respect to the random environment as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nHereafter, $1_{N}$ denotes the $N$ dimensional vector full of ones and, for any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $\\bar{v}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_{i}$ denotes the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of $v$. Remind our three estimators $\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w}$ defined in (3)-(4). Their respective limits when $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ while $\\theta$ is fixed, as proved below, are:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nm_{\\infty}^{N}:=\\overline{m^{N}}=\\mu \\overline{\\ell^{N}}-(1-\\lambda) \\overline{Q^{N} L^{N, \\bullet}-} \\\\\nv_{\\infty}^{N}:=\\left\\|m^{N}-m_{\\infty}^{N} 1_{N}\\right\\|_{2}^{2} \\\\\nw_{\\infty}^{N}:=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(c_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\left(m_{i}^{N}-\\left(m_{i}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $m^{N}$ is defined in Section 2.1 and the second equality of the first line comes from Equation (15). The rates of these temporal convergences are given below.\n\nProposition 4.1. There exists a constant $K$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $T \\geq 1, N \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\widehat{m}-m_{\\infty}^{N}\\right|^{2}\\right]=\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}(\\widehat{m}) \\leq K(T N)^{-1} \\\\\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\hat{v}-v_{\\infty}^{N}\\right|\\right] \\leq K\\left(1+\\sqrt{v_{\\infty}^{N}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{T^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}\\right) \\\\\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\widehat{w}-w_{\\infty}^{N}\\right|\\right] \\leq K\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{T}+\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta}}{\\Delta}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe proof of Proposition 4.1 is given in Appendix E.\nThe last ingredient needed to prove Theorem 2.1 are the rates of convergence of the temporal limits $m_{\\infty}^{N}, v_{\\infty}^{N}, w_{\\infty}^{N}$ as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nProposition 4.2. Assume that $1 \\geq \\lambda>0$. There exists a constant $K>0$ which depends on $\\lambda$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nI E\\left[\\left|m_{\\infty}^{N}-m\\right|^{2}\\right] \\leq \\frac{K}{N^{2}} \\\\\nI E\\left[\\left|v_{\\infty}^{N}-v\\right|\\right] \\leq \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{N}} \\\\\nI E\\left[\\left|w_{\\infty}^{N}-w\\right|^{2}\\right] \\leq \\frac{K}{N^{2}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $m, v, w$ are defined in (8)\nThe proof of Proposition 4.2 is given in Appendix F.\nFinally, the proof of Theorem 2.1 is merely the combination of Propositions 4.1 and 4.2.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. Let us prove Inequality (6). The proof of the two other inequalities are similar and even simpler (the only subtlety is to remark that $\\Delta / T<\\sqrt{\\Delta / T}$ for Inequality (7)).\n\nFirst, observe that (6) holds automatically when $N^{1 / 2} / T>1$. Suppose now that $N^{1 / 2} / T^{2} \\leq 1$. By the triangle inequality, we have\n\n$$\nI E[|\\hat{v}-v|] \\leq I E\\left[\\left|\\hat{v}-v_{\\infty}^{N}\\right|\\right]+I E\\left[\\left|v_{\\infty}^{N}-v\\right|\\right]\n$$\n\nBy the sub-additivity of $x \\mapsto \\sqrt{x}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I E\\left[\\sqrt{v_{\\infty}^{N}}\\right] \\leq\\left(I E\\left[\\left\\|m^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}} 1_{N}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]\\right)^{1 / 2} \\leq \\\\\n& \\left(I E\\left[\\left\\|\\left\\|m^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}} 1_{N}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}-v\\right\\|\\right]\\right)^{1 / 2}+\\sqrt{v} \\leq K\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, integrating (33) against $I P$ and using the upperbound above, we obtain\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left|\\hat{v}-v_{\\infty}^{N}\\right|\\right] \\leq K\\left(\\frac{N}{T^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn turn, thanks to (36), we have\n\n$$\nI \\mathcal{E}[|\\hat{v}-v|] \\leq K\\left(\\frac{N}{T^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining this with Markov inequality and then using that $N / T^{2} \\leq N^{1 / 2} / T$ and $T^{-1 / 2}=$ $N^{1 / 4} T^{-1 / 2} N^{-1 / 4} \\leq N^{1 / 2} T^{-1}+N^{-1 / 2}$, we obtain that for any $\\epsilon \\in(0,1)$,\n\n$$\nI P(|\\hat{v}-v| \\geq \\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{K}{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\frac{N^{1 / 2}}{T}+N^{-1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nproving (6).\n5. Simulation study. Before showing some numerical results, the practical implementation of the method (especially the inversion of the function $\\Psi$ defined by (10)) and the choice of $\\Delta$ are thoroughly discussed.\n5.1. Practical implementation. The computation of the three estimators $\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w}$ is obvious. However, the choice and computation of the two inverse functions $\\Phi^{(+)}$and $\\Phi^{(-)}$, defined in Appendix G, need further explanations.\n\nFirst, one has to compute $d^{(a)}$ defined in Equation (109). To avoid numerical errors, we replaced the condition $\\kappa(m, w)=4 r_{+} r_{-}$by the condition $\\left|\\kappa-4 r_{+} r_{-}\\right|<10^{-4}$. Moreover, we replaced $\\left(4 r_{+} r_{-}\\right)^{2}-4 r_{+} r_{-}+\\kappa(m, w)$ by $\\max \\left\\{0,\\left(4 r_{+} r_{-}\\right)^{2}-4 r_{+} r_{-}+\\kappa(m, w)\\right\\}$ to ensure that the square-root stays in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Remark that in those two cases, we have $d^{(+)}=d^{(-)}$. In particular, there is no issue regarding the choice of $\\Phi^{(+)}$or $\\Phi^{(-)}$. Out of those two cases, we use $\\Phi^{(-)}$whenever\n\n$$\nr_{+} \\geq 1 / 2 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad \\kappa(m, w) \\geq 4 r_{+} r_{-} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad d^{(+)}(m, w)>2 r_{-}\n$$\n\nThe first two conditions are chosen according to Proposition G.3. The last one is supported by the fact that, if $r_{+}<1 / 2$ and $\\kappa(m, w)<4 r_{+} r_{-}$then $D(\\lambda, p)<2 r_{-}$(see Proposition G.1) and $d^{(-)}(m, w)<d^{(+)}(m, w)$. Finally, if all the conditions above are not satisfied then the choice between $a=+$ and $a=-$ is arbitrarily made.\n\nSecond, one has to compute $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}$. On the one hand, to avoid numerical errors and the choice between $a=+$ and $a=-$, we replaced the condition $r_{+}=1 / 2$ by $\\left|r_{+}-r_{-}\\right|<10^{-3}$. On the other hand, when $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}$ is applied to the estimators $\\hat{m}$ and $\\hat{w}$, one may end up with a negative value. Yet, $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}$ should be non negative. Hence, we replaced $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)$ by $\\left|\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)\\right|$ (for instance in Equation (113)).\n\nFinally, when $\\Phi^{(+)}$or $\\Phi^{(-)}$are applied to the estimators $(\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}, \\hat{w})$, one may end up with estimators $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\lambda}, \\hat{p})$ which do not belong to the admissible set $\\Lambda$ defined above Equation (9). In that case we chose to clip the values. For instance, clip the value of $\\lambda$ to 0 if negative, or to 1 if strictly larger than 1 .\n\nThe numeric experiments were made using Julia programming language and a package should be available for the next revision of the paper.\n5.2. Choice of the tuning parameter. From the bound obtained in Equation (12), the optimal choice of $\\Delta$ is $\\Delta=-\\log (T) /(2 \\log (1-\\lambda))$. In that case,\n\n$$\n\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta}}{\\Delta}+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Delta}{T}}=\\frac{-2 \\log (1-\\lambda)}{T^{1 / 2} \\log (T)}+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\log (T)}}{T^{1 / 2}}\n$$\n\nSince the value of $\\lambda$ is not known, the choice $\\Delta=\\log (T)$ is made by default. However, the choice $\\Delta=1$ seems to give the best results among several tests and across several choices of parameters (see Figure 1). This is the reason why most of the plots of the next section are made with $\\Delta=1$.\n\nFIG 1. Absolute estimation error for the six estimators and their theoretical limits. The $y$-axis is in log-scale. Each line or mark correspond to a median computed over $N_{\\text {simu }}=100$ simulations. The panels correspond to the choices $\\Delta=\\log (T)$ and $\\Delta=1$ from left to right.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n5.3. Numerical results. Let us first give the framework of our simulations. If not specified otherwise, the following values are used:\n\n$$\nN=500, \\quad r_{+}=.5, \\quad \\beta=.5, \\quad \\lambda=.5, \\quad p=.5, \\quad \\Delta=1, \\quad N_{\\text {simu }}=1000\n$$\n\nFurthermore, the fractions of excitatory and inhibitory components are chosen as $r_{+}^{N}=$ $\\left\\lceil r_{+} N\\right\\rceil$ and $r_{-}^{N}=N-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{+}\\right|$.\n\nIn all the plots, the performance of one (or several) of our estimators is displayed. Let us denote $\\hat{\\vartheta}$ one of these estimators and $\\vartheta$ its corresponding true parameter value. The solid lines correspond to the median of $|\\hat{\\vartheta}-\\vartheta|$ computed over $N_{\\text {simu }}$ simulations and plotted as a function of the time horizon $T$. Furthermore, we add marks (circles or horizontal bars) on the right end of the plot. These marks correspond to the median of $\\left|\\hat{\\vartheta}_{\\infty}-\\vartheta\\right|$ computed over $N_{\\text {simu }}$ simulations, where $\\hat{\\vartheta}_{\\infty}$ is the theoretical limit of $\\hat{\\vartheta}$ as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ while the environment $\\theta$ is fixed (remind Equation (31)). Of course, these quantities are unknown in practice but we are able to compute them here since the parameters used for the simulation are known. Finally, the corresponding limit estimators of $\\mu, \\lambda$ and $p$ are defined by:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\hat{\\mu}_{\\infty}, \\hat{\\lambda}_{\\infty}, \\hat{p}_{\\infty}\\right)=\\Phi^{(a)}\\left(\\hat{m}_{\\infty}, \\hat{v}_{\\infty}, \\hat{w}_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the choice of $a \\in\\{+,-\\}$ is made according to Section 5.1.\nFigure 1 compares the performance of all the estimators. The two panels correspond to two choices of $\\Delta$ that will be discussed below. On the two panels, it is clear that the convergence of $\\hat{m}$ is faster than all the others (which is expected from our analysis). Furthermore, for large $T, \\hat{m}, \\hat{v}$ and $\\hat{\\lambda}$ are really close to their theoretical limits $\\hat{m}_{\\infty}, \\hat{v}_{\\infty}$ and $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\infty}$ respectively. Note that this is not the case for $\\hat{w}, \\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\hat{p}$. In particular, it seems that $\\hat{p}$ has the slowest convergence rate.\n\nFigure 1 gives also a comparison of the performance of our estimators with respect to the tuning parameter $\\Delta$. Either $\\Delta$ is chosen as a function of $T$ by $\\Delta=\\log (T)$ or $\\Delta$ is fixed to the value 1 . Obviously, the estimators $\\hat{m}, \\hat{v}$ for finite $T$ and all the limit estimators $\\hat{\\vartheta}_{\\infty}$ do not depend on $\\Delta$ so the differences between the two plots are due to randomness only. However, it seems that the convergence of $\\hat{w}$ is significantly faster when $\\Delta=1$. In turn, it implies the same improvement for the triplet $(\\hat{\\mu}, \\hat{\\lambda}, \\hat{p})$.\n\nFigure 2 gives an overview of the performance of the estimator $\\hat{p}$ as one of the parameters $\\left(N, r_{+}, \\beta, \\lambda\\right.$ or $p$ ) varies. The choice to vary $\\beta$ instead of $\\mu=\\lambda \\beta$ is made because the set of admissible values of $\\beta$ is independent of $\\lambda$ (which is not the case for $\\mu$ ). Remark that when $p=0.5$, which is the case for most of the panels in Figure 2, the value 0.25\n\nFIG 2. Absolute estimation error of $\\hat{p}$ and its theoretical limit. Each line or mark correspond to a median computed over $N_{\\text {simu }}=1000$ simulations. The panels correspond to different choices of varying parameter (the non-varying parameters are chosen according to the default values given in Section 5.3). The values of the varying parameter are given by the color legends.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\ncorrespond to the median of the absolute error of the most naive estimator: estimate $p$ by a random uniform value in $[0,1]$. Overall, the estimation error of the limit $\\hat{p}_{\\infty}$ is usually of the order of 0.01 and that of the estimator $\\hat{p}$ computed for $T=1000$ is approximately 20 times larger. As $N$ increases, the performance of $\\hat{p}$ for $T$ fixed deteriorates. This phenomenon is encoded in the factor $\\sqrt{N} / T$ appearing in Theorem 2.1 for example. Also, the marks corresponding to the estimation errors of the theoretical limit $\\hat{p}_{\\infty}$ for different values of $N$ are ordered as expected: the estimation error goes to 0 as $N$ goes to infinity. As $r_{+}$varies, the performance of $\\hat{p}$ seems not to vary too much. However, it is important to note that the case $r_{+}=0.4$ corresponds to a case where the choice of $a \\in\\{+,-\\}$ is not obvious and so it is arbitrary (see Section 5.1). Half of the time, the wrong $a$ is chosen. In particular, it is the reason why the mark corresponding to the limit estimator is around 0.06 instead of 0.01 for all the other cases. As $\\beta$ varies, the performances of $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{p}_{\\infty}$ seem not to vary too much. This is quite expected. As $\\lambda$ increases towards 1 , the performances of $\\hat{p}$ and $\\hat{p}_{\\infty}$ decreases. This is expected since $\\lambda \\rightarrow 1$ implies that the strength of interactions in the system\n\ngoes to 0 . In particular, it is more and more difficult to estimate $p$ which is closely related to the interactions. Nevertheless, contrarily to our upper-bounds which goes to infinity as $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ (see the remark below Theorem 2.1), the performance is good for $\\lambda=0.1$. Finally, the performance of $\\hat{p}$ as $p$ varies is more complex to analyze. For instance, for $p=0.9$, our method gives $\\hat{p}=1$ most of the time whence the eventually constant violet curve at $y=0.1$. In the case $p=0.1$, the performance of $\\hat{p}$ seems to be poor despite the fact that its limit $\\hat{p}_{\\infty}$ (blue mark) achieves good results. This phenomenon is also expected because as $p \\rightarrow 0$ the interactions in the system vanishes.\n\nAcknowledgments.

Hence, to conclude the proof, it remains to show that, conditionally on each realization of the random environment $\\theta, X$ is Markovian and has the transition probabilities given by (2) and (1). The Markovianity of the process and the conditional independence of its coordinates follow from its representation as a function of an i.i.d. sequence. The compatibility of the transition probabilities follows from simple computations.\nMarkovianity of the process. Observe that (29) implies that for each $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$, there exists a deterministic function $f_{\\theta, i}:\\{0,1\\}^{N} \\times\\{0,1\\} \\times\\{0,1, \\ldots, N\\} \\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$ such that for all $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\n$$\nX_{i, t}=f_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{t-1}, \\xi_{i, t}, J_{i, t}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen defining the function\n\n$$\nf_{\\theta}(x, \\xi, J)=\\left(f_{\\theta, 1}\\left(x, \\xi_{1}, J_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f_{\\theta, N}\\left(x, \\xi_{N}, J_{N}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in\\{0,1\\}^{N}, \\xi=\\left(\\xi_{1}, \\ldots, \\xi_{N}\\right) \\in\\{0,1\\}^{N}$ and $J=\\left(J_{1}, \\ldots, J_{N}\\right) \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, N\\}^{N}$, we can write for all $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\n$$\nX_{t}=f_{\\theta}\\left(X_{t-1}, \\xi_{t}, J_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\xi_{t}=\\left(\\xi_{1, t}, \\ldots, \\xi_{N, t}\\right)$ and $J_{t}=\\left(J_{1, t}, \\ldots, J_{N, t}\\right)$. This representation together with the fact the sequence $\\left(\\xi_{t}, J_{t}\\right)_{t \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is i.i.d ensures that $\\left(X_{t}\\right)_{t \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is a Markov chain. Moreover, since the pairs $\\left(\\xi_{1, t}, J_{1, t}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\xi_{N, t}, J_{N, t}\\right)$ are independent, the random variables $X_{i, t}=$ $f_{\\theta, i}\\left(X_{t-1}, \\xi_{i, t}, J_{i, t}\\right), i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$, are clearly conditionally independent given $X_{t-1}$.\nTransition probability. It remains to show that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, t}=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=p_{\\theta, i}(x)$ for all $x \\in\\{0,1\\}^{N}$, where $p_{\\theta, i}(x)$ is given by (1). To see that, write $z=(i, t)$ and observe that (29) allows us to write,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(X_{z}=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=0, \\xi_{z}=1\\right) & +\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}} \\theta_{i j} x_{j} I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=j \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right) \\\\\n& +\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\theta_{i j}\\left(1-x_{j}\\right) I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=j \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing that $X_{t-1}$ is measurable with respect to $\\sigma\\left(\\xi_{k, s}, J_{k, s}, s \\leq t-1, k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}\\right)$ and the fact that both $J_{z}$ and $\\xi_{z}$ are independent of all random variables $J_{k, s}, \\xi_{k, s}$ for $s \\leq t-1$ and $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$, we have that\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=0, \\xi_{z}=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=0, \\xi_{z}=1\\right)\n$$\n\nand also that for each $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$,\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=j \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=j\\right)=\\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{N}\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, it follows that\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(X=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=0, \\xi_{z}=1\\right)+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{N} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}} \\theta_{i j} x_{j}+\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}} \\theta_{i j}\\left(1-x_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince the random variables $J_{z}$ and $\\xi_{z}$ are also independent, and $I P_{\\theta}\\left(J_{z}=0\\right)=\\lambda, I P_{\\theta}\\left(\\xi_{z}=\\right.$ $1)=\\beta$ and $\\mu=\\lambda \\beta$, it follows that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, t}=1 \\mid X_{t-1}=x\\right)=p_{\\theta, i}(x)$, concluding the proof.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# APPENDIX B: COALESCENCE COUPLINGS \n\nThis section is devoted to the proof of two lemmas which relate independence and coalescence. It is structured as follows. First, the two lemmas are stated. Next, the construction of the coupling is detailed. After that, some properties of the coupling are provided. Finally, the proofs of the two lemmas are given.\nB.1. Two main lemmas. Here are two lemmas that relate coalescence with independence via couplings. The tilde and hat versions of $X$ defined below respect some additional spatial independence properties. The objective of the two lemmas is to prove that these versions can be coupled in such a way that they are equal except on an event related with coalescence (which in turn we expect to be of small probability).\n\nLEMMA B. 1 (All independent coupling). Let $k \\geq 2$ and consider $k$ different points $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{k}$ in $\\mathcal{Z}$. There exist random variables $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\ldots, \\tilde{X}_{z_{k}}$ satisfying the following properties: for each $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$,\n(i) $\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}} \\stackrel{d}{=} X_{z_{i}}$ (i.e., $\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}}$ and $X_{z_{i}}$ have the same distribution);\n(ii) $\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}}$ is independent of $\\left(X_{z_{j}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{j}}\\right)_{j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}}$\n(iii) $\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}} \\neq X_{z_{i}}\\right\\} \\subset \\cup_{j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left\\{z_{i} \\longleftrightarrow z_{j}\\right\\}$.\n\nLEMMA B. 2 (Blockwise independence). Let $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{4}$ be four different points in $\\mathcal{Z}$. There exist random variables $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\ldots, \\tilde{X}_{z_{4}}$ and $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{2}}$ satisfying the following properties:\n(i) $\\left(\\hat{X}_{z_{1}}, \\hat{X}_{z_{2}}\\right) \\stackrel{d}{=}\\left(X_{z_{1}}, X_{z_{2}}\\right)$;\n(ii) $\\left(\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{2}}\\right)$ is independent of $\\left(X_{z_{3}}, X_{z_{4}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{3}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{4}}\\right)$;\n(iii) $\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}} \\neq X_{z_{1}}\\right\\} \\subset \\cup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cup\\left(\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{1}}^{R}<t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\} \\cap\\left(\\cup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\}\\right)\\right)$,\n(iv) $\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{2}} \\neq X_{z_{2}}\\right\\} \\subset \\cup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cup\\left(\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}<t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\} \\cap\\left(\\cup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\}\\right)\\right)$.\n(v) $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}$ is independent of $\\tilde{X}_{z_{2}}$ and $\\hat{X}_{z_{2}}$ is independent of $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}$.\n\nMoreover, for each $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\}$,\n(iv) $\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}} \\stackrel{d}{=} X_{z_{i}}$;\n(v) $\\tilde{X}_{z_{j}}$ is independent of $\\left(\\tilde{X}_{z_{j}}, X_{z_{j}}, I^{z_{j}}\\right)_{j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}}$;\n(vi) $\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}} \\neq X_{z_{i}}\\right\\} \\subset \\cup_{j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left\\{z_{i} \\longleftrightarrow z_{j}\\right\\}$.\n\nREMARK B.3. Let us describe with some words Item (iii) above: if the hat version $\\hat{X}_{z_{1}}$ is different from the standard version $X_{z_{1}}$, then we know that\n\n- $z_{1}$ coalesces with $z_{3}$ or $z_{4}$, or\n- $z_{2}$ coalesces with $z_{3}$ or $z_{4}$ and the (backward) regeneration time of $z_{1}$ is less than the starting times of $z_{3}$ or $z_{4}$.\nB.2. Construction of the couplings. Let us denote $(J, \\xi)$ the sequence $\\left(J_{z}, \\xi_{z}\\right)_{z}$ defined in the backward regeneration representation of the process $X$. Since we are working for a fixed matrix $\\theta$ in this section, we omit its dependence in what follows. Due to the backward regeneration representation there exist measurable functions $f, g, r$ and $\\tau$ (which depend on $\\theta)$ such that, for all $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$,\n\n$$\nI^{z}=\\left(I_{s}^{z}\\right)_{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}}=f(z, J) \\text { and } X_{z}=g\\left(I^{z}, \\xi_{r\\left(I^{z}\\right)}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $r\\left(I^{z}\\right)=\\left(I_{\\tau\\left(I^{z}\\right)}^{z}, \\tau\\left(I^{z}\\right)\\right)$ is the regenerating site associated with $z$ and $\\tau\\left(I^{z}\\right)=\\inf \\{s \\in$ $\\left.\\mathbb{Z}: I_{s}^{z}>0\\right\\}$ is the last time that the random walk $I^{z}$ is not in the state 0 . In what follows, we denote $I=\\left(I^{z}\\right)_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\nNow, consider 5 independent sequences\n\n$$\n\\left(J^{(1)}, \\xi^{(1)}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J^{(5)}, \\xi^{(5)}\\right)\n$$\n\nall distributed as the sequence $(J, \\xi)$, and which are furthermore independent of $(J, \\xi)$. By convenience of notation, let us denote $\\left(J^{(0)}, \\xi^{(0)}\\right):=(J, \\xi)$. In other words, the layer (0) corresponds to the original process, and we add five i.i.d. layers on top of that. We then define the backward random walks $I^{(i)}=\\left(I^{(i), z}\\right)_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ by $I^{(i), z}=f\\left(z, J^{(i)}\\right)$, for each $0 \\leq i \\leq 5$. Clearly, the collections of random walks $I^{(0)}, \\ldots, I^{(5)}$ are independent. We will need the layers $(0)-(4)$ to construct the tilde versions, and the layers $(0)$ and $(5)$ to construct the hat versions.\n\nConstruction of the tilde versions. For $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\}$, let us denote\n\n$$\n\\tau_{i}^{c}=\\sup \\left\\{\\tau_{z_{i}, z_{j}}^{c}: j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nthe first time at which $I^{z_{i}}$ coalesces with (at least) one of the 3 other random walks (observe that $\\tau_{i}^{c}=-\\infty$ if $I^{z_{i}}$ does not coalesce with any of the other 3 random walks), and denote $z_{i}^{c}=\\left(I_{\\tau_{i}^{c}}^{z_{i}}, \\tau_{i}^{c}\\right)$ the site of coalescence in case $\\tau_{i}^{c}>-\\infty$. Then, for all $1 \\leq i \\leq 4$ and $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we define\n\n$$\n\\tilde{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}=I_{s}^{(0), z_{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{s>\\tau_{i}^{c}}+I_{s}^{(i), z_{i}^{c}} \\mathbf{1}_{s \\leq \\tau_{i}^{c}}\n$$\n\nIn words, the random walk $\\tilde{I}^{z_{i}}$ follows the random walk $I^{z_{i}}$ until it coalesces with one of the random walks $I^{z_{j}}, j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}$. After this time, the random walk $\\tilde{I}^{z_{i}}$ follows the independent random walk $I^{(i), z_{i}^{c}}$ associated with the site of coalescence $z_{i}^{c}$. With the notation $\\tilde{L}_{s}^{z_{i}}=i \\cdot 1_{s \\leq \\tau_{i}^{c}} \\in\\{0, \\ldots, 4\\}$, Equation (39) rewrites as\n\n$$\n\\tilde{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}=I_{s}^{(0), z_{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\tilde{L}_{s}^{z_{i}}=0}+I_{s}^{(i), z_{i}^{c}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\tilde{L}_{s}^{z_{i}}=i}\n$$\n\nand some computations give the following easy recursion formula:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{I}_{s-1}^{z_{i}}=J_{\\left(\\tilde{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}\\right)}^{\\left(\\tilde{L}_{s}^{z_{i}}, s\\right)}, \\text { for all } s \\leq t_{i}\n$$\n\nwhich can be compared with Equation (28). Moreover, remark that the layer processes $\\tilde{L}$ are measurable functions of the state processes $\\tilde{I}$ since\n\n$$\n\\tau_{z_{i}, z_{j}}^{c}=\\sup \\left\\{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}: I_{s}^{z_{i}}=I_{s}^{z_{i}} \\notin\\{0, \\infty\\}\\right\\}=\\sup \\left\\{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}: \\tilde{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{I}_{s}^{z_{i}} \\notin\\{0, \\infty\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nConstruction of the hat versions. Let us denote, for $i=1,2$,\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{i}=\\sup \\left\\{\\tau_{z_{i}, z_{j}}^{c}: j \\in\\{3,4\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand denote $\\hat{z}_{i}^{c}=\\left(I_{\\hat{\\tau}_{i}}^{z_{i}}, \\hat{\\tau}_{i}\\right)$ the corresponding site of coalescence in case $\\hat{\\tau}_{i}>-\\infty$. For instance, $\\hat{\\tau}_{1}$ corresponds to the first time at which $I^{z_{1}}$ coalesces with either $I^{z_{3}}$ or $I^{z_{4}}$. Then, for $i=1,2$, we define the auxiliary process, for all $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\n$$\n\\hat{I}_{s}^{(5), z_{i}}=I_{s}^{z_{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{s>\\hat{\\tau}_{i}}+I_{s}^{(5), \\hat{z}_{i}^{c}} \\mathbf{1}_{s \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{i}}\n$$\n\nThe construction is not yet done since these two random walks may be missing some coalescence in order to mimic the joint distribution of $\\left(X_{z_{1}}, X_{z_{2}}\\right)$. To circumvent this problem, we define\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}=\\sup \\left\\{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}: \\hat{I}_{s}^{(5), z_{1}}=\\hat{I}_{s}^{(5), z_{2}} \\notin\\{0, \\infty\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\hat{I}^{z_{i}}=\\hat{I}^{(5), z_{i}}, \\text { if } \\hat{\\tau}_{1,2} \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{i}\n$$\n\nwhile we put, for all $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$,\n\n$$\n\\hat{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}=I_{s}^{z_{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{s>\\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}}+\\hat{I}_{s}^{(5), \\hat{z}_{3-i}} \\mathbf{1}_{s \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}}, \\text { if } \\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}>\\hat{\\tau}_{i}\n$$\n\nFor instance, if $I^{z_{1}}$ first coalesces, say, with $I^{z_{3}}$, then it switches to its hat-version $\\hat{I}^{z_{1}}$ and remains stuck to this version forever. However, if $I^{z_{2}}$ hits $\\hat{I}^{z_{1}}$ before hitting $I^{z_{3}}$ or $I^{z_{4}}$, then it coalesces with $\\hat{I}^{z_{1}}$ and remains stuck to it forever. In words, we do not modify the random walk with the first (the largest in time) coalescence time $\\hat{\\tau}_{i}$, but we possibly modify the other one in between the times $\\hat{\\tau}_{1}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_{2}$. Like Equation (40), we have the following recursion:\n\n$$\n\\hat{I}_{s-1}^{z_{i}}=J_{\\left(\\hat{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}\\right.}^{\\left(\\hat{I}_{s}^{z_{i}}, s\\right)}, \\text { for all } s \\leq t_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\hat{L}_{s}^{z_{1}}=5 \\cdot 1_{s \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{1}}+5 \\cdot 1_{\\hat{\\tau}_{1}<s \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}} 1_{\\hat{\\tau}_{1,2} \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{2}}\n$$\n\nwith a similar definition for $\\hat{L}_{s}^{z_{2}}$. In other words, in any case, process 1 is in layer 5 starting from time $\\hat{\\tau}_{1}$, that is $\\hat{L}_{s}^{z_{1}}=5$ for $s \\leq \\hat{\\tau}_{1}$. But, if process 1 coalesces with process 2 (at time $\\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}$ ) and if process 2 is already evolving on layer 5 at that time, then process 1 switches to layer 5 at that coalescence time $\\hat{\\tau}_{1,2}$.\n\nOnce again, the layer processes $\\hat{L}^{z_{1}}$ and $\\hat{L}^{z_{2}}$ are measurable functions of the state processes $\\left(\\hat{I}^{z_{1}}, \\hat{I}^{z_{2}}, I^{z_{3}}, I^{z_{4}}\\right)$.\nB.3. Properties of the couplings. First, let us formalize the fact that the processes $I$ do not depend on the whole sequences $J^{(0)}, \\ldots, J^{(5)}$ but merely on a small subset of those. Let $\\gamma \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, N, \\infty\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\\ell \\in\\{0, \\ldots, 5\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ be some generic trajectories of the processes $I$ and $L$. Let us then define $J_{\\gamma}^{\\ell}=\\left(J_{\\left(\\gamma_{s}, s\\right)}^{\\left(\\ell_{s}\\right)}\\right)_{s \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, N\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and, for all $z=(i, t) \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, $f_{z}^{|}:\\{0,1, \\ldots, N\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}} \\rightarrow\\{0,1, \\ldots, N, \\infty\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ given by\n\n$$\n\\left(f_{z}^{|}\\left(J_{\\gamma}^{\\ell}\\right)\\right)_{s}= \\begin{cases}\\infty & \\text { if } s>t \\\\ i & \\text { if } s=t \\\\ J_{\\left(\\gamma_{s+1}, s+1\\right)}^{\\left(\\ell_{s+1}\\right)} & \\text { else. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nFinally, let us remark that:\n\n1. the definition of $I^{z_{i}}$ implies that $\\left\\{I^{z_{i}}=\\gamma\\right\\}=\\left\\{f_{z_{i}}^{|}\\left(J_{\\gamma}^{\\ell}\\right)=\\gamma\\right\\}$ where $\\ell_{s}^{\\sharp}=0$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$;\n2. Equation (40) and the measurability of the layer processes imply that for all $\\tilde{\\gamma}^{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{\\gamma}^{4} \\in$ $\\{0,1, \\ldots, N, \\infty\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$, there exist $\\tilde{\\ell}^{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{\\ell}^{4} \\in\\{0, \\ldots, 4\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\cap_{i=1}^{4}\\left\\{\\tilde{I}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}\\right\\}=\\cap_{i=1}^{4}\\left\\{\\tilde{I}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}, \\tilde{L}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\ell}^{i}\\right\\}=\\cap_{i=1}^{4}\\left\\{f_{z_{i}}^{|}\\left(J_{\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}}^{\\tilde{\\ell}^{i}}\\right)=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n3. Equation (42) and the measurability of the layer processes imply that for all choices $\\tilde{\\gamma}^{1}, \\tilde{\\gamma}^{2}, \\gamma^{3}, \\gamma^{4}, \\tilde{\\gamma}^{3}, \\tilde{\\gamma}^{4} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, N, \\infty\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$, there exist $\\tilde{\\ell}^{1}, \\tilde{\\ell}^{2} \\in\\{0,5\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\\tilde{\\ell}^{3}, \\tilde{\\ell}^{4} \\in\\{0,3,4\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA: & =\\left(\\cap_{i=1}^{2}\\left\\{\\hat{I}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}\\right\\}\\right) \\cap\\left(\\cap_{j=3}^{4}\\left\\{I^{z_{j}}=\\gamma^{j}, \\hat{I}^{z_{j}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{j}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\cap_{i=1}^{2}\\left\\{\\hat{I}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}, \\hat{L}^{z_{i}}=\\tilde{\\ell}^{i}\\right\\}\\right) \\cap\\left(\\cap_{j=3}^{4}\\left\\{I^{z_{j}}=\\gamma^{j}, \\hat{I}^{z_{j}}=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{j}, \\hat{L}^{z_{j}}=\\tilde{\\ell}^{j}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\cap_{i=1}^{2}\\left\\{f_{z_{i}}^{|}\\left(J_{\\gamma^{i}}^{\\tilde{\\ell}^{i}}\\right)=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{i}\\right\\}\\right) \\cap\\left(\\cap_{j=3}^{4}\\left\\{f_{z_{j}}^{|}\\left(J_{\\gamma^{j}}^{\\ell^{2}}\\right)=\\gamma^{j}, f_{z_{j}}^{|}\\left(J_{\\gamma^{j}}^{\\tilde{\\ell}^{j}}\\right)=\\tilde{\\gamma}^{j}\\right\\}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFirst, let us summarize the coupling properties of the processes $I$.\nProposition B.4. The processes $I, \\tilde{I}$ and $\\hat{I}$ satisfy the following coupling properties:\n(i) for all $i=1, \\ldots, 4,\\left\\{\\tilde{I}^{z_{i}} \\neq I^{z_{i}}\\right\\}=\\cup_{j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\},\\{i\\}}\\left\\{z_{i} \\longleftrightarrow z_{j}\\right\\}$,\n(ii) we have that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\tilde{I}^{z_{1}} \\neq I^{z_{1}}\\right\\} \\subset \\bigcup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cup\\left(\\bigcup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{1}}^{R}<t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\tilde{I}^{z_{2}} \\neq I^{z_{2}}\\right\\} \\subset \\bigcup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cup\\left(\\bigcup_{k=3}^{4}\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{k}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}<t_{3} \\vee t_{4}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof.

For all $i, \\hat{I}^{z_{i}}$ has the same distribution as $I^{z_{i}}$ and $\\left(\\hat{I}^{z_{1}}, \\hat{I}^{z_{2}}\\right)$ has the same distribution as $\\left(I^{z_{1}}, I^{z_{2}}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Remind that the layers $J^{(0)}, \\ldots, J^{(5)}$ are i.i.d. so that it is easy to prove that $\\hat{I}^{z_{i}}$ is a backward random walk with the same transitions as $I^{z_{i}}$ (compare Equation (40) with Equation (28)) which in turn implies that they share the same distribution.\n\nWe now turn to the second part of the proof. For the marginals, the same argument as above applies (thanks to Equation (42)). Hence, $\\hat{I}^{z_{i}}$ has the same distribution as $I^{z_{i}}$. Then, we show that the process $\\left(\\hat{I}_{s}^{z_{1}}, \\hat{I}_{s}^{z_{2}}\\right)_{s}$ is a two-dimensional Markov chain (backwards in time) which has the same transitions as $\\left(I_{s}^{z_{1}}, I_{s}^{z_{2}}\\right)_{s}$. Since both chains start from the same initial conditions, this implies the desired result.\n\nSince transitions between $t_{1} \\vee t_{2}$ and $t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}$ only concern one of the two processes, evolving according to the right marginals, we do only need to consider transitions $s \\rightarrow s-1$ for $s \\leq t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}$.

Throughout the proof we will consider partitions of the sets of cardinal 2,3 and 4 . For a finite set $E$, we denote by $\\mathcal{P}(E)$ the set of its partitions. For ease of notation, we consider a notation which we exemplify in the case of a set $\\{a, b, c\\}$ with three different elements. In this case, the set $\\mathcal{P}(\\{a, b, c\\})$ has 5 elements which are :\n\n- $\\{\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{c\\}\\}$ written as $a \\upharpoonright b \\upharpoonright c$,\n- $\\{\\{a, b\\},\\{c\\}\\}$, written as $a b \\upharpoonright c$,\n- $\\{\\{a, c\\},\\{b\\}\\}$, written as $a c \\upharpoonright b$,\n- $\\{\\{a\\},\\{b, c\\}\\}$, written as $a \\upharpoonright b c$,\n- $\\{\\{a, b, c\\}\\}$, written as $a b c$.\n\nThe proof relies on the Markovian property of the backward random walks $\\left(I^{z}\\right)_{z \\in \\mathcal{Z}}$. From these backward random walks (BRW), we define a \"status\" random walk - such as $S_{t}^{1}$ below - which informs us whether the BRW has started, is currently running, or has already reached the cemetery. This, in turn, allows us to define a partition valued Markov chain, denoted $P_{t}$. To keep concise notation for the states of this partition valued Markov chain, we use the notation introduced above, which informs us on the coalescing status of the BRWs. The proof is then based on the computation of the transition probabilities of the partition Markov chain (some transition graphs are drawn for pedagogical purposes). Finally, the proof is concluded by the computation of the coalescence probabilities.\n\nProof of Proposition 3.5. Without loss of generality, we assume in this proof that $t_{1} \\geq t_{2} \\geq t_{3} \\geq t_{4}$.\n\nProof of Item (i). Consider the backward random walks $I^{z_{1}}$ and $I^{z_{2}}$ from time $t=t_{1}$ to time $t=-\\infty$. Let us introduce the following notation: in what follows, the letter ' $S$ ' stands for the state of a random walk; $S_{t}^{1}$ will be the state at time $t$ of the random walk associated to $z_{1}$, and $S_{t}^{2}$ the state at time $t$ of the random walk associated to $z_{2}$. We define $S_{t}^{1}=1_{\\infty}$ if $t>t_{1}$, $S_{t}^{1}=1_{0}$ if $I_{t}^{z_{1}}=0, S_{t}^{1}=1$ else, and by analogy, $S_{t}^{2}=2_{\\infty}$ if $t>t_{2}, S_{t}^{2}=2_{0}$ if $I_{t}^{z_{2}}=0$, $S_{t}^{2}=2$ else.\n\nIn what follows, we extend the notation introduced above for partitions of sets. Let us denote $P_{t}=S_{t}^{1} \\upharpoonright S_{t}^{2}$ if $t>\\tau_{z_{1}, z_{2}}^{c}$ and $P_{t}=S_{t}^{1} S_{t}^{2}$ else. Then, the backward process $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{-\\infty<t \\leq t_{1}}$ is a time in-homogeneous backward Markov chain on the state space $\\mathcal{P}_{2}=$ $\\cup_{a \\in\\left\\{1_{\\infty}, 1,1_{0}\\right\\}} \\cup_{b \\in\\left\\{2_{\\infty}, 2,2_{0}\\right\\}}\\{a b, a \\upharpoonright b\\}$. At time $t=t_{1}$, the backward process starts from the initial condition $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}$ if $t_{1}>t_{2}$, and $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2$ if $t_{1}=t_{2}$ (note that in that case $z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$ implies that $i_{1} \\neq i_{2}$ so that $P_{t_{1}}=12$ is not possible). By Proposition 3.1, the random variable $\\min \\left\\{\\tau_{z_{1}}^{R}, \\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}\\right\\}>-\\infty$ almost surely, implying that $P_{-\\infty}:=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow-\\infty} P_{t}$ exists almost surely and $P_{-\\infty} \\in\\left\\{1_{0} 2_{0}, 1_{0} \\upharpoonright 2_{0}\\right\\}$, that is the set of absorbing states. One can check that\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\}\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nin case $t_{1}>t_{2}$, and\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\}\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2\\right)\n$$\n\nin case $t_{1}=t_{2}$.\nNow, for $t \\leq t_{1}$, let us denote $Q_{t}(x, y)$ the transition probabilities of the time inhomogeneous backward Markov chain $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{-\\infty<t \\leq t_{1}}$ :\n\n$$\nQ_{t}(x, y)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t-1}=y \\mid P_{t}=x\\right), x, y \\in \\mathcal{P}_{2}\n$$\n\nAssume for now that $t_{1}>t_{2}$. Since we are only interested in computing the coalescence probability (46), we only need to give the transition probabilities encountered on the path from state $1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}$ to state $1_{0} 2_{0}$. For $t>t_{2}+1$, the only relevant transition probability is $Q_{t}\\left(1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}, 1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}\\right)=1-\\lambda$. At time $t=t_{2}+1$ there are two relevant transitions: $Q_{t_{2}+1}(1 \\upharpoonright$ $\\left.2_{\\infty}, 1 \\upharpoonright 2\\right)=(1-\\lambda)(1-1 / N)$ and $Q_{t_{2}+1}\\left(1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}, 12\\right)=(1-\\lambda) / N$.\n\nFor $t \\leq t_{2}$, there are four relevant transition probabilities:\n\n- $Q_{t}(1 \\upharpoonright 2,1 \\upharpoonright 2)=(1-\\lambda)^{2}(1-1 / 2)$\n- $Q_{t}(1 \\upharpoonright 2,12)=(1-\\lambda)^{2} / N$,\n- $Q_{t}\\left(12,1_{0} 2_{0}\\right)=1-Q_{t}(12,12)=\\lambda$.\n\nFigure 3 gives a graphical representation of the relevant transitions just described in case $t_{2}<t_{1}$.\n\nStarting from Equation (46), one can check that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\}\\right)=I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t_{2}}\\right. & \\left.=12 \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}\\right) I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\mid P_{t_{2}}=12\\right) \\\\\n& +I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t_{2}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2 \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}\\right) I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\mid P_{t_{2}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, by the dynamics of the Markov chain $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{t \\leq t_{1}}$ we have that $I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t_{2}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2 \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright$ $2_{\\infty}\\right)=(1-\\lambda)^{t_{1}-t_{2}}$ and $I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t_{2}}=12 \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\upharpoonright 2_{\\infty}\\right)=(1-\\lambda)^{t_{1}-t_{2}} / N$.

By analogy to the case with two sites, we define $S_{t}^{3}=3_{\\infty}$ if $t>t_{3}$, $S_{t}^{3}=3_{0}$ if $I_{t}^{z_{3}}=0, S_{t}^{3}=3$ else. Let us describe the backward process $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{-\\infty<t \\leq t_{1}}$ in that case. First note that for all $t \\leq t_{1}, P_{t}$ is a partition of $\\left\\{S_{t}^{1}, S_{t}^{2}, S_{t}^{3}\\right\\}$ and in particular $P_{s} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{3}=$ $\\cup_{a \\in\\left\\{1_{\\infty}, 1,1_{0}\\right\\}} \\cup_{b \\in\\left\\{2_{\\infty}, 2,2_{0}\\right\\}} \\cup_{c \\in\\left\\{3_{\\infty}, 3,3_{0}\\right\\}} \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\{a, b, c\\}\\right)$.

Similarly to the proof of Item (i), we have\n\n$$\nI P_{B}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\}\\right)=I P_{B}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} 3_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nin case $t_{1}>t_{2} \\geq t_{3}$ for instance, where $P_{-\\infty}=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow-\\infty} P_{t}$ exists almost surely and $P_{-\\infty} \\in$ $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\left\\{1_{0}, 2_{0}, 3_{0}\\right\\}\\right)$. Assume for now that $t_{1}>t_{2}>t_{3}$ which is the most general case. The other cases can be treated similarly.\n\nFor $t \\leq t_{1}$, let us denote the transition probabilities of the chain\n\n$$\nQ_{t}(x, y)=I P_{B}\\left(P_{t-1}=y \\mid P_{t}=x\\right), x, y \\in \\mathcal{P}_{3}\n$$\n\nSince we are only interested in computing the coalescence probability (50), we only need to give the transition probabilities encountered on the path from state $1 \\dagger 2_{\\infty} \\dagger 3_{\\infty}$ to state $1_{0} 2_{0} 3_{0}$.

The backward process $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{-\\infty<t \\leq t_{1}}$ is naturally extended to the case of four sites and we use the decomposition\n\n$$\n\\left\\{z_{1} \\leftrightarrow z_{2}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{z_{3} \\leftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\}=\\left\\{z_{1} \\leftrightarrow z_{2} \\leftrightarrow z_{3} \\leftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{z_{1} \\leftrightarrow z_{2} \\nrightarrow z_{3} \\leftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAssume for now that $t_{1}>t_{2} \\geq t_{3} \\geq t_{4}$ so that $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}$. It suffices to control\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} 3_{0} 4_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}\\right) \\\\\n&+I P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\nmid 3_{0} 4_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe list of the relevant transitions and the corresponding graphs are not written here due to their huge size. However the computations can be made in the same manner. For instance, one can prove that\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} 3_{0} 4_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}\\right) \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{t_{1}-t_{4}} N^{-3}\n$$\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFIG 5. Graph of the relevant transitions of the backward process $P$ (for times $t \\leq t_{3}+1$ ) used to compute a bound for $I P_{B}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\rightsquigarrow z_{2} \\rightsquigarrow z_{3}\\right\\}$ ) when $t_{1} \\geq t_{2} \\geq t_{3}$. The starting node is $1 \\nmid 2 \\infty \\nmid 2 \\infty$ (which appears in Figure 4) if $t_{1}>t_{2}>3,1 \\nmid 2 \\nmid 3 \\infty$ if $t_{1}=t_{2}>t_{3}$ and $1 \\nmid 2 \\nmid 3$ else. On some of the edges, an upper bound of the corresponding transition probability is given (the nodes $1 \\nmid 23,13 \\nmid 2$ and $12 \\nmid 3$ play almost the same role that is why we omit some the transition probabilities). The gray vertical line separates two temporal zones: zone I corresponds to times $t \\leq t_{3}+1$ and zone II corresponds to times $t_{3}+1<t \\leq t_{2}+1$.\nand\n\n$$\nI P_{B}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 2_{0} \\nmid 3_{0} 4_{0} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2_{\\infty} \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}\\right) \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left(t_{1}-t_{2}\\right)+\\left(t_{3}-t_{4}\\right)} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nwhich in turn give the desired result. Finally, the same upper bound holds if $t_{1}>t_{2}$ is not satisfied by replacing the initial condition (for instance $t_{1}=t_{2}>t_{3} \\geq t_{4}$ corresponds to the initial condition $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\nmid 2 \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}$ if $z_{1} \\neq z_{2}$ ).\nProof of Item (iv). We will only prove the case $t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}>t_{3} \\vee t_{4}$. The case in which $t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}=$ $t_{3} \\vee t_{4}$ follows along the same lines. In the sequel, as before, we assume without loss of generality that $t_{1} \\geq t_{2}>t_{3} \\geq t_{4}$ (the case where $t_{1}<t_{2}$ can be treated in the same way). In the following, we use the backward process $\\left(P_{t}\\right)_{-\\infty<t \\leq t_{1}}$ with four sites like in the proof of Item (iii). Then, since $t_{3}+1 \\leq t_{2}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\{z_{1} \\rightsquigarrow z_{3} \\rightsquigarrow z_{4} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\longleftrightarrow} z_{2}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}<t_{3}\\right\\} & \\subset\\left\\{z_{1} \\rightsquigarrow z_{3} \\rightsquigarrow z_{4} \\stackrel{\\rightharpoonup}{\\longleftrightarrow} z_{2}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{\\tau_{z_{2}}^{R}<t_{3}+1\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 3_{0} 4_{0} \\nmid 2_{0}\\right\\} \\cap\\left\\{P_{t_{3}+1}=1 \\nmid 2 \\nmid 3_{\\infty} \\nmid 4_{\\infty}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAssume for now that $t_{1}>t_{2}$. It follows from the same arguments as above that\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{-\\infty}=1_{0} 3_{0} 4_{0} \\dagger 2_{0} \\mid P_{t_{2}+1}=1 \\dagger 2 \\dagger 3_{\\infty} \\dagger 4_{\\infty}\\right) \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{t_{3}+1-t_{4}} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nI P_{\\theta}\\left(P_{t_{3}+1}=1 \\dagger 2 \\dagger 3_{\\infty} \\dagger 4_{\\infty} \\mid P_{t_{1}}=1 \\dagger

$t_{1}=t_{2}$, the same upper-bound holds with the initial condition $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\dagger 2_{\\infty} \\dagger 3_{\\infty} \\dagger$ $4_{\\infty}$ replaced by $P_{t_{1}}=1 \\dagger 2 \\dagger

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# APPENDIX D: PROOF OF LEMMA 3.8 \n\nThe statements in both Items 1 and 2 are trivial, so that we only need to prove Items 3 through 7. Items 3,4 and 5 are proved in a similar way: Lemma B. 1 is used to relate independence with the high probability event of no coalescence, and some easy computations are needed to bound the covariance. Items 6 and 7 use the more involved Lemma B.2.\n\nProof of ITEM 3. In this case, $B=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2}, Y_{z_{3}}^{2}\\right]$. Let $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}$ be a random variable distributed as $X_{z_{1}}$, independent of $X_{z_{3}}$ and such that $\\left\\{X_{z_{1}} \\neq \\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\}$. The existence of such random variables is ensured by Lemma B. 1 with $k=2$. In particular, we have that $I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{z_{1}}\\right]$. Denote $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}=\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}-I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}\\right]$ and observe that $\\left\\{\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}} \\neq Y_{z_{1}}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}} \\neq\\right.$ $\\left.X_{z_{1}}\\right\\}$. By using the properties satisfied by random variables $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}$, one can check that $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}$ is independent of $Y_{z_{3}}$, so that\n\n$$\nB=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2}, Y_{z_{3}}^{2}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}}^{2}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right) Y_{z_{3}}^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nSince $\\left\\{\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}} \\neq Y_{z_{1}}\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}} \\neq X_{z_{1}}\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\}$ and $\\max \\left\\{\\left|Y_{z_{1}}\\right|,\\left|\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}\\right|,\\left|Y_{z_{3}}\\right|\\right\\} \\leq 1$ almost surely, it follows that\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq I P_{\\theta}\\left(z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nso that the result follows Item (i) of Proposition 3.5.\nProof of ITEM 4. Suppose that $z_{1}=z_{2}$. Then $B=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2}, Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]$. By Lemma B. 1 with $k=3$, there exist random variables $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}, \\tilde{Y}_{z_{3}}$ and $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}}$ defined in such a way that the following properties hold for each $i \\in\\{1,3,4\\}: 1) \\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}$ has the same law as $Y_{z_{i}} ; 2) \\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}$ is independent of $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{j}}$ and $Y_{z_{j}}$ for all $j \\in\\{1,3,4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\} ; 3)\\left\\{\\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}} \\neq Y_{z_{i}}\\right\\} \\subset \\cup_{j \\in\\{1,3,4\\} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left\\{z_{i} \\longleftrightarrow\\right.$ $\\left.z_{j}\\right\\}$. Using first that $Y_{z_{i}}^{2}$ has same law as $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}^{2}$ and then that $I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{i}}\\right]=0$, we can deduce from properties 1 and 2 above that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nB & =I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}}^{2}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right] \\\\\n& =I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}}^{2}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{3}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{4}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy combining property 3 , the above identity and the fact that $\\Longleftrightarrow$ is an equivalence relation, we can deduce that\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq I E_{\\theta}\\left[1_{\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3} \\longleftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\}}\\right]=I P_{\\theta}\\left(\\left\\{z_{1} \\longleftrightarrow z_{2} \\longleftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\}\\right)\n$$\n\nso that the result follows from Item (ii) of Proposition 3.5.\nProof of ITEM 5. Let us consider the case in which $z_{1}=z_{3}$. Let $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{4}$ be three different sites. The goal is to bound the covariance\n\n$$\nB=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2} Y_{z_{2}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]-\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}\\right] \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right]\n$$\n\nArguing exactly like in the proof of Item 3, one can show that $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}\\right] \\leq K(1-$ $\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{2}\\right|} N^{-1}$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right] \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{4}\\right|} N^{-1}$, so that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}\\right] \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right] \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{3}\\right|+\\left|t_{1}-t_{4}\\right|} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nWe will now deal with the term $I E_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2} Y_{z_{2}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]$. For that end, let $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\tilde{X}_{z_{2}}$ and $\\tilde{X}_{z_{4}}$ be the random variables defined in Lemma B. 1 with $k=3$, and denote $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}=\\tilde{X}_{z_{i}}-I E_{\\theta}\\left(X_{z_{i}}\\right)$, $i \\in\\{1,2,4\\}$ the corresponding centered versions. By using the independence properties of the random variables $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{i}}$ (and the fact that they are all centered), one can check that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}^{2} Y_{z_{2}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}}^{2}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{2}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{4}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}}\\right)\\right]+I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right] \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right]\n$$\n\nArguing exactly like in the proof of Item 4, one can deduce that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}}^{2}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{1}}^{2}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{2}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right)\\left(Y_{z_{4}}-\\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}}\\right)\\right] \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right|} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nwhere $s_{1} \\leq s_{2} \\leq s_{3}$ is an ordering of $\\left\\{t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{4}\\right\\}$. Finally, since $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right] \\leq K(1-$ $\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{2}-t_{4}\\right|} N^{-1}$, the random variables $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{k}}$ are bounded by 1 almost surely and $\\left|t_{2}-t_{4}\\right| \\leq$ $\\min \\left\\{\\left|t_{2}-t_{1}\\right|+\\left|t_{1}-t_{4}\\right|,\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right|\\right\\}$, it follows from (51), (52) and (53) that\n\n$$\n|B| \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{2}-t_{4}\\right|} N^{-1}\n$$\n\nconcluding the proof.\nProof of ITEM 6. Let $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{4}$ be four different points in $\\mathcal{Z}$ and denote by $\\hat{X}_{z_{1}}, \\hat{X}_{z_{2}}$, $\\tilde{X}_{z_{1}}, \\ldots, \\tilde{X}_{z_{4}}$ the random variables defined in Lemma B.2. Moreover, denote by $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{k}}=\\tilde{X}_{z_{k}}-$ $I E_{\\theta}\\left(\\tilde{X}_{z_{k}}\\right), 1 \\leq k \\leq 4$ and $\\tilde{Y}_{z_{k}}=\\tilde{X}_{z_{k}}-I E_{\\theta}\\left(\\tilde{X}_{z_{k}}\\right), 1 \\leq k \\leq 2$, their centered versions. First of all, observe that by using Items (i), (ii) and (iii) of Lemma B.2, we can rewrite B as\n\n$$\nB=I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}} 1_{\\left\\{z_{1} \\leftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{z_{1} \\leftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{z_{2} \\leftrightarrow z_{3}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{z_{2} \\leftrightarrow z_{4}\\right\\}}\\right]\n$$\n\nIn the remaining of the proof, we adopt the following notation.

The other cases are treated similarly. First, we combine the fact that $Y_{z_{4}}=\\hat{Y}_{z_{4}}$ on $E$ (this holds by Item (vi) of Lemma B.2) together with the decomposition $1_{\\{13 \\mid 2 \\mid 4\\}}=1_{13 \\mid 2}-1_{13 \\mid 24}-1_{134 \\mid 2}$ to deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 2 \\mid 4\\}}\\right]=I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 2\\}}\\right] \\\\\n& -I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 24\\}}\\right]-I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{3}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\tilde{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{134 \\mid 2\\}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, since $\\hat{Y}_{z_{4}}$ is centered and independent of $Y_{z_{1}}, \\hat{Y}_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}, \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{3}}$ and $1_{13 \\mid 2}$ (because this random variable is $\\sigma\\left(I^{z_{1}}, I^{z_{2}}, I^{z_{3}}\\right)$-measurable), we have that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 2\\}}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nwhich implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{IE}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 2 \\mid 4\\}}\\right]= & -I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{13 \\mid 24\\}}\\right] \\\\\n& -I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}-\\hat{Y}_{z_{1}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{2}}\\right) Y_{z_{3}} \\hat{Y}_{z_{4}} 1_{\\{134 \\mid 2\\}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of the above equality is in absolute value at most $2 M$. The second one can be dealt with proceeding similarly as Step 3.\n\nCombining Steps 1 to 4, we get $|B| \\leq 48 M$, and Items (iii) and (iv) of Proposition 3.5 give the upper-bound $M \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{t_{1} \\vee t_{2}-t_{3} \\wedge t_{4}} N^{-2}$, which allows to conclude.\n\nProof of Item 7. By symmetry, we only need to consider the case $t_{1} \\leq t_{2}$ and $t_{3} \\leq t_{4}$. The case $t_{1} \\geq t_{3}$ or $t_{2} \\leq t_{3}$ has already been treated in Item 6 . So suppose that either $t_{1} \\leq$ $t_{3} \\leq t_{2} \\leq t_{4}$ or that $t_{3} \\leq t_{1} \\leq t_{4} \\leq t_{2}$. Since $I E_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{i}}\\right]=0$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nB=\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{3}}, Y_{z_{2}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]+\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{3}}\\right] \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta} & {\\left[Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right] } \\\\\n& -\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}}, Y_{z_{2}}\\right] \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{3}}, Y_{z_{4}}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 3.7, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\leq K N^{-2}\\left[(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{3}\\right|+\\left|t_{2}-t_{4}\\right|}+(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{1}-t_{3}\\right|+\\left|t_{3}-t_{4}\\right|}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAlso, from Item 6 above, we have that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{3}}, Y_{z_{2}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right] \\leq K(1-\\lambda)^{\\max t_{i}-\\min t_{i}} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nCombing (56), (57) and (58), we obtain the assertion.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# APPENDIX E: TEMPORAL CONVERGENCES \n\nE.1.

Each term of the decomposition is then controlled by one of the three Propositions E.1, E. 7 or E.10. Their proofs need intermediate results, which are provided as lemmas.

Note that $X_{t}, p_{\\theta}\\left(X_{t-1}\\right)$ and $m^{N}$ are vectors so that the square terms in Lemma E. 3 have to be interpreted in terms of the Hadamard product of vectors. Also, the remainder term $r_{\\theta}^{N}$ does not depend on time $t$ because the process $\\left(X_{t}\\right)_{t \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is assumed to be stationary.\n\nProof. First, observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{i, t}-p_{i, \\theta}\\left(X_{t-1}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right] & =I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{i, t}\\right]-I E_{\\theta}\\left[p_{i, \\theta}^{2}\\left(X_{t-1}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =m_{i}^{N}-I E_{\\theta}\\left[p_{i, \\theta}^{2}\\left(X_{0}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the second equality follows by the stationarity. Now, from (1), we have that\n\n$$\np_{i, \\theta}\\left(X_{0}\\right)=\\left(\\mu-(1-\\lambda) L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)+(1-\\lambda)\\left(A^{N} X_{0}\\right)_{i}\n$$\n\nso that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.I E_{\\theta}\\left[p_{i, \\theta}^{2}\\left(X_{0}\\right)\\right]=(\\mu-(1-\\lambda) L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)^{2}+2\\left(\\mu-(1-\\lambda) L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-}\\right)(1-\\lambda)\\left(A^{N} I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{0}\\right]\\right)_{i} \\\\\n&+(1-\\lambda)^{2} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\left(A^{N} X_{0}\\right)_{i}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNext, notice that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\left(A_{\\theta}^{N} X_{0}\\right)_{i}\\right)^{2}\\right]=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) A^{N}(i, k) I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{k, 0} X_{j, 0}\\right]\n$$\n\nso that using that $I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{k, 0} X_{j, 0}\\right]=m_{j}^{N} m_{k}^{N}+\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{k, 0}, X_{j, 0}\\right)$, we deduce that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\left(A^{N} X_{0}\\right)_{i}\\right)^{2}\\right]=\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) m_{j}^{N}\\right)^{2}+\\widetilde{r}_{\\theta, i}^{N}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{r}_{\\theta, i}^{N}=\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) A^{N}(i, k) \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{k, 0}, X_{j, 0}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\left|A^{N}(i, j)\\right| \\leq 1 / N$ and Lemma 3.7, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widetilde{r}_{\\theta, i}^{N}\\right| \\leq N^{-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\left|\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[X_{k, 0}, X_{j, 0}\\right]\\right| \\leq N^{-2}\\left(N+N^{2} K(1-\\lambda) N^{-1}\\right) \\leq K N^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, recalling that $m^{N}=I E_{\\theta}\\left[X_{0}\\right]$, it follows from (64) and (65) that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[p_{i, \\theta}^{2}\\left(X_{0}\\right)\\right]=\\left[(\\mu-(1-\\lambda) L_{i}^{N, \\bullet-})+(1-\\lambda)\\left(A^{N} m^{N}\\right)_{i}\\right]^{2}+(1-\\lambda)^{2} \\widetilde{r}_{\\theta, i}^{N}\n$$\n\nThe result then follows from equation (15).\nAs a consequence of Lemma E.3, we will now find the leading term of $I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}\\right)^{2}\\right]$.\nLemma E.5. For any $t \\geq 1$ and $N \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}\\right|^{2}\\right]=\\frac{t}{N} w_{\\infty}^{N}+r_{\\theta, t}^{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $w_{\\infty}^{N}$ is defined in (31) and $r_{\\theta, t}^{N}$ is such that $\\left|r_{\\theta, t}^{N}\\right| \\leq K t N^{-2}$ for some $K$ depending only on $\\lambda$.\n\nProof. We start observing that\n\n$$\n\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} Q^{N}(i, j) M_{j, t}=N^{-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_{j}^{N} M_{j, t}\n$$\n\nand then we use that for all $s \\neq h$ and $1 \\leq j, k \\leq N$,\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{i, s}-p_{i, \\theta}\\left(X_{s-1}\\right)\\right)\\left(X_{k, h}-p_{k, \\theta}\\left(X_{h-1}\\right)\\right)\\right]=0\n$$\n\nto deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}\\right|^{2}\\right] & =N^{-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} c_{j}^{N} c_{k}^{N} I E_{\\theta}\\left[M_{j, t} M_{k, t}\\right] \\\\\n& =N^{-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left(c_{j}^{N}\\right)^{2} \\sum_{s=1}^{t} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{j, s}-p_{j, \\theta}\\left(X_{s-1}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, it follows from Lemma E. 3 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\overline{Q^{N} M_{t}}\\right|^{2}\\right] & =N^{-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left(c_{j}^{N}\\right)^{2} \\sum_{s=1}^{t} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(X_{j, s}-p_{j, \\theta}\\left(X_{s-1}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =t N^{-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left(c_{j}^{N}\\right)^{2} m_{j}^{N}\\left(1-m_{j}^{N}\\right)+t N^{-2}\\left\\langle\\left(c^{N}\\right)^{2}, r_{\\theta}^{N}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& =t N^{-1} w_{\\infty}^{N}+t N^{-2}\\left\\langle\\left(c^{N}\\right)^{2}, r_{\\theta}^{N}\\right\\rangle\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, by applying H\u00f6lder inequality and then using that $\\|v\\|_{1} \\leq N\\|v\\|_{\\infty}$ for $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\left(c^{N}\\right)^{2}, r_{\\theta}^{N}\\right\\rangle \\leq\\left\\|\\left(c^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\left\\|r_{\\theta}^{N}\\right\\|_{1} \\leq\\left\\|\\left(c^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right\\|_{\\infty} N\\left\\|r_{\\theta}^{N}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nand the result follows from inequality (84) and Lemma E.3.\nFor later use, let us mention the following immediate corollary of Lemmas E. 2 and E.5.\nLEMMA E.6. There exists a constant $K>0$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $t \\geq 1$ and $N \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{t}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq K t N^{-1}\n$$\n\nProof. First, observe that $w_{\\infty}^{N}$ defined in (31) satisfies $\\left|w_{\\infty}^{N}\\right| \\leq \\lambda^{-2} / 4$ by Inequality (84), and then combine this fact with Lemmas E. 2 and E.5.\n\nWe are now in position to deal with the term $D_{T}^{N, 3}$ defined in (62).\nProposition E.7. There exists a constant $K>0$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $N \\geq 1, T \\geq 2$ and $1 \\leq \\Delta \\leq\\lfloor T / 2\\rfloor$,\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[D_{T}^{N, 3}\\right] \\leq K\\left(\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta}}{\\Delta}+\\frac{\\Delta}{T}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. First, observe that by stationarity,\n\n$$\nD_{T}^{N, 3}=\\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{2 N}{T}\\lfloor T / 2 \\Delta\\rfloor I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{2 \\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]-\\frac{N}{T}\\lfloor T / \\Delta\\rfloor I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]-w_{\\infty}^{N}\\right\\rvert\\,\n$$\n\nThen, by using the triangle inequality, one can check that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\lvert\\, \\frac{2 N}{T}\\lfloor T / 2 \\Delta\\rfloor I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{2 \\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]-\\frac{N}{T}\\lfloor T / \\Delta\\rfloor I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]-w_{\\infty}^{N}\\right\\rvert\\,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen Lemmas E.2, E. 5 and E. 6 imply the result.\nIt remains to deal with $D_{\\Delta, T}^{N, 2}$ and $D_{2 \\Delta, T}^{N, 2}$. To that end, we shall use two additional lemmas. The first one is the following.\n\nLEMMA E.8. There exists a constant $K>0$ depending only on $\\lambda$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$, $\\Delta \\geq 1$ and $t \\geq 2$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2},\\left(\\bar{U}_{t \\Delta}-\\bar{U}_{(t-1) \\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq K N^{-2}(1-\\lambda)^{(t-2) \\Delta}\n$$\n\nProof. First, use that $\\bar{U}_{t}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{s=1}^{t} Y_{i, s}$ to deduce that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2},\\left(\\bar{U}_{t \\Delta}-\\bar{U}_{(t-1) \\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right]=N^{-4} \\sum_{z_{1} \\in F_{1}} \\sum_{z_{2} \\in F_{1}} \\sum_{z_{3} \\in F_{1}} \\sum_{z_{4} \\in F_{1}} \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $z_{k}=\\left(i_{k}, t_{k}\\right)$ for $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 4\\}$, and $F_{s}:=\\{1, \\ldots, N\\} \\times\\{(s-1) \\Delta+1, \\ldots, s \\Delta\\}$ for $s \\geq 1$. In the rest of the proof, we shall denote $\\mathbf{z}=\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, z_{4}\\right)$ and $B(\\mathbf{z})=$ $\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[Y_{z_{1}} Y_{z_{2}}, Y_{z_{3}} Y_{z_{4}}\\right]$. Notice that the covariance function $B(\\mathbf{z})$ is symmetric with respect to $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, as well as with respect to $z_{3}$ and $z_{4}$. For each $p \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 6\\}$ and $s \\geq 1$, we denote $\\mathcal{C}_{p, s}$ the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{z} \\in F_{1} \\times F_{1} \\times F_{s} \\times F_{s}$ satisfying the conditions of Item $p$ of Lemma 3.8 and such that $t_{1} \\leq t_{2}$ and $t_{3} \\leq t_{4}$. With this notation, one can check using the symmetry of the covariance function that the following inequality holds:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2},\\left(\\bar{U}_{t \\Delta}-\\bar{U}_{(t-1) \\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq 4 N^{-4} \\sum_{p=1}^{6} \\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{p, t}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\mathcal{C}_{1, t}=\\mathcal{C}_{2, t}=\\mathcal{C}_{5, t}=\\emptyset$ for $t \\geq 2$, so that we need only to control the sum of covariances for the cases $p \\in\\{3,4,6\\}$. This is done in the 3 steps below.\n\nStep 1. Here, we show that there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $N \\geq 1, \\Delta \\geq 1$ and $t \\geq 2$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{3, t}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N(1-\\lambda)^{(t-2) \\Delta+1}\n$$\n\nFirst, note that Item 3 of Lemma 3.8 implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{3, t}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| & \\leq K N^{2} \\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{3}=(t-1) \\Delta+1}^{t \\Delta}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left(t_{3}-t_{1}\\right)} N^{-1} \\\\\n& =K N(1-\\lambda)^{(t-2) \\Delta+1} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Delta-1}(1-\\lambda)^{k} \\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta}(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta-t_{1}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep 1 follows by noticing that $\\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta}(1-\\lambda)^{\\Delta-t_{1}}=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\Delta-1}(1-\\lambda)^{k}$, and then by using that $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\Delta-1}(1-\\lambda)^{k} \\leq \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-\\lambda)^{k} \\leq \\lambda^{-1}$.\n\nStep 2.

Since both terms are treated very similarly, we explain how we handle the first term only.

There exists a constant $K$ depending only on $\\lambda, \\mu$ and $p$, such that for all $N \\geq 1$ and $\\Delta \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq K \\Delta^{2} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nProof. We use the notation of the proof of Lemma E.8, except that we now denote $\\mathcal{C}_{1,6}$ the set of all vectors $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{1}} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{1}} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{1}} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{1}}$ satisfying the conditions of Item 7, of Lemma 3.8, that is, without imposing the constraint that $t_{1}>t_{4}$ or $t_{3}>t_{2}$. By taking $t=1$ in inequality (66), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(\\bar{U}_{\\Delta}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq 4 N^{-4}\\left(\\sum_{p=1}^{6} \\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1, p}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|\\right)\n$$\n\nSo we need to show that the sum of covariances is at most $K \\Delta^{2} N^{2}$. This is done in the 5 steps below.\n\nStep 1. First, we show that there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$ and $\\Delta \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p=1}^{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1, p}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K(\\Delta N)^{2}\n$$\n\nBy Item 1 and Item 2 of Lemma 3.8, we have that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p=1}^{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1, p}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{C}_{1,1}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{C}_{1,2}\\right| \\leq \\Delta N+2 \\Delta N(\\Delta N-1) \\leq 3(\\Delta N)^{2}\n$$\n\nso that the result follows with $K=3$.\nStep 2. Next, we show that there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$ and $\\Delta \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,3}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N \\Delta^{2}\n$$\n\nItem 3 of Lemma 3.8, ensures that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,3}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N^{2} \\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{3}=1}^{\\Delta}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{3}-t_{1}\\right|} N^{-1}\n$$\n\nSince $\\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{3}=1}^{\\Delta}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|t_{3}-t_{1}\\right|} \\leq \\Delta^{2}$, the result follows from the previous inequality.\nStep 3. Here, we show that there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$ and $\\Delta \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N \\Delta^{2}\n$$\n\nWe proceed very similarly as in the proof of Step 2 of Lemma E.8. First, observe that we can write (see Remark 3.9),\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|=\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1}=z_{2}, z_{3} \\neq z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|+\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1} \\neq z_{2}, z_{3}=z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|\n$$\n\nTo obtain the result, we apply Item 4 of Lemma 3.8 to obtain an upper bound for each term on the right hand side of the above identity. Since both terms are treated very similarly, we explain how we deal with the first term only. By applying Point 4 of Lemma 3.8 to the first one, we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1}=z_{2}, z_{3} \\neq z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N^{3} \\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{3}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{4}=1}^{\\Delta} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{t_{3} \\leq t_{4}\\right\\}}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right|} N^{-2}\n$$\n\nwhere $s_{1} \\leq s_{2} \\leq s_{3}$ denotes the ordering of the triple $\\left(t_{1}, t_{3}, t_{4}\\right)$. Next, we use that $\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+$ $\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right| \\geq t_{4}-t_{3}$ to deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{2}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{4}=1}^{\\Delta} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{t_{3} \\leq t_{4}\\right\\}}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left|s_{3}-s_{2}\\right|+\\left|s_{2}-s_{1}\\right|} & \\leq \\Delta \\sum_{t_{3}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{4}=1}^{\\Delta} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{t_{3} \\leq t_{4}\\right\\}}(1-\\lambda)^{t_{4}-t_{3}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\Delta^{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Delta-1}(1-\\lambda)^{k} \\leq \\lambda^{-1} \\Delta^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,4}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1}=z_{2}, z_{3} \\neq z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N \\lambda^{-1} \\Delta^{2}\n$$\n\nand the result follows.\nStep 4. In this step, we show that there exists a constant $K>0$ such that for all $N \\geq 1$ and $\\Delta \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,5}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N^{2} \\Delta^{2}\n$$\n\nWe start observing that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,5}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|=\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,5}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1}=z_{3}, z_{2} \\neq z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|+\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,5}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1} \\neq z_{3}, z_{2}=z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})|\n$$\n\nHence, it suffices to provide an upper bound for each term on the right hand side of the above inequality. We will explain how we deal with the first one only. The second one can be treated similarly. By Item 5 of Lemma 3.8, we have that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1,5}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{z_{1}=z_{3}, z_{2} \\neq z_{4}\\right\\}}|B(\\mathbf{z})| \\leq K N^{3} \\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{2}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{4}=1}^{\\Delta} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{t_{2} \\leq t_{4}\\right\\}}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left(t_{4}-t_{2}\\right)} N^{-1}\n$$\n\nHence, by observing that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{t_{1}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{2}=1}^{\\Delta} \\sum_{t_{4}=1}^{\\Delta} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{t_{2} \\leq t_{4}\\right\\}}(1-\\lambda)^{\\left(t_{4}-t_{2}\\right)} \\leq \\Delta^{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\Delta-1}(1-\\lambda)^{k} \\leq \\Delta^{2} \\lambda^{-1}\n$$\n\nthe result follows.\nStep 5.

On the other hand, by first rewriting $\\Upsilon_{T}^{N, 3}$ as (recall that $U_{i, T}=Z_{i, T}-T m_{i}^{N}$ ),\n\n$$\n\\Upsilon_{T}^{N, 3}=\\frac{1}{T}\\left|\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\frac{U_{i, T}}{T}\\right)^{2}+2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right) \\frac{U_{i, T}}{T}+2 \\frac{N}{T} \\overline{m^{N}} \\bar{U}_{T}\\right|\n$$\n\nand then using the triangle inequality, we obtain that\n\n$$\nI E_{\\theta}\\left[\\Upsilon_{T}^{N, 3}\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{T^{3}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(U_{i, T}\\right)^{2}\\right]+\\frac{2}{T^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right| I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|U_{i, T}\\right|\\right]+2 \\frac{N}{T^{2}} \\overline{m^{N}} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\bar{U}_{T}\\right|\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, by stationarity and Lemma 3.7,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right)=T \\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)+2 \\sum_{t=1}^{T}(T-t) \\operatorname{Cov}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}, X_{i, t}\\right) \\\\\n\\leq T \\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(X_{i, 0}\\right)+K T / N \\leq K T\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nso that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T^{3}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I E_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(U_{i, T}\\right)^{2}\\right]=\\frac{1}{T^{3}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\operatorname{Var}_{\\theta}\\left(Z_{i, T}\\right) \\leq K N T^{-2}\n$$\n\nMoreover, by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and then Jensen inequality, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right| \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|U_{i, T}\\right|\\right] \\leq \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right|^{2}} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left(U_{i, T}\\right)^{2}\\right]}\n$$\n\nHence, using once more Inequality (70) and reminding that $v_{\\infty}^{N}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right|^{2}$, we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{T^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|m_{i}^{N}-\\overline{m^{N}}\\right| \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|U_{i, T}\\right|\\right] \\leq K \\frac{N^{1 / 2}}{T^{3 / 2}} \\sqrt{v_{\\infty}^{N}}\n$$\n\nFinally, by combining Jensen inequality and Lemma E.6, it follows that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\bar{U}_{T}\\right|\\right] \\leq$ $\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\bar{U}_{T}\\right|^{2}\\right]} \\leq K T^{1 / 2} N^{-1 / 2}$ so that\n\n$$\n2 \\frac{N}{T^{2}} \\overline{m^{N}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}\\left[\\left|\\bar{U}_{T}\\right|\\right] \\leq K N^{1 / 2} T^{-3 / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere we have also used that that $\\left|\\overline{m^{N}}\\right| \\leq 1$.

First, some matrix notation is introduced. Then, the asymptotics of the rows and columns of the rescaled random environment $A^{N}$ are stated in Lemma F.1. In turn, the asymptotics of the rows and columns of the inverse matrix $Q^{N}$ are stated in Lemmas F. 4 and F.6. Then, the proofs of these three lemmas are given in three disjoint subsections. Finally, the proof of Proposition 4.2 is given in the last subsection.\n\nTo readers interested in random environments that differ from the i.i.d. case, let us mention that the proof of Proposition 4.2 relies solely on the results of Lemmas F.1, F.4, and F. 6 in the sense that the same proof applies to any environment $\\theta$ for which these lemmas hold. Similarly, the proofs of Lemmas F. 4 and F. 6 depend only on Lemma F. 1 Therefore, only the proof Lemma F. 1 must be adapted. In what follows, we specify the adaptation required for the symmetric interaction case.\n\nThe main modification concerns the bound of the variance terms for which we use Bienaym\u00e9's identity together with a control of the few non null covariance terms. The exhaustive list of modifications is: 1) Equation (96), 2) Equation (97) by proving that $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{n}} Z_{k}\\right)$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{n}} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right]$ are smaller than some universal constant, 3) check that the \"independence argument\" below Equation (98) still holds, 4) replace the \"independence argument\" by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to bound $\\mu_{1,1}, 5$ ) Equation (99) is replaced by\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(Z_{i}\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{n}: j \\neq i} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right) \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i}\\right)+K N^{-2}\n$$\n\nfor some universal constant $K$.\nTwo technical results used throughout the proofs are stated as technical lemmas in Section H.\nF.1. General notation. Hereafter, for any subset $S$ of $[N]$, we write $1_{S}$ to indicate the $N$-dimensional vector having value 1 in each coordinate belonging to $S$ and value 0 in the remaining coordinates. To alleviate the notation, we will simply write $1_{N}$ and $0_{N}$ instead of $1_{[N]}$ and $1_{\\emptyset}$, respectively. For any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}, \\bar{v}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_{i}$ denotes the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of $v,\\|v\\|_{r}=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left|v_{i}\\right|^{r}\\right)^{1 / r}$ where $r \\in[1, \\infty)$, denotes the $r$-norm of $v$ and $\\|v\\|_{\\infty}=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq N}\\left|v_{i}\\right|$ its $\\infty$-norm. For vectors $v, u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$, we write $v \\odot u$ to denote the vector whose $i$-th coordinate is $v_{i} u_{i}$, for $1 \\leq i \\leq N$. In other words, $v \\odot u$ is the Hadamard product between the vectors $v$ and $u$. To shorten the notation, we will simply note $v^{2}$ instead of $v \\odot v$. Observe that, with this notation, the orthogonal projection of a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ on the coordinates in $S \\subseteq[N]$ can be written as $1_{S} \\odot v$. In particular, all coordinates in $S^{c}$ of the vector $1_{S} \\odot v$ are null. One can always write $v=1_{S} \\odot v+1_{S^{c}} \\odot v$.\n\nFor any $N$-by- $N$ matrix $B$ with real entries, we denote $B^{\\dagger}$ its transpose. For all $r \\in[1, \\infty]$, we denote $\\|B\\|_{r}$ the operator norm of $B$ associated to the $r$-norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{r}$ :\n\n$$\n\\|B\\|_{r}=\\sup _{v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}: v \\neq 0_{N}} \\frac{\\|B v\\|_{r}}{\\|v\\|_{r}}\n$$\n\nIt is well-known that $\\|B\\|_{1}$ and $\\|B\\|_{\\infty}$ may be defined alternatively as\n\n$$\n\\|B\\|_{1}=\\max _{1 \\leq j \\leq N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}|B(i, j)| \\text { and }\\|B\\|_{\\infty}=\\max _{1 \\leq i \\leq N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N}|B(i, j)|\n$$\n\nThe following fact will also be used in the sequel: for each $r \\in(1, \\infty)$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\|B\\|_{r} \\leq\\|B\\|_{1}^{1 / r}\\|B\\|_{\\infty}^{1-1 / r}\n$$\n\nF.2. Study of the rescaled random environment. Recall that $A^{N}=\\left(A^{N}(i, j)\\right)_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq N}$ is a rescaled version of the random environment $\\theta$ defined as, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq N$,\n\n$$\nA^{N}(i, j)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nN^{-1} \\theta_{i j}, \\text { if } j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{+}, \\\\\n-N^{-1} \\theta_{i j}, \\text { if } j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{-}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nOne can check that $\\max \\left\\{\\left\\|A^{N}\\right\\|_{1},\\left\\|A^{N}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\right\\} \\leq 1$, so that (72) implies that $\\left\\|A^{N}\\right\\|_{r} \\leq 1$ for all $r \\in(1, \\infty)$ as well.\n\nF.2.1. Notation. In what follows, for $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$, we denote $L^{N, a b}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}$ and $C^{N, a b}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}$, where $\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top}$ denotes the transpose of the matrix $A^{N}$. On the one hand, both vectors have null coordinates outside of the set $\\mathcal{P}_{a}$. On the other hand, each coordinate $i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$ of the random vector $L^{N, a b}$ (resp. $C^{N, a b}$ ) is obtained by summing the entries in $\\mathcal{P}_{b}$ of the $i$-th row (resp. column) of the matrix $A^{N}$. Alternatively, the random vectors $L^{N, a b}$ and $C^{N, a b}$ can be defined as follows:\n\n$$\nL_{i}^{N, a b}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{b}} A^{N}(i, j), \\text { if } i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a} \\\\\n0, \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nC_{i}^{N, a b}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{b}} A^{N}(j, i), \\text { if } i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a} \\\\\n0, \\text { otherwise }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFor $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$, we denote $L^{N, a \\bullet}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} 1_{N}$ and $C^{N, a \\bullet}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{N}$. Note that the coordinates not belonging to $\\mathcal{P}_{a}$ of these two vectors are also 0 . Besides, each coordinate $i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$ of the random vector $L^{N, a \\bullet}$ (resp. $C^{N, a \\bullet}$ ) is given by the sum over all entries of the $i$-th row (resp. column) of the matrix $A^{N}$.

Observe that each coordinate $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ of the random vector $L^{N, \\bullet b}$ (resp. $C^{N, \\bullet b}$ ) is given by the sum over the entries in $\\mathcal{P}_{b}$ of the $i$-th row (resp. column) of the matrix $A^{N}$. One can also verify that\n\n$$\nL^{N, \\bullet b}=L^{N,+b}+L^{N,-b} \\text { and } C^{N, \\bullet b}=C^{N,+b}+C^{N,-b}\n$$\n\nIn the sequel, for each $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$, let\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}=L^{N, a b}-\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\widetilde{L}^{N, a b} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\text { and } \\widetilde{C}^{N, a b}=C^{N, a b}-\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\widetilde{C}^{N, a b} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\n$$\n\nThe vectors $\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}$ and $\\widetilde{C}^{N, a b}$ can be thought as the population-wise centered versions of the vectors $L^{N, a b}$ and $C^{N, a b}$ respectively, in the sense that $\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}=\\widetilde{C}^{N, a b}=0$. Observe that these vectors are well-defined for all $N \\geq 1$ such that $r_{a}^{N}>0$. In the next result, we collect some bounds which will be used throughout the section.\nF.2.2.

Results regarding the inverse matrix. Recall that $\\lambda>0$. Under this condition, the random matrix $Q^{N}:=\\left(I-(1-\\lambda) A^{N}\\right)^{-1}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-\\lambda)^{n}\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{n}$ is well-defined and satisfies $\\left\\|Q^{N}\\right\\|_{r} \\leq \\lambda^{-1}$ for all $r \\in[1, \\infty]$. For later use, let us observe that the easy-to-check properties $\\left\\|\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top}\\right\\|_{1}=\\left\\|Q^{N}\\right\\|_{\\infty}$ and $\\left\\|\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top}\\right\\|_{\\infty}=\\left\\|Q^{N}\\right\\|_{1}$ combined with inequality (72) imply that $\\left\\|\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top}\\right\\|_{r} \\leq \\lambda^{-1}$ for any $r \\in[1, \\infty]$.\n\nAs suggested by the heuristics presented in Section 2, a crucial ingredient in our analysis is to study both the sum of rows and columns of the matrix $Q^{N}$. By definition of the matrix $Q^{N}$ itself, these quantities are related to the corresponding counterparts computed from the matrix $A^{N}$.\nF.3.1. Notation. Similarly as above, for $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$, let us denote $\\ell^{N, a b}$ (resp. $c^{N, a b}$ ) the random vector obtained by summing, for each row (resp. column) in $\\mathcal{P}_{a}$ of the random matrix $Q^{N}$, the entries in $\\mathcal{P}_{b}$. Also, we denote $\\ell^{N, a \\bullet}=\\ell^{N, a+}+\\ell^{N, a-}$ and $\\ell^{N, \\bullet b}=\\ell^{N,+b}+$ $\\ell^{N,-b}$ for $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$, and define $\\ell^{N}=\\ell^{N,+\\bullet}+\\ell^{N,-\\bullet}$. Note that $\\ell^{N}=Q^{N} 1_{N}$, i.e., $\\ell^{N}$ corresponds to the random vector obtained by summing the rows of $Q^{N}$. The vectors $c^{N, \\bullet a}$, $c^{N, \\bullet a}$ and $c^{N}$ are defined in a similar way. In particular, note that $c^{N}=\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{N}$ is given as the sum of the columns of $Q^{N}$. Here $\\left(Q^{N}\\right)^{\\top}$ denotes the transpose of the matrix $Q^{N}$. For later use, let us also observe that $\\widetilde{\\ell^{N}}=\\widetilde{c^{N}}$.\n\nLike we did for $L$ and $C$, we define, for each $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a b}=\\ell^{N, a b}-\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, a b}} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\text { and } \\widetilde{c}^{N, a b}=c^{N, a b}-\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{c^{N, a b}} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\n$$\n\nMoreover, we denote $\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a \\bullet}=\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a+}+\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a-}, \\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}=\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,+b}+\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,-b}$ for $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$, and $\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N}=\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,+\\bullet}+\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,-\\bullet}$.\n\nHere is an immediate result stating that the $\\ell$ and $c$ vectors are uniformly bounded.\n\nLEMMA F.3.

Proof of Lemma F.1. Before the proof, we recall some classical results in the three lemmas below.\n\nLemma F.7. Consider i.i.d. random variables $\\left(B_{i}\\right)_{1 \\leq i \\leq N}$ distributed as $\\operatorname{Ber}(p)$ with $p \\in[0,1]$ and let $\\bar{B}=N^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} B_{i}$.

Let $\\left(B_{i j}\\right)_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq N}$ be i.i.d. random variables distributed as $\\operatorname{Ber}(p)$ with $p \\in$ $[0,1]$. For $U, V \\subset[N]$ and $\\epsilon \\in\\{-1,1\\}$, define $W_{i}=\\epsilon N^{-1} \\sum_{j \\in V} B_{i j}$ for $i \\in U$, and $W_{i}=0$, for $i \\in U^{c}$.

To that end, first observe that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left\\|A^{N} \\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]=N I E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} A^{N}(1, j) \\widetilde{L}_{j}^{N, a b}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, observe that if we denote $Z_{j}=L_{j}^{N, a b}-(p b) r_{b}^{N}$ for $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$, then we can write (recall that $A^{N}(i, j)=b N^{-1} \\theta_{i j}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ and $\\left.j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{b}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\left[\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} A^{N}(1, j) \\widetilde{L}_{j}^{N, a b}\\right]^{2}=N^{-2}\\left[\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}-\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j}\\right)\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} Z_{k}\\right)\\right]^{2}\n$$\n\nso that by applying Jensen's inequality we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.I E\\left[\\left\\|A^{N} \\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right] \\leq\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.2 N^{-1}\\left[I E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right]+I E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} Z_{k}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right]\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy observing that $\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j} \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|$ and using that $\\left(Z_{k}\\right)_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{b}}$ are i.i.d. centered random variables, one can check that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} Z_{k}\\right)^{2}\\right] & \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{2} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} Z_{k}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right| \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)=r_{a}^{N} r_{b}^{N} p(1-p) \\leq 1 / 4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last inequality we have used that $\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{k}\\right)=\\operatorname{Var}\\left(L_{k}^{N, a b}\\right)=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{b}\\right| p(1-p) / N^{2}$.\nNow, note that if $j \\neq 1$, then $\\theta_{1 j}$ is independent of $Z_{j}$ so that $I E\\left[\\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right]=I E\\left[\\theta_{1 j}\\right] I E\\left[Z_{j}\\right]=$ 0 , because $Z_{j}$ is centered. Moreover, one can check that $\\left(\\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}: j \\neq 1}$ are independent. Hence, by combining these facts with Jensen's inequality, we can deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq 2\\left[I E\\left[\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}: j \\neq 1} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right]+I E\\left[\\left(\\theta_{11} Z_{1}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq 2\\left[\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}: j \\neq 1} \\theta_{1 j} Z_{j}\\right)+\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq 2\\left[\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1\\right) p \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)+\\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)\\right] \\leq 2 r_{a}^{N} r_{b}^{N} p(1-p) \\leq 1 / 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining the last three inequalities we show that Inequality (79) holds.\nIt remains to show Inequality (78). In the case $a_{1} \\neq a$, the two vectors $\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}$ and $\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b_{1}}$ have disjoint supports so that $\\left\\langle\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}, \\widetilde{L}^{N, a_{1} b_{1}}\\right\\rangle=0$ a.s. and (79) trivially holds.\n\nFrom now on, consider that $a_{1}=a$.

In that case, $Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}=\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}$, and observe that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right| I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} L_{j}^{N, a b}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nfor any fixed $i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$. In the rest of the proof, $i$ denotes an arbitrary index in $\\mathcal{P}_{a}$. Next, observe that if we denote $Z_{j}=L_{j}^{N, a b}-(p b) r_{b}^{N}$ for $j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$, then we can write\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right| I E\\left[\\left(Z_{i}\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}: j \\neq i} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nSince $\\left(Z_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}}$ are i.i.d. centered random variables, one can check that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(Z_{i}\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}, j \\neq i} Z_{j}\\right)^{2}\\right]=\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right) \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich, in turn, implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I E\\left[\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right]=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right) \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|\\left(1-\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\right) \\operatorname{Var}\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}\\right)=r_{a}^{N} r_{b}^{N} p(1-p)-N^{-1} r_{b}^{N} p(1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining the above identity with Jensen's inequality (and the assumption we made on the sequence of fractions $r_{a}^{N}$ ), we deduce that Equation (98) is satisfied.\n\nNext, notice that $\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1\\right)^{-1} Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}$ can be seen as the empirical covariance of the random variables $L_{i}^{N, a b}$ and $L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}, i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$. In this perspective, $I E\\left[\\left|Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}-I E\\left[Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}\\right]\\right|^{2}\\right]$ corresponds to $\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1\\right)^{2}$ times the variance of the empirical covariance of the random variables $L_{i}^{N, a b}$ and $L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}, i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}$. It is well-known (e.g., see (Casella and Berger, 2024, page 363, exercise 7.45 b ) for the case of the empirical variance) that the latter is equal to\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|^{-1}\\left(\\mu_{2,2}+\\frac{\\mu_{2,0} \\mu_{0,2}-\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-2\\right) \\mu_{1,1}^{2}}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_{r, s}=I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-I E\\left[L_{i}^{N, a b}\\right]\\right)^{r}\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}-I E\\left[L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}\\right]\\right)^{s}\\right]$. We have $\\mu_{2,2}=I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.b p r_{b}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}-b_{1} p r_{b_{1}}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\left[\\leq\\left(I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-b p r_{b}^{N}\\right)^{4}\\right] I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}-b_{1} p r_{b_{1}}^{N}\\right)^{4}\\right]\\right)^{1 / 2}\\right.$ by Cauchy Schwarz inequality, $\\mu_{2,0}=I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-b p r_{b}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right], \\mu_{0,2}=I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b_{1}}-b_{1} p r_{b_{1}}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right]$ and $\\mu_{1,1}=$ $\\delta_{b b_{1}} I E\\left[\\left(L_{i}^{N, a b}-b p r_{b}^{N}\\right)^{2}\\right]$ by independence. By applying Lemma F.7, we know that, for some universal constant $K, \\mu_{2,2} \\leq K N^{-2}$ and $\\mu_{2,0}+\\mu_{0,2}+\\mu_{1,1} \\leq K N^{-1}$. Finally,\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left|Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}-I E\\left[Y_{a, b b_{1}}^{N}\\right]\\right|^{2}\\right] \\leq K \\frac{\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1\\right)^{2}}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|}\\left(N^{-2}+\\frac{N^{-2}-\\left(\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-2\\right) N^{-2}}{\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right|-1}\\right) \\leq K N^{-1}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the result.\nF.5. Proof of Lemma F.4. It suffices to show that the inequalities hold for all $N$ sufficiently large. Recall that $r_{a}^{N}=\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\right| / N$, for $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$. Throughout the proof, we assume that $N$ is large enough $\\left(N \\geq N_{0}\\right)$ ensuring that $r_{+}^{N} \\wedge r_{-}^{N} \\geq r_{\\min }>0$ for some $r_{\\min }$ sufficiently small depending only on the choice of $r_{+}$and $r_{-}$. In what follows, we shall denote $K$ a constant which may depend on $\\lambda$ and which may change from one line to another. The proof is divided in the 12 steps below.\n\nStep 1. Consider the event\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{N}=\\bigcap_{a \\in\\{-,+\\}} \\bigcap_{b \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left\\|L^{N, a b}-\\left(b p r_{b}^{N}\\right) 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\|_{2} \\vee\\left\\|C^{N, a b}-\\left(a p r_{b}^{N}\\right) 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq N^{1 / 4}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFor later use, let us observe that Points (ii) and (iii) of Lemma F. 1 imply that $\\mathcal{A}_{N}$ is included in the event\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{G}_{N}=\\bigcap_{b \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\{ \\| L^{N, \\bullet b}-(b p r_{b}^{N}) 1_{N} \\|_{2} \\vee\\left\\|L^{N, b \\bullet}-p\\left(r_{+}^{N}-r_{-}^{N}\\right) 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}\\right\\|_{2} \\\\\n\\vee\\left\\|C^{N, \\bullet b}-p r_{b}^{N}\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right)\\right\\|_{2} \\vee\\left\\|C^{N, b \\bullet}-(b p) 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq 2 N^{1 / 4}\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining Point (iv) of Lemma F. 1 with Markov's inequality, one can show that for any $\\alpha \\geq 1$, there exits a constant $K_{\\alpha}>0$ such that\n\n$$\nI^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{N}\\right) \\geq I^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{N}\\right) \\geq 1-K_{\\alpha} N^{-\\alpha / 4}\n$$\n\nHence, $\\mathcal{A}_{N}$ is a large probability event and we will first consider the expectations appearing in Lemma F. 4 under the event $\\mathcal{A}_{N}$ only. This is used in Step 4.\n\nStep 2. Let $a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}$. Here, we prove that\n(i) $\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a b}=(1-\\lambda)\\left[1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} \\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}+\\sum_{e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, e b} L}^{N, a e}+e^{N, a b} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right]$,\nwhere\n(ii) $\\left|\\epsilon^{N, a b}\\right| \\leq\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\|C^{N, \\bullet a}-p r_{a}\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right)\\right\\|_{2}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}$.\n\nStarting from $\\ell^{N, \\bullet b}=Q^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}=\\left(I_{N}-(1-\\lambda) A^{N}\\right)^{-1} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}$, we get $\\ell^{N, \\bullet b}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}+(1-$ $\\lambda) A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}$. Hence, it implies that $\\ell^{N, a b}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}+(1-\\lambda) A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}\\right)$ and $\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, a b}}=$ $\\delta_{a b}+(1-\\lambda)\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\langle A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}, 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\rangle$, so that\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a b}=(1-\\lambda)\\left[1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}-\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\langle A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}, 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\rangle 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThen, using the substitution $\\ell^{N, \\bullet b}=\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}+\\sum_{e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, e b}} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{e}}$ in the two terms above and the fact that $1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{e}}=L^{N, a e}$, we get point (i) with\n\n$$\n\\epsilon^{N, a b}=-\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\langle A^{N} \\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}, 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\rangle=-\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\langle\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b},\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nYet, $\\left(A^{N}\\right)^{\\top} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}=C^{N, \\bullet a}$ by definition and $\\left\\langle\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}, 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}, 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right\\rangle=0$ by construction so that\n\n$$\n\\epsilon^{N, a b}=-\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\langle\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}, C^{N, \\bullet a}-p r_{a}\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nand point (ii) follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\nStep 3. Proceeding as in Step 2, one can show that\n(i) $\\widetilde{c}^{N, a b}=(1-\\lambda)\\left[1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot A^{N} \\widetilde{c}^{N, \\bullet b}+\\sum_{e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{c^{N, e b} C}^{N, a e}+\\gamma^{N, a b} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right]$,\nwhere\n(ii) $\\left|\\gamma^{N, a b}\\right| \\leq\\left(r_{a}^{N} N\\right)^{-1}\\left\\|L^{N, \\bullet a}-\\left(a p r_{a}\\right) 1_{N}\\right\\|_{2}\\left\\|\\widetilde{c}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}$.\n\nStep 4. Here, we prove Equation (87).\nFrom Step 2, one can sum for $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$ to obtain (100)\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}=(1-\\lambda)\\left[A^{N} \\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}+\\sum_{a \\in\\{-,+\\}} \\sum_{e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, e b} L}^{N, a e}+\\sum_{a \\in\\{-,+\\}} e^{N, a b} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThen, using the fact that $\\left\\|1_{\\mathcal{P}_{x}}\\right\\|_{2}=N^{1 / 2}\\left(r_{a}^{N}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\leq N^{1 / 2}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(1-\\lambda)^{-1}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq\\left\\|A^{N}\\right\\|_{2}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2} \\\\\n&+4 \\max _{e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\mid \\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, e b}\\right\\} \\max _{a, e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a e}\\right\\|_{2}\\right\\}+N^{1 / 2} \\sum_{a \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left|e^{N, a b}\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\left\\|A^{N}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq 1$ and $\\left|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, e b}\\right| \\leq r_{e}^{N} \\lambda^{-1}$ (see inequality (84)). On the event $\\mathcal{A}_{N} \\supset \\mathcal{G}_{N}$, we have $\\left\\|C^{N, \\bullet a}-p r_{a}^{N}\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right)\\right\\|_{2} \\leq 2 N^{1 / 4}$, and using Point (ii) of Step 2, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}(1-\\lambda)^{-1}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}\\left[1+\\frac{4}{r_{+}^{N} \\wedge r_{-}^{N}} N^{-1 / 4}\\right]+4 \\lambda^{-1} \\max _{a, e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a e}\\right\\|_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNow, since $r_{+}^{N} \\wedge r_{-}^{N} \\geq r_{\\min }$, it follows that $1+\\frac{4}{r_{+}^{N} \\wedge r_{-}^{N}} N^{-1 / 4} \\leq 1+4 r_{\\min }^{-1} N^{-1 / 4}<(1-\\lambda)^{-1}$ for $N \\geq N_{1}$ for some $N_{1}$ sufficiently large. As a consequence, there exists a constant $K$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2} \\leq K \\max _{a, e \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a e}\\right\\|_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand Equations (81) and (82) of Lemma F. 1 implies that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right] \\leq K I E\\left[\\max _{a, b \\in\\{-,+\\}}\\left\\{\\left\\|\\widetilde{L}^{N, a b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right\\}\\right] \\leq K\n$$\n\nfor all $N \\geq N_{1}$. Taking the maximum value of $I E\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}\\left\\|\\tilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right]$ over all $N \\in\\left[N_{0}, N_{1}\\right]$, we get\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right] \\leq K\n$$\n\nfor all $N \\geq N_{0}$. Yet, inequality 84 implies that $\\left|\\widetilde{\\ell}_{i}^{N, a b}\\right| \\leq 2 \\lambda^{-1}$ which in turn implies that $\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4} \\leq 4 \\lambda^{-2} N^{2}$. Hence, to get rid of the term $\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}$ it suffices to write\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right] \\leq 4 \\lambda^{-2} N^{2} I P\\left(\\left(\\mathcal{A}_{N}\\right)^{c}\\right)+I E\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathcal{A}_{N}}\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right] \\leq K\n$$\n\nwhere we used the last inequality of Step 1 with $\\alpha=8$.\nFinally, the proof of the inequality $I E\\left[\\left\\|\\widetilde{c}^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\|_{2}^{4}\\right] \\leq K$ follows the same line and is therefore omitted.\n\nStep 5. Here, we prove Equation (85).\nWe have already used in Step 2 that $\\ell^{N, a b}=1_{\\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\odot\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{b}}+(1-\\lambda) A^{N} \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}\\right)$ Hence, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N, a b} & =r_{a}^{N} \\delta_{a b}+(1-\\lambda) N^{-1} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{P}_{a}} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A^{N}(i, j) \\ell_{j}^{N, \\bullet b} \\\\\n& =r_{a}^{N} \\delta_{a b}+(1-\\lambda) N^{-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} C_{j}^{N, \\bullet a} \\ell_{j}^{N, \\bullet b} \\\\\n& =r_{a}^{N} \\delta_{a b}+(1-\\lambda) p r_{a}^{N}\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,+b}-\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,-b}\\right)+\\eta^{N, a b}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta^{N, a b}=(1-\\lambda) N^{-1}\\left\\langle C^{N, \\bullet a}-p r_{a}^{N}\\left(1_{\\mathcal{P}_{+}}-1_{\\mathcal{P}_{-}}\\right), \\ell^{N, \\bullet b}\\right\\rangle$. In particular, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,+b}-\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,-b}=\\frac{\\left(b r_{a}^{N}\\right)}{1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{a}^{N}-r_{-}^{N}\\right)}+\\eta^{N,+b}-\\eta^{N,-b} \\\\\n\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,+b}+\\widetilde{\\ell}^{N,-b}=\\frac{r_{a}^{N}+2 b(1-\\lambda) p r_{a}^{N} r_{-}^{N}}{1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{a}^{N}-r_{-}^{N}\\right)}+(1-\\lambda) p\\left(\\eta^{N,+b}-\\eta^{N,-b}\\right)+\\eta^{N,+b}+\\eta^{N,-b}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nand so\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\ell^{N, a b}}=\\frac{r_{a}^{N} \\delta_{a b}+b(1-\\lambda) p r_{+}^{N} r_{-}^{N}}{1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{+}^{N}-r_{-}^{N}\\right)}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda) p}{2}\\left(\\eta^{N,+b}-\\eta^{N,-b}\\right)+\\eta^{N, a b}\n$$\n\nSince by our assumption, $\\left|r_{+}^{N}-r_{+}\\right|+\\left|r_{-}^{N}-r_{-}\\right| \\leq K N^{-1}$, we have\n$\\left|\\frac{r_{a}^{N} \\delta_{a b}+b(1-\\lambda) p r_{+}^{N} r_{-}^{N}}{1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{+}^{N}-r_{-}^{N}\\right)}-\\frac{r_{a} \\delta_{a b}+b(1-\\lambda) p r_{+} r_{-}}{1-(1-\\lambda) p\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)}\\right| \\leq K\\left(\\left|r_{+}^{N}-r_{+}\\right|+\\left|r_{-}^{N}-r_{-}\\right|\\right) \\leq K N^{-1}$,\nfor some constant $K$ that may depend on $\\lambda$, and the result will follow once we check that $\\operatorname{IE}\\left[\\left(\\eta^{N, a b}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\leq K N^{-2}$.\n\nTo this end, we write $\\eta^{N, a b}=(1-\\lambda) N^{-1}\\left(\\eta_{+}^{N, a b}+\\eta_{-}^{N, a b}\\right)$ where, for $e \\in\\{-,+\\}$, $\\eta_{e}^{N, a b}=\\left\\langle C^{N, e a}-(e p) r_{a}^{N} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{e}}, \\ell^{N, e b}\\right\\rangle$. Remind that $\\ell^{N, e b}=\\overline{\\ell^{N, e b}}+\\left(r_{e}^{N}\\right)^{-1} \\overline{\\ell^{N, e b}} 1_{\\mathcal{P}_{e}}$.

Also, we shall denote $K$ a constant which may depend on $\\lambda$ and which may change from one line to another. The proof is divided in several steps.\n\nWe will first prove (91).

In view of Proposition G.1, it suffices to find this inverse function on the set\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}= \\begin{cases}(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty)^{2}, & \\text { if } r_{+} \\neq 1 / 2 \\\\ \\{(m, v, w) \\in(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty)^{2}: w>m(1-m)\\}, & \\text { if } r_{+}=1 / 2\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nHence, from now on, $(m, v, w)$ will denote an arbitrary vector in $\\mathcal{M}$ (in particular, it is not related to $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$ ). Remind the function $\\kappa$ defined in Equation 11 and let us define $d^{(+)}, d^{(-)}:(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by, for $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$,\n\n$$\nd^{(a)}(m, w)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{4 r_{+} r_{-}+a \\sqrt{\\left(4 r_{+} r_{-}\\right)^{2}-4 r_{+} r_{-}+\\kappa(m, w)}}{4 r_{+} r_{-}-\\kappa(m, w)}, & \\text { if } \\kappa(m, w) \\neq 4 r_{+} r_{-} \\\\ \\left(8 r_{+} r_{-}\\right)^{-1}, & \\text { if } \\kappa(m, w)=4 r_{+} r_{-}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIf $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$ and $(m, v, w)$ are related through (8) then the value $d^{(a)}(m, w)$ is a candidate to be equal to $D(\\lambda, p)$. The values $d^{(+)}(m, w)$ and $d^{(-)}(m, w)$ are the roots of the quadratic equation\n\n$$\n\\left[4 r_{+} r_{-}-\\kappa(m, w)\\right] u^{2}-\\left(8 r_{+} r_{-}\\right) u+1=0\n$$\n\nOn the one hand, $d^{(-)}$is positive and one can check that it is $C^{1}$ (even when $\\kappa(m, w) \\rightarrow$ $4 r_{+} r_{-}$). On the other hand, $d^{(+)}$may be negative and goes to infinity when $\\kappa(m, w) \\rightarrow$ $4 r_{+} r_{-}$. In view of this remark and Proposition G.1, $d^{(-)}(m, w)$ is expected to be the good candidate to be equal to $D(\\lambda, p)$. This is true most of the time but not for the whole range of parameters (see Proposition G. 3 below).\n\nFrom now on, let $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$. Let us define $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}:(0,1) \\times(0, \\infty) \\rightarrow(0, \\infty)$ by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)= \\begin{cases}w[m(1-m)]^{-1}-1, & \\text { if } r_{+}=1 / 2 \\\\ {\\left[1-d^{(a)}(m, w)\\right]^{2}\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{-2},} & \\text { else }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand $\\phi_{2}^{(a)}: \\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow(1, \\infty)$ by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w)=1+\\frac{v}{\\left[\\left(m-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+r_{+} r_{-}\\right] \\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)}\n$$\n\nIf $(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$ and $(m, v, w)$ are related through (8) then $\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)$ (respectively $\\phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w)$ ) are two candidates to be equal to $(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}\\left(\\right.$ resp. $\\left.p^{-1}\\right)$. Then, for $k=1,2,3$, let $\\Phi_{k}^{(a)}: \\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathbb{R}$ be defined by,\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\Phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, v, w)=m\\left(1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)}\\right)-r_{-} \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)} \\\\\n\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w)=1-\\phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w)} \\\\\n\\Phi_{3}^{(a)}(m, v, w)=\\left(\\phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w)\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFinally, let $\\Phi^{(a)}: \\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ be defined by the three coordinate functions above. Let us remark that all the functions involved in the definition of $\\Phi^{(a)}$ are obviously $C^{\\infty}$ except $d^{(a)}$. Nevertheless, it is easy to check that $d^{(-)}$is (at least) $C^{1}$ when $\\kappa(m, w) \\rightarrow 4 r_{+} r_{-}$. In turn, $\\Phi^{(-)}$is regular.\n\nProposition G.2. The function $\\Phi^{(-)}$is $C^{1}$.\nFinally, the functions $\\Phi^{(+)}$and $\\Phi^{(-)}$are related with $\\Psi$ in the following sense.\nProposition G.3.

Remind that $d^{(a)}(m, w)$ is a candidate for $D(\\lambda, p)$. In that regard, the sign condition appearing in Item 2 above is consistent with Proposition G.1.\n\nProof.\n\nProof of 1. Let $(\\mu, \\lambda, p) \\in \\Lambda$. In the following, we shorten the notation $\\Psi_{k}=\\Psi_{k}(\\mu, \\lambda, p)$. Finally, we denote $\\Psi=\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{2}, \\Psi_{3}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nLet us first consider the case $r_{+}=1 / 2$. In that case, the $\\phi$ and $\\Phi$ functions do not depend on the superscript $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$ and we omit it in the following. Furthermore, $D(\\lambda, p)=1$ and $\\Psi$ reduces to\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\Psi_{1}=\\mu+(1-\\lambda) p / 2 \\\\\n\\Psi_{2}=(1-\\lambda)^{2} p(1-p)\\left[\\left(\\Psi_{1}-1 / 2\\right)^{2}+1 / 4\\right] \\\\\n\\Psi_{3}=\\Psi_{1}\\left[1-\\Psi_{1}\\right]\\left[1+(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}\\right]\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nHence, it is easy to check that $\\phi_{1}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)=(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}$ and\n\n$$\n\\phi_{2}(\\Psi)=1+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)^{2} p(1-p)\\left[\\left(\\Psi_{1}-1 / 2\\right)^{2}+1 / 4\\right]}{\\left[\\left(\\Psi_{1}-1 / 2\\right)^{2}+1 / 4\\right](1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}}=1+\\frac{1-p}{p}=\\frac{1}{p}\n$$\n\nThen, we conclude by\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\Phi_{1}^{(a)}(\\Psi)=\\Psi_{1}-(1-\\lambda) p / 2=\\mu \\\\\n\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}(\\Psi)=1-\\frac{1}{p}(1-\\lambda) p=\\lambda \\\\\n\\Phi_{3}^{(a)}(\\Psi)=(1 / p)^{-1}=p\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nLet us then consider the case $r_{+} \\neq 1 / 2$. First, we remark that\n\n$$\n\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)=\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1+4(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} r_{+} r_{-}}{D(\\lambda, p)^{2}}\n$$\n\nThen, substituting $(1-\\lambda) p=(1-D(\\lambda, p)) /\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)$into the equation aboves gives that\n\n$$\n\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)=\\frac{\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+4 r_{+} r_{-}(1-D(\\lambda, p))^{2}}{D(\\lambda, p)^{2}}\n$$\n\nThen, using the fact that $\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{2}=\\left(r_{+}+r_{-}\\right)^{2}-4 r_{+} r_{-}=1-4 r_{+} r_{-}$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right) D(\\lambda, p)^{2}=1+4 r_{+} r_{-}\\left[D(\\lambda, p)^{2}-2 D(\\lambda, p)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhich means that $D(\\lambda, p)$ is a solution of the quadratic equation\n\n$$\n\\left[4 r_{+} r_{-}-\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)\\right] X^{2}-\\left(8 r_{+} r_{-}\\right) X+1=0\n$$\n\nBy definition of $d^{(+)}$and $d^{(-)}$, we necessarily have $D(\\lambda, p) \\in\\left\\{d^{(+)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right), d^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)\\right\\}$. In turn, since $(1-D(\\lambda, p))^{2}\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)^{-2}=(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}$, we have\n\n$$\n(1-\\lambda)^{2} p^{2} \\in\\left\\{\\phi_{1}^{(+)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{2}\\right), \\phi_{1}^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{2}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand the proof is concluded in the same manner as the case $r_{+}=1 / 2$.\nProof of 2. Let us first remark that, if $r_{+}=1 / 2$ or $\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)=4 r_{+} r_{-}$, then $\\Phi^{(+)}=\\Phi^{(-)}$ and the result is trivial.\n\nOn the one hand, if $\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)>4 r_{+} r_{-}$then the root $d^{(+)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)$ is negative which implies that $D(\\lambda, p)=d^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)$. On the other hand, if $r_{+}>1 / 2$ and $\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)<4 r_{+} r_{-}$ then\n\n$$\nd^{(+)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right) \\geq \\frac{4 r_{+} r_{-}}{4 r_{+} r_{-}-\\kappa\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)}>1\n$$\n\nYet, we know that $D(\\lambda, p)<1$ by Proposition G. 1 which implies that $D(\\lambda, p)=d^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)$.\nAs a summary, we have $D(\\lambda, p)=d^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)$ in any case. In turn, it implies that $(1-$ $\\lambda)^{2} p^{2}=\\phi_{1}^{(-)}\\left(\\Psi_{1}, \\Psi_{3}\\right)$ and the proof is concluded as above.\n\nProof of 3. Let $(m, v, w) \\in \\mathcal{M}$, and $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$ such that $\\Phi^{(a)}(m, v, w) \\in \\Lambda$. In the following, we shorten the notation $d^{(a)}=d^{(a)}(m, w), \\phi_{1}^{(a)}=\\phi_{1}^{(a)}(m, w), \\phi_{2}^{(a)}=\\phi_{2}^{(a)}(m, v, w)$ and $\\Phi_{k}^{(a)}=\\Phi_{k}^{(a)}(m, v, w)$ for $k=1,2,3$. Finally, we denote $\\Phi^{(a)}=\\left(\\Phi_{1}^{(a)}, \\Phi_{2}^{(a)}, \\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\right) \\in \\Lambda$.\n\nWithout any condition, it is easy to check that $D\\left(\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}, \\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\right)=1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}$. In particular, it gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Psi_{1}\\left(\\Phi^{(a)}\\right) & =\\frac{\\Phi_{1}^{(a)}+\\left(1-\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}\\right) \\Phi_{3}^{(a)} r_{-}}{1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{m\\left[1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}\\right]-r_{-} \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}+r_{-} \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}}{1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}}=m\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Psi_{2}\\left(\\Phi^{(a)}\\right) & =\\left(1-\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}\\right)^{2} \\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\left(1-\\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\right)\\left[\\left(m-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+r_{+} r_{-}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\phi_{1}^{(a)}\\left[\\phi_{2}^{(a)}-1\\right]\\left[\\left(m-r_{-}\\right)^{2}+r_{+} r_{-}\\right]=v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the last coordinate, we use the condition stated in the Proposition.\nLet us first consider the case $r_{+}=1 / 2$. In that case, the $\\phi$ and $\\Phi$ functions do not depend on the superscript $a \\in\\{-,+\\}$ and we omit it in the following. First, remark that $D\\left(\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}, \\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\right)=$ $1-\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right) \\sqrt{\\phi_{1}^{(a)}}=1$ in that case, so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Psi_{3}\\left(\\Phi^{(a)}\\right) & =m(1-m)\\left[1+\\left(1-\\Phi_{2}^{(a)}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\Phi_{3}^{(a)}\\right)^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =m(1-m)\\left[1+\\frac{w}{m(1-m)}-1\\right]=w\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet us then consider the case $r_{+} \\neq 1 / 2$ and assume the sign condition: $\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(1-d^{(a)}\\right)=$ $\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(r_{+}-r_{-}\\right)$.

To that end, we analyze two simple and related statistical settings (both inspired by the one considered in Delattre and Fournier (2016)) where all the computations can be done more transparently. The first statistical setting is discussed in Section I.1 and the second one in Section I.2. In the end of that subsection, we also present some concluding remarks connecting the results proved. Finally, in Section I.3, we state and prove a Gaussian approximation used in Section I.1.\n\nThroughout the section, we write $\\theta$ to denote a random variable distributed as $\\operatorname{Bin}(N, p)$ where $0<p_{\\min } \\leq p \\leq p_{\\max }<1$ is an unknown parameter. Let $\\kappa \\in\\left(0, p_{\\max } / 2\\right)$ be a known value and define $\\gamma(p)=\\kappa / p$ for all $p_{\\min } \\leq p \\leq p_{\\max }$. Observe that $\\gamma(p)<1 / 2$ for all values of $p$. In what follows, we denote $m=1 / 2+\\kappa$.\nI.1. Statistical setting $\\mathbf{1}$ and problem formulation. Let $\\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(N, p)$ and consider a discrete random variable $B$ taking values in $\\{0, \\ldots, T\\}$ such that $B \\mid \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(T, 1 / 2+$ $\\gamma(p) \\theta / N)$. Note $1 / 2+\\gamma(p) \\theta / N<1$ for all $p$ and all realizations of $\\theta$, since $\\gamma(p)<1 / 2$. In particular, the conditional distribution of $B \\mid \\theta$ is well-defined no matter the realization of $\\theta$.\n\nSuppose we observe $N$ independent copies $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{N}$ of the random variable $B$ as defined above. Given these observations, we want to find an unbiased estimator for the parameter $1 / p$ whose variance is of order $\\left(N^{1 / 2} / T+1 / N^{1 / 2}\\right)^{2}$.\n\nIn what follows, we write $I_{p}^{\\star}$ to denote the probability distribution of $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{N}$ associated to the choice of $p$. The expectation and variance computed with respect to $I_{p}^{\\star}$ are denoted $I E_{p}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}_{p}$ respectively. One can easily check that, for all values of $p$, the mean of each random variable $B_{i}$ under $I_{p}^{\\star}$ is a known quantity: $I E_{p}\\left[B_{i}\\right]=I E_{p}[B]=T m$.\n\nREMARK I.1. Note that the goal is to determine an unbiased estimator for the parameter $1 / p$ and not for the parameter $p$ itself. In Section I.2, we explain why the parameter $1 / p$ is a \"natural\" parameter to be estimated in this setting.\n\nNote also that the random variables $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{N}$ can be seen as an oversimplified version of the random variables $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} X_{1, t}, \\ldots, \\sum_{t=1}^{T} X_{N, t}$ in which we drop the temporal and spatial dependence between the random variables $X_{i, t}$ given the realization of the environment and consider $\\mu=1 / 2$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}=\\emptyset$ (no inhibition). The parameter $\\gamma$ plays the role of the parameter $(1-\\lambda)$ in the original model. In particular, it is implicitly assumed that the baseline parameter $\\mu$ is known and equals to $1 / 2$, making the estimation problem even simpler.\n\nRecall that $m=1 / 2+\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is a known quantity. Given the random variables $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{N}$, define\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(B_{i}-T m\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nand consider the following estimator for $1 / p$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{S}=\\frac{N}{T(T-1) \\kappa^{2}}(\\hat{V}-T m(1-m))+1\n$$\n\nThe estimator $\\hat{S}$ is unbiased (see the proposition below) and follows from the method of moments. We expect that its variance gives the optimal rate of convergence within the class of unbiased estimators of $1 / p$. However, we do not have a proof of such result at the moment. The goal of this subsection is to show the following result.\n\nProposition I.2. For the estimator $\\hat{S}$ defined in (114) the following results hold:\n\n1. $\\hat{S}$ is an unbiased estimator of $1 / p$ : for all $p$,\n\n$$\nI E_{p}[\\hat{S}]=1 / p\n$$\n\n2. For all $p$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(\\hat{S})=\\frac{2}{\\kappa^{4}}\\left(\\frac{m(1-m) N^{1 / 2}}{T}+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N^{1 / 2}}\\right)^{2}(1+o(1))\n$$\n\nProof. We start proving Item 1. First, use the decomposition\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(B)=I E_{p}\\left[\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(B \\mid \\theta)\\right]+\\operatorname{Var}_{p}\\left[I E_{p}(B \\mid \\theta)\\right]\n$$\n\nto check that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(B)=T m(1-m)+\\frac{T(T-1)}{N} \\gamma^{2} p(1-p)\n$$\n\nThen, to conclude the proof, combine the above identity with the fact that\n\n$$\nI E_{p}(\\hat{S})=\\frac{N}{T(T-1)(\\gamma p)^{2}}\\left(\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(B)-T m(1-m)\\right)+1\n$$\n\nNext, we prove Item 2. First, observe that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{p}(\\hat{S})=\\frac{N}{T^{2}(T-1)^{2}(\\gamma p)^{4}} \\operatorname{Var}_{p}\\left((B-T m)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, write $\\operatorname{Var}_{p}\\left((B-T m)^{2}\\right)=I E_{p}\\left[(B-T m)^{4}\\right]-\\operatorname{Var}_{p}^{2}(B)$ and use (115) to show that\n\n$$\n\\frac{N}{T^{2}(T-1)^{2}} \\operatorname{Var}_{p}^{2}(B)=\\left(\\frac{N^{1 / 2}}{(T-1)} m(1-m)+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N^{1 / 2}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nTo conclude the proof, we approximate the term $I E_{p}\\left[(B-T m)^{4}\\right]$. To that end, we use the Gaussian approximation provided in Lemma I. 5 below. Using this approximation, we can write $B / T-m=G+\\epsilon$ so that\n\n$$\nI E_{p}\\left[(B-T m)^{4}\\right]=T^{4}\\left(I E_{p}\\left[G^{4}\\right]+\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\binom{4}{k} I E_{p}\\left[G^{4-k} \\epsilon^{k}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, since $G$ is a centered Gaussian random variable with variance $m(1-m) T^{-1}+\\gamma^{2} p(1-$ $p) N^{-1}$, we obtain that\n\n$$\nI E_{p}\\left[G^{4}\\right]=3\\left(\\frac{m(1-m)}{T}+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nMoreover, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the estimate (121), and the fact that G is a centered Gaussian random variable, one can show that there exists a constant $C_{k}$ depending only on $k$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.I E_{p}\\left[G^{4-k} \\epsilon^{k}\\right] \\leq C_{k}\\left(\\frac{m(1-m)}{T}+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N}\\right)^{(4-k)} \\times\\right) \\\\\n&\\left(\\frac{1}{T^{k / 2} N^{k / 4}}+\\frac{\\log ^{k}(T)}{T^{k}}+\\frac{\\log ^{k}(N)}{N^{k}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining the above inequality with Jensen inequality, we then conclude that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left.N I E_{p}\\left[G^{4-k} \\epsilon^{k}\\right] \\leq \\tilde{C}_{k}\\left(\\frac{N^{(4-k) / 4}}{T^{4-k / 2}}+\\frac{N \\log ^{k}(T)}{T^{4}}+\\frac{\\log ^{k}(N)}{N^{(k-1)} T^{(4-k)}}+\\frac{1}{T^{k / 2} N^{3-3 k / 4}}\\right.\\right. \\\\\n&\\left.\\left.+\\frac{\\log ^{k}(T)}{N^{(3-k)} T^{k}}+\\frac{\\log ^{k}(N)}{N^{3}}\\right)\\right,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{C}_{k}$ is a constant depending only on $k$. Since $\\frac{N^{(4-k) / 4}}{T^{4-k / 2}} \\frac{T^{2}}{N}=\\frac{1}{T^{2-k / 2} N^{k / 4}} \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\frac{N \\log ^{k}(T)}{T^{4}} \\frac{T^{2}}{N}=\\frac{\\log ^{k}(T)}{T^{2}} \\rightarrow 0$ as $N, T \\rightarrow \\infty$, one can deduce from the above inequality that\n\n$$\n\\max _{k=1, \\ldots, 4} N I E_{p}\\left[G^{4-k} \\epsilon^{k}\\right]=o\\left(\\left(\\frac{m(1-m) N^{1 / 2}}{T}+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N^{1 / 2}}\\right)^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombing (116), (117), (118), (119) and (120), the result follows.\n1.2. Statistical setting 2 and problem formulation. As in the previous subsection, let $\\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(N, p)$. Here, we assume that the random variable $B$ takes values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$ and is such that $B \\mid \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(2,1 / 2+\\gamma(p) \\theta / N)$.\n\nSuppose that $T$ is even and that we observe $n:=(N T) / 2$ independent copies $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ of the random variable $B$ as defined above. We want to show that the variance of any unbiased estimator of the parameter $1 / p$ is larger than $K(N / T)$ for some positive universal constant $K$. Hence, if $N / T$ remains bounded away from 0 , then no unbiased estimator of the parameter $1 / p$ is consistent.\n\nWith a slight abuse of notation, we also write $I_{p}^{\\star}$ to denote the probability distribution of $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ associated to the choice of $p$. The expectation and variance computed with respect to $I_{p}^{\\star}$ are denoted $I_{p}^{\\star}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}_{p}$ respectively. In this setting, observe that $I_{p}\\left[B_{i}\\right]=$ $2(1 / 2+\\kappa)=2 m$ for all values of $p$.\n\nRemark I.3. In this setting, the random variables $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ are distributed as the random variables $\\left(X_{1,1}+X_{1,2}\\right),\\left(X_{1,3}+X_{1,4}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(X_{1, T-1}+X_{1, T}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(X_{N, 1}+\\right.$ $\\left.X_{N, 2}\\right),\\left(X_{N, 3}+X_{N, 4}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(X_{N, T-1}+X_{N, T}\\right)$ under the assumptions that: 1) $\\mu=1 / 2$ and $\\mathcal{P}_{-}=\\emptyset$ (no inhibition), 2) for all $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ and $1 \\leq t \\leq T / 2$, the random variables $X_{i, 2 t-1}$ and $X_{i, 2 t}$ are conditionally independent given the realization of the environment and 3) all the other dependencies are dropped. Note that the random variables $X_{i, t}$ are less dependent under this set of assumptions than under the assumptions made in the statistical setting 1.\n\nWhile in our original problem, the \"natural\" parameter to estimate is $p$, in this statistical setting the \"natural\" parameter is $1 / p$ (as well as in the statistical setting 1). We can see this\n\nby checking that the probability mass function $f_{p}$ of each random variable $B_{i}$ under $I P_{p}$ can be written as\n\n$$\nf_{p}(b)=\\binom{2}{b}\\left[m^{b}(1-m)^{(2-b)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}\\left(\\frac{1}{p}-1\\right) s(b)\\right], b \\in\\{0,1,2\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $s(b)=1$ if $b \\in\\{0,2\\}$ and $s(b)=-1$ if $b=1$. The expression above for $f_{p}(b)$ follows from the fact that\n\n$$\nf_{p}(b)=I E_{p}\\left[\\binom{2}{b}(1 / 2+\\gamma(p) \\theta / N)^{b}(1 / 2-\\gamma(p) \\theta / N)^{2-b}\\right]\n$$\n\nand simple calculations involving binomial random variables.\nTo alleviate the notation, we parametrize the model by $\\eta=1 / p$ in what follows. In particular, we write $I P_{\\eta}=I P_{1 / p}, I E_{\\eta}=I E_{1 / p}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\eta}=\\operatorname{Var}_{1 / p}$. Therefore, we assume that we observe $n$ independent copies $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ of a random variable $B$ taking values in $\\{0,1,2\\}$ having as probability mass function $g_{\\eta}(b)=f_{1 / \\eta}(b)$. We want to show that no unbiased estimator of $\\eta$ based on these observations is consistent whenever $N / T$ remains bounded away from 0 . This is the content of the proposition below.\n\nProposition I.4. For all $N$ large enough, we have for any unbiased estimator $\\hat{\\eta}\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ of $\\eta$ that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\eta}\\left(\\hat{\\eta}\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)\\right) \\geq \\frac{N C^{2}}{T \\kappa^{4}}\n$$\n\nwhere $C:=\\min \\left\\{m^{2}, m(1-m),(1-m)^{2}\\right\\}>0$. In particular, if $N / T$ remains bounded away from 0 , then no unbiased estimator of $\\eta$ is consistent.\n\nProof. First, verify that the Fisher information of a single observation is given by\n\n$$\nI_{1}(\\eta):=-I E_{\\eta}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\log g_{\\eta}(B)}{\\partial \\eta^{2}}\\right]=\\frac{\\kappa^{4}}{N^{2}} I E_{\\eta}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{(2-B)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}(\\eta-1) s(B)\\right)^{2}}\\right]\n$$\n\nThen, use Corollary 5.9 of Lehmann and Casella (1998) to deduce that the Fisher information of $n=N T / 2$ i.i.d observations is given by\n\n$$\nI_{n}(\\eta)=n I_{1}(\\eta)=\\frac{T \\kappa^{4}}{2 N} I E_{\\eta}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{(2-B)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}(\\eta-1) s(B)\\right)^{2}}\\right]\n$$\n\nNext, observe that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{(2-B)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}(\\eta-1) s(B)\\right)^{2} & \\\\\n& \\geq m^{B}(1-m)^{2-B}\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{2-B}+2 \\kappa^{2}(\\eta-1) / N s(B)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand that $(\\eta-1) / N s(B) \\geq 0$ for $B=0,2$. Combining these inequalities with the definition of $C=\\min \\left\\{m^{2}, m(1-m),(1-m)^{2}\\right\\}$, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{(2-B)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}(\\eta-1) s(B)\\right)^{2} \\geq C\\left(C-2 \\kappa^{2}(\\eta-1) / N\\right)\n$$\n\nfrom which it follows that for $N \\geq 4(\\eta-1) \\kappa^{2} / C$,\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{B}(1-m)^{(2-B)}+\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{N}(\\eta-1) s(B)\\right)^{2} \\geq C^{2} / 2\n$$\n\nwhich, in turn, implies that\n\n$$\nI_{n}(\\eta) \\leq \\frac{T \\kappa^{4}}{N C^{2}}\n$$\n\nas long as $N \\geq 4(\\eta-1) \\kappa^{2} / C$. By Assumption 1 (and restricting the range of $p$ if necessary), we have that $(\\eta-1) \\leq M$ for some suitable constant $M$ so that for all $N \\geq 4 M \\kappa^{2} / C$, we have that\n\n$$\nI_{n}(\\eta) \\leq \\frac{T \\kappa^{4}}{N C^{2}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, by Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (see Theorem 5.10 of Lehmann and Casella (1998)), it then follows that for all unbiased estimators $\\hat{\\eta}\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ of $\\eta$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}_{\\eta}\\left(\\hat{\\eta}\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)\\right) \\geq\\left(I_{n}(\\eta)\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{N C^{2}}{T \\kappa^{4}}\n$$\n\nand the result follows.\n\nConcluding remarks. Both statistical settings 1 and 2 consider a statistical model with a hidden layer described by the random variable $\\theta$, similar as in the original model. As indicated in Remarks I. 1 and I.3, the laws of the statistical models considered in these settings are related to the law of the original model under different sets of assumptions dropping many dependencies. Moreover, more dependencies of the original model are preserved in setting 1.\n\nBoth Propositions I. 2 and I. 4 highlight the interplay between the dimension of the original model (number $N$ of observed nodes) and the sample size (the number $T$ of time units observed per node). In the regime $N^{2} \\gg T$ (which implies that $N / T \\gg\\left(N^{1 / 2} / T+1 / N^{1 / 2}\\right)^{2}$ ), the results of Proposition I. 2 and I. 4 combined indicate that estimating the model parameter becomes easier as more dependencies of the original model are preserved. This partially explains why the lower bound in Proposition I. 4 suggests that the condition $T \\gg N$ is necessary for our original estimation problem, while Item 2 of Proposition I. 2 indicates that the weaker condition $T \\gg N^{1 / 2}$ might suffice for consistently estimating the model parameters. Proving such a result in the original model remains an interesting open question.\nI.3. Auxiliary results. In this section, we state and prove the Gaussian approximation used to prove Item 2 of Proposition I.2. This result follows almost immediately from the KMT approximation theorem (see for example Koml\u00f3s, Major and Tusn\u00e1dy (1975)).\n\nLemma I.5. Let $B$ be a discrete random variable taking values in $\\{0, \\ldots, T\\}$ such that $B \\mid \\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(T, 1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)$ where $\\theta \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(N, p), 0<p_{\\min } \\leq p \\leq p_{\\max }<1$ and $0<\\gamma_{\\min } \\leq$ $\\gamma \\leq \\gamma_{\\max }<1 / 2$. Denote $m=1 / 2+\\gamma p$. There exists a probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, B^{\\mathcal{\\alpha}}\\right)$ on which almost surely\n\n$$\n\\frac{B}{T}-m=G+\\epsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ is a centered Gaussian random variable with variance $m(1-m) T^{-1}+\\gamma^{2} p(1-$ $p) N^{-1}$ and the error term $\\epsilon$ satisfies for all integer $\\alpha \\geq 1$,\n\n$$\nI E\\left[|\\epsilon|^{\\alpha}\\right] \\leq K_{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{1}{T^{\\alpha / 2} N^{\\alpha / 4}}+\\left(\\frac{\\log (T)}{T}\\right)^{\\alpha}+\\left(\\frac{\\log (N)}{N}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some positive constant $K_{\\alpha}$ depending only $\\alpha$.\n\nProof. Throughout the proof, we assume we work on a probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, I^{p}\\right)$ rich enough so that all the processes below are well-defined.\n\nLet $\\left(U_{t}\\right)_{1 \\leq t \\leq T}$ and $\\left(V_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mid N]}$ be two independent collections of i.i.d random variables uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$. For each $u \\in[0,1]$, define\n\n$$\nF_{T}(u)=\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} 1_{U_{t} \\leq u} \\text { and } F_{N}(u)=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1_{V_{j} \\leq u}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{T}(u)=\\sqrt{T}\\left(F_{T}(u)-u\\right) \\text { and } \\alpha_{N}(u)=\\sqrt{N}\\left(F_{N}(u)-u\\right)\n$$\n\nWith this notation, one can check that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B}{T}=m+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} \\alpha_{T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\alpha_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nNext, consider two independent Brownian Bridges $\\left(B_{T}(t)\\right)_{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}$ and $\\left(B_{N}(t)\\right)_{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}$ and define for each $u \\in[0,1]$,\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_{T}(u)=\\alpha_{T}(u)-B_{T}(u) \\text { and } \\epsilon_{N}(u)=\\alpha_{N}(u)-B_{N}(u)\n$$\n\nWe also suppose that the first Brownian Bridge $\\left(B_{T}(t)\\right)_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1}$ is independent of $\\theta$ as well. Furthermore, we follow the construction used in the KMT approximation (see Koml\u00f3s, Major and Tusn\u00e1dy (1975)) in such a way that we can also assume that for $z>0$,\n\n$$\nI^{p}\\left(\\sup _{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}\\left|\\epsilon_{T}(u)\\right| \\geq \\frac{1}{T^{1 / 2}}(a \\log (T)+z)\\right) \\leq b e^{-c z}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nI^{p}\\left(\\sup _{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}\\left|\\epsilon_{N}(u)\\right| \\geq \\frac{1}{N^{1 / 2}}(a \\log (N)+z)\\right) \\leq b e^{-c z}\n$$\n\nfor some positive universal constants $a, b$, and $c$. Using that $B_{N}(u) \\sim N(0, u(1-u))$ for each $u \\in[0,1]$, we immediately see that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} B_{N}(p) \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy similar arguments, we also have that $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} B_{T}(m) \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{m(1-m)}{T}\\right)$, so that it follows from the independence between $B_{T}(p)$ and $B_{N}(p)$ that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} B_{T}(m)+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} B_{N}(p) \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{m(1-m)}{T}+\\frac{\\gamma^{2} p(1-p)}{N}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining identities (122), (123) and (125), we then deduce that\n\n$$\n\\frac{B}{T}-m=G+\\epsilon\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nG=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}} B_{T}(m)+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} B_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nis a centered Gaussian random variable with variance $m(1-m) T^{-1}+\\gamma^{2} p(1-p) N^{-1}$ and\n\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}\\left(\\left(B_{T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)-B_{T}(m)\\right)+\\epsilon_{T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)\\right)+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\epsilon_{N}(p)\n$$\n\nNext, we will prove that the error term $\\epsilon$ defined in (126) satisfies the bound stated in (121). By combining the tail integral formula for the moments with (124), one can show that for any integer $\\alpha \\geq 1$\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(\\sup _{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}\\left|\\epsilon_{T}(u)\\right|\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right] \\leq K \\frac{\\log ^{\\alpha}(T)}{T^{\\alpha / 2}}\n$$\n\nfor some constant $K$ depending only on $a, b, c$ and $\\alpha$. Similarly, one can also show that for any integer $\\alpha \\geq 1$\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(\\sup _{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}\\left|\\epsilon_{N}(u)\\right|\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right] \\leq K \\frac{\\log ^{\\alpha}(N)}{N^{\\alpha / 2}}\n$$\n\nfor some constant $K$ depending only on $a, b, c$ and $\\alpha$. Moreover, by the independence between $\\left(B_{T}(u)\\right)_{0 \\leq u \\leq 1}$ and $\\theta$, we can write\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(B_{i, T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)-B_{i, T}(m)\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right]=I E\\left[\\varphi_{\\alpha}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{\\alpha}(q)=I E\\left[\\left(B_{T}(q)-B_{T}(m)\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right], q \\in[0,1]$. Next, using properties of a Brownian Bridge, we can check that\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\alpha}(q) \\leq 2^{\\alpha-1}|q-m|^{\\alpha / 2} I E\\left[|N(0,1)|^{\\alpha}\\right]\\left(1-|q-m|^{\\alpha / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nso that denoting $K_{\\alpha}=2^{\\alpha-1} I E\\left[|N(0,1)|^{\\alpha}\\right]$, we obtain that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(B_{T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)-B_{T}(m)\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right] \\leq K_{\\alpha} \\gamma I E\\left[|\\theta / N-p|^{\\alpha / 2}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere we have also used that $0 \\leq|q-m| \\leq 1$ which implies that $\\left(1-|q-m|^{\\alpha / 2}\\right) \\leq 1$.\nBy applying Lemma F. 7 of the main text, we then deduce that\n\n$$\nI E\\left[\\left(B_{T}(1 / 2+\\gamma \\theta / N)-B_{T}(m)\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right] \\leq K N^{-\\alpha / 4}\n$$\n\nfor $K=K_{\\alpha} \\gamma_{\\max }^{\\alpha} C_{\\alpha}$, where $C_{\\alpha}$ is a constant depending only on $\\alpha$.
