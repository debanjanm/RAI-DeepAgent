      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nProblems of recovery of signals from incomplete observations were studied intensively in different settings. This includes recovering signals from samples. It is known that smooth signals can be recovered arbitrarily small error from samples taken with sufficient frequency. This lead to the interpolation problem. There are many different approaches to this problem for smooth enough signals: splines, B-splines, or mean values of signal between sampling points; see, e.g., $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,14,16,20,21]$, and the references therein. In particular, B-spline methods have been applied for multi-dimension signals featuring polynomial growth, including the case defined on multidimensional spaces $[1,2,16,20,21]$.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on interpolation formulae such as\n\n$$\nx(t)=\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_{k}(t) x(k)\n$$\n\nwhere $t \\in \\mathbf{R}, x: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ is a signal, $a_{k}(t)$ are some coefficients.\nFor the Schwartz space of rapidly decaying functions, there is an interpolation formula [22]. The coefficients of this formula have to be calculated via numerical integration of some special function, so it can be called semi-explicit; see also [23]. This formula includes the value of the Fourier transforms at the sampling points.\n\nFor the band-limited signals vanishing on $\\pm \\infty$, there is an interpolation formula with explicitly given coefficients: the classical Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem establishes that a band-limited signal can be recovered without error from a discrete sample taken with a sampling rate that is at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal (the Nyquist critical rate). In particular, a band-limited signal $x(\\cdot) \\in L_{2}(\\mathbf{R})$ with the support of the Fourier transform $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega s} x(s) d s$ contained in the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ can be recovered from its sample $\\{x(k)\\}_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}$ as\n\n$$\nx(t)=\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin (\\pi(k-t))}{\\pi(k-t)} x(k)\n$$\n\nThis is celebrated Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov interpolation formula, also known as Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula, Shannon's interpolation formula, and Whittaker's interpolation formula. It can be observed that since the coefficients of this interpolation formula are decreasing as $\\sim 1 / k$, it covers only signals such that $x(t) \\rightarrow 0$ with a certain rate as $|t| \\rightarrow+\\infty$.\n\nThere are many works devoted to generalization of the Sampling Theorem; see e.g. the reviews in $[13,15,19,25,27,28]$ and literature therein. Unfortunately, the generalisations listed therein do not lead to any alternative explicit interpolation formulae for standard band-limited signals from $L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$, and they not cover the setting with non-decaying signals.\n\nAs far as we know, there are only one another explicit interpolation formulae in the existing literature: it is Vaaler formula [26]; see some analysis in [23]. This formula is different from (1) since it includes the value of derivatives at the sampling points. The coefficients of this formula decay as $\\sim 1 / k$, similarly to (2).\n\nThe present paper obtains interpolation formulae similar to (2) but with faster decreasing coefficients. This itself is a useful feature, since it allows to reduce the error caused by truncation that is unavoidable in calculations. However, the main focus of this paper is extension of the\n\ninterpolation formula on unbounded and non-vanishing band-limited signals. Let us explain why it is important. It can be observed that a unbounded non-vanishing signal usually can be modified to a signal from $L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ without any loss of information, for example, by replacement a signal $x(t)$ featuring polynomial growth by $e^{-|t|} x(t)$. However, at least for the case of signals from $L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$, these damping transformations represent the convolutions in the frequency domain, with smoothing kernels. Unfortunately, a band-limited signal will be transformed into a non-bandlimited one along the way. For the general type unbounded two-sided processes, one could expect a similar impact of the damping transformations on the spectrum. Therefore, it was essential to develop a special approach for obtaining explicit interpolation formulae applicable to unbounded non-decaying signals $x$ featuring polynomial growth such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{t \\in \\mathbf{R}}(1+|t|)^{-\\alpha}|x(t)|<+\\infty\n$$\n\nfor some $\\alpha \\geq 0$.\nThe paper obtains an analog of Sampling Theorem and a interpolation formula (1) for bandlimited non-decaying one-dimensional unbounded signals featuring polynomial growth and such that their spectrum is contained in a interval $I \\subset(-\\pi, \\pi)$. We show that, for these signals, where the series absolutely converge for each $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$. The coefficients in (1) are calculated as\n\n$$\na_{k}(t)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} E(t, \\omega) e^{-i \\omega k} d \\omega\n$$\n\nfor some regular enough functions $E(t, \\omega): \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ such that $E(t, \\omega)=e^{i \\omega t}$ for $\\omega \\in I$ (Theorem 4.2). The requirements for the regularity of these function are defined by the allowed rate of growth for a class of admissible signals $x$. An algorithm for calculations of $a_{k}(t)$ is provided (Lemma 4.3 below). In particular, it is shown that, for any $\\alpha \\geq 0$, the functions $E$ can be selected such that $a_{k}(t)$ decay faster than $\\sim 1 / k^{\\nu}$ for some $\\nu>1+\\alpha$.\n\nFurthermore, for the special case of the signals featuring sublinear growth with $\\alpha \\in[0,1 / 2)$, we calculated the coefficients $a_{k}(t)$ explicitly (Theorem 2.3). The $k$ th coefficients for the corresponding new interpolation formula (5) are decreasing as $\\sim 1 / k^{2}$. A more general case of the signals featuring subquadratic growth with $\\alpha \\in[0,3 / 2)$, we found a semi-explicit representation for the coefficients $a_{k}(t)$ via integrals of functions $e^{-i \\omega k} \\omega^{l}$ for $l=1,2,3$. (Theorem 2.4 and formula (6) in Section 2). The corresponding $\\left|a_{k}(t)\\right|$ decay faster than $\\sim 1 / k^{5 / 2}$. It is also shown how to construct the coefficients $a_{k}(t)$ for the general case where $\\alpha \\geq 3 / 2$ such that the corresponding values $a_{k}(t)$.\n\nSome numerical experiments are described in Section 5.",

Let $\\rho: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow(0,1]$ be defined as\n\n$$\n\\rho(t)=(1+|t|)^{-\\alpha}\n$$\n\nLet $\\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$ be the space of functions $f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ such that $\\rho f \\in L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$, with the norm $\\|f\\|_{\\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})}:=\\|\\rho f\\|_{L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})}$.\n\nLet $\\rho L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ be the space of functions $f: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ such that $\\rho^{-1} f \\in L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$, with the norm $\\|f\\|_{\\rho L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})}:=\\left\\|\\rho^{-1} f\\right\\|_{L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})}$.\n\nDefinition 2.1. For a Borel measurable set $D \\subset \\mathbf{R}$ with non-empty interior, let $x \\in \\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$ be such that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) y(t) d t=0$ for any $y \\in \\rho L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ such that $\\left.Y\\right|_{\\mathbf{R} \\backslash D} \\equiv 0$, where $Y$ is the Fourier transform of $y$. In this case, we say that $D$ is a spectral gap of $x \\in \\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$.\n\nFor $\\Omega \\in(0,+\\infty)$, we denote by $\\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$ the set of all signals $x \\in \\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$ with the spectral gap $\\mathbf{R} \\backslash(-\\Omega, \\Omega)$. We call these signals band-limited.\n\nIt was shown in [12] that signals from $\\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$ are continuous for any $\\alpha \\geq 0$.\nWe use the terms \"spectral gap\" and \"band-limited\" because, for a signal $x \\in \\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$, Definition 2.1 means that $X(\\omega)=0$ for $\\omega \\in D$, where $X$ the Fourier transform of $x$. The standard Fourier transform is not applicable for general type non-vanishing signals from $\\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$, however, we will use the terms \"spectral gap\" and \"band-limited\" for them as well. It is shown in Section 3 below that this is still justified with respect to the spectral properties of these signal.\n\nWe consider below spectral representation and some applications for unbounded signals from $\\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$.\n\nProposition 2.2. For any $\\alpha \\geq 0$ and $\\Omega \\in(0, \\pi)$, there exists a sequence of functions $\\left\\{a_{k}(\\cdot)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\subset$ $\\rho L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ such that $\\sup _{t \\in \\mathbf{R}} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}(1+|k|)^{\\alpha}\\left|a_{k}(t)\\right|<+\\infty$ and (1) holds, i.e., $x(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{k}(t) x(k)$ for any $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$. The corresponding series is absolutely convergent for each $t$.\n\nIn particular, it follows that, for any $t$, the coefficients $\\left|a_{k}(t)\\right|$ are decreasing as $\\sim 1 / k^{\\nu}$ for some $\\nu>1+\\alpha$.\n\nLemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 below provide a way to calculate $a_{k}(t)$ for any $\\alpha \\in[0,+\\infty)$\nFor the case where $\\alpha \\in[0,1 / 2)$, it was possible to calculate these functions explicitly, as is Theorem 2.3 below.\n\nLet $\\Omega \\in(0, \\pi)$ be given. Let some even integer number $N$ be selected such that\n\n$$\nN>\\frac{\\Omega}{\\pi-\\Omega}\n$$\n\nIt can be noted that we need to select larger $N$ for larger $\\Omega$, i.e., $N \\rightarrow+\\infty$ as $\\Omega \\rightarrow \\pi-0$.\nFor $t \\in[N, N+1)$ and $\\tau=t-N \\in[0,1)$, let us select\n\n$$\ng(t)=\\frac{\\pi\\lfloor t\\rfloor}{t}=\\frac{\\pi N}{N+\\tau}\n$$\n\nHere $\\lfloor t \\cdot=\\min \\{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}: t \\geq m\\}$.\nIt is easy to see that, for any $t \\in[N, N+1)$, we have $g(t) \\geq \\pi N(N+1)^{-1}>\\Omega$ and $g(t) t=\\pi N$.\nAssume that the function $g(t)$ is extended periodically from $[N, N+1)$ to $\\mathbf{R}$. This function is right-continuous. In addition, $g(m)=\\pi$ and $(t-m) g(t)=\\pi N$ for any integer $m$ and any $t \\in[N+m, N+m+1)$.\n\nTheorem 2.3. If $\\alpha \\in[0,1 / 2)$ in (4), then, for band-limited signal $x \\in \\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$, for any $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $m=\\lfloor t-N\\rfloor$, i.e., $t \\in[N+m, N+m+1)$, we have that (1) holds, i.e., $x(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{k}(t) x(k)$ for $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$, where $a_{m}(t)=1-\\frac{g(t)}{\\pi}$, and\n\n$$\na_{k}(t)=\\frac{(t-m) \\sin [g(t)(k-m)]}{\\pi(k-m)(k-t)}, \\quad k \\neq m\n$$\n\nThe corresponding series is absolutely convergent for each $t$ and is absolutely convergent uniformly on any bounded interval of $\\mathbf{R}$.\n\nIn particular, formula (5) implies that $a_{k}(k)=1$, and that $a_{k}(l)=0$ for any integers $k$ and $l$ such that $k \\neq l$.\n\nIt can be noted that, under the assumptions of Theorem 2.3, we have that\n\n$$\na_{k}(t)=\\frac{(t-m) g(t) \\operatorname{sinc}[g(t)(k-m)]}{\\pi(k-t)}=\\frac{N \\operatorname{sinc}[g(t)(k-m)]}{k-t}, \\quad k \\neq m\n$$\n\nWe used here that $(t-m) g(t)=\\pi N$.\nTheorem 2.4. If $\\alpha \\in[0,3 / 2)$ in (4), then, for any band-limited signal $x \\in \\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$, for any $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $m=\\lfloor t-N\\rfloor$, we have that (1) holds with\n\n$$\na_{k}(t)=\\frac{\\sin [g(t)(k-m)]}{\\pi(k-m-t)}+\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{g(t)}^{\\pi}[P(t, \\omega) \\cos (-k+m)-Q(t, \\omega) \\sin (-k+m)] d \\omega\n$$\n\nwere\n\n$$\nP(t, \\omega):=p_{3}(t) \\omega^{3}+p_{2}(t) \\omega^{2}+p_{1}(t) \\omega+p_{0}, \\quad Q(t, \\omega):=q_{2}(t) \\omega^{2}+q_{1}(t) \\omega+q_{0}\n$$\n\nand where\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p_{3}(t)=1 / 3, \\quad p_{2}(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}(g(t)+\\pi), \\quad p_{1}(t)=\\pi g(t) \\\\\n& p_{0}(t)=-\\frac{1}{3} g(t)^{3}+\\frac{1}{2}(g(t)+\\pi) g(t)^{2}-\\pi g(t)^{2}+1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& q_{0}(t)=\\frac{\\pi-\\gamma(t)}{\\gamma(t)^{2}-\\pi^{2}-2 g(t)^{2}+2 g(t) \\pi} \\\\\n& q_{1}(t)=1-2 q_{0}(t) g(t), \\quad q_{2}(t)=-q_{0}(t) \\pi^{2}-p_{1}(t) \\pi\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding series is absolutely convergent for each $t \\in \\mathbf{R}$.",

This completes the proof of Theorem 2.3.\n\nProof of Theorem 2.4. We can select $E_{N}$ as in Lemma 4.3 with $d=2$. It is easy to verify directly that the assumptions of Lemma 4.3 are satisfied with this choices. Then the interpolation formula and its absolute convergence for any $t$ follows from Proposition 4.2, Lemma 4.7, and Corollary 4.5. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.4.\n\nRemark 4.8. The integrals in Theorem 2.4 can be calculated explicitly by parts as integrals of polynomials multiplied on $e^{-i \\omega k}$., and $a_{k}$ can be presented explicitly. The resulting formulae will be tremendous, but could streamline calculations. In fact, or any positive $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, one can, similarly to Theorems 2.3-2.4, provide formulas for $a_{k}$.",

The classical Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov interpolation formula (2) is applicable to bounded signals vanishing at $t \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$.

Theorem 2.3 covers unbounded signals with sublinear growth $\\sim|t|^{\\alpha}, \\alpha \\in[0,1 / 2)$. Theorem 2.4 covers unbounded signals with sub-quadratic growth $\\sim|t|^{\\alpha}, \\alpha \\in[0,3 / 2)$.\n2.

For these signals, the classical interpolation formula (2) is not applicable, since its coefficients decay as $\\sim 1 / k$.\n3. The classical Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov interpolation formula (2) allows spectrum bandwidth $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. On the other hand, Proposition 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 require that the spectrum bandwidth of $x$ is $[-\\Omega, \\Omega]$, for $\\Omega \\in(0, \\pi)$. Therefore, the possibility to cover non-decaying unbounded signals is achieved via certain oversampling; this oversampling, however, can be arbitrarily small, since $\\Omega$ can be arbitrarily close to $\\pi$.\n4. The condition that $\\Omega \\in(0, \\pi)$, and that the sampling points are integers, can be removed, as usual, by linear changes of the times scale, i.e., with the replacement of the signal $x(t)$ by signal $x(\\mu t)$, with $\\mu>0$. Clearly, less frequent sampling would require $\\mu>1$, and selection of a larger $\\Omega$ would require $\\mu<1$.\n5. It can be seen that selection of $N$ used for the definition of $g$ in interpolation formula (1)-(5) is non-unique.\n6. Different choices of $\\left.E(\\cdot, \\omega)\\right|_{|\\omega|>\\Omega}$ lead to different versions of the interpolation formula.\n7. We derived explicitly sampling coefficients $a_{k}(t)$ for the case where $\\alpha \\in(0,1 / 2)$. For the general case where $\\alpha>1 / 2$, one has to select more smooth functions $E(\\cdot, \\omega)$. Construction of such functions is straightforward, as is shown in Lemma 4.3(B). It is possible to obtain the corresponding coefficients $a_{k}(t)$ explicitely, similarly to the case where $\\alpha<1 / 2$. In particular, in the setting of Theorem 2.4 for $\\alpha \\in[0,3 / 2)$, this would require calculation of integrals of $\\omega^{k} e^{-i \\omega k}$ for $k=1,2,3$. We leave it for the future research. Alternatively, these $a_{k}(t)$ this can be found via numerical integration; this is how it was done in our numerical examples.\n8. It can be emphasised that the interpolation formulae in Theorems 2.3-2.4 are exact;. Therefore, for a vanishing signal $x \\in L_{2}(\\mathbf{R}) \\cap \\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$, all formulae from Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 give the same value as (2). Similarly, the value is the same when applied for $x \\in \\mathcal{V}(\\rho, \\Omega)$ with $a_{k}$ calculated for $\\Omega_{0} \\in[\\Omega, \\pi)$ instead of $\\Omega$. However, the values for the corresponding finite truncated sums can be different.\n9. It can be shown that Proposition 3.4 still holds for $\\rho(t)=e^{-\\alpha|t|}$ or $\\rho(t)=e^{-\\alpha t^{2}}$ with $\\alpha>0$. However, it does not seem that analogs of Proposition 2.2 or Theorems 2.3-2.4 can\n\nbe obtained in this case. This is because all functions $f \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\rho)$ are analytical for these $\\rho$, and hence if $f_{\\mathbf{R} \\backslash D} \\equiv 0$ then $f \\equiv 0$. This implies that the exponents $e^{i \\cdot t}$ do not feature analytical extension from $(-\\Omega, \\Omega)$ to $\\mathbf{R}$ in the space $\\rho L_{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ with these $\\rho$. Moreover, the concept of the spectral gaps in Definition 2.1 is not applicable here; this definition implies that any set $D \\subset \\mathbf{R}$ with non-empty interior, and such that $D \\neq \\mathbf{R}$, is a spectrum gap for any signal from $\\rho^{-1} L_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R})$ with these $\\rho$.",

  "abstract": "The paper establishes an analog Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov sampling theorem\nfor unbounded non-decaying band-limited signals. An explicit interpolation\nformula is obtained for signals sublinear growth with rate of growth less than\n1/2. At any time, the rate of decay for the $k$th coefficients of this formula\nis $\\sim 1/k^2$. In addition, the paper obtains a method for calculating the\ncoefficients of the interpolation formula applicable to signals with\narbitrarily high rate of polynomial growth.",
