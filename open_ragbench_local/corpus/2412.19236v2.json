The\nwell-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which\nrenders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes\nwhile contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear\npartial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of\nBSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize\ndynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment\nopportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands\nbeing identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.", "updated": "2025-01-08T15:01:14Z", "published": "2024-12-26T14:34:26Z"}
