InTRODUCTION\n\nThere exists a huge literature dealing with dynamics in games and their ability to reach a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). Various impossibility results have been proved, showing that no simple adaptive dynamics can reach a PNE in every game that has one. See, for instance, the papers in the collection by Hart and Mas-Colell (2013) and the more recent articles by Milionis et al. (2023), Hakim et al. (2024), among many others. To determine the actual relevance of these impossibility results, Johnston et al. (2023) considered the class of ordinal games with fixed number of players and fixed action sets for each player and looked at the frequency of games for which adaptive\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ School of Mathematics, and Monash Data Futures Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3800, Australia.\n    ${ }^{2}$ Dipartimento di Economia e Finanza, Luiss University, Viale Romania 32, 00197 Roma, Italy.\n    ${ }^{3}$ Dipartimento di Matematica \"Guido Castelnuovo\", Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Roma, Italy.\n\n    E-mail addresses: andrea.collevecchio@monash.edu, hmimun@luiss.it, matteo.quattropani@uniroma1.it, marco.scarsini@luiss.it.\n\ndynamics fail to converge to a Nash equilibrium even if it exists. They proved that this frequency vanishes as the number of players diverges, provided the number of actions for each player do not grow too fast. Although their results are fully combinatorial, they can be framed within the literature of games with random payoffs. Most papers about games with random payoffs focus on the number of PNE and its distribution. More recently, the attention has shifted to the behavior of adaptive dynamics in games with random payoffs. Our paper can be seen as part of this stream of literature, in the sense that we consider games with random payoffs and we study best response dynamic (BRD) for a class of such games. In particular, we focus on ordinal potential games. It is well known that all games in this class admit PNE and BRD converges to one of these equilibria. The issue we want to study in this paper is to which equilibria is a BRD more likely to converge.\n1.1. Our contribution. In this paper we consider a particular class of two-player normal-form games, called ordinal potential games. These games always admit pure Nash equilibria, and the common learning dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium. In this class of games, all the strategic features of the game are embedded in the potential function, i.e., it is sufficient to know the potential function to pinpoint the pure Nash equilibria of an ordinal potential game. Therefore, if we want to pick an ordinal potential game at random, we can put a suitable probability measure on the space of potentials. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the two players have the same number of actions $K$. We will make the strong assumption that all outcomes in the potential are strictly comparable, i.e., no equivalences are allowed. With this assumption, a random ordinal potential game is equivalent to a random permutation on of the first $K^{2}$ integers.\n\nThe structure of the game implies that, for a given realization of the potential, if we start at a fixed action profile and we perform best response dynamic starting with the first player (i.e., the player choosing the row), then we reach a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to determine the probability of reaching the pure Nash equilibrium with the smallest or second smallest or third smallest potential, etc., when also the starting action profile is chosen uniformly at random. This translates into finding the expected size of the basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium of the game. Solving this problem exactly for a specific choice of $K$ is a quite complicate endeavor. We adopt an asymptotic approach and study the problem as $K \\rightarrow \\infty$. We use a result of Mimun et al. (2024) according to which the fraction of the number of pure Nash equilibria over $K$ converges to $1 / 2$. Based on this, we see that the\n\ndistribution of the rescaled ranking of pure Nash equilibrium found by the best response dynamic converges to an absolutely continuous distribution supported on the interval $[0,1 / 2]$, which we characterize explicitly.\n1.2. Related literature. As mentioned before, most of the initial contributions on random games, starting with Goldman (1957), assumed i.i.d. payoffs with a continuous distribution, and studied the existence of pure Nash equilibria and the distribution of their random number. Two papers proved that, under the above hypotheses, the number of pure Nash equilibria converges in distribution to a Poisson distribution with parameter 1 as either the number of players diverges (Arratia et al., 1989) or the number of actions for each player diverges (Powers, 1990).\n\nRinott and Scarsini (2000) retained the assumption of independence for the random payoff vectors corresponding to different action profiles, but allowed for dependence of payoffs within the same action profile (modeled by an exchangeable multinormal distribution). They proved an interesting phase transition in the correlation coefficient as either the number of players or the number of actions diverges. When correlation is negative, the number of pure Nash equilibria converges to 0 , when the correlation is null, it converges to Poisson(1), when the correlation is positive, it diverges and a central limit theorem holds.\n\nMore recently, several papers started studying the behavior of best response dynamic in games with random payoffs. Amiet et al. (2021b) studied games with many players and two actions for each player. They assumed i.i.d. payoffs, but allowed distributions to have atoms. They proved that the number of pure Nash equilibria diverges exponentially fast in a way that depends on the parameter that corresponds to the size of the atoms. Moreover, they studied the behavior of best response dynamic and proved some phase transitions in the above parameter. To achieve their results, they used some percolation techniques. Their results were recently generalized by Collevecchio et al. (2024). Amiet et al. (2021a) compared the asymptotic behavior of best response dynamic and better response dynamic for two-player random games with i.i.d. payoffs with a continuous distribution. Heinrich et al. (2023) studied the role of the playing sequence in the convergence to equilibrium of best response dynamic. Johnston et al. (2023) studied the model of Amiet et al. (2021b) with no atoms and more than two actions per player, and allow this number to grow, although at a lower rate than the number of players. For an extensive list of contributions on random games, we refer to the papers by Amiet et al. (2021b) and Johnston et al. (2023).\n\nPradelski and Tarbush (2024) introduced the concept of satisficing equilibria, which corresponds to the idea that players play one of their $k$ best pure actions, not necessarily the best. The proved that in almost all games, there exist satisficing equilibria in which all but one player use best response and the remaining player plays at least a second-best action. Various aspects of games with random payoffs were recently studied in Hart et al. (2008), Holroyd et al. (2019), Alon et al. (2021), Wiese and Heinrich (2022), Pei and Takahashi (2023), Flesch et al. (2023), Garnier and Ziliotto (2023), Bhasin et al. (2023), Newton and Sawa (2024), Sep\u00falveda and Ziliotto (2024).\n\nIn a paper that, similarly to ours, focuses on the quality of different equilibria, Canyakmaz et al. (2024) studied techniques that can be used to steer players towards one of several equilibria in a game in some specific class, e.g., coordination games. Their approach does not consider games with random payoffs. Hakim et al. (2024) studied the problem of computing the asymptotic behavior of noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink equilibria of a game. The authors generated games with random utilities to carry out randomized experiments of running noisy replicator dynamics. Kiatsupaibul et al. (2024) studied a variation of fictitious play called Monte Carlo fictitious play (MCFP) and proved that, with the aid of an auxiliary game, it converges to a pure Nash equilibrium in games of common interest.\n\nThe problem of learning equilibria in repeated games with a large number of actions was studied by Chen et al. (2024) in the setting of AI Safety via Debate.\n\nThe idea of ordinal games goes back at least to Fishburn (1978), who used the term \"stochastic dominance games\" to identify them. They were then studied by several authors (see, e.g., Cruz and Simaan, 2000, Bonanno, 2008, Gafarov and Salcedo, 2015). The computational complexity of their equilibria was recently studied by Conitzer (2024). Pieroth and Bichler (2024) proposed a new solution concept, called $\\alpha$-Rank-collections, for games where ordinal preferences are known, but there is uncertainty concerning players' cardinal utilities.\n\nOrdinal potential games were introduced and studied by Monderer and Shapley (1996), and then characterized by Voorneveld and Norde (1997) and Norde and Patrone (2001).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. The game \n\n2.1. Ordinal games. Throughout the paper, for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we let $[n]:=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. We study two-person normal form finite ordinal games where each player $i \\in\\{\\mathrm{~A}, \\mathrm{~B}\\}$ has the same action\n\nset $[K]$ and a preference relation $\\prec_{i}$ over the outcomes of the game. We assume these preferences to be strict, i.e., for all pairs of outcomes $\\Theta, \\Theta^{\\prime}$, either $\\Theta \\prec_{i} \\Theta^{\\prime}$ or $\\Theta^{\\prime} \\prec_{i} \\Theta$.\n\nA strategy profile $\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right)$ is a Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game if, for all $a, b \\in[K]$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(a, b^{*}\\right) \\prec_{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left(a^{*}, b\\right) \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}}\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nA two-person normal form game is called strictly ordinal potential (SOP) if there exists a potential function $\\Psi:[K] \\times[K] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that, for each player $i \\in\\{\\mathrm{~A}, \\mathrm{~B}\\}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Theta(a, b) \\prec_{\\mathrm{A}} \\Theta\\left(a^{\\prime}, b\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow \\Psi(a, b)>\\Psi\\left(a^{\\prime}, b\\right) \\\\\n& \\Theta(a, b) \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}} \\Theta\\left(a, b^{\\prime}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow \\Psi(a, b)>\\Psi\\left(a, b^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo allow us to express asymptotic results in a simple way, the inequality in the potential is reversed with respect to the preference orders: given the action of the other player, an outcome with a lower potential is better than an outcome with a higher potential. For our class of SOP games, w.l.o.g, the potential function can be chosen to be 1-1 with values in $\\left[K^{2}\\right]$. In other words, the outcome whose potential is 1 is the best, the one whose potential is 2 is the second best, etc, all the way to the worst, whose potential is $K^{2}$. The class of 1-1 potentials with values in $\\left[K^{2}\\right]$ will be denoted by $\\mathcal{P}_{K}$. In the sequel we identify the function $\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{P}_{K}$ with the $[K] \\times[K]$ matrix of its values.\n\nTwo SOP games having the same potential are strategically equivalent, i.e., they have the same set of Nash equilibria. Any SOP game is strategically equivalent to a game where $\\prec_{\\mathrm{A}} \\equiv \\prec_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The potential identifies the set of Nash equilibrium of any SOP game. Therefore, we identify the equivalence class of strategically equivalent SOPs with their potential $\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{P}_{K}$. Each NE of a SOP game is a local minimum of its potential. The set of NE of $\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{P}_{K}$ will be denoted by $\\mathrm{NE}_{K}$. Its cardinality $\\left|\\mathrm{NE}_{K}\\right|$ will be denoted by $W_{K}$.

The NE in a SOP can be ordered according to their potential, so that the equilibrium $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{1}$ is the one with the smallest potential, $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{2}$ is the one with the second smallest potential, etc. The ranking of equilibrium $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ is denoted by $\\Lambda(\\boldsymbol{\\eta})$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. RANDOM STRICTLY ORDINAL POTENTIAL GAMES \n\nWe now study random SOP games. To achieve this, for every fixed $K$, we consider a uniform distribution over the set $\\mathcal{P}_{K}$. A simple way to generate a uniform distribution on $\\mathcal{P}_{K}$ is to draw $K^{2}$ i.i.d. random variables with a continuous distribution function (w.l.o.g, a uniform distribution on $[0,1])$ and to consider their rankings, which, with probability 1 , are all different.\n\nA random SOP game has a random number of NE, which is a random variable with values in $[K]$, as each column and raw can contain at most one NE. This random number is positive, since the potential always has a global minimum and cannot be larger than $K$ because the preferences are strict, i.e., the values that the potential can take are all distinct.\n\nIt is easy to compute the average number of NE in a random SOP. Each action profile is a NE with probability $1 /(2 K-1)$ because it is a NE if the value of its potential is larger than all the values on the same row and column. Therefore, the expected number of NE is\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}\\left[W_{K}\\right]=\\frac{K^{2}}{2 K-1}\n$$\n\nThe following concentration result was proved by Mimun et al.

BEST RESPONSE DYNAMIC\n\nThe best response dynamic (BRD) is a learning algorithm taking as input a potential $\\Psi$ and a starting action profile $\\left(a_{0}, b_{0}\\right)$.

When the algorithm visits an action profile for the second time, that profile is a NE. Notice that a BRD never visits a row or column more than twice (once by the row player and once by the column player), so it reaches a PNE in at most $2 K$ steps. For this reason, we will often employ the notation $\\operatorname{BRD}(2 K)$ to denote the action profile in which the BRD will eventually get absorbed in.\n\nOnce a starting point $\\operatorname{BRD}(0)=\\left(a_{0}, b_{0}\\right)$ is chosen, the BRD will reach (deterministically) one NE. For each NE $\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right)$, we define its basin of attraction (BoA) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{BoA}\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right):=\\left\\{(a, b): \\text { if } \\operatorname{BRD}(0)=(a, b), \\text { then } \\operatorname{BRD}(2 K)=\\left(a^{*}, b^{*}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nRemark 4.1.

This is because the very first step of the BRD is along the row.\n\nRemark 4.2. Notice that if the potential $\\Psi^{\\prime}$ is obtained from $\\Psi$ by permuting rows and columns, then the PNE of $\\Psi^{\\prime}$ are just the corresponding permutations of the PNE of $\\Psi$. Moreover, the basin of attractions of the PNE in $\\Psi^{\\prime}$ are obtained by permuting the columns of the corresponding basin of attractions in $\\Psi$.\n\nExample 4.3. We now consider the realization of a SOP and its rearrangement, obtained by permuting rows and columns.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nThe potential on the right is obtained by permuting some rows and columns of the potential on the left. The green numbers in the above matrices indicate the potential equilibria. The numbers above the matrices indicate the potential of the equilibrium to which the column is attracted. The meaning of the other colors will be explained in Remark 5.1 below.\n\nOur goal is to study the BoAs of the different NE. In particular, we will focus on their size. An exact analysis for fixed $K$ is quite cumbersome, but we have some interesting asymptotic results. We remind the reader that $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{i}$ is the equilibrium with the $i$-th highest potential.\n\nTheorem 4.4.

Call this entry $\\left(X_{t+1}, Y_{t+1}\\right) \\in\\left[R_{t}\\right] \\times[K]$.\n(b.i) If $\\left(X_{t+1}, Y_{t+1}\\right) \\notin M_{t}$, then set $C_{t+1}=C_{t}+1$ and $\\Psi\\left(X_{t+1}, C_{t+1}\\right)=t+1$.\n(b.ii) If $\\left(X_{t+1}, Y_{t+1}\\right) \\in M_{t}$, then set $C_{t+1}=C_{t}$ and $\\Psi\\left(X_{t+1}, Y_{t+1}\\right)=t+1$.\n(4) The output of the algorithm will be called $\\Psi$.\n\nIn the incremental construction call $\\Psi^{t}$ the set of all entries added at times $s \\leq t$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{t}:=$ $\\sigma\\left(\\Psi^{t}\\right)$. So $\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\in\\left\\{0, \\ldots, K^{2}\\right\\}}$ is the natural filtration.\n\nRemark 5.1. The potential on the right in Example 4.3 is a possible outcome of an incremental construction. In that example, the incremental construction ends right after having added the entry 21.

Asymptotic analysis of the incremental construction\n### 6.1. $\\varepsilon$-stopped incremental construction.\n\nDefinition 6.1. Fix $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1 / 2)$. An $\\varepsilon$-stopped incremental construction of a potential $\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{P}_{K}$ is obtained as follows: perform the incremental construction of Algorithm 1 up to the stopping time $\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}$ defined as\n\n$$\n\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}:=\\inf \\left\\{t \\geq 0: G_{t}=\\lfloor\\varepsilon K\\rfloor\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAfter $\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}$ continue the construction by placing the remaining integers $\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}+1, \\ldots, K^{2}$ uniformly at random on the remaining empty entries.\n\nNotice that the set of best $\\lfloor\\varepsilon K\\rfloor$ equilibria and the value of their potential are measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}$.\n\nProposition 6.2. Fix $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1 / 2)$.\n(a) The stopping time $\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}{K} \\xrightarrow[K \\rightarrow \\infty]{P} \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{1-2 \\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\n(b) The quantities $R_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}$ and $C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{R_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}}{K}, \\frac{C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}}{K}\\right) \\xrightarrow[K \\rightarrow \\infty]{P}\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-2 \\varepsilon}, 1-\\sqrt{1-2 \\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe proof of Proposition 6.2 requires the introduction of a new process, $\\left(\\widetilde{C}_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$, defined below.\nIn Algorithm 1(b) let $Y_{t+1}$ be sampled as follows: draw a cell at random in the set of rows $\\left\\{1, \\ldots, R_{t}\\right\\}$. If the cell is not empty, draw another cell, and keep drawing until an empty cell is selected. Call $\\mathcal{U}_{t+1}$ a Bernoulli random variable that takes value 1 if no resamples are needed. We have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}\\left(\\mathcal{U}_{t+1}=1\\right)=u_{t+1}=1-\\frac{t}{R_{t} K}\n$$\n\nThe process $\\widetilde{C}_{t}$ is constructed as follows:\n(a) Set $\\widetilde{C}_{0}=0$.\n(b) If $\\Re_{t+1}=1$, then set $\\widetilde{C}_{t+1}-\\widetilde{C}_{t}=C_{t+1}-C_{t}$.\n(c) If $\\Re_{t+1}=0$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{t+1}=1$, then set $\\widetilde{C}_{t+1}-\\widetilde{C}_{t}=C_{t+1}-C_{t}$.\n(d) If $\\Re_{t+1}=0$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{t+1}=0$, then set $\\widetilde{C}_{t+1}=C_{t}$.\n\nCall $D_{t}$ the number of steps where (d) occurs up to time $t$. It follows that, a.s.,\n\n$$\n0 \\leq C_{t}-\\widetilde{C}_{t} \\leq D_{t}\n$$\n\nMoreover,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}\\left(D_{t+1}=D_{t}+1\\right)=\\mathrm{P}\\left(\\Re_{t+1}=0, \\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=0\\right)=\\frac{R_{t} K-t}{K^{2}-t} \\frac{t}{R_{t} K} \\leq \\frac{t}{K^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere the inequality stems from the fact that $R_{t} \\leq K$, which implies $\\left(R_{t} K-t\\right) /\\left(K^{2}-t\\right) \\leq R_{t} K / K^{2}$.\nThe next two results provide a control on the difference between the processes $C_{t}$ and $\\widetilde{C}_{t}$.\nLemma 6.3. Fix $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ and choose $t=\\left\\lfloor K^{1+\\alpha}\\right\\rfloor$. Then\n\n$$\n\\lim _{K \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{P}\\left(D_{t}<6 K^{2 \\alpha}\\right)=1\n$$\n\nProof. Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables $\\left(L_{j}\\right)$ such that $\\mathrm{P}\\left(L_{j}=1\\right)=$ $j / K^{2}$. Then Eq.

The result can be deduced using the so-called Wormald differential equation method (see Wormald, 1995). For simplicity, we adopt here the same formulation as in Warnke (2019, theorem 2), and use the bounds proved therein. With this method, the evolution of the space-time rescaled random process can be uniformly first-order approximated by the solution of an associated Cauchy problem.\n\nThe main requirement is that the expected increment of the original process be controlled by certain function (which plays the role of the derivative in the associated Cauchy problem) up to a vanishingly small error, as we showed in Lemma 6.5.\n\nWe can now prove Proposition 6.2.\nProof of Proposition 6.2. Fix $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1 / 2)$. If we define\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\tau}_{\\varepsilon K}:=\\inf \\left\\{t \\geq 0: \\widetilde{G}_{t}=\\lfloor\\varepsilon K\\rfloor\\right\\}\n$$\n\nthen, by Proposition 6.6, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\bar{\\tau}_{\\varepsilon K}}{K} \\xrightarrow[K \\rightarrow \\infty]{P} \\frac{1}{2} \\log \\left(\\frac{1}{1-2 \\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn light of (6.22), to prove (a) it suffices to show that, for all $t \\leq K^{7 / 6}$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{G}_{t}-G_{t}\\right|}{K} \\xrightarrow[K \\rightarrow \\infty]{P} 0\n$$\n\nNotice that Eq. (6.23) follows by Corollary 6.4 and Eq. (6.12). At this point, the convergence in (b) is a consequence of (a), Proposition 6.6, and Corollary 6.4.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 7. Proofs of the main results \n\nTo help the reader understand the idea behind the proof of Theorem 4.4, we consider an example that illustrates the behavior of a BRD in its first steps.\n\nExample 7.1. We consider the behavior of the incremental construction in a small game. Fig. 2 shows it pictorially. The probability that $\\operatorname{BRD}(\\cdot)$ travels on the exact path shown in Fig. 2 is\n$\\mathrm{P}(\\operatorname{BRD}(t)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}$, for $t=1, \\ldots, 6 \\mid \\operatorname{BRD}(0)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{0})=\\frac{1}{K} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 K-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3 K-2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4 K-4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5 K-6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6 K-9}$\nTo wit, $\\operatorname{BRD}(1)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}$ if $\\Psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}\\right)$ is the smallest in its column, which happens with probability $1 / K$. Given this event, we have that $\\operatorname{BRD}(2)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{2}$ if $\\Psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{2}\\right)$ is the smallest of its row and the\n\npreviously visited column, which happens with probability $1 /(2 K-1)$. Given $\\operatorname{BRD}(1)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}$ and $\\operatorname{BRD}(2)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{2}$, we have that $\\operatorname{BRD}(3)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{3}$ if $\\Psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{3}\\right)$ is the smallest of all previously visited rows column, which happens with probability $1 /(3 K-2)$. Given $\\operatorname{BRD}(i)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$, for all $i \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, we have that $\\operatorname{BRD}(4)=\\boldsymbol{x}_{4}$ if $\\Psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{4}\\right)$ is the smallest of all previously visited rows column, which happens with probability $1 /(4 K-4)$. And so on.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. In this example $\\varepsilon K=4, \\tau_{\\varepsilon K}=6, R_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}=4$ and $C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}=5$. Green dots represent pure Nash equilibrium. When the BRD reaches an action profile on a green dotted line, it reaches the pure Nash equilibrium on the same line. If the BRD reaches an action profile on a blue dotted line, then it reaches the $\\varepsilon K$-th equilibrium. We start the process $\\operatorname{BRD}(\\cdot)$ at $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}=\\left(R_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}+1, C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}+1\\right)=(5,6)$; the profiles $\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}, \\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{6}\\right)$ represent the trajectory of the BRD. The best-response dynamics reaches the row of the $\\varepsilon K$-th equilibrium in 6 steps. Hence it reaches the $\\varepsilon K$-th equilibrium in 7 steps. Strategy profiles on red dotted lines are explored by the best-response dynamics starting at $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}$.\n\nConsider a finite sequence of action profiles $\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\right)_{t=0}^{T}$ such that, $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\\left(C_{t}, R_{t}\\right)$, with $C_{t}=C_{t-1}$ for $t$ odd and $R_{t}=R_{t-1}$ for $t$ even.

First of all, notice that, by construction of the BRD, all the elements in one column belong to the same basin of attraction. In particular, all profiles in columns $1, \\ldots, C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}-1$ will be attracted by equilibria $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{\\ell}$ with $\\ell<\\varepsilon K$. Profiles in column $C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}$ will be attracted by $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{\\varepsilon K}$.\n\nWe now focus on the columns $C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}+1, \\ldots, C_{K}$. Consider the process $\\operatorname{BRD}(\\cdot)$ that starts at the profile $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}=\\left(R_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}+1, C_{\\tau_{\\varepsilon K}}+1\\right)$. The probability that, starting from $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}$, the BRD ends up in the $\\varepsilon K$-th NE is obtained by summing the probability that the BRD arrives in the $\\varepsilon K$-th NE in a given number of steps. Notice that, starting at $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}$, at least two steps are necessary to reach any NE.

If we call $T_{k}$ the time that is needed to collect the $k$-th coupon, then we have\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}\\left[T_{k}\\right]=K\\left(H_{k}-H_{K-k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{k}$ is the $k$-th harmonic number\n\n$$\nH_{k}:=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{i}\n$$\n\nMoreover, for each $k \\in[K]$, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}\\left[T_{k}\\right] \\leq 2 K^{2}\n$$\n\nIf, for some $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1), k=K-K^{\\varepsilon}$, then\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}\\left[T_{k}\\right] \\sim(1-\\varepsilon) K \\log (K)\n$$\n\nand Chebyshev inequality implies that, for all $\\delta>0$\n\n$$\n\\lim _{K \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{P}\\left(\\left|\\frac{T_{k}}{(1-\\varepsilon) K \\log (K)}-1\\right|>\\delta\\right)=0\n$$\n\nNotice that, the probability of having a Nash equilibrium with ranking larger than $t$ is bounded above by the probability that the incremental construction in Algorithm 1 does not stop before time $t$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{P}\\left(\\max \\left\\{C_{\\lfloor(1+\\delta) K \\log K\\rfloor}, R_{\\lfloor(1+\\delta) K \\log K\\rfloor}\\right\\}=K\\right) & \\geq \\mathrm{P}\\left(R_{\\lfloor(1+\\delta) K \\log K\\rfloor}=K\\right) \\\\\n& =\\mathrm{P}\\left(T_{K} \\leq\\lfloor(1+\\delta) K \\log K\\rfloor\\right) \\rightarrow 1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the asymptotic follows by (7.26).

Each game in this class admits at least one\npure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these\npure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure\nNash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.\n  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint\ndistribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic\nexact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium,\nwhen the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.", "updated": "2025-02-10T21:15:12Z", "published": "2024-07-07T18:15:54Z"}
