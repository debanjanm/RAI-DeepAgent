INTRODUCTION\n\nThe homotopy and isotopy classes of closed curves with nonvanishing curvature in Euclidean space $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ have been classified in terms of their self-linking number $[5,12,21]$. In this work we obtain parallel results for curves of constant curvature by an approximation argument.\n\nTo state our main result, let $\\Gamma$ be an interval $[a, b] \\subset \\mathbf{R}$ or the topological circle $\\mathbf{R} /((b-a) \\mathbf{Z})$, and $\\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ be the space of $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ maps $f: \\Gamma \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ with its standard topology induced by the $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$-norm $|\\cdot|_{k}$. We say that $f_{0}, f_{1} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{\\ell \\leq k}$-homotopic if there is a family $f_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{\\ell}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$, for $t \\in[0,1]$, such that $t \\mapsto f_{t}$ is continuous. Then $f_{t}$ is a called a $\\mathcal{C}^{\\ell}$-homotopy. The space of (immersed) curves $\\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ consists of locally injective maps with nonvanishing derivative when $k \\geq 1$. The curvature of $f \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ is given by $\\kappa:=\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right| /\\left|f^{\\prime}\\right|$, where $T:=f^{\\prime} /\\left|f^{\\prime}\\right|$ is the tantrix of $f$.\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n \\geq 3}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy of curves with nonvanishing curvature. Suppose that $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ have constant curvature. Then, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ of curves with constant curvature such that $\\widetilde{f}_{0}=f_{0}, \\widetilde{f}_{1}=f_{1}$, and $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon$. Furthermore, if $f_{t}$ have unit speed, then $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ may be tangent to $f_{t}$ at any finite set of points prescribed in $\\Gamma$.\n\nIn the terminology of Gromov [13] or Eliashberg-Mishachev [4], the result above establishes a parametric $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-dense relative $h$-principle for curves of constant curvature in the space of curves with nonvanishing curvature. The nonparametric version, which states that curves of constant curvature are dense in $\\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ with respect to the $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-norm, had been obtained earlier in [8].\n\nWe say that $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ is closed when $\\Gamma$ is a circle. If closed curves $f_{0}$, $f_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$ with nonvanishing curvature are $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopic through curves with nonvanishing curvature, then their tantrices $T_{0}, T_{1}$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopic.

Furthermore, Rosenberg [21] showed that $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopic if and only if $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}\\left(f_{0}\\right)=\\mathrm{SL}_{2}\\left(f_{1}\\right)$, where $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}$ denotes the self-linking number $\\bmod 2$. Thus Theorem 1.1 yields:\n\nCorollary 1.2. A pair of closed curves $f_{0}, f_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$ of constant curvature are $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopic through $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ curves of constant curvature if and only if $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}\\left(f_{0}\\right)=$ $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}\\left(f_{1}\\right)$.\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Emb}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ denote the space of injective or embedded curves. A pair of curves $f_{0}, f_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$-isotopic if they can be joined by a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$-homotopy $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{k}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$. A knot is an embedded closed curve $f \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{0}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$. Gluck and Pan [12] showed that two knots of nonvanishing curvature $f_{0}, f_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-isotopic through knots of nonvanishing curvature if and only if they are $\\mathcal{C}^{0}$-isotopic and $\\operatorname{SL}\\left(f_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{SL}\\left(f_{1}\\right)$, i.e., they have the same self-linking number. If $f_{t}$ in Theorem 1.1 is an isotopy, then (choosing $\\varepsilon$ sufficiently small) we may assume that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is an isotopy as well. Thus we obtain:\n\nCorollary 1.3. A pair of knots $f_{0}, f_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$ of constant curvature are $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-isotopic through $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ knots of constant curvature if and only if they are $\\mathcal{C}^{0}$-isotopic and $\\operatorname{SL}\\left(f_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{SL}\\left(f_{1}\\right)$.\n\nSo the $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$ homotopy and isotopy classes of closed curves of constant curvature in $\\mathbf{R}^{3}$ mirror those of closed curves with nonvanishing curvature. In other words, a loop of constant curvature is just as flexible as one without inflection points. The self-linking number of a knot $f \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$ with nonvanishing curvature is the linking number of $f$ with a perturbation of $f$ along its principal normal $N:=T / \\kappa$. The self-linking number $\\bmod 2$ of a closed curve $f \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{2}\\left(\\Gamma, \\mathbf{R}^{3}\\right)$ with nonvanishing curvature is the self-linking number $\\bmod 2$ of a perturbation of $f$ to an embedded curve. See $[12,20,21]$ for more background and references on self-linking number.\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1.1 utilizes the fact that, when $\\left|f_{t}^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, the curvature of $f_{t}$ is the speed of its tantrix $T_{t}$. Thus we approximate $T_{t}$ with a homotopy $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ of curves with constant speed, and set $\\widetilde{f}_{t}(s):=\\int_{a}^{s} \\widetilde{T}_{t}(u) d u$. For $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ to be closed when $f_{t}$ is closed, we need to have $\\int_{\\Gamma} \\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\int_{\\Gamma} T_{t}$. To this end, we construct $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ by creating sinusoidal bumps near suitably chosen points along $T_{t}$, via parametric versions of classical theorems of Carath\u00e9odory and Steinitz. The bumps have to be long enough to control $\\int_{\\Gamma} \\widetilde{T}_{t}$, while vanishing sufficiently fast as $t \\rightarrow 0,1$ to ensure that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopy. Implementing this plan is particularly subtle when the convex hull of $T_{0}$ or $T_{1}$ has no interior points, as we will discuss below.\n\nConstructing closed curves of constant curvature, by integrating spherical curves, goes back to Fenchel [6], and belongs to the convex integration theory [4, 7, 13, 25], which includes works by Whitney [29] and Nash-Kuiper [17, 19]. A nonparametric version of the above argument had been developed in [8]; however, the perturbation method there is not suitable for obtaining a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopy of tantrices, and our present construction is fundamentally different. See also [11] for another nonparametric\n\napproach, and $[1,10]$ for some other examples of parametric $h$-principle in Riemannian geometry.\n\nNontrivial $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$ knots of constant curvature were first constructed by Koch and Engelhardt [16] by gluing helical segments. Using the same method, McAtee [18] obtained $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$ knots in every isotopy class. Existence of $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ knots of constant curvature, in every isotopy class, was first established in [8] via convex integration. This approach was also used later by Wasem [27] to obtain an $h$-principle for $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$ curves with prescribed curvature.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Reduction to a Local Problem \n\nWe start by showing that Theorem 1.1 is a consequence of the following result which supplies additional information on the curvature of the desired homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ and can be applied to subintervals in any partition of $\\Gamma$. Let $I:=[a, b[$. It is always assumed that $t \\in[0,1]$ unless specified otherwise.\nTheorem 2.1. Let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n \\geq 3}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy of unit speed curves with nonvanishing curvature $\\kappa_{t}$. Suppose that $\\kappa_{0}$ and $\\kappa_{1}$ are constant. Then for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ of unit speed curves with constant curvature $\\widetilde{\\kappa}_{t}$ such that\n(1) $\\widetilde{f}_{0}=f_{0}$ and $\\widetilde{f}_{1}=f_{1}$,\n(2) $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon$,\n(3) $\\widetilde{f}_{t}=f_{t}$ on $\\partial I$,\n(4) $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(\\widetilde{U}_{t}\\right)=T_{t}\\left(U_{t}\\right)$ for some neighborhoods $\\widetilde{U}_{t}, U_{t}$ of $\\partial I$.\n\nFurthermore, $\\widetilde{\\kappa}_{t}$ may be set equal to any continuous function $c(t)$ such that $c(0)=\\kappa_{0}$, $c(1)=\\kappa_{1}, c(t)>\\max \\left(\\kappa_{t}\\right)$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, and $c(t)$ is sufficiently large on $[\\eta, 1-\\eta]$ where $\\eta>0$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThe last statement in the above theorem means that there exists $\\bar{\\eta}>0$ such that any $0<\\eta \\leq \\bar{\\eta}$ is admissible; and that for every such $\\eta$ there exists a number $\\bar{c}>0$ such that any function $c(t) \\geq \\bar{c}$ on $[\\eta, 1-\\eta]$ is admissible.\n\nSuppose that Theorem 2.1 holds. Then Theorem 1.1 is established as follows. We may identify $\\Gamma$ with $I$ by noting that $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ is closed provided that $f_{t}(a)=f_{t}(b)$ and the derivatives $f_{t}^{(i)}(a)=f_{t}^{(i)}(b)$ for $i \\leq k$. We may also assume that $f_{t}$ in Theorem 1.1 has unit speed. Indeed after replacing $f_{t}$ with the rescalings $\\left|I\\right| f_{t} /$ length $\\left(f_{t}\\right)$, where $|I|=b-a$, we may assume that $f_{t}$ have constant length $|I|$. Then there exists a continuous family of diffeomorphisms $\\theta_{t}: I \\rightarrow I$ such that $f_{t} \\circ \\theta_{t}$ has unit speed. Now if we obtain a homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ with $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t} \\circ \\theta_{t}\\right|_{1}$ sufficiently small, then it is easily seen that $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\circ \\theta_{t}^{-1}-f_{t}\\right|_{1}$ will also be small; see the proof of [8, Prop. 5.4]. Hence $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\circ \\theta_{t}^{-1}$ will be the desired homotopy.\n\nTo find $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$, let $a=: s_{0}<\\cdots<s_{N}:=b$ be any partition of $I$ which includes the points prescribed in $\\Gamma$, and set $I_{i}:=\\left[s_{i}, s_{i+1}\\right]$. Let $f_{t}^{i}$ be the restriction of $f_{t}$ to $I_{i}$, and $c_{i}(t)$ be an admissible curvature function for deforming $f_{t}^{i}$ as described in Theorem 2.1. Then $c(t):=\\sum_{i} c_{i}(t)$ will also be admissible. Applying Theorem 2.1 to $f_{t}^{i}$ with respect to $c(t)$ and $\\varepsilon$, we obtain homotopies $\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}$ such that $\\left|\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right|=1$,\n\n$\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}-f_{t}^{i}\\right|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon$, and $\\widetilde{f_{t}^{i}}$ have uniform constant curvature. Set $\\widetilde{f}_{t}:=\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}$ on $I_{i}$. We only need to check that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$. Then it follows immediately that $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon$ and $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ has constant curvature as desired.\n\nTo see that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$, first note that by item (3) in Theorem 2.1, $\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}=f_{t}^{i}=f_{t}$ on $\\partial I_{i}$. Thus $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{0}$. Furthermore, since $\\left|\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}\\right|=1, \\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}=\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}$. So by item (4) in Theorem 2.1, $\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}=\\left(f_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}=f_{t}^{\\prime}$ on $\\partial I_{i}$, which shows that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$. In particular $\\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{\\prime}$ is well-defined. So it suffices to check that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k-1}$. Note that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is piecewise $\\mathcal{C}^{k-1}$ since $\\left.\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\right|_{I_{i}}=\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}=\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right)^{\\prime}$ and $\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ by Theorem 2.1. Furthermore, by item (4) of Theorem 2.1, if $s_{i}$ lies in the interior of $I$, then there are neighborhoods $U_{i-1}$ and $U_{i}$ of $s_{i}$ in $I_{i-1}$ and $I_{i}$ respectively such that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(U_{i-1}\\right)=T_{t}\\left(U_{i-1}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(U_{i}\\right)=T_{t}\\left(U_{i}\\right)$. Hence $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is reparametrization of $T_{t}$ with constant speed on the neighborhood $U_{i-1} \\cup U_{i}$ of $s_{i} \\in I$. Since $T_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k-1}$, it follows that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k-1}$ near $s_{i}$. So $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{k-1}$ as claimed.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. Approximation with Nonflat Curves \n\nHere we show that homotopies $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ may be perturbed to assume a generic property, which we need in order to establish Theorem 2.1. First we record the following fact, which is a standard application of Thom's jet transversality theorem $[4,14]$.\n\nLemma 3.1. Let $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^{k \\geq 1}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$. Then for any $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\\bar{f} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ such that $|\\bar{f}-f|_{k} \\leq \\varepsilon$ and the first $n$ derivatives of $\\bar{f}$ are linearly independent except possibly at finitely many points of $I$.\n\nProof. Let $J^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)=I \\times \\mathbf{R}^{n(n+1)}$ be the space of the $n$-jets of maps $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$. The $n$-jet $j^{n} f: I \\rightarrow J^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ is given by $j^{n} f(s)=\\left(s, f(s), f^{\\prime}(s), \\ldots, f^{(n)}(s)\\right)$. Let $A \\subset J^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ consist of elements whose last $n$-coordinates are linearly dependent. The set of last $n$ elements of $A$ may be identified with $n \\times n$ matrices of rank less than $n$, which form a stratified space of dimension $n^{2}-1$ [4, p. 16]. So $\\operatorname{dim}(A)=1+n+\\left(n^{2}-1\\right)$ or $\\operatorname{codim}(A)=1$. By the jet transversality theorem, for an open dense set of maps $\\bar{f} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right), j^{n} \\bar{f}$ is transversal to $A$. Since $\\operatorname{dim}(I)=\\operatorname{codim}(A), j^{n} \\bar{f}$ may intersect $A$ only at a discrete set. Finally, since $\\operatorname{Imm}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ is dense in $\\mathcal{C}^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ [14, Thm. 2.12], we may assume that $\\bar{f} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$.\n\nA subset of $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is nonflat if its convex hull has interior points. By abuse of notation, for any mapping $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$, we may write $f$ to refer to $f(I)$, when the meaning is clear from context, e.g., we say $f$ is nonflat, if $f(I)$ is nonflat. Note that if derivatives of $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ are linearly independent up to order $n$, at some point $s \\in I$, then $f$ is nonflat.\nProposition 3.2. Let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n \\geq 3}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$-homotopy with nonvanishing curvature. Then, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ homotopy $\\bar{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ with nonvanishing curvature such that $\\bar{f}_{0}=f_{0}, \\bar{f}_{1}=f_{1},\\left|f_{t}-\\bar{f}_{t}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\varepsilon, \\bar{f}_{t}$ is nonflat for $t \\in(0,1)$, and $\\bar{f}_{t}=f_{t}$ on a neighborhood of $\\partial I$.\n\nProof. For $i \\in \\mathbf{Z}$ choose $t_{i} \\in(0,1)$ with $t_{i}<t_{i+1}$ and $t_{i} \\rightarrow 1$ or 0 as $i \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $-\\infty$ respectively. By Lemma 3.1, there are curves $g_{t_{i}} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ such that every segment of $g_{t_{i}}$ is nonflat, and $\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\rightarrow 0$ as $i \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$. For $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$, set\n\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{(1-\\lambda) t_{i}+\\lambda t_{i+1}}:=(1-\\lambda) g_{t_{i}}+\\lambda g_{t_{i+1}}\n$$\n\nThis defines a homotopy $\\bar{f}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ for $t \\in(0,1)$ with $\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\rightarrow 0$ as $t \\rightarrow 1,0$. So setting $\\bar{f}_{0}:=f_{0}$ and $\\bar{f}_{1}:=f_{1}$ yields a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$-homotopy $\\bar{f}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ for $t \\in[0,1]$.\n\nSince $t \\mapsto\\left|f_{t}\\right|_{k}$ is continuous, by Lemma 3.1 we may choose $t_{i}$ and $g_{t_{i}}$ so that\n\n$$\n\\left|f_{t}-f_{t^{\\prime}}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\delta, \\text { for } t, t^{\\prime} \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right], \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\delta\n$$\n\nfor any given $\\delta>0$. For $t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right]$ we may rewrite (1) as $\\bar{f}_{t}=\\left(1-\\lambda_{t}\\right) g_{t_{i}}+\\lambda_{t} g_{t_{i+1}}$, where $\\lambda_{t} \\in[0,1]$ is the number such that $t=\\left(1-\\lambda_{t}\\right) t_{i}+\\lambda_{t} t_{i+1}$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\leq\\left(1-\\lambda_{t}\\right)\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t}\\right|_{k}+\\lambda_{t}\\left|g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\\\\n\\leq\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|f_{t_{i}}-f_{t}\\right|_{k}+\\left|g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|f_{t_{i+1}}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\leq 4 \\delta\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSo setting $\\delta \\leq \\varepsilon / 4$, we obtain $\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\varepsilon$ as desired. Then choosing $\\varepsilon$ sufficiently small yields that $\\bar{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ and $\\bar{f}_{t}$ has nonvanishing curvature.\n\nTo make $\\bar{f}_{t}$ nonflat, let $\\phi: I \\rightarrow[0,1]$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ step function with $\\phi=0$ near 0 and $\\phi=1$ near 1. Set $\\bar{t}_{i}:=\\left(t_{i}+t_{i+1}\\right) / 2$, and $g_{\\bar{t}_{i}}:=\\phi g_{t_{i}}+(1-\\phi) g_{t_{i+1}}$. Then $g_{\\bar{t}_{i}}$ is nonflat, since it shares a segment with $g_{t_{i}}$. We have\n\n$$\n\\left|g_{\\bar{t}_{i}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k}=\\left|\\phi\\left(g_{t_{i}}-g_{t_{i+1}}\\right)+g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq C\\left|g_{t_{i}}-g_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant which depends only on $|\\phi|_{k}$. Furthermore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|g_{t_{i}}-g_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k} \\leq\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|f_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|f_{t_{i+1}}-g_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k} \\leq 3 \\delta \\\\\n\\left|g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq\\left|g_{t_{i+1}}-f_{t_{i+1}}\\right|_{k}+\\left|f_{t_{i+1}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq 2 \\delta\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nSo $\\left|g_{\\bar{t}_{i}}-f_{\\bar{t}_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq(3 C+2) \\delta$. Set $\\delta \\leq \\varepsilon /(4(3 C+2))$, replace $\\left\\{t_{i}\\right\\}$ by a reindexing of $\\left\\{t_{i}, \\bar{t}_{i}\\right\\}$, and let $\\bar{f}_{t}$ be the corresponding homotopy given by (1). Then $\\left|g_{t_{i}}-f_{t_{i}}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\varepsilon / 4$ by (2), which yields $\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{k} \\leq \\varepsilon$ by (3). Furthermore, $\\bar{f}_{t}$ is now nonflat, since it shares a segment with $g_{t_{i}}$ or $g_{t_{i+1}}$, when $t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right]$. Finally, using a partition of unity on $I$, we may glue $\\bar{f}_{t}$ to $f_{t}$ near $\\partial I$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4.

Let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 1}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-isotopy of nonflat curves of length $\\ell_{t}$, and $x:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ be a continuous map with $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{int} \\operatorname{conv}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$. Suppose that $x(0)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{0}\\right)$ and $x(1)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{1}\\right)$. Then for any $\\varepsilon>0$ and natural number $m$, there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-isotopy $\\widehat{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n+m-1}\\right)$ such that\n(1) $\\widehat{f}_{0}=f_{0}$ and $\\widehat{f}_{1}=f_{1}$,\n(2) $\\widehat{f}_{t} \\subset U_{\\varepsilon}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$,\n(3) $\\underline{\\operatorname{cm}}\\left(\\widehat{f}_{t}\\right)=x(t)$,\n(4) $\\widehat{f}_{t}=f_{t}$ on a neighborhood of $\\partial I$,\n(5) $\\widehat{f}_{t}$ is nonflat in $\\mathbf{R}^{n+m}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$.\n\nFurthermore, we may set length $\\left(\\widehat{f}_{t}\\right)$ equal to any continuous function $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ such that $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{0}=\\ell_{0}, \\widetilde{\\ell}_{1}=\\ell_{1}, \\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}>\\ell_{t}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, and $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ is sufficiently large on $[\\eta, 1-\\eta]$ where $\\eta>0$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThe last statement in the above theorem means that there exists $\\bar{\\eta}>0$ such that any $0<\\eta \\leq \\bar{\\eta}$ is admissible; and that for every such $\\eta$ there exists a number $\\bar{\\ell}>0$ such that any function $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} \\geq \\bar{\\ell}$ on $[\\eta, 1-\\eta]$ is admissible.\n\nTo show that Theorem 2.1 follows from Theorem 4.1, first we record:\nCorollary 4.2. Let $f_{0} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k \\geq 2}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ be a curve with constant positive curvature, and $I_{i}$ be subintervals in a partition of $I$. Then there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\in$ $\\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ with constant curvature such that $\\widetilde{f}_{0}=f_{0}, \\widetilde{f}_{t}=f_{0}$ on $\\partial I, \\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(\\widetilde{U}_{t}\\right)=$ $T_{0}\\left(U_{0}\\right)$ for some neighborhoods $\\widetilde{U}_{t}, U_{0}$ of $\\partial I$, and $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is nonflat on $I_{i}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$.\nProof. We may assume that $\\left|f_{0}^{\\prime}\\right|=1$. Then $\\left|T_{0}^{\\prime}\\right|$ is the curvature of $f_{0}$. So $T_{0}$ has constant speed. Let $T_{t}:=T_{0}, T_{t}^{i}$ be the restriction of $T_{t}$ to $I_{i}$, and set $x_{i}(t):=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{0}^{i}\\right)$. Let $c:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a continuous function such that $c(0)=1, c(t) \\geq 1$, and $c(t)$ is so large outside a small neighborhoods of 0,1 that $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}^{\\prime}:=c(t)\\left|I_{i}\\right|$ forms admissible length functions for deforming $T_{t}^{i}$ as described in Theorem 4.1. Note that if $f_{0}$ is flat, then $T_{0}$ lies in a subsphere of $\\mathbf{S}^{n-1}$, i.e., the intersection of $\\mathbf{S}^{n-1}$ with a subspace of $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$, where it is nonflat. Thus we may apply Theorem 4.1 to $T_{t}^{i}$ with respect to $x_{i}(t)$ and $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}^{i}$ to obtain a homotopy $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$ such that $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ is nonflat in $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}=T_{0}$ on a neighborhood of $\\partial I_{i}, \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{0}^{i}\\right)$, and length $\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=c(t)\\left|I_{i}\\right|$. The last condition allows us to parametrize $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ with constant speed $c(t)$. Define $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ by setting it equal to $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ on each $I_{i}$. Then $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(\\widetilde{U}_{t}\\right)=T_{0}\\left(U_{0}\\right)$ for some open neighborhoods $\\widetilde{U}_{t}$ and $U_{0}$ of $\\partial I$, because we had $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}=T_{0}$ on a neighborhood of $\\partial I_{i}$ before we reparametrized $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ with constant speed. Now set $\\widetilde{f}_{t}(s):=f_{0}(a)+\\int_{a}^{s} \\widetilde{T}_{t}$. Since $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ is nonflat on $I_{i}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, so is $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$. Furthermore, since $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ has constant speed $\\operatorname{ave}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{0}^{i}\\right)$. So $\\int_{I_{i}} \\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\int_{I_{i}} T_{0}$, which yields that $\\int_{I} \\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\int_{I} T_{0}$. Thus $\\widetilde{f}_{t}=f_{0}$ on $\\partial I$, which completes the proof.\n\nThe last observation shows that in Theorem 2.1 we may assume that $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ are nonflat on any given partition $I_{i}$ of $I$. Indeed, by Corollary 4.2, $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopic through curves of constant curvature to a pair of curves, say\n\n$\\bar{f}_{0}$ and $\\bar{f}_{1}$, which are nonflat on $I_{i}$. Concatenating these homotopies with $f_{t}$, we obtain a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy between $\\bar{f}_{0}$ and $\\bar{f}_{1}$ through curves of nonvanishing curvature, which after a perturbation we may assume to be nonflat by Proposition 3.2. Now if Theorem 2.1 holds when $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ are nonflat on $I_{i}$, then $\\bar{f}_{0}$ and $\\bar{f}_{1}$ may be joined by a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy of curves of constant curvature. Concatenating this homotopy with the homotopies between $f_{0}, \\bar{f}_{0}$ and $f_{1}, \\bar{f}_{1}$, we obtain a $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-homotopy between $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ through curves of constant curvature, as desired.\n\nSuppose now that Theorem 4.1 holds. Then we prove Theorem 2.1 as follows. Since $f_{t}$ in Theorem 2.1 has unit speed, $T_{t}=f_{t}^{\\prime}$. So to have $\\left|f_{t}-\\bar{f}_{t}\\right|_{1} \\leq \\varepsilon$ we must have $\\left|T_{t}-\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\right|_{0} \\leq \\varepsilon$. After subdividing $I$ into finitely many subintervals $I_{i}$ we may assume that length $\\left(T_{t}\\left(I_{i}\\right)\\right)<\\varepsilon$. Then $T_{t}\\left(I_{i}\\right)$ is contained in a ball $B$ of radius $\\varepsilon$ centered at its midpoint. Now if $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(I_{i}\\right) \\subset U_{\\varepsilon / 2}\\left(T_{i}\\left(I_{i}\\right)\\right)$, then $\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\left(I_{i}\\right)$ is contained in $B$ as well. So $\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}-T_{t}\\right|_{0} \\leq \\varepsilon$ on $I_{i}$. Furthermore, by Proposition 3.2, we may assume that $f_{t}$ is nonflat on each $I_{i}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, which yields that so is $T_{t}$. As discussed above, we may also assume that $f_{0}$ and $f_{1}$ are nonflat on $I_{i}$ via Corollary 4.2. Then so are $T_{0}$ and $T_{1}$. Hence we may assume that $T_{t}$ is nonflat on $I_{i}$.\n\nSimilar to the proof of Corollary 4.2, let $T_{t}^{i}$ be the restriction of $T_{t}$ to $I_{i}$. We may apply Theorem 4.1 to $T_{t}^{i}$ with respect to $x_{i}(t):=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{t}^{i}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}^{i}=c(t)\\left|I_{i}\\right|$ to obtain the homotopy $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ with $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{t}^{i}\\right)$ and length $\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=c(t)\\left|I_{i}\\right|$. So we may assume that $\\widetilde{T}_{i}$ has constant speed $c(t)$, and define $\\widetilde{T}_{t}$ on $I$ by setting it equal to $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ on $I_{i}$. Next we set $\\widetilde{f}_{t}(s):=f_{t}(a)+\\int_{a}^{s} \\widetilde{T}_{t}$. Then $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{i}\\right|=\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}\\right|=1$. So $\\widetilde{\\kappa}_{t}=\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right|=c(t)$ as desired. Furthermore, since $\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}$ has constant speed, $\\operatorname{ave}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{T}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{ave}\\left(T_{t}^{i}\\right)$. So $\\int_{I_{i}} \\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\int_{I_{i}} T_{t}$, which yields that $\\int_{I} \\widetilde{T}_{t}=\\int_{I} T_{t}$. Thus $\\widetilde{f}_{t}=f_{t}$ on $\\partial I$. Next note that $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}(s)-f_{t}(s)\\right| \\leq \\int_{a}^{s}\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}-T_{t}\\right| \\leq \\int_{I}\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}-T_{t}\\right|=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{I_{i}}\\left|\\widetilde{T}_{t}-T_{t}\\right| \\leq N \\varepsilon|I|$. Thus $\\left|f_{t}-\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right|_{0} \\leq N \\varepsilon|I|$. We also have $\\left|f_{t}^{\\prime}-\\widetilde{f}_{t}^{\\prime}\\right|_{0}=\\left|T_{t}(u)-\\widetilde{T}_{t}(u)\\right|_{0} \\leq \\varepsilon$. Hence $\\left|f_{t}-\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right|_{1}$ can be made arbitrarily small.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. Perturbation of Geodesics \n\nHere we prove a very special case of Theorem 4.1 by an explicit elementary argument. A curve $f \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$ is a geodesic if it has constant speed and lies in a plane through the origin of $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$.\n\nLemma 5.1. For $t \\in(0,1]$, let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-isotopy of geodesics of length $\\ell_{t}$. Then, for any continuous family of constants $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} \\succ \\ell_{t}$ and $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-isotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{\\infty}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$ such that $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\subset U_{\\varepsilon}\\left(f_{t}\\right), \\widetilde{f}_{t}=f_{t}$ on a neighborhood of $\\partial I$, length $\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}, \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$, and $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is nonflat. Furthermore if $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} / \\ell_{t} \\rightarrow 1$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nProof. We may assume that $I=[-1,1]$. After composing $f_{t}$ with a family of rotations we may also assume that $f_{t}$ lies in the plane of the first two coordinates, and $f_{t}(0)=p:=(1,0, \\ldots, 0)$. So $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)=\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)\\right| p$. Let $e_{n}$ be the standard basis of $\\mathbf{R}^{n}$. We construct $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ through a sequence of $n-2$ perturbations of $f_{t}$ in the directions\n\n$e_{3}, \\ldots, e_{n}$ which increase the length by $\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right) /(n-2)$ at each step, and preserve $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$. This is achieved using the $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ bump function $\\beta_{t}: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ given by\n\n$$\n\\beta_{t}(s):=\\lambda_{t} \\exp \\left(\\frac{-1}{\\rho_{t}^{2}-s^{2}}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\omega_{t} s\\right)\n$$\n\nif $-\\rho_{t} \\leq s \\leq \\rho_{t}$, and 0 otherwise. Set $\\lambda_{t}:=\\min \\left\\{\\left|\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right|, \\varepsilon / 4\\right\\}$, and $\\rho_{t}:=\\min \\left\\{m_{t}, 1-\\right.$ $\\left.m_{t}\\right\\}$ for $m_{t} \\in(0,1)$. So $\\beta_{t}$ depends only on $m_{t}$ and $\\omega_{t}$, which control its location and length respectively. For $s \\in[0,1]$ and appropriate values of $m_{t}$ and $\\omega_{t}$ specified below, we define\n\n$$\nf_{t}^{1}(s):=\\frac{f_{t}(s)+\\beta_{t}\\left(s-m_{t}\\right) e_{3}}{\\left|f_{t}(s)+\\beta_{t}\\left(s-m_{t}\\right) e_{3}\\right|}\n$$\n\nif $m_{t}-\\rho_{t} \\leq s \\leq m_{t}+\\rho_{t}$, and we set $f_{t}^{1}(s):=f_{t}(s)$ otherwise. Then we extend $f_{t}^{1}$ to $[-1,1]$ by letting $f_{t}^{1}(-s)$ be the reflection $f_{t}^{1}(s)$ in $\\mathbf{S}^{n-1}$ with respect to $p$. See Figure 1. Since $f_{t}^{1}$ is symmetric with respect to $p, \\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)=\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)\\right| p$. Furthermore\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1.\nthere exists a unique $\\omega_{t} \\geq 0$ for each $m_{t}$ such that length $\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)=\\ell_{t}+\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right) /(n-2)$, since the length of (the graph of) $\\beta_{t}$ increases monotonically with $\\omega_{t}$. Finally note that if $m_{t}$ is close to 0 , then the bumps are close to $p$, so $\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)\\right| \\geq\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)\\right|$ and when $m_{t}$ is close to 1 then the bumps are away from $p$ so $\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)\\right|$. It follows that there exists a unique choice for $m_{t}$ such that $\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}^{1}\\right)\\right|=\\left|\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)\\right|$. So we have specified a unique choice for $f_{t}^{1}$. Since the parameters $\\ell_{t}, \\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}, \\lambda_{t}, \\omega_{t}, m_{t}$, and $\\rho_{t}$ all depend continuously on $t, t \\mapsto\\left|f_{t}^{1}\\right|_{1}$ is continuous. Similarly, this procedure can be continued, for $2 \\leq i \\leq n-2$, by setting, for $s \\in[0,1]$,\n\n$$\nf_{t}^{i}(s):=\\frac{f_{t}^{i-1}(s)+\\beta_{t}\\left(s-m_{t}\\right) e_{i+2}}{\\left|f_{t}^{i-1}(s)+\\beta_{t}\\left(s-m_{t}\\right) e_{i+2}\\right|}\n$$\n\nif $m_{t}-\\rho_{t} \\leq s \\leq m_{t}+\\rho_{t}$, and $f_{t}^{i}(s):=f_{t}^{i-1}(s)$ otherwise, with appropriate values of $m_{t}$ and $\\omega_{t}$ at each step, as described above. Then $\\widetilde{f}_{t}:=f_{t}^{n-2}$ is the desired homotopy. Finally suppose that $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} / \\ell_{t} \\rightarrow 1$. We want to show that then $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$. To this end note that after composing $f_{t}$ and $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ with local homotheties in $\\mathbf{S}^{n-1}$ centered at $p$, we may assume that $\\ell_{t}$ is constant.

{"section_id": 6, "text": "# 6. Parametric Carath\u00e9odory and Steinitz Theorems \n\nHere we prove one-parameter versions of some classical results in convex geometry needed to establish Theorem 4.1. Steinitz [26] [22, Thm. 1.3.10] showed that any point in the interior of the convex hull of a set $X \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ lies in the interior of the convex hull of at most $2 n$ points of $X$. We need the following analogue of that result. We say that a family of sets $S_{t}=\\left\\{s_{1}(t), \\ldots, s_{N}(t)\\right\\} \\subset I$ is continuous if $s_{i}(t)$ is continuous.\nLemma 6.1. Let $f_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Emb}^{0}\\left(I, \\mathbf{R}^{n \\geq 3}\\right)$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{0}$-homotopy, and $x:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ be a continuous map with $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{int} \\operatorname{conv}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$. Then there exists a continuous family $S_{t} \\subset I$ of sets of $4 n$ distinct points such that $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{intconv}\\left(f_{t}\\left(S_{t}\\right)\\right)$.\nProof. By Steinitz theorem, for each $t \\in[0,1]$ there is a collection $S_{t} \\subset I$ of $2 n$ distinct points such that $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{intconv}\\left(f_{t}\\left(S_{t_{0}}\\right)\\right)$. By continuity of $t \\mapsto f_{t}$, for each $t_{0} \\in[0,1]$ we have $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{intconv}\\left(f_{t}\\left(S_{t_{0}}\\right)\\right)$ for $t$ close to $t_{0}$. By Lebesgue number lemma, there exists a partition $0=t_{0}<\\cdots<t_{\\ell}=1$ of $[0,1]$ such that $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{intconv}\\left(f_{t}\\left(S_{t_{i}}\\right)\\right)$ for $t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right]$. Let $S_{t}^{o}$ be a continuous selection of $2 n$ points such that $S_{t}^{o}=S_{t_{i}}$ whenever $t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right]$ and $i$ is even. Similarly let $S_{t}^{o}$ be a continuous selections of $2 n$ points such that $S_{t}^{o}=S_{t_{i}}$ whenever $t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right]$ and $i$ is odd. Then $S_{t}:=S^{o}(t) \\cup S^{o}(t)$ gives a continuous selection of $4 n$ points which contain $x(t)$ within the interior of their convex hull; however, $S_{t}$ may contain fewer than $4 n$ points.\n\nTo complete the proof it remains to show that there is a continuous selection of $4 n$ distinct points of $I$ arbitrarily close to $S_{t}$ with respect to Hausdorff distance between subsets of $I$. Note that $S_{t}$ may be viewed as a continuous mapping $[0,1] \\rightarrow I^{4 n} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{4 n}$. We need to find a continuous map $\\widetilde{S}_{t}:[0,1] \\rightarrow I^{4 n}$, which is arbitrarily close to $S_{t}$ as a subset of $I$, and such that $\\widetilde{S}_{t}$ does not intersect any of the hyperplanes $H_{i j}$ where the $i^{\\text {th }}$ and $j^{\\text {th }}$ coordinates of $\\mathbf{R}^{4 n}$ are equal, for $1 \\leq i<j \\leq 4 n$. Let $H_{i j}^{ \\pm}$be the closed half-spaces determined by $H_{i j}$. If any segment of $S_{t}$ lies in $H_{i j}^{-}$, we may reflect that with respect to $H_{i j}$ to obtain a mapping $\\widetilde{S}_{t}$ which is contained in $H_{i j}^{+}$ (in other words, whenever two points of $S_{t}$ cross each other, then we switch their indices). So $\\widetilde{S}_{t}$ and $S_{t}$ coincide as subsets of $I$. Finally, we may perturb $\\widetilde{S}_{t}$ so that it lies in the interior of $H_{i j}^{+}$which yields the desired mapping $\\widetilde{S}_{t}$.\n\nCarath\u00e9odory's theorem [2] [22, Thm. 1.1.4] states that any point $x$ in the convex hull of a set $X \\subset \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ is a convex combination of at most $n+1$ points $p_{i}$ of $X$, i.e., there exist constants $a_{i}>0$ with $\\sum_{i} a_{i}=1$ such that $x=\\sum_{i} a_{i} p_{i}$. We need the following continuous version of Carath\u00e9odory's theorem:\nLemma 6.2. Let $p_{i}:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}, i=1, \\ldots, N$, be $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ maps. Suppose there exists a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ map $x:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ such that $x(t) \\in \\operatorname{intconv}\\left(\\left\\{p_{i}(t)\\right\\}\\right)$. Then there are $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ functions $a_{i}(t)$ such that $a_{i}>0, \\sum_{i} a_{i}(t)=1$, and $\\sum_{i} a_{i}(t) p_{i}(t)=x(t)$.\nProof. We may assume that $x(t)=0$ after replacing $p_{i}(t)$ with $p_{i}(t)-x(t)$. Then we need to find functions $a_{i}(t)$, such that $P(t) a(t)=0$, where $P(t)$ is the $n \\times N$ matrix with columns $p_{i}(t)$, and $a(t)$ is the vector with components $a_{i}(t)$. So $a(t) \\in \\operatorname{ker}(P(t))$. By Carath\u00e9odory's theorem, there are coefficients $a^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right):=\\left(a_{1}^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right), \\ldots, a_{N}^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right)\\right)$\n\nfulfilling these properties at any given point $t_{0} \\in(0,1)$. We may assume that $a_{i}^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right)>0$ since 0 lies in the interior of the convex hull. Note that $P(t)$ has constant rank $n$, since int $\\operatorname{conv}\\left(\\left\\{p_{i}(t)\\right\\}\\right) \\neq \\emptyset$. So $\\operatorname{ker}(P(t))$ has dimension $N-n$. Since $p_{i}(t)$ are $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$, we may choose a $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$ family of orthonormal bases $e_{j}(t)$ for $\\operatorname{ker}(P(t))$ near $t_{0}$, by a theorem of Dole\u017eal $[3,23,28]$. Then the projection $a^{0}(t):=\\sum\\left\\langle a^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right), e_{j}(t)\\right\\rangle$ of $a^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ into $\\operatorname{ker}(P(t))$ will be $\\mathcal{C}^{k}$. Furthermore, since $a_{i}^{0}\\left(t_{0}\\right)>0$, we have $a_{i}^{0}(t)>0$ for $t$ near $t_{0}$. So the desired coefficients can be found locally. Thus we may cover $[0,1]$ by a finite number of open subsets where the desired coefficients exist and glue them together via a partition of unity.\n\nNote 6.3. If $p_{i}(t)$ in the last result were constant, then the conclusion would follow immediately from a theorem of Kalman [15] who established existence of continuous barycentric coordinates inside convex polytopes.\n\nNote 6.4. Lemma 6.1 does not hold, for any finite number of points, if we require that $x(t)$ lie only in the relative interior of $\\operatorname{conv}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$, i.e., allow $f_{t}$ to be flat [9].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 7.

The proof proceeds in four stages: (I) we define a certain point $\\bar{x}(t)$ associated to $x(t)$, and select points $p_{i}(t)$ of $f_{t}$ which contain $\\bar{x}(t)$ within their convex hull; (II) we perturb $f_{t}$ to a curve $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ which contains geodesic segments $\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}$ near $p_{i}(t)$, see Figure 2 ; (III) we perturb $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ to the desired homotopy $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ by replacing $\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}$ with longer curves $\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}$ via Lemma 5.1; (IV) we verify that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopy.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2.\n(I) By the triangle inequality, we may assume that $f_{t}=f_{0}$ for $t \\in[0, \\eta]$, and $f_{t}=f_{1}$ for $t \\in[1-\\eta, 1]$ if $\\eta>0$ is sufficiently small. Accordingly, we set $x(t)=x(0)$ for $t \\in[0, \\eta]$ and $x(t)=x(1)$ for $t \\in[1-\\eta, 1]$. So $x(t)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$ for $t \\in[0, \\eta] \\cup[1-\\eta, 1]$. Define $\\bar{x}:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{n}$ by setting $\\bar{x}(0):=x(0), \\bar{x}(1):=x(1)$, and\n\n$$\n\\bar{x}(t):=\\frac{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} x(t)-\\ell_{t} \\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)}{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}}\n$$\n\nfor $t \\in(0,1)$. Since $x(t)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$ near 0 and $1, \\bar{x}$ is continuous. Next note that as $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ grows large, $\\bar{x}(t) \\rightarrow x(t)$. So choosing $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ sufficiently large on $[\\eta, 1-\\eta]$, we can make sure that $\\bar{x}(t) \\in \\operatorname{int} \\operatorname{conv}\\left(f_{t}\\right)$. Now, by lemma 6.1, we may continuously choose $4 n$ distinct points $s_{i}(t) \\in \\operatorname{int}(I)$ such that if $p_{i}(t):=f_{t}\\left(s_{i}(t)\\right)$ then $\\bar{x}(t) \\in \\operatorname{int} \\operatorname{conv}\\left\\{p_{i}(t)\\right\\}$.\n\nThus, by Lemma 6.2, there are continuous functions $a_{i}(t)>0$ with $\\sum a_{i}(t)=1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sum a_{i}(t) p_{i}(t)=\\bar{x}(t)\n$$\n\nWe assume that all sums range over $i=1, \\ldots, 4 n$.\n(II) Let $\\delta:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a continuous function with $\\delta(t)>0$ for $t \\in(0,1)$ and $\\delta(0)=0=\\delta(1)$. We may assume that $\\max (\\delta)$ is smaller than the smallest distance in $f_{t}$ between the points $p_{i}(t), f_{t}(a), f_{t}(b)$. Then there exist points $r_{i}(t), q_{i}(t)$ in $f_{t}$ which are at distance $\\delta(t)$ from $p_{i}(t)$, as measured in $f_{t}$, and lie on different sides of $p_{i}(t)$ when $\\delta(t)>0$. Let $\\widehat{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}$ be the segment of $f_{t}$ between $r_{i}(t)$ and $q_{i}(t)$. So\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widehat{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right|=2 \\delta(t)\n$$\n\nReplacing $\\widehat{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}$ with the geodesic segment $r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)$ in $\\mathbf{S}^{n-1}$, and reparametrizing with constant speed, yields a $\\mathcal{C}^{0}$-homotopy $\\widehat{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{0}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n}\\right)$. Since $f_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$, $\\left|\\widehat{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right| /\\left|r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)\\right| \\rightarrow 1$ as $\\delta(t) \\rightarrow 0$. Thus, if $\\max (\\delta)$ is sufficiently small, we can make sure that $\\left|r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)\\right|>\\delta(t)$. Let $\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}$ be the subsegment of $r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)$ of length $\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|=a_{i}(t) \\delta(t)$ centered at the midpoint of $r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)$. So $\\bar{g}_{0}^{i}=p_{i}(0)$. If we set $\\bar{g}_{t}:=\\cup_{i} \\bar{g}_{t}^{i}$, then we may record that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|=\\delta(t), \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|=a_{i}(t)\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|\n$$\n\nFurthermore, we set\n\n$$\n\\bar{p}_{i}(t):=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext we smoothen $\\widehat{f}_{t}$ by rounding off its corners at $r_{i}(t)$ and $q_{i}(t)$ as follows. Let $I^{\\prime} \\subset \\operatorname{int}(I)$ be a subsegment so large that $\\widehat{f}_{t}\\left(I^{\\prime}\\right)$ contains all segments $r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)$, $\\phi: I \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ (bump) function such that $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq 1, \\phi>0$ on $I^{\\prime}$ and $\\phi=0$ near $\\partial I$, and $\\theta_{t}: \\mathbf{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be a continuous family of symmetric $\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ functions with $\\theta_{t} \\geq 0, \\int_{I} \\theta_{t}(s) d s=1$ and compact support $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)$. Now define\n\n$$\n\\bar{f}_{t}:=\\frac{\\phi\\left(\\widehat{f}_{t} * \\theta_{t}\\right)+(1-\\phi) \\widehat{f}_{t}}{\\left|\\phi\\left(\\widehat{f}_{t} * \\theta_{t}\\right)+(1-\\phi) \\widehat{f}_{t}\\right|}\n$$\n\nThen $\\bar{f}_{t} \\in \\operatorname{Imm}^{k}\\left(I, \\mathbf{S}^{n-1}\\right)$, and assuming $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)$ is sufficiently small, we have $\\bar{g}_{t}^{i} \\subset \\bar{f}_{t}$. Since $\\left|\\widehat{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{0} \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\delta(t) \\rightarrow 0,1,\\left|\\widehat{f}_{t} * \\theta_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, which in turn yields that $\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{t}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\delta(t) \\rightarrow 0,1$. Furthermore, if we set $\\bar{\\ell}_{t}:=\\operatorname{length}\\left(\\bar{f}_{t}\\right)$ and $\\bar{\\ell}_{t}:=\\operatorname{length}\\left(\\widehat{f}_{t}\\right)$, then $\\bar{\\ell}_{t} \\rightarrow \\bar{\\ell}_{t}$ as $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$. So assuming $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)$ is sufficiently small, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\bar{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right| \\leq 2\\left|\\bar{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right|=2 \\sum\\left(\\left|\\widehat{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right|-\\left|r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\n(III) Now we construct the desired homotopy $\\widehat{f}_{t}$ by applying Lemma 5.1 to deform each segment $\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}$ of $\\bar{f}_{t}$ to a canonical curve $\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}$ with appropriate length $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|$ so that $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=x(t)$ and length $\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=\\bar{\\ell}_{t}$. Set $\\widetilde{g}_{t}:=\\cup_{i} \\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}$. Then $\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\backslash \\widetilde{g}_{t}=\\bar{f}_{t} \\backslash \\bar{g}_{t}$, which yields\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|=\\bar{\\ell}_{t}-\\bar{\\ell}_{t}+\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|\n$$\n\nSince $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ can be made arbitrarily close to $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}$ which is smaller than $\\ell_{t}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, we may assume that $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}<\\ell_{t}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$ by choosing $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right)$ sufficiently small, which yields that $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|>\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|$ for $t \\in(0,1)$. So, by Lemma 5.1, we may require that $\\widetilde{g}_{t}$ and consequently $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ be nonflat in $\\mathbf{S}^{n+m-1}$ for $t \\in(0,1)$, as desired. Next note that, by Lemma 5.1, $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right)=\\bar{p}_{i}(t)$. Thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right) & =\\sum \\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|}{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}} \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right)+\\frac{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|}{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}} \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t} \\backslash \\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum \\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|}{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}} \\bar{p}_{i}(t)+\\frac{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|}{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}} \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\bar{f}_{t} \\backslash \\bar{g}_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSetting the last expression above equal to $x(t)$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum \\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|}{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|} \\bar{p}_{i}(t)=\\frac{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t} x(t)-\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|\\right) \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\bar{f}_{t} \\backslash \\bar{g}_{t}\\right)}{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|}\n$$\n\nfor $t \\in(0,1)$. Thus $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=x(t)$ provided that we find values for $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|$ so that (5) holds. Note that, as $\\delta(t) \\rightarrow 0, \\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\bar{f}_{t} \\backslash \\bar{g}_{t}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{cm}\\left(f_{t}\\right), \\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right| \\rightarrow \\ell_{t}$, and $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right| \\rightarrow \\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}$. So the right hand side of (5) which we call $\\widetilde{x}(t)$ converges to $\\bar{x}(t)$, and thus lies in int conv $\\left\\{p_{i}(t)\\right\\}$ if $\\max (\\delta)$ is sufficiently small. On the other hand $\\bar{p}_{i}(t) \\rightarrow p_{i}(t)$. So assuming $\\max (\\delta)$ is sufficiently small, we have\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{x}(t) \\in \\operatorname{int} \\operatorname{conv}\\left\\{\\bar{p}_{i}(t)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor $t \\in(0,1)$. If we set $\\widetilde{x}(0):=x(0), \\widetilde{x}(1):=x(1)$, then $\\widetilde{x}$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, and the above inclusion still holds at $t=0,1$, since $\\bar{p}_{i}(0)=\\bar{g}_{0}^{i}=p_{i}(0)$ and $\\bar{p}_{i}(1)=\\bar{g}_{1}^{i}=p_{i}(1)$ by definition. Thus, by Lemma 6.2, there are continuous functions $\\widetilde{a}_{i}(t)>0$ with $\\sum \\widetilde{a}_{i}(t)=1$ such that $\\sum \\widetilde{a}_{i}(t) \\bar{p}_{i}(t)=\\widetilde{x}(t)$. Hence if we set\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|:=\\widetilde{a}_{i}(t)\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|\n$$\n\nthen (5) holds and we obtain $\\operatorname{cm}\\left(\\widetilde{f}_{t}\\right)=x(t)$ as desired.\n(IV) It remains to check that $\\widetilde{f}_{t}$ is a $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$-homotopy, i.e., $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{0}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$ as $t \\rightarrow 0$. To this end note that $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-f_{0}\\right|_{1} \\leq\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-\\bar{f}_{t}\\right|_{1}+\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{0}\\right|_{1}$ and $\\left|\\bar{f}_{t}-f_{0}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$ as we discussed in Part II above. So we just need to show that $\\left|\\widetilde{f}_{t}-\\bar{f}_{t}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$, which is the case provided that $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}-g_{t}^{i}\\right|_{1} \\rightarrow 0$. Thus, by Lemma 5.1, it suffices to check that $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right| /\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right| \\rightarrow 1$, as $t \\rightarrow 0,1$. Note that, for $t \\in(0,1)$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|}{\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}^{i}\\right|}=\\frac{\\widetilde{a}_{i}(t)\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right|}{a_{i}(t)\\left|\\bar{g}_{t}\\right|}=\\frac{\\widetilde{a}_{i}(t)}{a_{i}(t)}\\left(\\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}\\right|}{\\delta(t)}+1\\right)\n$$\n\nFurthermore, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}}{\\delta(t)} \\leq \\frac{\\left|\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right|}{\\delta(t)}+\\frac{\\left|\\ell_{t}-\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}\\right|}{\\delta(t)}\n$$\n\nWe can make sure that $\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right) / \\delta(t)$ vanishes as $t \\rightarrow 0,1$, by setting $\\delta(t) \\geq\\left(\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}-\\ell_{t}\\right)^{1 / 2}$ for $t$ close to 0,1 . This is possible since $\\widetilde{\\ell}_{0}=\\ell_{0}, \\widetilde{\\ell}_{1}=\\ell_{1}$, and all other constraints\n\nfor $\\delta(t)$ mentioned above where positive upper bounds for $\\max (\\delta)$. Next note that by (4),\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\ell_{t}-\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}}{\\delta(t)}=2 \\frac{\\ell_{t}-\\widetilde{\\ell}_{t}}{\\left|\\overline{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right|} \\leq 4 \\sum\\left(1-\\frac{\\left|r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)\\right|}{\\left|\\overline{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right|}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\delta(0)=0=\\delta(1),\\left|\\overline{r_{i}(t) q_{i}(t)}\\right| \\rightarrow 0$ as $t \\rightarrow 0,1$. Thus, since $f_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$, the right hand side of the last expression above vanishes as $t \\rightarrow 0,1$. Hence $\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right| /\\left|\\widetilde{g}_{t}\\right| \\rightarrow 1$. Now it suffices to note that $\\widetilde{a}_{i}\\left(t_{0}\\right)=a_{i}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$, for $t_{0}=0,1$. Indeed by definition $\\widetilde{a}_{i}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ are barycentric coordinates of $\\widetilde{x}\\left(t_{0}\\right)=x\\left(t_{0}\\right)=\\bar{x}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$, with respect to $p_{i}\\left(t_{0}\\right)$.
