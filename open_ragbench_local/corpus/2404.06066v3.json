The chromatic number $\\chi(S)$ of a block design $S$ is the smallest integer $\\delta$ such that $S$ has a weak $\\delta$-colouring. It has previously been shown that any Steiner triple system has chromatic number at least 3 and that for each $v \\equiv 1$ or $3(\\bmod 6)$ there exists a Steiner triple system on $v$ points that has chromatic number 3. Moreover, for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$ there exist infinitely many Steiner triple systems with chromatic number $\\delta$.\n\nWe consider colourings of the subclass of Steiner triple systems which are resolvable. A Kirkman triple system consists of a resolvable Steiner triple system together with a partition of its blocks into parallel classes. We show that for each $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$ there exists a Kirkman triple system on $v$ points with chromatic number 3. We also show that for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with chromatic number $\\delta$. We close with several open problems.\n\n\nKeywords: Triple systems, Kirkman triple systems, Colourings of designs, Weak colouring\n\nMSC 2020: 05B07, 05B30, 05C15", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nA $(v, k, \\lambda)$-BIBD (balanced incomplete block design) is a pair $(V, \\mathcal{B})$ such that $V$ is a set of $v$ elements (called points) and $\\mathcal{B}$ is a collection of $k$-element subsets of $V$ (called blocks) such\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New Brunswick, Saint John, NB, E2L 4L5, Canada. andrea.burgess@unb.ca\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ Department of Mathematics, The University of Waikato, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand. nicholas.cavenagh@waikato.ac.nz\n    $\\ddagger$ Department of Mathematics, Toronto Metropolitan University, Toronto, ON, M5B 2K3, Canada. danziger@torontomu.ca\n    \u00a7Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, A1C 5S7, Canada. dapike@mun.ca\n\nthat each unordered pair of points in $V$ is contained in exactly $\\lambda$ blocks in $\\mathcal{B}$. When $k=3$, the blocks of $\\mathcal{B}$ are often called triples. A $(v, 3, \\lambda)$-BIBD is also known as a Steiner triple system or $\\operatorname{STS}(v)$ if $\\lambda=1$. It is well known that an $\\operatorname{STS}(v)$ exists if and only if $v \\equiv 1$ or 3 $(\\bmod 6)$ [22]; such integers $v$ are the admissible orders for Steiner triple systems.\n\nLet $S=(V, \\mathcal{B})$ be a $(v, k, \\lambda)$-BIBD. A colouring of $S$ is any mapping $\\phi$ from $V$ to a colour set $C$. If $|C|=\\delta$ we say that $\\phi$ is a $\\delta$-colouring. Given any $\\delta$-colouring $\\phi: V \\rightarrow C$ and point $x \\in V$, if $\\phi(x)=c$, then we say that $x$ has colour $c$. The colour class of $c \\in C$ is the set of points of colour $c$, i.e. $\\phi^{-1}(c)=\\{x \\in V \\mid \\phi(x)=c\\}$. If $\\phi$ is surjective, then the colour classes partition the point set $V$. The colour type associated with a colouring corresponds to a multiset of integers which give the sizes of the colour classes. We employ partition notation to denote the colour type; e.g. the type $\\{3,3,3,4\\}$ may be described as $3^{3} 4^{1}$. If the elements of the colour type differ by at most one, we say that the colouring is equitable.\n\nA block $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$ is said to be monochromatic if each point of the block $B$ is mapped to the same colour. We say that $\\phi$ is a weak colouring of a design if there are no monochromatic blocks. The weak chromatic number $\\chi(S)$ is the smallest $\\delta$ such that the design $S$ has a weak $\\delta$-colouring. In this paper, all colourings considered are weak, so we will hereafter omit the word \"weak\"; thus, in the remainder of the paper we refer to a weak $\\delta$-colouring as simply a $\\delta$-colouring and $\\chi(S)$ as the chromatic number of $S$. If $S$ has chromatic number $\\delta$, then we say that $S$ is $\\delta$-chromatic.\n\nNo Steiner triple system is 2-chromatic, save for the degenerate case of an $\\operatorname{STS}(3)[26,30]$. There exists a 3 -chromatic $\\operatorname{STS}(v)$ whenever $v \\equiv 1$ or $3(\\bmod 6)$ and $v \\geqslant 7$ (see Theorem 18.4 of [11]), and there exists a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{STS}(v)$ if and only if $v \\equiv 1$ or $3(\\bmod 6)$ and $v \\geqslant 21[8,17]$. It is shown in [3] that for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$ and sufficiently large $v \\equiv 1$ or $3(\\bmod 6)$, there exists an $\\operatorname{STS}(v)$ with chromatic number $\\delta$; this result was generalized to equitable $\\delta$-colourings in [9]. Examples of Steiner triple systems which have chromatic number 3 but do not have equitable colourings are given in [12]. For triple systems with $\\lambda \\geqslant 2$, it was shown in [20] that for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$ there is a $\\delta$-chromatic $(v, 3, \\lambda)$-BIBD for all sufficiently large admissible $v$; more generally, for all $\\delta \\geqslant 2$ and $k \\geqslant 3$ other than $(\\delta, k)=(3,2)$, it was proved that the necessary conditions for the existence of a $(v, k, \\lambda)$-BIBD are asymptotically sufficient for the existence of a $\\delta$-chromatic $(v, k, \\lambda)$-BIBD.\n\nA parallel class of a $\\operatorname{BIBD}(V, \\mathcal{B})$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{B}$ which includes each element of $V$ exactly once; that is, a parallel class is a partition of $V$ into blocks of $\\mathcal{B}$. A $\\operatorname{BIBD}(V, \\mathcal{B})$ is said to be resolvable if $\\mathcal{B}$ partitions into parallel classes. Vertex colourings of resolvable designs appear to be first mentioned in [25], where it is observed that a family of 3-colourable resolvable triple systems is produced by the Bose construction.\n\nIn this paper we focus directly on the problem of colouring resolvable Steiner triple systems. A resolvable $(v, 3,1)$-BIBD together with a partition into parallel classes is known as a Kirkman triple system, or $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$. A $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ exists if and only if $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$ [24, 28]; for each such order $v$ we prove that there exists a 3 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$. We also prove that there are infinitely many $\\delta$-chromatic Kirkman triple systems for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$.\n\nWe say that a colouring $\\phi$ of a $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ is rainbow if it is a 3-colouring in which the colour class sizes are each $v / 3$ and there exists a parallel class, which we call a rainbow parallel class,\n\nin which every triple receives all three colours. A straightforward counting argument yields that in a rainbow colouring there is exactly one rainbow parallel class, as any block not in the rainbow parallel class of a rainbow colouring of a KTS receives exactly two distinct colours. We may also refer to a $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ as rainbow if it possesses a colouring which is rainbow.\n\nOur aim in this paper is to construct colourings for Kirkman triple systems. We first give results on small orders in Section 2. In Section 3, we manipulate standard constructions of Kirkman triple systems by incorporating rainbow colourings. These methods involve group divisible designs.\n\nDefinition 1.1. A $k$-GDD or Group Divisible Design is a triple $(V, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathcal{B})$ where $\\mathcal{G}$ is a partition of $V$ into subsets of points, called groups, and $\\mathcal{B}$ is a set of blocks, each of size $k$, with the following properties:\n\n- every pair of points in different groups belongs to exactly one block of $\\mathcal{B}$;\n- no block intersects a group in more than one point.\n\nThe group type, or just type, of a $k$-GDD is the multiset $T=\\{|G| \\mid G \\in \\mathcal{G}\\}$. If the integer $g$ occurs $u$ times in $T$ we use the notation $g^{u}$. Similarly to BIBDs, a $k$-GDD is said to be resolvable if the block set $\\mathcal{B}$ can be partitioned into parallel classes, in which case we refer to a $k$-RGDD. In particular, we explore constructions using a class of GDDs known as frames and prove the following.\n\nTheorem 1.2. For each $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$ there exists a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ with chromatic number 3 .\n\nWe apply similar techniques to study 4-colourings in Section 4. Our main result in that section is Theorem 4.5, in which we show the existence of an infinite class of 4-colourable Kirkman triple systems for which the orders grow according to a linear function. In Section 5, we study the case where there is an arbitrary number of colours, giving a proof of the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 1.3. For each $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there are infinitely many integers $v$ such that there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ with chromatic number $\\delta$.\n\nA simple way to construct Kirkman triple systems is to use quadruple systems. We define $Q(v)$ to be a quadruple system of order $v$, namely a $(v, 4,1)$-BIBD. A quadruple system $Q(v)$ is known to exist if and only if $v \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12)$ [18]. Using quadruple system techniques, we discover interesting relationships between colourability of Kirkman triple systems and their underlying quadruple systems, which we describe in Section 6. We conclude the paper in Section 7 by discussing some open problems.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Results for small orders \n\nIt is well known [11] that there is a unique $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ up to isomorphism, shown by the following triples on the point set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\{1,2,3\\} & \\{1,4,7\\} & \\{1,5,9\\} & \\{1,6,8\\} \\\\\n\\{4,5,6\\} & \\{2,5,8\\} & \\{2,6,7\\} & \\{2,4,9\\} \\\\\n\\{7,8,9\\} & \\{3,6,9\\} & \\{3,4,8\\} & \\{3,5,7\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nLemma 2.1. There exist 3-colourings of $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ for each of the following colour types: $3^{3}$, $2^{1} 3^{1} 4^{1}$ and $1^{1} 4^{2}$.\n\nProof. Using the representation of the $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ above, a 3 -colouring with colour type $3^{3}$ is given by the colour classes $\\{1,4,9\\},\\{2,5,7\\}$ and $\\{3,6,8\\}$; this is a rainbow colouring for which the parallel class containing the block $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is rainbow. For colour type $2^{1} 3^{1} 4^{1}$, consider the classes $\\{1,2\\},\\{3,5,8\\}$ and $\\{4,6,7,9\\}$. For colour type $1^{1} 4^{2}$, consider the classes $\\{1\\},\\{2,3,5,9\\}$ and $\\{4,6,7,8\\}$.\n\nNow, for several small orders we explicitly provide rainbow colourings that will be useful in subsequent constructions.\n\nLemma 2.2. There exists a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ for each $v \\in\\{3,9,15,21,33,39,57,69\\}$.\nProof. The result is clearly true for $v=3$, and for $v=9$ a rainbow colouring appears in the proof of Lemma 2.1. For $v=15$, the following $\\operatorname{KTS}(15)$ (taken from Example 5.1.1 in [23]) has a rainbow colouring under the point partition $\\{1,4,7,13,14\\},\\{2,5,6,8,9\\}$ and $\\{3,10,11,12,15\\}$.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nFor $v \\in\\{21,33,39,57,69\\}$ we constructed several $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ in a manner similar to that described in [10], and in so doing we were able to identify several systems with rainbow colourings. The general approach here is to construct a $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ on the point set $\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{(v-3) / 3}, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{3}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{\\infty_{0}, \\infty_{1}, \\infty_{2}\\right\\}$ such that the permutation\n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\left(0_{0}, 1_{0}, \\ldots,\\left(\\frac{v-6}{3}\\right)_{0}\\right)\\left(0_{1}, 1_{1}, \\ldots,\\left(\\frac{v-6}{3}\\right)_{1}\\right)\\left(0_{2}, 1_{2}, \\ldots,\\left(\\frac{v-6}{3}\\right)_{2}\\right)\\left(\\infty_{0}\\right)\\left(\\infty_{1}\\right)\\left(\\infty_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nfixes one parallel class, induces a short orbit of $\\frac{v-3}{6}$ parallel classes and induces a long orbit of $\\frac{v-3}{3}$ parallel classes.

Then there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9 v)$ which has a 3-colouring that is equitable.\nProof. Let $A_{1}=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{v}\\right\\}, A_{2}=\\left\\{a_{v+1}, a_{v+2}, \\ldots, a_{2 v}\\right\\}$ and $A_{3}=\\left\\{a_{2 v+1}, a_{2 v+2}, \\ldots, a_{3 v}\\right\\}$, with $B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, C_{1}, C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ similarly defined. Next, let $A=A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\cup A_{3}$ with $B$ and $C$ similarly defined.\n\nWe construct a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9 v)=(A \\cup B \\cup C, \\mathcal{B})$ as follows. Add to $\\mathcal{B}$ the blocks of a 3 -coloured $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 v)$ on each of $A, B$ and $C$ in such a way that the vertices in the set $A_{i} \\cup B_{i} \\cup C_{i}$ have colour $i$, for each $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 3$.\n\nNecessarily $v$ is odd; otherwise a $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 v)$ does not exist. Thus there exists a Latin square $L_{v}$ of order $v$ which partitions into transversals $T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{v}$. Equivalently, there is a 3 -RGDD of type $v^{3}$ (a resolvable transversal design), $G$. Add to $\\mathcal{B}$ nine copies of $G$, using the following sets of three groups:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{2}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{3}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{3}, C_{1}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{2}, C_{1}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{A_{2}, B_{3}, C_{2}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{1}, C_{3}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{3}, C_{3}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{A_{2}, B_{1}, C_{1}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{2}, C_{2}\\right\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTo see that the added blocks can be partitioned into parallel classes, let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{X}_{1}=\\left(\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{2}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{3}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{3}, C_{1}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathcal{X}_{2}=\\left(\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{2}, C_{1}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{2}, B_{3}, C_{2}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{1}, C_{3}\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathcal{X}_{3}=\\left(\\left\\{A_{1}, B_{3}, C_{3}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{2}, B_{1}, C_{1}\\right\\},\\left\\{A_{3}, B_{2}, C_{2}\\right\\}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand let $G_{i, j, k}$ be the $k^{\\text {th }}$ parallel class in the copy of $G$ placed on the $j^{\\text {th }}$ set of groups in $\\mathcal{X}_{i}$. For each $i \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, v\\}, G_{i, 1, k} \\cup G_{i, 2, k} \\cup G_{i, 3, k}$ forms a parallel class.\n\nIn addition to the Kirkman triple systems produced by Theorem 2.3, we call attention to the family of Kirkman triple systems that arise from the Bose construction. Resolvable Bose triple systems are studied in [25], where it is shown that for such a triple system to exist it must have order $v \\equiv 9(\\bmod 18)$. Moreover, for each $v \\equiv 9(\\bmod 18)$ such a system is constructed. The resolvable Bose triple systems that are constructed in [25] are observed to all have equitable 3 -colourings.\n\nWe finish this section with some comments on small Kirkman triple systems that are not 3 -chromatic. In [33], Tonchev and Vanstone presented thirty non-isomorphic KTS(33). We analysed each of them computationally by implementing an exhaustive backtracking algorithm to search for potential colourings. In so doing we found that none of them can be 3 -coloured, but they each admit a 4 -colouring that is equitable and of type $8^{3} 9^{1}$; we include an appendix with details of such colourings. Additionally, we tested the 1-rotational $\\operatorname{KTS}(33)$ over the cyclic group given by Buratti and Zuanni [5], and found that 13 are 3 chromatic, while the rest are all 4 -chromatic; we give an example of one of the 3 -chromatic systems from [5] in the appendix. We also tested the 3 -pyramidal KTS(33) from [2] and found that it was 4 -chromatic. It seems that, at least in the case $v=33$, a high degree of symmetry correlates with a higher chromatic number.\n\nLastly we observe that sporadic examples of Kirkman triple systems with chromatic number greater than 4 appear in the literature. Fug\u00e8re, Haddad and Wehlau [14] prove that the points and lines of the projective geometry $\\mathrm{PG}(5,2)$ form a 5 -chromatic Steiner triple system; it is known that $\\mathrm{PG}(n, 2)$ is resolvable whenever $n$ is odd [1], so that this design yields a 5 -chromatic KTS(63). In [17], Haddad shows that the Steiner triple system derived from the affine geometry $\\mathrm{AG}(4,3)$ is 5 -chromatic; it follows that there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(81)$ which is 5 -chromatic. Bruen, Haddad and Wehlau [4] show that the KTS(243) given by the affine geometry $\\mathrm{AG}(5,3)$ is 6 -chromatic.", "tables": {"table_0": "| $\\{1,2,3\\}$ | $\\{1,4,5\\}$ | $\\{1,6,7\\}$ | $\\{1,8,9\\}$ | $\\{1,10,11\\}$ | $\\{1,12,13\\}$ | $\\{1,14,15\\}$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $\\{4,8,12\\}$ | $\\{2,8,10\\}$ | $\\{2,9,11\\}$ | $\\{2,12,15\\}$ | $\\{2,13,14\\}$ | $\\{2,4,6\\}$ | $\\{2,5,7\\}$ |\n| $\\{5,10,14\\}$ | $\\{3,13,15\\}$ | $\\{3,12,14\\}$ | $\\{3,5,6\\}$ | $\\{3,4,7\\}$ | $\\{3,9,10\\}$ | $\\{3,8,11\\}$ |\n| $\\{6,11,13\\}$ | $\\{6,9,14\\}$ | $\\{4,10,15\\}$ | $\\{4,11,14\\}$ | $\\{5,9,12\\}$ | $\\{5,11,15\\}$ | $\\{4,9,13\\}$ |\n| $\\{7,9,15\\}$ | $\\{7,11,12\\}$ | $\\{5,8,13\\}$ | $\\{7,10,13\\}$ | $\\{6,8,15\\}$ | $\\{7,8,14\\}$ | $\\{6,10,12\\}$ |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Constructions via frames \n\nThe main aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2. We begin with some definitions. Recall that a $k$-GDD consists of a partition $\\mathcal{G}$ of the point set $V$ into groups, and a collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of blocks of size $k$ which contain each pair of points in different groups exactly once, but no pair of points contained in a single group. A $k$-GDD is said, in turn, to be a $k$-frame if there is a partition $\\mathcal{P}$ of $\\mathcal{B}$ into partial parallel classes such that each element of $\\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $V \\backslash G$ for some group $G \\in \\mathcal{G}$. A frame thus can be thought of as a partially resolvable group divisible design, where each partial parallel class misses exactly one group. A 3 -frame is also known as a Kirkman frame.\n\nRemark 3.1. By a standard straightforward counting argument, in a Kirkman frame, for each $G \\in \\mathcal{G}$ there are $|G| / 2$ partial parallel classes in $\\mathcal{P}$ which exclude $G$; hence, every group has even size.\n\nTheorem 3.2 ([31]). There is a Kirkman frame of type $g^{u}$ if and only if $u \\geqslant 4, g$ is even and $g(u-1)$ is divisible by 3 .\n\nKirkman frames have also been classified when all but one group has uniform size, and the group sizes are either small or divisible by 12 .\n\nTheorem 3.3 ([16, 34]). Let $0<g \\leqslant 12$ or $g \\equiv 0(\\bmod 12)$ and $u, m>0$. Then there exists a Kirkman frame of type $g^{u} m^{1}$ if and only if the following all hold:\na) $g$ is even;\nb) $g u \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)$;\nc) $m \\equiv g(\\bmod 6)$;\nd) $u \\geqslant 3$;\ne) if $u=3$ then $m=g$, and if $u>3$ then $0<m \\leqslant g(u-1) / 2$.\n\nA subsystem of a Kirkman triple system $(V, \\mathcal{B})$ with parallel classes $\\mathcal{R}$ is a Kirkman triple system $\\left(V^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right)$ with parallel classes $\\mathcal{R}^{\\prime}$ such that $V^{\\prime} \\subseteq V, \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$, and each element of $\\mathcal{R}^{\\prime}$ is a subset of some element of $\\mathcal{R}$. Equivalently, the parallel classes of $\\mathcal{R}^{\\prime}$ are those of $\\mathcal{R}$ induced by restricting to the subset of points $V^{\\prime}$. Note that each triple of $\\mathcal{B}$ intersects $V^{\\prime}$ in either 0,1 or 3 points.\n\nA rainbow subsystem of a rainbow Kirkman triple system with colouring $\\phi$ is a subsystem which is also rainbow under the colouring $\\phi$ restricted to the points of the subsystem. Note that any rainbow Kirkman triple system trivially contains a rainbow subsystem of order 3. Also note that every rainbow Kirkman triple system is 3 -chromatic, save for the degenerate case of a $\\operatorname{KTS}(3)$, which is 2 -chromatic.\n\nKirkman frames are a key tool for constructing Kirkman triple systems, particularly Kirkman triple systems with subsystems. The standard methods are summarized in [31]. These methods are here manipulated to obtain the proof of the following theorem, which may be regarded as the main construction in this paper.\n\nTheorem 3.4. Suppose there exists a Kirkman frame on $v$ points of type $T$. Suppose that for some positive integer $w$, for each $t \\in T$ there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 t+w)$ with a colouring $\\phi$ which is rainbow and containing a rainbow subsystem on $w$ points. Then there exists a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 v+w)$.\n\nProof. Let $(V, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathcal{B})$ be a Kirkman frame of type $T$; note that necessarily this means that every $t \\in T$ is even (see Remark 3.1). Further, the existence of a $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 t+w)$ implies that $w \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$, so we let $w=3 w^{\\prime}$, where $w^{\\prime}$ is odd. Let $W=\\left\\{\\infty_{i} \\mid i \\in\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, w^{\\prime}\\right\\}\\right\\}$, $V^{\\prime}=V \\times\\{0,1,2\\}$ and let $W^{\\prime}=W \\times\\{0,1,2\\}$. We will construct a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 v+w)$, $\\left(V^{\\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ with a colouring $\\phi^{\\prime}$ which maps $(x, i)$ to colour $i$ for each $x \\in V \\cup W$ and $i \\in\\{0,1,2\\}$.\n\nFor each $B=\\{x, y, z\\} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, construct the following parallel classes of blocks on the set of points $B \\times\\{0,1,2\\}$ :\n\n- $\\{\\{(x, 0),(y, 0),(z, 1)\\},\\{(x, 1),(y, 1),(z, 2)\\},\\{(x, 2),(y, 2),(z, 0)\\}\\}$;\n\n- $\\{\\{(x, 0),(y, 2),(z, 2)\\},\\{(x, 1),(y, 0),(z, 0)\\},\\{(x, 2),(y, 1),(z, 1)\\}\\}$\n- $\\{\\{(x, 0),(y, 1),(z, 0)\\},\\{(x, 1),(y, 2),(z, 1)\\},\\{(x, 2),(y, 0),(z, 2)\\}\\}$.\n\nLet the resultant set of blocks be $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. Let $\\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}=\\{G \\times\\{0,1,2\\} \\mid G \\in \\mathcal{G}\\}$. Note that the structure $\\left(V^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is a Kirkman frame of type $\\{3 t \\mid t \\in T\\}$. Let $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ be the associated set of partial parallel classes and note that by Remark 3.1, each group $G^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ of size $3 t$ is missed by $3 t / 2$ partial classes. Observe that each block of $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ receives exactly two distinct colours under the colouring $\\phi^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe fix a group $G_{0} \\in \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$ of size $3 t_{0}$ and add to $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime \\prime}$ a copy of the $\\operatorname{KTS}\\left(3 t_{0}+w\\right), K_{0}$, on $G_{0} \\cup W^{\\prime}$ so that the subsystem of order $w$ is on the points of $W^{\\prime}$. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\left(G_{0}\\right)$ be the set of $(w-1) / 2$ parallel classes in $K_{0}$ which each include a partition of the points of $W^{\\prime}$. That is, blocks in each of these parallel classes intersect $W$ in either 0 or 3 points. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{2}\\left(G_{0}\\right)$ be the set of remaining parallel classes, where $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2}\\left(G_{0}\\right)\\right|=\\left(3 t_{0}+w-1\\right) / 2-\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\left(G_{0}\\right)\\right|=3 t_{0} / 2$. Further, we add to $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime \\prime}$ the blocks of the rainbow class so that they are of the form $\\{(x, 0),(y, 1),(z, 2)\\}$, consistent with the colouring $\\phi^{\\prime}$.\n\nFor every other group $G \\in \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left\\{G_{0}\\right\\}$ of size $3 t$, we remove the blocks of the subsystem of order $w$ from the $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 t+w)$, creating a $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 t+w)$ with a hole of size $w, K_{1}(G)$. We add to $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime \\prime}$ a copy of $K_{1}(G)$ on $G \\cup W^{\\prime}$, so that the hole is on the points of $W^{\\prime}$. Further, we again place the blocks of the rainbow class so that they are of the form $\\{(x, 0),(y, 1),(z, 2)\\}$, consistent with the colouring $\\phi^{\\prime}$. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{1}(G)$ (resp. $\\mathcal{R}_{2}(G)$ ) denote the set of \"short\" (resp. \"full\") classes of $K_{1}(G)$. Note that the $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{1}(G)\\right|=(w-1) / 2$ \"short\" classes cover $G$, and each of the $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2}(G)\\right|=(3 t+w-1) / 2-\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{1}(G)\\right|=3 t / 2$ \"full\" classes covers $G \\cup W^{\\prime}$.\n\nObserve that $\\left(V^{\\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ defined above is a Steiner triple system, and furthermore that $\\phi^{\\prime}$ is a 3-colouring of this Steiner triple system. It remains to show that this system is also a Kirkman triple system with a rainbow parallel class.\n\nFor each group $G \\in \\mathcal{G}^{\\prime}$, by Remark 3.1, there exist $|G| / 2$ partial parallel classes $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ such that $P$ excludes the points in $G$. Match these with the $|G| / 2$ parallel classes of $\\mathcal{R}_{2}(G)$ on $G \\cup W^{\\prime}$ to create $|G| / 2$ parallel classes on $V^{\\prime}$.\n\nNext, we create the rainbow parallel class by taking the rainbow parallel class from $\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\left(G_{0}\\right)$ (placed on $G_{0} \\cup W^{\\prime}$ ) together with the rainbow parallel class from $\\mathcal{R}_{1}(G)$ for each $G \\neq G_{0}$. Finally, create $(w-3) / 2$ more parallel classes by combining the non-rainbow parallel classes from $\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\left(G_{0}\\right)$ with the non-rainbow parallel classes from $\\mathcal{R}_{1}(G)$ for each $G \\neq G_{0}$.\n\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 1.2, that there is a 3-chromatic rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ for every $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$.\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2. The cases $v \\in X=\\{3,9,15,21,33,39,57,69\\}$ are dealt with in Lemma 2.2; therefore we assume $v \\notin X$. Set $\\omega=(v-3) / 3$. If $\\omega \\not \\equiv 10(\\bmod 12)$, let $g \\in\\{2,4,6\\}$ such that $g \\equiv \\omega(\\bmod 6)$ and set $(m, u)=(g, \\omega / g-1)$. Otherwise, set $(g, m, u)=(4,10,(\\omega-10) / 4)$. Since $v \\notin X$, one can check that $(g, m, u)$ satisfies Theorem 3.3: in particular, $u \\geqslant 3$, and $u \\neq 3$ when $m \\neq g$ (that is, when $\\omega \\equiv 10(\\bmod 12)$. Therefore, there exists a Kirkman frame of type $g^{n} m^{1}$. Also, by Lemma 2.2, there exists a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 m+3)$, for $m=2,4,6,10$. Then, by Theorem 3.4, there exists a rainbow $\\operatorname{KTS}(3 \\omega+3)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 4-chromatic Kirkman triple systems \n\nWe further exploit the standard frame methods (see [31]) to obtain results on 4-chromatic Kirkman triple systems.\n\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that there exists a 4-coloured (not necessarily 4-chromatic) 4-GDD of type $4^{u}$ such that:\na) in any block there are at most two points of the same colour; and\nb) in any group there is exactly one point of each colour.\n\nThen, for any $g \\geqslant 1$, there exists a 4 -coloured 3 -frame of type $(8 g)^{u}$ such that each group is equitably coloured.\n\nProof. Let $(V, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathcal{B})$ be a 4 -GDD of type $4^{u}$ satisfying the conditions of the lemma. We construct a 4 -coloured 3 -frame $\\left(V^{*}, \\mathcal{G}^{*}, \\mathcal{B}^{*}\\right)$ of type $(8 g)^{u}$ as follows. The point set will be\n\n$$\nV^{*}=V \\times\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\}=\\{(v, i) \\mid v \\in V, i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\}\\}\n$$\n\nFor each $v \\in V$ and $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\}$, the vertex $(v, i)$ is coloured with the same colour as the vertex $v$ in the original 4-GDD. The set of groups will be\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}^{*}=\\{G \\times\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\} \\mid G \\in \\mathcal{G}\\}\n$$\n\nObserve that in each group, there are exactly $2 g$ points of each colour, as required by the conditions of this lemma.\n\nWe next describe the block set $\\mathcal{B}^{*}$. By Theorem 3.2, there exists a 3 -frame of type $(2 g)^{4}$. For each $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$, place a copy, $F(B)$, of this 3 -frame on the point set $\\{(v, i) \\mid v \\in B, i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\}\\}$ so that the above groups are preserved. By property (a), all the triples thus constructed are 4 -coloured.\n\nThe fact that the resultant $\\left(V^{*}, \\mathcal{G}^{*}, \\mathcal{B}^{*}\\right)$ is a 3 -frame follows by the Fundamental Frame Construction (Construction 3.1 from [31], see also [32]). To see this, consider the original 4-GDD of type $4^{u}$. Let $v \\in V$, let $G_{v}$ be the group of $\\mathcal{G}$ containing $v$ and let $\\mathcal{B}_{v} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ be the set of blocks (each of size 4) which contain $v$. Next, by the definition of a GDD, the set of triples $\\left\\{B \\backslash\\{v\\} \\mid v \\in \\mathcal{B}_{v}\\right\\}$ is a partition of $V \\backslash G_{v}$. It follows that the set of 3 -frames of the form $\\left\\{F(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{v}\\right\\}$ partition into $g$ partial parallel classes of $V^{*}$, each of which exclude $G_{v} \\times\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 g\\}$. Considering each vertex of $v \\in V$ in turn, $\\mathcal{B}^{*}$ partitions into the required partial parallel classes.\n\nLemma 4.2. Let $u \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12)$ and $u \\geqslant 4$. Then there exists a 4-coloured (not necessarily 4 -chromatic) 4-GDD of type $4^{u}$ with block size 4 such that:\na) in any block there are at most two points of the same colour; and\nb) in any group there is exactly one point of each colour.\n\nProof. We first consider the case $u=4$. Let the groups be of the form $G_{j}=\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{4}\\right\\}$, where $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$. For each $i, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, the point $i_{j}$ receives colour $i$.

Since $u \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12)$, there exists a quadruple system $Q(u)=$ $(V, \\mathcal{B})$ of order $u$. For each point $v \\in V$, construct a group $G(v)=\\left\\{(v, i) \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{4}\\right\\}$, where $(v, i)$ receives colour $i$ for each $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{4}$. Then, for each block $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$, place the coloured $\\operatorname{GDD}\\left(4^{4}\\right)$ constructed for the case $u=4$ on the groups $\\{G(v) \\mid v \\in B\\}$.\n\nThe following lemma follows from the standard filling-in construction for frames; see Construction 5.1 of [31]. This construction allows us to build a $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g u+1)$ from a 3 -frame of type $(4 g)^{n}$ by adding a new point $\\infty$ to the points of the frame, and for each group $G$, adding the blocks of a $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g+1)$ on the points of $G \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$. Supposing the frame admits a 4 -colouring in which each group contains an equal number of points of each colour, by choosing an equitably 4 -colourable $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g+1)$, we may identify the points appropriately so that the resulting $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g u+1)$ is itself 4 -colourable; this colouring is necessarily equitable since the colour on $\\infty$ occurs on $g u+1$ vertices and the other three occur on $g u$ vertices.\n\nLemma 4.3. Suppose that there exists a 4 -coloured 3 -frame of type $(4 g)^{u}$ such that the points in each group are coloured equitably. Further, suppose that there exists a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g+1)$ that admits an equitable 4 -colouring. Then there exists a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(4 g u+$ 1) that admits an equitable 4 -colouring.\n\nIn Section 2, we previously observed the existence of 4 -chromatic Kirkman triple systems of order 33 which admit a colouring of type $8^{3} 9^{1}$, and hence we have the following.\n\nLemma 4.4. There exists a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(33)$ such that the points are equitably coloured for some 4-colouring.\n\nCombining the results of this section, we obtain the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.5. Let $u \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12)$. Then there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(32 u+1)$ with chromatic number 4. Furthermore there is a 4 -colouring which is equitable.\n\nProof. By Lemma 4.4, the theorem is true for $u=1$. Otherwise $u \\geqslant 4$ and by Lemma 4.2 there is a 4 -coloured GDD $4^{u}$ with block size 4 such that: (a) in any block there are at most two points of the same colour; and (b) in any group there is exactly one point of each colour. In turn, by Lemma 4.1 with $g=4$, there exists a 4 -coloured 3 -frame of type $32^{u}$ such that each group is equitably coloured. Finally, apply Lemma 4.3 with $g=8$. Note that the 4 -chromatic equitably coloured $\\operatorname{KTS}(33)$ needed in this construction is given by Lemma 4.4.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5 Kirkman triple systems with an arbitrary chromatic number \n\nIn this section our main aim is to prove Theorem 1.3. That is, we establish that for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with chromatic number $\\delta$. We will make use of the following results from the literature. Note that a partial quadruple system $Q^{\\prime}$ of order $u$ is a set $U$ of $u$ points and a set $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ of blocks of size 4 from $U$ such that every pair from $U$ is contained in at most one block. If $U \\subseteq V$ and $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ for some quadruple system $Q=(V, \\mathcal{B})$, we say that $Q^{\\prime}$ embeds in $Q$.\n\nTheorem 5.1 ([15, 27]). Every partial quadruple system of order $v$ can be embedded in a quadruple system of order $w$ for some $w \\geqslant v$.\n\nTheorem 5.2 ([29, 35, 36]). Let $w<v$ be positive integers with $w, v \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12)$. Any quadruple system of order $w$ can be embedded in a quadruple system of order $v$ if and only if $v \\geqslant 3 w+1$.\n\nBy combining these two results, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 5.3. For any partial quadruple system $Q^{\\prime}(u)$ on u points, there exists an integer $v_{0}$ such that for all $v \\geqslant v_{0}$ with $v \\equiv 1$ or $4(\\bmod 12), Q^{\\prime}(u)$ can be embedded in a quadruple system of order $v$.\n\nWe will also need the following lemma.\nLemma 5.4. Let $\\delta \\geqslant 4$ and let $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\delta}$. Then there exists a $\\delta$-coloured (not necessarily $\\delta$-chromatic) resolvable 3 -GDD of type $4^{3}$ with groups $G_{j}=\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid i \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\right\\}, j \\in$ $\\{0,1,2\\}$, such that vertex $i_{j}$ receives colour $c_{j}+i(\\bmod \\delta)$ for each $i \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ and $j \\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. Moreover, if it is not the case that $c_{0}=c_{1}=c_{2}$, then $\\left\\{0_{0}, 0_{1}, 0_{2}\\right\\}$ is a block.\n\nProof. Note that without loss of generality, by cycling colours modulo $\\delta$ if needed, we may assume $c_{0}=0$. We first consider the case $c_{0}=c_{1}=c_{2}=0$. Consider the following resolvable 3 -GDD of type $4^{3}$, obtained by deleting a group from the construction given in Lemma 4.2. Specifically, the blocks are as follows, where $(x, y, z)$ denotes the block $\\left\\{x_{0}, y_{1}, z_{2}\\right\\}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\{(0,0,1),(1,1,2),(2,3,3),(3,2,0)\\}, & \\{(0,1,3),(1,0,0),(2,2,1),(3,3,2)\\} \\\\\n\\{(0,2,2),(1,3,1),(2,1,0),(3,0,3)\\}, & \\{(0,3,0),(1,2,3),(2,0,2),(3,1,1)\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIf point $i_{j}$ has colour $i$, then all the conditions of the lemma are satisfied.\nOtherwise assume $c_{0}=0$ and $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right) \\neq(0,0)$. We may assume that $c_{1} \\leqslant c_{2}$; (otherwise swap groups $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ ). We first consider when $\\delta=4$.\n\nWe present a list of resolvable 3 -GDDs, each of type $4^{3}$, exhaustively covering every possible case. We use the same notation as above to describe points, namely, $(x, y, z)$ denotes the block $\\left\\{x_{0}, y_{1}, z_{2}\\right\\}$. Firstly, the case $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right) \\in\\{(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)\\}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\{(0,0,0),(1,1,1),(2,2,2),(3,3,3)\\}, & \\{(0,1,2),(1,0,3),(2,3,0),(3,2,1)\\} \\\\\n\\{(0,2,3),(1,3,2),(2,0,1),(3,1,0)\\}, & \\{(0,3,1),(1,2,0),(2,1,3),(3,0,2)\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, the case $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right)=(1,2)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\{(0,0,0),(1,2,1),(2,3,2),(3,1,3)\\}, & \\{(0,1,2),(1,3,3),(2,2,0),(3,0,1)\\} \\\\\n\\{(0,2,3),(1,0,2),(2,1,1),(3,3,0)\\}, & \\{(0,3,1),(1,1,0),(2,0,3),(3,2,2)\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNow, the case $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right)=(1,3)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\{(0,0,0),(1,2,2),(2,3,3),(3,1,1)\\}, & \\{(0,2,1),(1,0,3),(2,1,2),(3,3,0)\\} \\\\\n\\{(0,1,3),(1,3,1),(2,2,0),(3,0,2)\\}, & \\{(0,3,2),(1,1,0),(2,0,1),(3,2,3)\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAnd finally, a solution for $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right)=(2,3)$ is obtained by swapping the second and third coordinates in each of the triples in the case $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right)=(1,3)$.\n\nOtherwise $c_{0}=0,\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right) \\neq(0,0)$ and $\\delta>4$. Let $X_{0}=\\{0,1,2,3\\}, X_{1}=\\left\\{c_{1}, c_{1}+1, c_{1}+\\right.$ $\\left.2, c_{1}+3\\right\\}$ and $X_{2}=\\left\\{c_{2}, c_{2}+1, c_{2}+2, c_{2}+3\\right\\}$, where elements in these sets are evaluated in $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\mathrm{d}}$. That is, $X_{0}, X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are the sets of colours used in groups $G_{0}, G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, respectively. Considering $X_{0}$, monochromatic blocks can only occur in colours $0,1,2$ or 3 . Thus if either $X_{1}$ or $X_{2}$ is disjoint from $X_{0}$, we have a solution using any of the above GDDs from the case $\\delta=4$ and $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}\\right) \\neq(0,0)$.\n\nIt remains to consider the case that $\\left|X_{1} \\cap X_{0}\\right| \\geqslant 1$ and $\\left|X_{2} \\cap X_{0}\\right| \\geqslant 1$. For $j \\in\\{1,2\\}$, if $c_{j} \\in X_{0}$, set $c_{j}^{\\prime}=c_{j}$; otherwise $0<\\delta-3 \\leqslant c_{j} \\leqslant \\delta-1$, and define $c_{j}^{\\prime}=4-\\delta+c_{j} \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$. Since $\\left(c_{1}^{\\prime}, c_{2}^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq(0,0)$, from above there exists a resolvable 3-GDD of type $4^{3}$ which satisfies the conditions of the lemma for $\\delta=4$, where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are replaced by $c_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $c_{2}^{\\prime}$, respectively.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we recolour (and possibly relabel) points in groups $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ to obtain a $\\delta$-colourable resolvable 3 -GDD of type $4^{3}$ which satisfies the conditions of the lemma.\n\nFor each $j \\in\\{1,2\\}$, we consider three cases. If $c_{j} \\in X_{0} \\backslash\\left\\{\\delta-3, \\delta-2, \\delta-1\\right\\}$, then for each integer $i$ such that $4-c_{j} \\leqslant i \\leqslant 3$, recolour the point $i_{j}$ with colour $i+c_{j}$. If $c_{j} \\in\\{\\delta-3, \\delta-2, \\delta-1\\} \\backslash X_{0}$, then for each integer $i$ such that $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant \\delta-c_{i}$ recolour the points $i_{j}$ with colour $c_{j}+i$. Lastly, if $c_{j} \\in\\{\\delta-3, \\delta-2, \\delta-1\\} \\cap X_{0}$, then necessarily $\\left(\\delta, c_{j}\\right) \\in\\{(5,2),(5,3),(6,3)\\}$, which we consider individually as subcases below.\n\nIf $\\delta=5$ and $c_{j}=2$, points $0_{j}, 1_{j}, 2_{j}$ and $3_{j}$ are coloured with colours $2,3,0$ and 1 , respectively. Recolour vertex $3_{j}$ with colour 4 then swap vertices $2_{j}$ and $3_{j}$ (in all blocks), keeping the new colours.\n\nIf $\\delta=5$ and $c_{j}=3$, points $0_{j}, 1_{j}, 2_{j}$ and $3_{j}$ are coloured with colours $3,0,1$ and 2 , respectively. Recolour vertex $3_{j}$ with colour 4 then replace vertex $1_{j}$ with $3_{j}$, vertex $3_{j}$ with $2_{j}$ and vertex $2_{j}$ with $1_{j}$ (in all blocks), keeping the new colours.\n\nFinally, if $\\delta=6$ and $c_{j}=3$, points $0_{j}, 1_{j}, 2_{j}$ and $3_{j}$ are coloured with colours $3,0,1$ and 2 , respectively. Recolour vertex $2_{j}$ with colour 5 , recolour vertex $3_{j}$ with colour $4_{j}$, then swap vertex $1_{j}$ with $3_{j}$ (in all blocks), keeping the new colours.\n\nExample 5.5. For example, in the previous theorem, suppose $\\delta=5, c_{0}=0, c_{1}=2$ and $c_{2}=4$. Then $X_{1}=\\{2,3,4,0\\}$ and $X_{2}=\\{4,0,1,2\\}$. In turn, $c_{1}^{\\prime}=2$ and $c_{2}^{\\prime}=3$.\n\nThen, using notation from the theorem, the blocks are as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\{(0,0,0),(1,3,2),(2,2,3),(3,1,1)\\}, & \\{(0,1,2),(1,2,0),(2,3,1),(3,0,3)\\} \\\\\n\\{(0,2,1),(1,1,3),(2,0,2),(3,3,0)\\}, & \\{(0,3,3),(1,0,1),(2,1,0),(3,2,2)\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nLemma 5.6. For each $\\delta \\geqslant 4$, and list of (possibly non-distinct) colours $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\delta}$, there exists a $\\delta$-coloured 3 -frame of type $8^{4}$ with groups $G_{j}=\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid i \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 7\\}\\right\\}, j \\in$ $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, such that:\na) vertex $i_{j}$ has colour $c_{j}+i(\\bmod \\delta)$ for each $j \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$;\nb) there exists a block $\\left\\{0_{0}, 0_{1}, 0_{2}\\right\\}$ in the frame, unless $c_{0}=c_{1}=c_{2}$.\n\nProof. By Theorem 3.2, there exists a 3 -frame of type $2^{4}$ given by $(V, \\mathcal{G}, \\mathcal{B})$. Here $V=\\left\\{x_{j} \\mid x \\in\\{0,1\\}, j \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\right\\}, \\mathcal{G}=\\left\\{\\left\\{x_{j} \\mid x \\in\\{0,1\\}\\right\\}, j \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\right\\}$ and without loss of generality, we assume that $\\left(0_{0}, 0_{1}, 0_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nNext, we apply the \"Inflation by TD\" Construction (Construction 3.2 from [31]), giving each point in the above 3 -frame weight 4 and thus placing the resolvable 3 -GDD of type $4^{3}$ from Lemma 5.4 on each blown up block, to obtain a 3 -frame of type $8^{4}$. Here for each $x \\in$ $\\{0,1\\}$, and $j \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}, x_{j} \\in V$ is replaced by the set of points $\\left\\{(4 x+y)_{j}, y \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\right\\}$. In addition, point $(4 x+y)_{j}$, receives colour $c_{j}+4 x+y(\\bmod \\delta)$, so that (a) is satisfied.\n\nWe note that this colouring is consistent with that of each of the 3 -GDD of type $4^{3}$ from Lemma 5.4 placed on the blocks, using $c_{j}+4 x(\\bmod \\delta)$ in place of $c_{j}$ in that lemma. Finally, note that since $\\left(0_{0}, 0_{1}, 0_{2}\\right)$ was a block in the original frame and the ingredient 3 -GDDs came from Lemma 5.4, (b) holds.\n\nTheorem 5.7. Let $\\delta \\geqslant 4$. There exist infinitely many Kirkman triple systems with chromatic number $\\delta$.\n\nProof. Recall that, as mentioned in the introduction, there are infinitely many Steiner triple systems with chromatic number $\\delta$ (see [3]). Let $S=(V, \\mathcal{B})$ be such a Steiner triple system on $|V|=v$ points with a $\\delta$-colouring. Let $\\mathcal{B}=\\left\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{b}\\right\\}$, where $b=|\\mathcal{B}|$. Let $X=\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots x_{b}\\right\\}$ be a set of distinct points, where $X$ is disjoint from $V$.\n\nLet $Q^{\\prime}(v+b)$ be the partial quadruple system of order $v+b$ defined by adding the point $x_{i}$ to block $B_{i}$ for each $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, b\\}$. By Corollary 5.3 , there exist infinitely many integers $w$ such that $Q^{\\prime}(v+b)$ embeds in a quadruple system $Q(w)$ of order $w$. Colour the points of $Q(w) \\backslash V$ arbitrarily with $\\delta$ colours from the set $\\{0, \\ldots, \\delta-1\\}$.\n\nNext, for each point $j$ in $Q(w)$, let $\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid i \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 7\\}\\right\\}$ be a group of points such that if $j$ has colour $c$, then $i_{j}$ has colour $c+i(\\bmod \\delta)$. For each block $B$ in $Q(w)$, place a 3 -frame of type $8^{4}$ on the point set $\\left\\{i_{j} \\mid j \\in B, i \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 7\\}\\right\\}$ in such a way that (a) no triple is monochromatic; and (b) if $B$ contains an original triple $\\{x, y, z\\}$ from $S$, the triple $\\left\\{0_{x}, 0_{y}, 0_{z}\\right\\}$ is included in the corresponding 3 -frame. This is possible by Lemma 5.6.\n\nNext, add an infinity point which can receive any colour. Add a copy of $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ to each group together with the infinity point, so that no block is monochromatic. This is straightforward to do when $\\delta \\geqslant 4$. The resultant triple system $S^{\\prime}$ is a $\\operatorname{KTS}(8 w+1)$ [31, Construction 5.1], which is $\\delta$-coloured by construction; moreover it contains $S$ as a subsystem so has chromatic number $\\delta$.\n\nTheorem 1.3, that for each $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there are infinitely many integers $v$ such that there exists a $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ with chromatic number $\\delta$, now follows from Theorems 1.2 and 5.7.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 6 Kirkman triple systems from quadruple systems \n\nWe first review a standard construction for Kirkman triple systems that makes use of quadruple systems. Given a quadruple system $Q$ of order $v$ on vertex set $\\left\\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}\\right\\}$, we build a Kirkman triple system $K(Q)$ of order $2 v+1$ as follows.\n\nThe vertex set $V$ of $K(Q)$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\{\\infty\\} \\cup\\left\\{q_{i}, q_{i}^{\\prime} \\mid i \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, v-1\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFor each block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ from $Q$, place a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ on the vertex set\n\n$$\n\\{\\infty\\} \\cup\\left\\{w, x, y, z, w^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nin such a way that the triples including $\\infty$ are $\\left\\{\\infty, w, w^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\infty, x, x^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\infty, y, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\infty, z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Observe that such a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ placement is not unique, so in turn $K(Q)$ may not be unique.\n\nIt is well known that $K(Q)$ is a Kirkman triple system; see Theorem 5.1.3 from [23]. Building on this construction, we obtain some results which may be useful in future work to construct Kirkman triple systems with fixed chromatic number.\n\nTheorem 6.1. If $Q$ is a quadruple system of order $v$ and if there is a $K(Q)$ which is $\\delta$ colourable, then $Q$ has a $\\delta$-colouring.\n\nProof. Let $A=\\left\\{q_{0}, q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{q_{0}^{\\prime}, q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. From the definition of $K(Q)$, we may assume that the vertices of $K(Q)$ are labelled with $\\{\\infty\\} \\cup A \\cup B$ in such a way that for each $\\{w, x, y, z\\} \\subset A$ that is a block of $Q$, there is a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ on the vertex set:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\infty, w, x, y, z, w^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\left\\{\\infty, q_{i}, q_{i}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ is a triple for each $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant v-1$.\nFix a $\\delta$-colouring of the points of $K(Q)$. Observe that in this colouring, when restricted to the point set $A$ of $Q$, the block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ is not monochromatic. We therefore conclude that the $\\delta$-colouring yields a $\\delta$-colouring of $Q$ such that no block is monochromatic.\n\nCorollary 6.2. If $Q$ is a quadruple system, then for any $K(Q), \\chi(K(Q)) \\geqslant \\chi(Q)$.\nTheorem 6.3. Let $\\delta \\geqslant 2$. If $Q$ is a $\\delta$-colourable quadruple system of order $v$, then there is a $K(Q)$ which is a $2 \\delta$-colourable Kirkman triple system of order $2 v+1$.\n\nProof. Let $Q$ be a $\\delta$-colourable quadruple system of order $v$. Let $A=\\left\\{q_{0}, q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{q_{0}^{\\prime}, q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Fix a $\\delta$-colouring of $Q$ on the vertex set $A$ using the colour set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\delta\\}$.\n\nConsider a Kirkman triple system $K(Q)$ based on $Q$ as described above. By the definition of $K(Q),\\left\\{\\infty, q_{i}, q_{i}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ is a triple for each $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant v-1$, and for each $\\{w, x, y, z\\} \\subset A$ that is a block of $Q, K(Q)$ contains the blocks of a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ on the vertex set\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\infty, w, x, y, z, w^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, for each block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$, since the block is not monochromatic then we may select $x, y$ and $z$ to be points that do not all have the same colour, and include the following triples in $K(Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n\\{x, y, z\\}, & \\left\\{w, y, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w, z\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x, w, y^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{w^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x, w^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime}, y\\right\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe now colour the points of $B \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ using the extended colour set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 \\delta\\}$. Whenever vertex $w \\in A$ is coloured with $j$, let $w^{\\prime} \\in B$ be coloured with $\\delta+j$. Finally, colour $\\infty$ with colour 1. Hence, for each block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ in $Q$, since the points in the set $\\{x, y, z\\}$ are mapped to at least two different colours, the points in the set $\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ are also mapped to at least two different colours.\n\nObserve that for each of the triples\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\infty, w, w^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\infty, x, x^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\infty, y, y^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\infty, z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\},\\{x, y, z\\},\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nthe points are mapped to at least two different colours. Each of the remaining six triples of the $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ arising from $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ intersects both $A$ and $B$ non-trivially, so again receives at least two distinct colours.\n\nIn conclusion, the $K(Q)$ constructed is $2 \\delta$-colourable.\nWe note, however, that if $Q$ is $\\delta$-chromatic, then $K(Q)$ need not be $2 \\delta$-chromatic, as the following example demonstrates.\n\nExample 6.4. Consider the quadruple system $Q(13)$ with the following blocks:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\{0,1,3,9\\}, & \\{1,2,4,10\\}, & \\{2,3,5,11\\}, & \\{3,4,6,12\\}, & \\{4,5,7,0\\}, \\\\\n\\{5,6,8,1\\}, & \\{6,7,9,2\\}, & \\{7,8,10,3\\}, & \\{8,9,11,4\\}, & \\{9,10,12,5\\}, \\\\\n\\{10,11,0,6\\}, & \\{11,12,1,7\\}, & \\{12,0,2,8\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThen $Q(13)$ is 2 -chromatic, for example using the colour class $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and its complement. Next, we construct a particular $K(Q)$; in an abuse of bracket notation, we assume that the elements of the sets are each ordered as written, replacing each $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ with\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{llll}\n\\left\\{\\infty, w, w^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{\\infty, x, x^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{\\infty, y, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{\\infty, z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\{x, y, z\\}, & \\left\\{w, y, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w, z\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x, w, y^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\\\\n\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{w^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x, w^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, & \\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime}, y\\right\\}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n(So, for example, for the block $\\{12,0,2,8\\}$ we assume that $w=12, x=0, y=2$ and $z=8$.) However, this $K(Q)$ is 3 -chromatic; one 3 -colouring has colour classes:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0^{\\prime}, 2^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{7,8,10,12,6^{\\prime}, 8^{\\prime}, 9^{\\prime}, 11^{\\prime}, 12^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{9,11,1^{\\prime}, 3^{\\prime}, 4^{\\prime}, 5^{\\prime}, 7^{\\prime}, 10^{\\prime}, \\infty\\right\\}\n$$\n\nMore generally, we give some conditions on a $\\delta$-colourable quadruple system $(\\delta \\geqslant 3)$ that yield a Kirkman triple system $K(Q)$ which is $(\\delta+1)$-colourable.\n\nTheorem 6.5. Suppose there exists a quadruple system $Q$ of order $v$ and a $\\delta$-colouring of its points such that each block receives at least 3 distinct colours. Then there exists a Kirkman triple system $K(Q)$ of order $2 v+1$ that is $(\\delta+1)$-colourable.\n\nProof. Let $Q$ be such a quadruple system of order $v$. Let $A=\\left\\{q_{0}, q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}\\right\\}$ and $B=$ $\\left\\{q_{0}^{\\prime}, q_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, q_{v-1}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$. Fix a colouring of $Q$ on the point set $A$, using the colour set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\delta\\}$.\n\nFor each block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ of $Q$, assuming without loss of generality that $x, y$ and $z$ have different colours, add the following triples to form a $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\{\\infty, w, w^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{\\infty, x, x^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{\\infty, y, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{\\infty, z, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\\\\n& \\{x, y, z\\}, \\quad\\left\\{w, y, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w, z\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{x, w, y^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\\\\n& \\left\\{x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{w^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}, z\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{x, w^{\\prime}, z^{\\prime}\\right\\}, \\quad\\left\\{x^{\\prime}, w^{\\prime}, y\\right\\} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we label the points of $B \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ with the colour set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\delta, \\delta+1\\}$. Label $\\infty$ with colour $\\delta+1$. Next, whenever vertex $w \\in A$ is coloured with $j$, let $w^{\\prime} \\in B$ be also coloured with $j$. It is now easily observed that each of the triples of the $\\operatorname{KTS}(9)$ arising from each block $\\{w, x, y, z\\}$ has at least two colours.\n\nWe finish this section by using known existence results for quadruple systems along with Theorem 6.3 to construct Kirkman triple systems with small chromatic number.\n\nTheorem 6.6. $[13,19]$ There is a 2-colourable quadruple system of order $3 n+1$ if and only if $n \\equiv 0$ or $1(\\bmod 4)$.\n\nCorollary 6.7. For each $n \\equiv 0$ or $1(\\bmod 4)$, there exists a Kirkman triple system $K(6 n+3)$, say $S$, such that $\\chi(S) \\leqslant 4$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 7 Conclusion \n\nTheorem 1.3 posits, for each integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, the existence of infinitely many $\\delta$-chromatic Kirkman triple systems. In the particular case that $\\delta=3$, Theorem 1.2 shows that there is a 3 -chromatic Kirkman triple system for every order $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$, thereby completely determining the spectrum for 3 -chromatic Kirkman triple systems.\n\nFor $\\delta=4$, Theorem 4.5 gives a 4 -chromatic Kirkman triple system whenever $v \\equiv 33$ or $129(\\bmod 384)$. It is known that a 4 -chromatic Steiner triple system exists for every admissible order $v \\geqslant 21[8,17]$; whether the same is true for Kirkman triple systems remains open. We tested the $66,937 \\mathrm{KTS}(21)$ with nontrivial automorphism group for colouring properties, and found that they are all 3 -chromatic; thus, a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(21)$ would necessarily be free of nontrivial automorphisms.\n\nQuestion 7.1. Does there exist a 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(21)$ ?\nGiven the complete existence result for 4 -chromatic $\\operatorname{KTS}(v)$ for orders in several congruence classes, it seems likely that they will exist more generally. We thus make the following conjecture.\n\nConjecture 7.2. There is a 4 -chromatic Kirkman triple system of every order $v \\equiv 3$ $(\\bmod 6)$ with $v \\geqslant v_{0}$ for some integer $v_{0} \\geqslant 21$.\n\nThe value of $v_{0}$ in Conjecture 7.2 is open for debate, and clearly the actual value (if it exists) is dependent on the answer to Question 7.1. The smallest order for which we have actually found a 4 -chromatic Kirkman triple system is $v=33$, and so we conjecture that $v_{0} \\leqslant 33$.\n\nConsidering higher chromatic numbers, de Brandes, Phelps and R\u00f6dl [3] showed that for every integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there exists a value $v_{0}$ for which there is a $\\delta$-chromatic Steiner triple system of every admissible order $v \\geqslant v_{0}$. We conjecture that an analogous result holds for Kirkman triple systems.\nConjecture 7.3. For every integer $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, there exists an integer $v_{0}$ such that whenever $v \\geqslant v_{0}$ and $v \\equiv 3(\\bmod 6)$, there is a $\\delta$-chromatic Kirkman triple system of order $v$.\n\nIn Section 6, we explored colouring properties of Kirkman triple systems formed from quadruple systems. Specifically, Theorems 6.1 and 6.3 together imply that if $Q$ is a $\\delta$ chromatic quadruple system, then there exists a $K(Q)$ such that $\\delta \\leqslant \\chi(K(Q)) \\leqslant 2 \\delta$. Applying this result with 2 -chromatic quadruple systems, we obtain Kirkman triple systems of orders congruent to 3 and $9(\\bmod 24)$ whose chromatic number is either 3 or 4 (Corollary 6.7). While Theorem 6.5 gives conditions on the quadruple system $Q$ which would imply that $\\chi(K(Q)) \\leqslant \\delta+1$ for some $K(Q)$, we note that these conditions cannot be satisfied for a 2-colouring of $Q$. Nevertheless, Example 6.4 shows that a 2 -chromatic quadruple system may give rise to a 3 -chromatic Kirkman triple system. We therefore ask the following question.\nQuestion 7.4. Does there exist a quadruple system $Q$ and a $K(Q)$ where $Q$ is 2 -chromatic and $K(Q)$ is 4 -chromatic?\n\nMore generally, are there conditions on a 2 -chromatic quadruple system $Q$ that characterize whether $K(Q)$ is 3 - or 4 -chromatic?\n\nFor a $\\delta$-chromatic quadruple system with $\\delta \\geqslant 3$, we ask if the lower bound from Corollary 6.2 on the chromatic number of $K(Q)$ is tight; a positive answer would yield an additional method to construct Kirkman triple systems with specified chromatic number.\nQuestion 7.5. Let $\\delta \\geqslant 3$ be an integer. Does there exist a $\\delta$-chromatic quadruple system $Q$ and a $K(Q)$ such that $\\chi(K(Q))=\\delta$ ?\n\nWe also ask whether the upper bound from Theorem 6.3 is tight, particularly if $\\delta \\geqslant 3$.\nQuestion 7.6. Does there exist a $\\delta$-chromatic quadruple system $Q$ and a $K(Q)$ such that $\\chi(K(Q))=2 \\delta$ ?\n\nFinally, we note that the question of colouring Kirkman triple systems can be generalized in several ways. It would be interesting to study colourings of resolvable $\\operatorname{BIBD}(v, k, \\lambda)$ for arbitrary values of $k$ and/or $\\lambda$. Another natural extension would be to consider colourings of resolvable $\\ell$-cycle decompositions of the complete graph (or the complete graph with a 1-factor $I$ removed, for even orders). More generally, the Oberwolfach Problem $\\mathrm{OP}(F)$ asks, given a 2 -regular graph $F$ of order $v$, whether there exists a 2 -factorization of $K_{v}$ or $K_{v}-I$ in which each 2 -factor is isomorphic to $F$ (see [7] for further details); requiring a solution to the Oberwolfach Problem or its variants (such as the Hamilton-Waterloo Problem) which satisfies vertex-colouring properties provides an open area of study.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 8 Acknowledgements \n\nWe thank Petteri Kaski for providing us with the collection of 66,937 KTS(21) having nontrivial automorphism groups.

Below we provide details for how to obtain such a colouring for each of these designs. We also found that 13 of the $\\operatorname{KTS}(33)$ which are 1-rotational over the cyclic group from [5] are 3 -chromatic, and provide the details of a colouring of one such system.\n\nWe first consider the systems from [33]. In each case the point set is $V=\\mathbb{Z}_{33}$.
