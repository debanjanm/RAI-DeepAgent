Our main results include a new superhedging duality for American options when wealth processes can be negative and trading strategies are subject to a cone constraint.

Some earliest results include [50], [20], [38]. Discrete-time versions were obtained in [14], [27]. Versions of FTAP for general semimartingales in continuous time were given in [15], [18]. The authors introduced therein the condition No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk (NFLVR) and proved that it is equivalent to the existence of local martingale measures (for locally bounded semimartingales). We refer to [19] for a comprehensive treatment of noarbitrage pricing theory.\n\nThe NFLVR condition provides a typical framework where the problems of pricing, hedging or portfolio optimization can be formulated. However, requiring absence of free lunches with vanishing risk can sometimes be restrictive: in a model with the three-dimensional Bessel process (see [17]) or in the Stochastic Portfolio Theory of [24], the NFLVR condition fails and arbitrage opportunities may arise. Several approaches have been proposed for such models. One could apply the benchmark approach: a pricing theory under physical measure, developed in [46], see also [47]. Alternatively, one could try to develop a theory based on a weaker noarbitrage condition. No Unbounded Profit with Bounded Risk (NUPBR), introduced in [32], is such an alternative. The authors in [32] showed that the problems of pricing and utility\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *The second author gratefully acknowledges the support of the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) through grant K 143529 and also within the framework of the Thematic Excellence Program 2021 (National Research subprogramme \"Artificial intelligence, large networks, data security: mathematical foundation and applications\").\n\nmaximization can still be solved under NUPBR. In [35], the author proved the equivalence of NUPBR and the existence of a local martingale deflator for one dimensional asset price processes. The paper [56] extended this result to a multidimensional semimartingale setting. The connection of NUPBR and numerair\u00e9 portfolios was discussed in [12]. In a diffusion setting, [51] developed pricing equations and hedging formulas under NUPBR. See also [25] for other concepts of no-arbitrage.\n\nUnder arbitrage, pricing and hedging become much more complicated for American options. These are derivatives which give holders the right to exercise an option at any instant (stopping time) until a given future date. In the pioneering work [39], the author transformed the pricing problem for an American option into a free boundary problem. The option price was computed explicitly up to the optimal stopping boundary. The idea was investigated further by [58]. Financial hedging arguments for American claims was introduced later in [5], [30], and [31] for diffusion settings. For the optimal stopping and free boundary problems, we refer to the book [44]. In another line of research, techniques with variational inequalities, BSDEs were applied to compute the prices of American options in [6] and [28], [21], [22], among other papers. Summary of the most essential results on the pricing of American options are discussed in [41].\n\nMost of the literature on American options assumes that an equivalent local martingale measure (ELMM) exists. In the absence of ELMMs, the problems are little studied, with the exceptions of [3], [34]. As observed by C. Kardaras, in the absence of an ELMM it is not optimal to exercise an American call option (written on a non-dividend-paying stock) only at the maturity date. Can one then characterize, or compute, the optimal exercise time? The latter question was answered in [3] where the optimal stopping time to exercise American call options was derived. The solution is meaningful for option holders. However, from the sellers' perspective, this is not enough and the following questions arise naturally:\n\nQ1: How can we provide a hedging argument for the seller?\nMore generally, in [23], see also in [24], the authors posed the following problem:\nQ2: Develop a theory for pricing American contingent claims without EMMs.\nIn the first part of this paper, we introduce a new framework to study the problems of pricing and hedging for American options in the absence of EMMs, or, more precisely, when the condition NFLVR holds only locally (that is, up to a sequence of stopping times) and not globally. The framework covers many interesting situations where arbitrage opportunities exist, as explained above. Unlike previous studies, in our setting option sellers continue trading after the exercise time chosen by buyers to lower hedging price. The mathematical background is, as usual, the closedness of the set of hedgeable claims in appropriate topological spaces. We employ an idea with product spaces which is rooted in [9] for discrete time models, in [10] for super-replication under model uncertainty and transaction costs. In addition, our techniques require the whole machinery developed in [15]. As far as we know, the current paper is the first to study local viability in general frictionless market settings when portfolios are allowed to be negative and strategies take values in a convex cone.\n\nWe obtain new pricing systems which are more complex than the local martingale deflators developed in [32], [35], [56], [12], just to mention a few. Importantly, under the local NFLVR condition, we are able to establish the existence of superhedging strategies for American options by using the new framework and superhedging duality by using the new pricing systems. A superhedging duality result for American option were given in [34] for continuous price processes using tools in stochastic analysis such as optional decomposition (we believe that these results of [34] could be extended to c\u00e0dl\u00e0g price processes by using the general optional decomposition given in [55]). Nevertheless, the duality of [34] is less practical than ours since sellers in their\n\nframework have to stop trading after the exercise time. In addition, our arguments purely rely on analysis, do not involve change of num\u00e9raire techniques or optional decomposition, and thus are applicable not only to negative portfolios but also when other factors, such as dividends, liquidity costs, etc., are taken into account. Let us recall the paper [36] which explains that the notion of num\u00e9raire portfolio is only available for nonnegative processes, and asked for different, appropriate tools for working with negative wealth processes, see Remark 1.12 therein. Such requests are particularly useful for utility maximization problems, where the initial capital is fixed.\n\nIn the second part of the paper, we study the pricing and hedging problems for European option. It is shown that the new superhedging duality can be stated by using only the concept of Equivalent Local Martingale Deflator, see [35]. It is noted that the new duality works with negative portfolios, trading constraints, and the approach is suitable for more complex situations.\n\nTo sum up, we provide a complete answer for the questions Q1 and Q2 (recalled above). It is worth emphasizing that even when the market satisfies the global NFLVR condition, our approach for American options is new and may be used in future work.\n\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. The new approach and results for American option are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses results for European options. Proofs are given in Section 5. Section 6 collects useful auxiliary material.\n\nNotations. Let $I$ be some index set and $X_{i}, i \\in I$ be sets. In the product space $\\mathbf{X}=\\prod_{i \\in I} X_{i}$, a vector $\\left(f^{i}\\right)_{i \\in I}$ will be denoted by $\\mathbf{f}$. If there are orderings $\\geq_{i}$ given on each $X_{i}$ then we write $\\mathbf{f} \\geq \\mathbf{g}$ if $f^{i} \\geq_{i} g^{i}$ for all $i \\in I$. If $1 \\in X_{i}$ for all $i$ then $\\mathbf{1}$ denotes the vector with all coordinates equal to 1 and $\\mathbf{1}^{i}$ denotes the vector with coordinate $i$ equal to 1 and the other coordinates zero. Similarly, when $0 \\in X_{i}, \\mathbf{0}$ denotes the vector all of whose coordinates equal 0 . We denote by $L^{0}(\\mathcal{F}, P)$ the vector space of (equivalence classes of) random variables on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$, equipped with the metric $d_{0}(X, Y)=E[|X-Y| \\wedge 1]$ for any $X, Y \\in L^{0}(\\mathcal{F}, P)$. As usual, $L^{p}(\\mathcal{F}, P), p \\in[1, \\infty]$ is the space of $p$-integrable (resp. bounded) random variables equipped with the standard $\\|\\cdot\\|_{p}$ norm.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 The model \n\nLet $T>0$ be a fixed time horizon.

For simplicity, we also assume $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{F}_{T}$. Consider a financial market model with $1 \\leq d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ risky assets $S=\\left(\\mathcal{S}^{i}\\right)_{1 \\leq i \\leq d}$ and one risk-free asset whose price is assumed to be one at all times. Assume that $S$ is an $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$-valued, adapted and locally bounded semimartingale.

It was called BK in [29].\n\nDefinition 2.5. The price process $S$ admits an unbounded profit with bounded risk (UPBR $\\left.{ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}\\right)$ if there exists a sequence of admissible strategies $H_{n} \\in \\mathcal{A}_{1}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that the corresponding terminal wealth processes are unbounded in probability, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{m \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} P\\left(\\left|H_{n} \\cdot S_{T}\\right| \\geq m\\right)>0\n$$\n\nIf no such sequence exists, we say that the price process $S$ satisfies the NUPBR $\\left.{ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}\\right)$ condition.\nThe No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk ( $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ ) condition is recalled from [15] (when $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$ ), [32] and its local version is also introduced below.\n\nDefinition 2.6. (i) The price process $S$ satisfies the $N F L V R_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition if for any sequence $H_{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $H_{n} \\in \\mathcal{A}_{1 / n}$, and $H_{n} \\cdot S_{T}$ converges a.s. to some limit $W \\in[0, \\infty]$, then $W=0$, a.s.\n(ii) The price process $S$ satisfies the local $N F L V R_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition with respect to the localizing sequence $\\mathcal{T}=\\left\\{T_{k}, k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$ if for every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the stopped process $S_{t}^{k}=S_{t \\wedge T_{k}}$ satisfies the condition $N F L V R_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ on $\\left[0, T \\wedge T_{k}\\right]$.\n\nFor the case without trading constraints, a general version of the first FTAP was given in Corollary 1.2 of [15]. For a comprehensive theory of arbitrage, we refer to the book [19].\n\nTheorem 2.7. For a locally bounded semimartingale $S$, the condition $N F L V R_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ when $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$ is equivalent to the existence of a probability $Q \\sim P$ such that $S$ is a local $Q$-martingale.\n\nThe global NFLVR ${ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition is a special case of the local NFLVR ${ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition when the localizing sequence contains only the terminal time $T$. When $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$, it is known that $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ $=\\mathrm{NUPBR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}+\\mathrm{NA}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ in frictionless settings, see Corollary 3.8 of [15], Lemma 2.2 of [29] and Proposition 4.2 of [32]. Furthermore, local NUPBR ${ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ is equivalent to global NUPBR ${ }_{\\mathfrak{C}}$, while the local $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition does not imply the global $\\mathrm{NA}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ one, see [51], Example 4.6 of [32]. Therefore, it is possible to have arbitrage opportunities under the local $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition.\n\nEquivalent local martingale deflators were introduced in [35], which play the same roles as equivalent martingale measures.\n\nDefinition 2.8. Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$. Define $\\mathcal{X}_{x}=\\left\\{x+H \\cdot S_{T}, H \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}\\right\\}$. An equivalent local martingale deflator (ELMD) is a nonnegative process $Y$ with $Y_{0}=1$ and $Y_{T}>0, P$-a.s. such that $Y X$ is a local martingale for all $X \\in \\mathcal{X}$. Since $1 \\in \\mathcal{X}$, an ELMD is in particular a strictly positive local martingale.\n\nWhen $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$ and $S$ is a one dimensional semimartingale, 35 proved the equivalence between NUPBR $_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ and the existence of an ELMD. By introducing the concept of strict sigmamartingale density, 56 generalized the result for finite-dimensional semimartingale settings using a change of num\u00e9raire technique. 11 proved the equivalence between NUPBR $_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ and the existence of a strict sigma-martingale for continuous semimartingales by using only stochastic calculus. It is worth noting that all of the previous studies focus on nonnegative portfolios.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Pricing and hedging American options \n\nDefine $\\mathbb{T}:=\\{\\tau: \\tau$ is a stopping time taking values in $[0, T]\\}$. An American option is an optional process $\\Phi_{t}, t \\in[0, T]$ giving its holders the payoff $\\Phi_{\\tau}$ when exercised at time $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}$. An European option is a special case when $\\mathbb{T}=\\left\\{T^{\\sharp}\\right\\}$ where $T^{\\sharp} \\in(0, T]$ is the maturity of the European option. Here, the option maturity $T^{\\sharp}$ could be strictly smaller than the trading horizon $T$. A Bermudan option is also a special case where the set of possible exercise times is finite. Let $\\mathcal{T}=\\left\\{T_{k}, k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}$ be a localizing sequence. The following conditions will be imposed.\n\nAssumption 3.1. (i) $S$ satisfies the local NFLVR $_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition w.r.t. $\\mathcal{T}$.\n(ii) $\\Phi$ is a.s. lower-semicontinuous from the right: for almost every $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, for all $t \\in[0, T]$, if $t<t_{n} \\in[0, T], n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ converges to $t$ then $\\liminf _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\Phi_{t_{n}}(\\omega) \\geq \\Phi_{t}(\\omega)$.\n\nAssumption 3.1 is very general and includes most of interesting models. In classical settings, the superhedging price of the American option $\\Phi$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\inf \\left\\{z: \\exists H \\in \\mathcal{A} \\text { such that } z+H \\cdot S_{\\tau} \\geq \\Phi_{\\tau}, \\text { a.s., for any } \\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFor hedging, the option seller has to find one strategy $H$ which dominates the American payoff at any stopping time. In the presence of arbitrage opportunities, the seller may prefer to continue trading after the stopping time $\\tau$ chosen by the option buyer and exploit such riskless opportunities to reduce hedging prices. Notably, the trading strategy after the exercise time $\\tau$ may be different from the strategy before $\\tau$. For this modelling purpose, we need to consider a generalization of admissibility. Let $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}$ be a stopping time and $v$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}$-measurable random variable. We define\n$\\mathcal{A}_{x}(\\tau, v):=\\left\\{H\\right.$ such that $H_{t} 1_{\\tau<t} \\in \\mathcal{L}(S), H_{t}(\\omega) 1_{\\tau<t} \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ and $\\left.v+\\int_{\\tau}^{t} H_{u} d S_{u} \\geq-x, \\forall \\tau \\leq t \\leq T\\right\\}$\nand $\\mathcal{A}(\\tau, v)=\\cup_{x \\geq 0} \\mathcal{A}_{x}(\\tau, v)$. We define the set of $x$-generalized strategies by\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x}^{\\tau}=\\left\\{\\widetilde{H}=(H,(H(\\tau))_{\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}}), H \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x} \\text { and } H(\\tau) 1_{[[[\\tau, T]]} \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}\\left(\\tau, \\int_{0}^{\\tau} H_{u} d S_{u}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{H}_{t}(\\tau):=H_{t} 1_{t \\leq \\tau}+H_{t}(\\tau) 1_{t>\\tau}, \\forall \\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}\n$$\n\nDefine also $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\tau}=\\cup_{x>0} \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x}^{\\tau}$. For each $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}$, the strategy $\\widetilde{H}_{t}(\\tau)$ in (6) is also predictable. For each strategy $\\widetilde{H}=\\left(H,(H(\\tau))_{\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}}\\right), H$ represents the strategy that the seller uses before the exercise time $\\tau$, and $H(\\tau) 1_{[[[\\tau, T]]}$ is the strategy used after time $\\tau$. Note that a strategy $\\widetilde{H}$, parametrized\n\nby $\\tau$, is an infinite dimensional vector of admissible trading strategies. For a strategy $\\widetilde{H}$, the corresponding terminal wealth is a vector $\\left(\\widetilde{H}(\\tau) \\cdot S_{T}\\right)_{\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}}$. The new admissibility notion allows to introduce the following definition of superhedging price, see similar concepts in [2], [4], [1],\n\n$$\n\\pi_{x}^{A}(\\Phi):=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\exists \\widetilde{H} \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x+z}^{\\tau} \\text { s.t. } z+\\widetilde{H}(\\tau) \\cdot S_{T} \\geq \\Phi_{\\tau}, \\forall \\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHere, the hedging portfolios could be negative, as long as the credit constraint $x$ is satisfied. Since $S$ is locally bounded, we may assume that $S_{t \\wedge T_{k}}$ is bounded without loss of generality. Let $t_{i}, i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be an enumeration of $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap[0, T] \\cup\\{T\\}$ with $t_{0}=T$. Define by $\\Theta$ the set containing all such $t_{i}$,\n\n$$\n\\Theta=\\left\\{t_{i}, i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn the following discussions, we will work with different product spaces. Recall that $S^{k}=$ $\\left(S_{t \\wedge T_{k}}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$ and denote $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\left(S_{t}^{k}\\right)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}, t \\in[0, T]$.

Such product topology is called the $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$-topology. Furthermore, we define\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma, b}:=\\left\\{\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma}: \\exists x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\text {such that }-x \\leq f^{k, \\theta} \\leq x, \\text { a.s., } \\forall k \\in D, \\theta \\in \\Theta\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe boundedness from below and above in (9) make $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma, b}$ a subspace. We note that $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma, b}=\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma}$ when $D \\times \\Gamma$ is finite and in general $\\mathbf{S}_{t} \\notin \\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta, b}$ unless $S$ is bounded. It is crucial to work with the subspace $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma, b}$ to establish Fatou-closedness of certain sets, see Proposition 5.3 later on. Under the global $\\mathrm{ NFLVR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition, there is no need to restrict to these subspaces. It is clear that $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma, b}$ is also a locally convex topological space, when equipped with the induced topology of $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, D \\times \\Gamma}$. Other product spaces, e.g., $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{0, D \\times \\Gamma, b}$, are defined similarly, see also [10] for product spaces and their duals. The product space $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta}$ admits the predual $\\bigoplus_{(k, \\theta) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta} L^{1}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t \\wedge T_{k}}, P\\right)$, which is not a Fr\u00e9chet space, but an LF space, see Appendix 6. Therefore we cannot apply the Krein-Smulian theorem (see in [52]) to $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta}$. Similarly, it is not easy to find the predual of $\\mathbf{L}_{t}^{\\infty, \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta, b}$ (see Theorem 8.12.1 of [42]) and check if the predual is a Fr\u00e9chet space, in order to use the Krein-Smulian theorem. It is also emphasized that in the proof of Theorem 2.7, the Krein-Smulian theorem plays a crucial role while in our paper it can't be used and we use a compactness argument instead.\n\nFor a generalized strategy $\\widetilde{H}$, we define the corresponding stopped processes\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{W}_{t}^{k, \\theta}(\\widetilde{H})=\\int_{0}^{t \\wedge T_{k}} \\widetilde{H}_{u}(\\theta) d S_{u}=\\int_{0}^{t} \\widetilde{H}_{u}(\\theta) d S_{u}^{k},(k, \\theta) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta, t \\in[0, T]\n$$\n\nFor $D \\times \\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta$, we set\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{x}^{D \\times \\Gamma}=\\left\\{\\left(\\widetilde{W}_{T}^{k, \\theta}(\\widetilde{H})\\right)_{k \\in D, \\theta \\in \\Gamma}: \\widetilde{H} \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x}^{\\Theta}\\right\\}, x>0 \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{0}^{D \\times \\Gamma}=\\left\\{\\left(\\widetilde{W}_{T}^{k, \\theta}(\\widetilde{H})\\right)_{k \\in D, \\theta \\in \\Gamma}: \\widetilde{H} \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\Theta}\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\mathbf{C}}_{0}^{D \\times \\Gamma}=\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{0}^{D \\times \\Gamma}-\\mathbf{L}_{T,+}^{0, D \\times \\Gamma}\\right) \\\\\n& \\widetilde{\\mathbf{C}}^{D \\times \\Gamma}=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{C}}_{0}^{D \\times \\Gamma} \\bigcap \\mathbf{L}_{T}^{\\infty, \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta, b}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we define $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}^{\\Theta}=\\cup_{x>0} \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x}^{\\Theta}$ and\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x}^{\\Theta}=\\left\\{\\widetilde{H}=(H,(H(\\theta))_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}), H \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x} \\text { and } H(\\theta) 1_{[\\mid \\theta, T]]} \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}\\left(\\theta, \\int_{0}^{\\theta} H_{u} d S_{u}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe local $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathfrak{C}}$ condition is reformulated as below.\n\nProposition 3.2.

Under Assumption 3.1, for any $\\emptyset \\neq D \\times \\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta$ such that $T \\in \\Gamma$, the convex cone $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{C}}^{D \\times \\Gamma}$ is $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$-closed.\n\nUsing the $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$-closedness, we apply the typical separation argument and obtain the new pricing systems below.\n\nDefinition 3.4. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be a localizing sequence and $\\Theta$ be defined as in (8). Let $D=\\left\\{k_{1}<\\right.$ $\\left.\\ldots<k_{p}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\Gamma=\\left\\{\\theta_{1}<\\ldots<\\theta_{q}\\right\\} \\subset \\Theta .

For each $\\theta_{j} \\in \\Gamma$, the condition (19) describes the supermartingale property of the deflated wealth processes after the exercise time $\\theta_{j}$. The condition (18) explains the supermartingale property of the deflated wealth processes between two exercise times $\\theta_{\\ell}, \\theta_{\\ell+1}$. Remark 3.7 below illustrates this effect. Note that we could always embed a $(D \\times \\Gamma)$-pricing system into a $(\\mathbb{N} \\times \\Theta)$-pricing system by setting $Z_{T}^{k, \\theta}=0$ for $(k, \\theta) \\notin D \\times \\Gamma$. The set of such pricing systems is denoted by $\\mathcal{Z}^{A}$, which is useful for computing superhedging prices of American options.\n\nIn particular, when $\\Theta=\\{T\\}$, the concept of pricing system in Definition 3.4 is reduced as follows.\n\nDefinition 3.5. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be a localizing sequence. A $D$-pricing system for $\\mathbf{S}$ w.r.t $\\mathcal{T}$ is a vector $\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\bigoplus_{k \\in D} L^{1}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{T \\wedge T_{k}}, P\\right)$ such that\n(i) $0 \\leq \\mathbf{Z}_{T}$ and $E\\left[\\sum_{k \\in D} Z_{T}^{k}\\right]=1$;\n(ii) For any $u \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ and any two stopping times $0<\\sigma \\leq \\tau \\leq T$ and $B \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}$, we have\n\n$$\nE\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{p} Z_{T}^{k_{i}, T}\\left(u \\cdot S_{\\tau}^{k_{i}}-u \\cdot S_{\\sigma}^{k_{i}}\\right) 1_{B}\\right] \\leq 0\n$$\n\nThe set of such pricing systems is denoted $\\mathcal{Z}$, which is used for pricing European options.\nExample 3.6. Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{n}$ and $d=1$. Assume $Q^{1}$ is an equivalent local martingale measure for the price process $\\mathcal{S}^{1}$. For each $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, denote $Z_{t}^{k}:=\\left.d Q^{1} / d P\\right|_{t \\wedge T_{k}}$. The vector $\\mathbf{Z}=$ $\\left(0, \\ldots 0, Z_{T}^{k}, 0, \\ldots\\right)$ is a $\\{k\\}$-pricing system. The vector $\\mathbf{Z}=0.5\\left(0, \\ldots 0, Z_{T}^{k_{1}}, 0 \\ldots 0, Z_{T}^{k_{2}}, 0 \\ldots\\right)$ is a $\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}\\right\\}$-pricing system.\n\nRemark 3.7. Consider the case without constraint $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{n}, d=2$. Let $0<\\sigma \\leq \\tau \\leq T$ be two stopping times and $B \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\sigma}$. Recall that $\\mathcal{S}_{t}^{1, k}=\\mathcal{S}_{t \\wedge T_{k}}^{1}, \\mathcal{S}_{t}^{2, k}=\\mathcal{S}_{t \\wedge T_{k}}^{2}$ are the stock prices $\\mathcal{S}^{1}, \\mathcal{S}^{2}$ stopped at $T_{k}$.\n\n- The case $D=\\{k\\}, \\Gamma=\\{\\theta\\}$.

Consider the setting in Remark 3.7 for the case with no short sale constraint for the stock $\\mathcal{S}^{1}$. In this situation, all the equalities in the equations for $\\mathcal{S}^{1}$ are replaced by the inequality $\\leq$, and we get the supermartingale properties for the corresponding deflated versions of $\\mathcal{S}^{1}$.\n\nThe new pricing system also gives supermartingale property for wealth processes in the product framework.\n\nProposition 3.9. Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{n}$ or $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{*}$. Let $\\mathbf{Z}$ be a $(D \\times \\Gamma)$-pricing system for $\\mathbf{S}$ with respect to $(\\mathcal{T}, \\Theta)$.

The supermartingale property can be obtained by nonnegative wealth processes and ELMDs. For some $H \\in \\mathcal{A}_{x}$ and an ELMD Z, the local martingale $Z_{t}\\left(x+H \\cdot S_{t}\\right)$ is bounded from below by zero and hence a supermartingale. We get that\n\n$$\nE\\left[Z_{T}\\left(x+H \\cdot S_{T}\\right)\\right] \\leq x\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\nE\\left[Z_{T}\\left(H \\cdot S_{T}\\right)\\right] \\leq x-x E\\left[Z_{T}\\right]\n$$\n\nWhen $Z_{T}$ is a strict local martingale, the upper bound may be different from zero. In that case, $Z_{t}\\left(H \\cdot S_{t}\\right)$ is not a supermartingale, as expected under arbitrage.\n\nRemark 3.11. For non-negative wealth processes with initial capital $z>0$, the corresponding strategies must be in $\\mathcal{A}_{z}$. The closedness of the set of non-negative wealth processes with the initial capital $z$ in the semimartingale topology is proved in [36] by a change of num\u00e9raire technique. The author discussed in Remark 1.12 that the supermartingale property of discounted processes is not suitable when wealth is negative and asked for different techniques to work with negative wealth processes. In this paper, we investigate the situation where the initial capital $z$ differs from the credit constraint $x$, i.e., the wealth processes can be negative as long as they are uniformly bounded below by $-x$. Therefore, the set of wealth processes in our setting is larger than that of [36], which may lead to higher expected utilities and smaller hedging prices. The supermartingale property is preserved by the new pricing systems, as in Proposition 3.9.\n\nWe state a version of the first Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing. This time it is formulated in terms of pricing systems instead of martingale measures, noting that generalized strategies are used for trading.\n\nCorollary 3.12. [FTAP] Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{u}$ or $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{s}$. The following are equivalent:\n(i) Assumption 3.1 (i) holds;\n(ii) for any $(k, \\theta) \\in D \\times \\Gamma$ and $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{T \\wedge T_{k}}$ with $P(A)>0$, there exists a $(D \\times \\Gamma)$-pricing system for $\\mathbf{S}$ such that $E\\left[Z_{T}^{k, \\theta} 1_{A}\\right]>0$.\n(iii) for any $k \\in D$ and $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{T \\wedge T_{k}}$ with $P(A)>0$, there exists a $D$-pricing system for $\\mathbf{S}$ such that $E\\left[Z_{T}^{k} 1_{A}\\right]>0$.\n\nIn discrete time settings, versions of FTAPs under cone constraints were given in [45], [43]. In Application 3.2 of [45], the condition no time $t$ local arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable density $Z$ such that\n\n$$\nE\\left[Z\\left(\\operatorname{diag}\\left(S_{t-1}\\right)^{-1} S_{t}-1\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right] \\in \\widetilde{\\mathfrak{C}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{C}}:=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}: x \\cdot y \\leq 0, \\forall y \\in \\mathfrak{C}\\right\\}$. The conditions (18), (19) are close in spirit to (25), however, [45] considered the constraint $\\operatorname{diag}\\left(S_{t}\\right) H_{t} \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ instead.\n\nTo derive superhedging dualities for American options, we transform the superhedging problem for American options into the one for the corresponding European options in the product spaces. Since our setting allows arbitrage opportunities, the superhedging problem has solutions if trading strategies are bounded from below, see also [8] for similar ideas for utility maximization. Here, we assume that the credit constraint $x$ is fixed.\n\nProposition 3.13. Let $z$ be a real number and assume $\\Phi_{t} \\geq-x$, a.s. The following are equivalent:\n(i) There exists $\\widetilde{H} \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x+z}^{\\tau}$ such that for any $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}$\n\n$$\nz+\\int_{0}^{T} \\widetilde{H}_{u}(\\tau) d S_{u} \\geq \\Phi_{\\tau}, \\text { a.s. }\n$$\n\n(ii) There exists $\\widetilde{G} \\in \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x+z}^{\\Theta}$ such that\n\n$$\nz+\\int_{0}^{T \\wedge T_{k}} \\widetilde{G}_{u}(\\theta) d S_{u} \\geq \\Phi_{\\theta} 1_{T_{k} \\geq T}-x 1_{T_{k}<T}, \\text { a.s., } \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\theta \\in \\Theta\n$$\n\nOur second main result of the paper is the superhedging duality for American options.\n\nTheorem 3.14. Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{n}$ or $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{s}$. Let Assumption 3.1 be in force. Let $\\left(\\Phi_{t}\\right)_{t \\in[0, T]}$ be an American option. Assume that $\\Phi$ is bounded or $\\Phi \\geq 0$. Let $x>0$ be a fixed credit constraint such that $\\Phi_{t} \\geq-x$, a.s., for any $t \\in[0, T]$. There exists $(z, \\widetilde{H}) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\widetilde{\\mathcal{A}}_{x+z}^{\\mathbb{T}}$ such that\n\n$$\nz+\\int_{0}^{T} \\widetilde{H}_{u}(\\tau) d S_{u} \\geq \\Phi_{\\tau}, \\text { a.s. } \\forall \\tau \\in \\mathbb{T}\n$$\n\nif and only if\n\n$$\nz \\geq \\sup _{\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathcal{Z}^{A}} E\\left[\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\theta \\in \\Theta} Z_{T}^{k, \\theta}\\left(\\Phi_{\\theta} 1_{T_{k} \\geq T}-x 1_{T_{k}<T}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Section 5.5. Other ideas to transform problems with American options into ones with European options were discussed in literature, for example, in [57], [1]. It is also known that we need to enlarge the probability space to include uncertain exercise times. Under transaction costs, [57] introduced $\\mathfrak{T}^{m}:=\\left\\{t_{\\#}^{m}=k 2^{-m} T, k=0, \\ldots, 2^{m}\\right\\}$ and equipped the product space $\\Omega \\times[0, T]$ with the product measure $P \\otimes \\nu^{m}$ where the measure $\\nu^{m}$ charges only the points of $\\mathfrak{T}^{m}$ with equal weights $1 /\\left(2^{m}+1\\right)$. The concept of Fatou-convergence in $L^{0}\\left(P \\otimes \\nu^{m}\\right)$ therein and our Fatou-convergence are very much similar. As explained in [57], \"the expected \"value\" of an American claim is an expectation of the weighted average of \"values\" of assets obtained by the option holder for a variety of exercise dates\". The authors in [57] therefore introduced a specific class of coherent price systems which perfoms this idea. In a discrete time setting $\\mathfrak{T}=\\{1,2, \\ldots N\\}$, the paper [1] employed the enlarged probability space $\\Omega \\times \\mathfrak{T}$ and showed that superhedging prices of American options are exactly superhedging prices of the corresponding European options in the enlarged space, and the superhedging duality holds true. Our approach shares similar spirits to the two mentioned work, or in terms of mathematics, this could be seen by comparing the enlarged space $L^{0}\\left(P \\otimes \\nu^{m}\\right)$ to the product space $\\prod_{\\# \\in \\mathfrak{T}^{m}} L^{0}(P)$. However, there are some features that distinguish our approach from the mentioned studies. First, the approach with product spaces naturally incorporates stopping times under the local $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathbb{C}}$ condition, while the others may need more effort to work with stopping times. Secondly, it is possible to equip suitable topologies in continuous time settings (as the $\\mathbf{w}^{*}$ topology in our framework), and to give financial and geometrical meanings, in analogous to the classical settings where $\\mathrm{NFLVR}_{\\mathbb{C}}$ holds globally.\n\nA superhedging duality was also given in the book [34] where the case with continuous martingale is treated. In comparison, the superhedging price in the present paper may be smaller than that of [34], because the sellers could simultaneously exploit better credit constraints and arbitrage profits after the exercise time. On the other hand, the authors in [34] followed a stochastic analysis approach and employed the optional decomposition theorem for continuous semimartingales in general filtrations under the existence of strictly positive local martingale deflators, see also [33]. A general optional decomposition was given in [55]. Our approach is completely different and relies on functional analysis, instead.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4 Pricing and hedging European options \n\nSuperhedging dualities for nonnegative portfolios were discussed in Section 4.7 of [32], and in [37] by using the change of num\u00e9raire technique (without the existence of optimal hedging strategies), or in [34] by using decomposition theorem. A superhedging duality for European options is deduced from Theorem 3.14.\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{n}$ or $\\mathfrak{C}=\\mathfrak{C}^{s}$. Let Assumption 3.1 be in force.
