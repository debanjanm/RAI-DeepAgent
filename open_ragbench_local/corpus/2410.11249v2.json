The convolution potential $V: \\mathbb{T}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ has real Fourier coefficients $\\hat{V}(n), n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. The Hamiltonian $H(q, \\tilde{q})=f(q \\tilde{q})$, where $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, belongs to the Gevrey class. In other words, we are intended to prove a Kolmogorov-ArnoldMoser (KAM) theorem for equation (1.1).\n\nWhen $d=1$, the KAM theory of Hamiltonian PDEs is well established; see, for instance, [Kuk87], [KP96], [Way90], [Kuk93], [P96] and [CW93]. This equation is intrinsically interesting, when the spatial dimension $d \\geq 2$. However, the study of KAM theory for Hamiltonian PDEs with $d \\geq 2$ remains in its early stages. For $d=2$, [Bou98] developed a new method initialed by [CW93] to obtain the Gevrey smooth quasi-periodic solutions of NLS with analytic nonlinearity. His method relies on Newton iteration, Fr\u00f6hlich-Spencer techniques (i.e., multi-scale analysis), and the Malgrange preparation theorem. Later, [Bou05] introduced harmonic analysis and semialgebraic set theory to refine the techniques in [Bou98], proving the persistency of quasi-periodic solutions of NLS and NLW with analytic nonlinearity for arbitrary $d$, and he claimed the obtained solutions are analytic. However, he only gave a sketch of the proof, and there is a key coupling lemma seems unlikely to hold. We believe the sketch he described there can only obtain the Gevrey smooth solutions. This method is now referred to as the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) method.\n\nFor the case of finitely differentiable nonlinearity, Berti, Bolle, Corsi, and Procesi among others, ([BB10], [BBP10], [BP11], [BB12], [BB13], [BCP15], and [BB20], for example), improved the Nash-Moser iterative scheme and developed a novel multi-scale inductive analysis. They established the existence of finitely differentiable periodic or quasi-periodic solutions for NLS and NLW with finitely differentiable nonlinearity for arbitrary spatial dimension $d$.\n\nIn this paper, we aim to show that for (1.1) with Gevrey nonlinearity, most quasi-periodic solutions persist and the persisted solutions have the same Gevrey index as the nonlinearity. To state our results, we begin with the definition of a Gevrey- $(\\alpha, L)$ function. Let $\\alpha>1, L>0$, and let $K$ be a compact set of the form $K^{\\prime} \\times \\mathbb{T}^{n_{2}}$, where $K^{\\prime} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}$ is compact, and $n_{1}+n_{2} \\geq 1$. We define\n\n$$\nG^{\\alpha, L}(K)=\\left\\{\\varphi \\in C^{\\infty}(K):\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, L}=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n_{1}+n_{2}}}\\left(\\frac{L^{|k|_{1}}}{k!}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left\\|\\partial^{k} \\varphi\\right\\|_{C^{0}(K)}<\\infty\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $|k|_{1}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{1}+n_{2}}\\left|k_{j}\\right|, k!=\\prod_{j=1}^{n_{1}+n_{2}} k_{j}!$, and $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{C^{0}(K)}$ denotes the uniform norm for continuous functions defined on $K$. A function $\\varphi \\in G^{\\alpha, L}(K)$ is called a Gevrey- $(\\alpha, L)$ function. We refer to $\\alpha$ as the Gevrey index and $L$ as the Gevrey width of $\\varphi$. Furthermore, we define\n\n$$\nG^{\\alpha}(K)=\\underset{L>0}{\\cup} G^{\\alpha, L}(K)\n$$\n\nand functions in $G^{\\alpha}(K)$ are referred as Gevrey- $\\alpha$ functions. We assume $f, f^{\\prime}, f^{\\prime \\prime} \\in G^{\\alpha, L_{0}}([-1,1])$ for some $\\alpha>1$ and $L_{0}>0$.\n\nOne says $\\tilde{q}(\\tilde{x}, t)$ is a quasi-periodic function in time $t$ if there exist $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b}$ and $q(\\tilde{x}, \\theta) \\in$ $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{d+b}\\right)$ (here $\\tilde{x} \\in \\mathbb{T}^{d}, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{T}^{b}$ ) such that\n\n$$\n\\tilde{q}(\\tilde{x}, t)=q(\\tilde{x}, \\lambda t)\n$$\n\nWe say that $\\lambda$ is the frequency and $q(\\tilde{x}, \\theta)$ is the hull of $\\tilde{q}(\\tilde{x}, t)$. See [KP96] for the definitions of quasi-periodic function and its hull, for example.\n\nSelect finite Fourier modes $0 \\in\\left\\{n_{1}, n_{2}, \\ldots, n_{b}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. Denote $\\mathcal{R}=\\left\\{\\left(n_{j}, e_{j}\\right): 1 \\leq j \\leq b\\right\\}$, where $e_{j}$ is the $j$-th unit vector in $\\mathbb{Z}^{b}$. Let $\\operatorname{supp} \\hat{V}=\\left\\{n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{b}\\right\\}$. Then, the spectral of the operator $\\mathcal{L}:=-\\Delta+V(\\tilde{x}) *$ are\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\mu_{n_{j}}=\\lambda_{j}, & (1 \\leq j \\leq b) \\\\ \\mu_{n}=|n|^{2} & n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d} \\backslash\\left\\{n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{b}\\right\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $|n|^{2}=\\sum_{j=1}^{d}\\left|n_{j}\\right|^{2}$ and $\\lambda:=\\left(\\lambda_{j}=\\left|n_{j}\\right|^{2}+\\hat{V}\\left(n_{j}\\right): 1 \\leq j \\leq b\\right)$. Given $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{q}_{0}(\\tilde{x}, t)=q_{0}(\\tilde{x}, \\lambda t)=\\sum_{j=1}^{b} a_{j} e^{i \\lambda_{j} t+i n_{j} \\cdot \\tilde{x}}\n$$\n\nyields a solution to the linear equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{i} q_{t}(\\tilde{x}, t)=-\\Delta q(\\tilde{x}, t)+V(\\tilde{x}) * q(\\tilde{x}, t)\n$$\n\nThis solution is quasi-periodic and corresponds to a flow on a $b$-torus\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{T}^{b}=\\mathcal{T}_{0}\\left\\{\\left|a_{j}\\right|\\right\\}=\\left\\{\\sum_{j=1}^{b} z_{j} e^{i n_{j} \\cdot \\tilde{x}}: z_{j} \\in \\mathbb{C},\\left|z_{j}\\right|=a_{j}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe problem we study is the \"persistency\" of solutions (1.5) for the Gevrey perturbed equation (1.1). The term \"persistency\" in this paper is defined as follows:\n\nThere exists a quasi-periodic solution\n\n$$\n\\tilde{q}(\\tilde{x}, t)=q\\left(\\tilde{x}, \\lambda^{\\prime} t\\right)\n$$\n\nto (1.1), such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\lambda^{\\prime}-\\lambda\\right|<C \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left\\|q-q_{0}\\right\\|_{\\alpha, L^{\\prime}}<C \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor some $L^{\\prime}>0$. Here, $C$ is a constant depending only on $b, d, L_{0}, \\alpha$ and the bound of $\\lambda$.\nNote that the Gevrey index $\\alpha>1$ of the solutions here is the same as the Gevrey index of nonlinearity, and $\\alpha>1$ is arbitrary. In previous papers, the persisted solutions only have Gevrey index $\\alpha \\gg 1$, even if the nonlinearity is polynomial.\n\nIn KAM theory, the vector $\\left(\\hat{V}\\left(n_{j}\\right): 1 \\leq j \\leq b\\right)$ is typically considered as a parameter vector. This is equivalent to regarding $\\lambda=\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{b}\\right)$ in the same way. Thus, we take $\\lambda \\in I_{0}=[0,1]^{b}$ as parameters.\n\nHere is our main theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. For arbitrary $\\alpha>1$, let $H(q, \\bar{q})=f(q \\bar{q}), f, f^{\\prime}, f^{\\prime \\prime} \\in G^{\\alpha, L_{0}}([-1,1])\\left(L_{0}>0\\right)$. Fix $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$and let $I_{0}=[0,1]^{b}$. For $\\varepsilon$ sufficiently small, there exists a Cantor set $I_{0, \\varepsilon} \\subset I_{0}$ such that $\\operatorname{mes}\\left(I_{0} \\backslash I_{0, \\varepsilon}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. For $\\lambda \\in I_{0, \\varepsilon}$, there exists a quasi-periodic solution to (1.1) with frequency $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ (depending on $\\lambda$ ), whose hull $q(\\tilde{x}, \\theta)$ is in $G^{\\alpha, L_{0} / 2}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{d+b}\\right)$. Moreover, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\hat{q}\\left(n_{j}, e_{j}\\right)=a_{j}, \\quad 1 \\leq j \\leq b \\\\\n\\left|\\lambda^{\\prime}-\\lambda\\right| \\leq C \\varepsilon\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\sum_{\\substack{(n, k) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d+k} \\\\(n, k) \\notin \\mathcal{R}}}\\|\\hat{q}(n, k)\\| e^{\\frac{\\alpha k n}{2}|(n, k)|_{\\alpha}} \\leq C \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhich implies\n\n$$\n\\left\\|q-q_{0}\\right\\|_{\\alpha, \\frac{k_{\\alpha}}{2}}<C \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{q}(n, k)$ is the $(n, k)$-Fourier coefficient of $q(\\tilde{x}, \\theta), q_{0}(\\tilde{x}, \\theta)=\\sum_{j=1}^{h} a_{j} e^{i \\theta_{j}+i n_{j} \\cdot \\tilde{x}}$, and $C$ is a constant depending on $\\alpha, L_{0}, I_{0}, b$ and $d$ only.\n\nHere, the term $|(n, k)|_{\\alpha}=\\sum_{j=1}^{d}\\left|n_{j}\\right|^{1 / \\alpha}+\\sum_{j=1}^{d}\\left|k_{j}\\right|^{1 / \\alpha}$, and the weight function $e^{\\alpha L^{\\prime}|(n, k)|_{\\alpha}}$ corresponds to Gevrey- $\\left(\\alpha, L^{\\prime}\\right)$ regularity.\n\nThe following are some key highlights that we would like to emphasize:\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach based on the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) method to handle Gevrey smooth nonlinear perturbations. Unlike earlier works, which approximated the Gevrey Hamiltonian by analytic ones (see [Pop04] for example), we directly employ the Gevrey norm introduced in [MS02] (i.e., (1.2)). We find that the Gevrey norm possesses an almost equivalent norm described by Fourier coefficients, allowing us to use it similarly to the sup-norm of real analytic functions in most cases.\n\nTo apply the semi-algebraic techniques, we explored the relationship between the rate of polynomial approximation of Gevrey functions in Gevrey norm and the domain, and developed an effective strategy for the polynomial approximation of Gevrey funtions.\n\nDuring the Newton iteration, we need to estimate the Gevrey norm of the approximate solution $q\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)$. We apply the Markov Inequality to obtain the Gevrey norm estimate of $q\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)$ only from the sup-norm of $T_{r-1}^{-1}\\left(\\eta, \\eta^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $F\\left(q_{r}\\right)$ on a real domain.\n\nIn addition, as we have mentioned in the beginning, Bourgain only provided an outline of the proof of the persistency of quasi-periodic solutions for NLS and NLW using the CWB method in Chapters 19 and 20 of [Bou05]. There is a key coupling lemma in his argument, but he did not give a proof for this coupling lemma. The coupling lemma he claimed seems unlikely to hold, as noted by [Wan16], \"This is because the sizes of the resonant clusters are in general, much larger than their separation.\" In our paper, we exploit the strict concavity of $g(s)=s^{1 / \\alpha}$ to improve Lemma 7 of [Bou98] and obtain our Lemma 6.1. In Lemma 7 of [Bou98], the loss of the decay rate is $\\frac{1}{2} L$, while the loss of the decay rate in Lemma 6.1 can be arbitrarily small. This improvement helps us to get solutions with arbitrary Gevrey index $\\alpha>1$.\n\nMoreover, when applying the CWB method, the reality of the drifted frequency $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ is straightforward when the nonlinearity is polynomial or real analytic. However, for Gevrey smooth nonlinearity, the reality of the drifted frequency $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ seems not to be obvious. We provide a proposition in Appendix A to clarify this issue.\n\nHere are more remarks.\nRemark 1. It seems that the scheme in the present paper could apply to NLW by combining with Lemma 20.14 in [Bou05].\n\nRemark 2. Typically, when $d=1$, the second Melnikov conditions hold, and the solutions obtained from the classical KAM techniques are linearly stable. However, the linear stability of solutions obtained from CWB method is unknown. In 2010, [EK10] applied classical KAM techniques to prove the KAM theorem for NLS with analytic nonlinearity for arbitrary d, obtaining KAM tori that are analytic in time and $C^{\\infty}$ in space. For $d \\geq 1$, Yuan/Yua21] proved the KAM theorem for the generalized Pochhammer-Chree equations using the traditional KAM techniques,\n\nand the obtained KAM tori are also linearly stable. Recently, He, J. Shi, Y. Shi and Yuan [HSSY24] proved the the linear stability of the KAM tori without the second Melnikov conditions by combining the traditional KAM techniques and the CWB method. Thus, it seems plausible that the solutions here are also linearly stable.\n\nRemark 3. If we apply the amplitude-frequency modulation, as in [Bou95], [KP96], [PP12], [Wan19], [BB20], etc, we could replace the convolution potential $V(\\tilde{x}) *$ by the multiplicative potential $V(\\tilde{x}) \\equiv$ constant. However, for the simplicity of the argument, we do not pursue this in the present work.\n\nRemark 4. For more history and applications of the CWB method to Hamiltonian PDEs, we refer to [CW93], [Bou94],[Bou95], [Bou97], [Bou98], [Wan16], [Wan19], [Wan20].\n\nNotations. For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we denote by $a \\cdot b$ the standard product in $R^{d}$. The symbol $\\|\\cdot\\|$ denotes $l^{2}$ norm, $L^{2}$ norm or the operator norm corresponding to these norms.\n\nLet $K$ be a compact set, and $\\varphi \\in C(K)$. We denote the uniform norm of $\\varphi$ by $\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0}(K)}$.\nLet $C^{k}(K)$ be the set of $k$-times continuously differentiable complex-valued functions.\nWe set $0^{0}=1, \\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2, \\ldots\\}, \\mathbb{R}_{+}=\\{s \\in \\mathbb{R}: s>0\\}$.\nGiven an integer $n \\geq 1, \\alpha>1, k=\\left(k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ and $\\boldsymbol{L}=\\left(L_{1}, L_{2}, \\ldots, L_{n}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we define\n\n$$\n|k|=\\max _{i=1, \\ldots, n}\\left\\{\\left|k_{i}\\right|\\right\\}, \\quad|L|=\\max _{i=1, \\ldots, n}\\left\\{\\left|L_{i}\\right|\\right\\}, \\quad|k|_{\\alpha}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|k_{i}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{d}}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{L}^{k}=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\left|L_{i}\\right|^{k_{i}}\n$$\n\nLet $\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We denote by $\\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right]$ the subspace spanned by these vectors. If we use $k_{1}$ to denote an element in $\\mathbb{N}^{n}$, we use $k_{1}(j)$ to denote the j -th component of $k_{1}$, and the same convention applies to elements in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We write $\\boldsymbol{L}<\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\prime}$ to indicate that $\\boldsymbol{L}(j)<\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\prime}(j)$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq n$.\n\nWhen we say $I \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an interval of size $d$, we mean that $I$ is a closed cube with sides parallel to the axes, and each side has length $d$. Two intervals are said to be disjoint if their interiors are disjoint.\n\nLet $I$ be an interval. We denote by $C I$ the interval with the same center as $I$ but expanded by the factor $C$.\n\nWhenever we encounter a situation where a specific integer cannot be found, we will choose the closest integer.\n\nFor any positive numbers $a, b$ the notation $a \\lesssim b$ means $C a \\leq b$ for some constant $C>0$ depending only on $\\alpha, L_{0}, I_{0}, b$ and $d$. By $a \\ll b$ we mean that the constant $C$ is very large. The various constants can be defined by the context in which they arise. Finally, $N^{a-}$ means $N^{a-\\epsilon}$ with some small $\\epsilon>0$ (the precise meaning of \"small\" can again be derived from the context).\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide the definitions of Gevrey functions, the Gevrey norm, and the properties of the Gevrey norm. Section 3 and Section 4 describe the Lyapounov-Schimidt decomposition and the Newton iteration scheme. In Section 5, we state the Iterative Lemma and provide its proof, except for the measure estimates. Notably, we demonstrate that the estimate of the Gevrey norm can be obtained at each step by applying polynomial truncation and the Markov Inequality. In Section 6, we present the proof of the measure estimates in the Iterative Lemma. In Section 7, we give the proof of Theorem 1.1. Finally, Appendices A and B present two technical propositions, Appendix C states the matrixvalued Cartan-type theorem, Appendix D states some facts about semialgebraic sets, Appendix E presents the multi-scale reasoning for the large deviation theorem.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Gevrey functions and their properties \n\nIn this section, we provide the definition of Gevrey functions and some technical lemmas. In the Introduction, we have introduced the definition of a Gevrey- $(\\alpha, L)$ function for $L>0$. Here, we extend the definition by defining the Gevrey norm with different Gevrey widths. Let $\\boldsymbol{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$\n\nand let $K$ be a compact set in $n$-dimensional space. For $\\varphi \\in C^{\\infty}(K)$, the Gevrey norm is defined as follows:\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n}}\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{L}^{k}}{k!}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left\\|\\partial^{k} \\varphi\\right\\|_{C^{0}(K)}\n$$\n\nIf $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}<\\infty$, we say that $\\varphi$ is Gevrey- $(\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L})$ on $K$, denoted by $\\varphi \\in G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}(K)$. The vector $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is referred to as the Gevrey width of $\\varphi$. We also have\n\n$$\nG^{\\alpha}(K)=\\bigcup_{\\boldsymbol{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}} G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}(K)\n$$\n\nIn this paper, we frequently employ two distinct Gevrey widths. For clarity, we restate the definition in this context.\n\nLet $n_{1}, n_{2} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$. Let $K_{1}$ be a compact interval in $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}$ (corresponding to parameters) and $K_{2}=\\mathbb{T}^{n_{2}}$. Let $K=K_{1} \\times K_{2}$ and $L_{1}, L_{2}>0$. For a function $\\varphi(\\lambda, \\theta) \\in C^{\\infty}(K)$, where $\\lambda \\in K_{1}$ and $\\theta \\in K_{2}$, the Gevrey norm is defined as\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}=\\sum_{k_{1} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n_{1}}, k_{2} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n_{2}}}\\left(\\frac{L_{1}^{\\left|k_{1}\\right|_{1}^{\\alpha}} L_{2}^{\\left|k_{2}\\right|_{1}}}{k_{1}\\left|k_{2}\\right|}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left\\|\\partial_{\\lambda}^{k_{1}} \\partial_{\\theta}^{k_{2}} \\varphi\\right\\|_{C^{0}(K)}\n$$\n\nIf $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}<\\infty$, we say that $\\varphi(\\lambda, \\theta)$ is Gevrey- $\\left(\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}\\right)$ on $K$, denoted by $\\varphi \\in G^{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}(K)$. The parameters $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are referred to the Gevrey widths with respect to $\\lambda$ and $\\theta$, respectively.\n\nProposition 2.1 (Product). Let $\\boldsymbol{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}$ and $\\varphi, \\psi \\in G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}(K)$, then we have\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi \\psi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}\\|\\psi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, for $L_{1}, L_{2}>0$ and $\\varphi, \\psi \\in G^{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}(K)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi \\psi\\|_{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}\\|\\psi\\|_{\\alpha, L_{1}, L_{2}}\n$$\n\nThis proposition shows that $G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}$ is a Banach algebra.\nProposition 2.2 (Derivative). Suppose $0 \\leq \\boldsymbol{h}<\\boldsymbol{L}$ and $\\varphi \\in G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}(K)$. Then all partial derivatives of $\\varphi$ belong to $G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}-\\boldsymbol{h}}(K)$, and we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n}} \\frac{\\boldsymbol{h}^{m \\alpha}}{m!^{\\alpha}}\\left\\|\\partial^{m} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}-\\boldsymbol{h}} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}^{n}$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\partial^{m} \\varphi\\right\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}-\\boldsymbol{h}} \\leq\\left(\\frac{m!}{\\boldsymbol{h}^{m}}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}\n$$\n\nThis result is often referred to as the \"Cauchy estimate\" for Gevrey functions.\nProposition 2.3 (Composition). Let $L>0, \\boldsymbol{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{m}$, and let $K$ be an $n$-dimensional compact set, and $K_{1}$ be an m-dimensional compact set as previously defined. Let $Y \\in G^{\\alpha, L}(K)$, and let $u=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{n}\\right)$ be a mapping whose components belong to $G^{\\alpha, \\boldsymbol{L}}\\left(K_{1}\\right)$.

For detailed proofs, we refer to [MS02].\n\nWe now discuss the decay of Fourier coefficients of Gevrey functions. Let $\\alpha>1$ and $K=\\mathbb{T}^{d}$. Lemma 4.8 in [DG17] shows that if $f \\in G^{\\alpha, L}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{d}\\right)$, then $|\\hat{f}(k)| \\leq C\\|f\\|_{\\alpha, L} e^{-L|k|_{1}^{1 / \\alpha}}$, where $C$ is a constant independent of $\\alpha$ and $L$. However, with a minor modification to the proof, we can deduce a more intrinsic description:\n\nProposition 2.4 (Decay of Fourier coefficients). Let $\\alpha>1$ and $L>0$. If $f \\in G^{\\alpha, L}\\left(\\mathbb{T}^{d}\\right)$, then for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, we have\n\n$$\n|\\hat{f}(k)| \\leq\\left(\\frac{h(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)}{2 \\pi}\\right)^{d}\\|f\\|_{\\alpha, L} e^{-\\alpha(1-\\varepsilon) L|k|_{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nwhere $h(\\varepsilon, \\alpha)=\\left(\\frac{1}{1-(1-\\varepsilon)^{\\frac{1}{n-1}}}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}$.\nProof.

On the other hand, if the Fourier coefficients of a function $f$ exhibit sub-exponential decay, then $f$ is Gevrey function. In the following, we provide a precise description.\n\nWe first consider the Gevrey norm of $e^{i k \\cdot x}$.\nLemma 2.5.

Let $V$ be a Banach algebra with norm denoted by $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{V}$, and let $\\varphi: I \\rightarrow V$ be a $V$-valued map.

Taking the conjugate of equations (3.13), we can duplicate them as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\left(k \\cdot \\lambda^{\\prime}-\\mu_{n}\\right) \\hat{q}(n, k)-\\varepsilon \\frac{\\overline{\\partial H}}{\\partial \\hat{q}}(q, \\hat{q})(n, k)=0 & (n, k) \\notin \\mathcal{R} \\\\ \\left(-k \\cdot \\lambda^{\\prime}-\\mu_{-n}\\right) \\hat{q}(n, k)-\\varepsilon \\frac{\\overline{\\partial H}}{\\partial q}(q, \\hat{q})(n, k)=0 & (n, k) \\notin-\\mathcal{R}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe will see that the relation $\\hat{q}(-n,-k)=\\hat{q}(n, k)$ is preserved for the approximate solutions in Newton's algorithm. In fact, the second equality in (3.14) is simply $\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{P} \\bar{F}(q)=0$ modulo a Fourier transform. Therefore, up to a Fourier transform, (3.14) can be written as follows:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{P} F(q)=0 \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{P^{\\prime}} \\bar{F}(q)=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe also refer to both (3.14) and (3.15) as the $P$-equations.\nThus, the general procedure is to determine $\\hat{q}(n, k) \\|_{(n, k) \\notin \\mathcal{R}}$ (which depends on $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ and $\\lambda$ ) from the $P$-equations, and then substitute it into $Q$-equations to obtain the new frequencies $\\lambda^{\\prime}=\\left(\\lambda_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{b}^{\\prime}\\right)$. Note that the frequencies $\\lambda_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{b}^{\\prime}$ need to be real, otherwise the function (3.6) cannot represent a quasi-periodic solution to (1.1).

Assume that $|x-y|>M_{1}^{\\theta}$. Our goal is to achieve the desired off-diagonal decay by iteratively applying inequality (6.15). The iteration process continues until the distance between $w$ and $y$ becomes less than $2 M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}$, which serves as the termination condition.\n\nIn each iteration, the distance between $w$ and $y$ decreases relative to the distance between $x$ and $y$. Specifically, from (6.15), we observe that when the distance between $w$ and $y$ in all dimensions decreases by $2 M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}$, we obtain a decay factor of at least $e^{-M_{1}^{\\theta_{3}} c}$. We will analyze the decay in each dimension separately.\n\nSuppose that, in (6.15), for some $j$, the distance $\\left|z_{j}-w_{j}\\right|<M_{1}^{\\theta_{3}}$ is repeated $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}}$ times for a small $\\tilde{\\delta}$. After $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}}$ iterations, the repeated application of (6.15) leads to a decay of at least $e^{-M_{1}^{\\theta-\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}} \\cdot M_{1}^{\\theta_{3}} c}$, which simplifies to $e^{-(b+d) L M_{1}^{c}}$ under the condition $\\theta-\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}+\\theta_{3} c>c$.\n\nNext, consider the case where $\\left|z_{j}-w_{j}\\right|<M_{1}^{\\theta_{3}}$ occurs fewer than $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}}$ times. In this case, for every dimension, there is at most a loss of distance of $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\tilde{\\delta}}$. Without loss of generality, we assume that the distance between $x$ and $y$ in all dimension (i.e., $\\left|x_{j}-y_{j}\\right|$ ) is greater than $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\tilde{\\delta} / 2}$. Otherwise, the dimension with the greatest distance will provide the decay for those dimensions where the distance is less than $M_{1}^{\\theta-\\tilde{\\delta} / 2}$, with a small reduction in $L$ by $O\\left(M_{1}^{-c \\tilde{\\delta}}\\right)$.\n\nLet us now focus on each individual dimension. Take $x_{1}, y_{1}$ for example. Let $R$ denote the distance that contributes to the decay, then we have\n\n$$\nR+M_{1}^{\\theta-\\tilde{\\delta}} \\geq\\left|x_{1}-y_{1}\\right|\n$$\n\nWe refer to the distance that contributes to the decay as the decay distance. For $1 \\leq j \\leq R / M_{1}^{\\theta}$, denote by $l_{j} R$ the sum of the decay distances provided by (6.15) where $j M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}} \\leq\\left|z_{1}-w_{1}\\right|<$ $(j+1) M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}$. Denote by $l_{0} R$ the sum of the decay distances provided by (6.15) where $M_{1}^{\\theta_{2}} \\leq$ $\\left|z_{1}-w_{1}\\right|<M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}$. Clearly, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{R / M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} l_{j} \\geq 1\n$$\n\nThus, the total decay across iteration is greater than\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{l_{0} R}{3 M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} M_{1}^{\\theta_{2} c}+\\sum_{j=1}^{R / M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} \\frac{l_{j} R}{(j+3) M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} j^{c} M_{1}^{\\theta_{1} c} & \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{R / M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} l_{j}\\left(1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-\\theta+\\frac{3 \\tilde{\\delta}}{4}+\\theta_{1}}\\right)\\right) R^{c} \\\\\n& \\geq\\left(1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-\\theta+\\frac{3 \\tilde{\\delta}}{4}+\\theta_{1}}\\right)\\right) R^{c} \\\\\n& \\geq\\left(1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-\\theta+\\frac{3 \\tilde{\\delta}}{4}+\\theta_{1}}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{M_{1}^{c\\left(\\theta_{1}-\\tilde{\\delta}\\right)}}{\\left|x_{1}-y_{1}\\right|^{c}}\\right)\\left|x_{1}-y_{1}\\right|^{c} \\\\\n& \\geq\\left(1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-c \\tilde{\\delta} / 2}\\right)\\right)\\left|x_{1}-y_{1}\\right|^{c}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe inequality above relies on the facts that\n\n$$\n\\frac{R}{3 M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} M_{1}^{\\theta_{2} c} \\geq R^{c}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{j^{c} R}{(j+3) M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}} M_{1}^{\\theta_{1} c} \\geq\\left(1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-\\theta+\\frac{3 \\tilde{\\delta}}{4}+\\theta_{1}}\\right)\\right) R^{c}\n$$\n\nunder the assumption\n\n$$\nc<\\frac{\\theta-\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta}}{2}-\\theta_{1}}{\\theta-\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta}}{2}-\\theta_{3}}\n$$\n\nThe inequality (6.18) follows from\n\n$$\n\\frac{j}{j+3}\\left(\\frac{R}{j M_{1}^{\\theta_{1}}}\\right)^{1-c} \\geq 1-O\\left(M_{1}^{-\\theta+\\frac{3 \\tilde{\\delta}}{4}+\\theta_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich holds for all $j$.

Furthermore, noting that $\\left\\|\\Delta q_{l}\\right\\|_{\\alpha, A-(l+2) C_{1}, L_{l}}<\\epsilon_{l-1}^{1-}$, applying Lemma 2.11 and Lemma 5.2 again gives us the following estimate:\n\n$$\n\\left|\\partial\\left(S_{l}-S_{l-1}\\right)\\left(x, x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|<\\left(\\epsilon_{l+1}^{2}+\\epsilon_{l}^{2}+A^{\\alpha(l+2)^{C_{1}}} \\epsilon_{l-1}^{1-}\\right) e^{-\\alpha L_{l+1}^{(0,2)}\\left|x-x^{\\prime}\\right|_{\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nUsing induction again, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\partial S_{l}\\right\\|<C\n$$\n\nNow we prove Lemma 6.4 by double induction.\nFirst, we prove this lemma for $r=1$.

Let $f(M)=e^{M^{\\frac{1}{2}-c}}$ and denote by $f^{-1}$ the inverse of $f$. Combing the multiscale reasoning in the proof of Lemma 19.13 of [Bou05] and Lemma 6.1, we can confirm the statement $P(1, M, L-$ $\\left.\\left(f^{-1}(M)\\right)^{\\max \\left\\{\\frac{c_{2}}{\\lambda}, \\kappa, \\theta c\\right\\}-c}\\right)$ for $\\tilde{M} \\leq M<f(\\tilde{M})$.

We call the induction we have made by induction-1.\nAssume that Lemma 6.4 holds for $T_{l-1}^{\\sigma}$. Using (6.45) and Lemma 5.3, we obtain the statement $P\\left(r, M, L_{l}^{(0.4)}\\right)$ for $M<\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{l}$.

To establish this estimate, some further restrictions in the $\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)$-parameter space will be required. To describe these restrictions, we introduce the definition of sectional measure.\nDefinition 6.5.

In this article, when we say that a set has a semi-algebraic description, we always mean this, and we will not explain it again below.\n\nNoting that $\\left|k \\cdot \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right|>M_{1}^{-C}$, it follows that $G_{M^{2}}^{\\sigma+k \\cdot \\lambda^{\\prime}}$ fails to satisfy (E.42) for at most $M^{C}$ values of $k$.\n\nPartition $\\Omega=\\left[-M_{1}, M_{1}\\right]^{b} \\times\\left[-10 M_{1}, 10 M_{1}\\right]^{d}$ into $M$-interval. For $|n|>M$, if the $M$-interval centered at $(n, k)$ for some $k$ does not intersect with any bad $M$-interval, we place the interval in $\\Omega_{0}$. For $|n|<M$, if the $M^{2}$-interval $\\left(\\left[-M^{2}, M^{2}\\right]+k\\right) \\times\\left[-10 M^{2}, 10 M^{2}\\right]$ does not intersect with any bad $M^{2}$ interval, we place the interval in $\\Omega_{0}$. All remaining $M$-intervals are placed in $\\Omega_{1}$.
