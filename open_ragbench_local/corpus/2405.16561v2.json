InTRODUCTION\n\nGeneralizing Mantel's theorem from 1907 [18], Tur\u00e1n's theorem from 1941 [23] started the systemetic study of Extremal Graph Theory. Given a graph $F$, let $\\operatorname{ex}(n, F)$ denote the largest number of edges in a graph not containing $F$ as a subgraph (called $F$-free). Let $K_{r}$ denote the complete graph on $r$ vertices and $T_{r}(n)$ denote the complete $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices with $[n / r]$ or $[n / r]$ in each part (known as the Tur\u00e1n graph); and $t_{r}(n)$ be the size of $T_{r}(n)$. Tur\u00e1n's theorem [23] states that $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n, K_{r+1}\\right)=t_{r}(n)$ for all $n \\geqslant r \\geqslant 1$ and in addition, $T_{r}(n)$ is the unique extremal graph.\n\nLet $K_{t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{r}}$ denote the complete $r$-partite graph with parts of size $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{r}$ and write $K_{r}(t)=$ $K_{t, \\ldots, t}$ with $r$ parts. A celebrated result of Erd\u0151s and Stone [10] determines $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$ asymptotically:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)=t_{r}(n)+o\\left(n^{2}\\right)=\\left(1-\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\frac{n^{2}}{2}+o\\left(n^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nErd\u0151s [7] and Simonovits [21] independently improved the error term above to $O\\left(n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$. Simonovits [21] also showed that any extremal graph for $K_{r+1}(t)$ can be obtained from $T_{r}(n)$ by adding or removing $O\\left(n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$ edges. Later Erd\u0151s and Simonovits [9] determined the structure of extremal graphs for $K_{r+1}(t)$ for $t \\leqslant 3$ as follows.\n\nTheorem 1. [9] For $t \\leqslant 3$, every extremal graph $G$ for $K_{r+1}(t)$ has a vertex partition $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}$ such that\n\n- $G\\left[U_{i}, U_{j}\\right]$ is complete for all $i \\neq j$,\n- $G\\left[U_{i}\\right]=n / r+o(n)$,\n- $G\\left[U_{1}\\right]$ is extremal for $K_{t, t}$, and\n- $G\\left[U_{2}\\right], \\ldots, G\\left[U_{r}\\right]$ are extremal for $K_{1, t}$.\n\nThe restriction $t \\leqslant 3$ in Theorem 1 comes from our knowledge on $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n, K_{t, t}\\right)$. A well-known open problem in Extremal Graph Theory is proving $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n, K_{t, t}\\right)=\\Omega\\left(n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$ and this is only known for $t \\leqslant 3$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Jie Han is partially supported by a Simons Collaboration Grant 630884 and National Natural Science Foundation of China (12371341).

Let $\\mathcal{G}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k}\\right)$ denote the family of $k$-partite graphs with $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k}$ vertices in its parts and write $\\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)=\\mathcal{G}(n, \\ldots, n)$ with $k$ parts. Given a graph $F$, define $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k} ; F\\right)$ as the largest number of edges in $F$-free graphs from $\\mathcal{G}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k}\\right)$, and let $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}(n, F)=\\operatorname{ex}(n, \\ldots, n ; F)$ (with $k$ parts). (Trivially $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}(n, F)=\\binom{k}{2} n^{2}$ if the chromatic number $\\chi(F)>k$.) In 1975 Bollob\u00e1s, Erd\u0151s, and Szemer\u00e9di [2] investigated several Tur\u00e1n-type problem for multipartite graphs. Applying a simple counting argument, they showed that, for any $n, k, r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $k>r$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}\\right)=t_{r}(k) n^{2}\n$$\n\nThe main results of [2] were on the minimum degree that forces a copy of $K_{r}$ in the graphs of $\\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)$. This problem has been intensively studied and resolved when $k=r$ (frequently in its complementary form concerning independent transversals) [13-15,22], and more recently for $k>r$ [17] (certain cases are still unsolved). There are several other extremal results for multipartite graphs. Bollob\u00e1s, Erd\u0151s, and Straus [1] determined $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{r} ; K_{r}\\right)$ for all $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{r}$ and $r$. Let $k K_{r}$ denote $k$ vertex-disjoint copies of $K_{r}$. The problem $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{r} ; k K_{r}\\right)$ were studied more recently $[6,12,24]$ and settled by Chen, Lu, and Yuan [5] when $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{r}$ are sufficiently large ( $k, r$ are arbitrary but fixed). The minimum pair density of multipartite graphs that forces a clique was studied by Bondy, Shen, Thomass\u00e9, and Thomassen [3] and Pfender [19].\n\nIn this paper we study $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$, the multi-partite version of the Erd\u0151s-Stone theorem and Theorem 1. To give the precise value of $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$, we need the following definition. Given $a, t, n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{a} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, let $z_{t}^{(a)}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{a}\\right)$ be the $a$-partite Zarankiewicz number for $K_{t, t}$, that is, the maximum number of edges in a $K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graph with part sizes $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{a}$. For simplicity, we write $z_{t}^{(n)}(n)$ if $n_{1}=\\cdots=n_{a}$. We also write $z_{t}(m, n)$ for $z_{t}^{(2)}(m, n)$.\n\nTheorem 1 says that any extremal graph for $K_{r+1}(t)$ is the join of an extremal graph for $K_{t, t}$ and $r-1$ extremal graphs for $K_{1, t}$. Inspired by this, a natural guess of an extremal graph for its $r$-partite analogue is as follows. Suppose $k=a r+b$ with $0 \\leqslant b<r$. We start with an $n$-blowup of $T_{r}(k)$, which has $r$ classes and each class has either $a$ or $a+1$ parts. We add a $K_{t, t}$-free graph to one class with the most number of parts and $\\left\\{K_{1, t}, K_{2,2}\\right\\}$-free graphs to the remaining $r-1$ classes. If $r<k \\leqslant 2 r$, then it is easy to see (as in the proof of Theorem 2) that this graph is $K_{r+1}(t)$-free and has $t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n, n)+(k-r-1)(t-1) n$ edges, and therefore\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right) \\geqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n, n)+(k-r-1)(t-1) n\n$$\n\nIn this paper we first improve this lower bound when $t \\geqslant 2$ and $r<k \\leqslant 2 r$.\nTheorem 2. Suppose $t \\geqslant 2, r<k \\leqslant 2 r$ and $n \\geqslant 8 t^{2}$. Then $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right) \\geqslant g(n, r, k, t)$, where\n\n$$\ng(n, r, k, t):=t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(k-r-1) n+\\min \\{k-r-1,2 r-k\\}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{(t-1)^{2}}{4}\\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nThe following is our main result, in which we prove a matching upper bound when $t \\in\\{2,3\\}$ and $n$ is sufficiently large.\nTheorem 3. For any $t \\in\\{2,3\\}$ and integers $r$, there exists $n_{0}=n_{0}(r) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for $n \\geqslant n_{0}$ and $r<k \\leqslant 2 r$, we have $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)=g(n, r, k, t)$.\n\nIn fact, we conjecture that $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)=g(n, r, k, t)$ holds for all $t \\geqslant 2, r<k \\leqslant 2 r$, and sufficiently large $n$.\n\nA natural question is whether our result can be extended to larger values of $t$ and $k$. For larger value of $t$, although we can use $z_{t}(n, n)$ without knowing its precise value, we need several properties of this function in our proof. K\u0151v\u00e1ri, S\u00f3s, Tur\u00e1n [16] showed that $z_{t}(n, n)=O\\left(n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$ for $t \\geqslant 2$ and proving a matching lower bound is a well-known open problem:\n$(Z) z_{t}(n, n)=\\Omega\\left(n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$ for $t \\geqslant 2$.\nIt was shown $[4,8]$ that $(Z)$ holds for $t=2,3$. In addition, we will need the following properties.\n$(E 1)$ For any $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for large $n, z_{t}^{(a+1)}(n)-z_{t}^{(a)}(n) \\geqslant \\delta n^{2-1 / t}$.\n$(E 2)$ for any $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1]$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for large $n$,\n\n$$\nz_{t}(n, n)-z_{t}((1-\\varepsilon) n, n) \\geqslant \\delta n^{2-1 / t}\n$$\n\n$(E 3) z_{t}(m, n)-z_{t}(m-1, n) \\geqslant t-1$.\nWe can easily verify $(E 1)-(E 3)$ for $t=2,3$. First, a proof of $(E 1)$ from $(Z)$ for all $t$ is given in Section 3.3. Second, when $t=2,3,(E 2)$ follows from $z_{t}(m, n) \\leqslant(1+o(1)) m n^{1-1 / t}$ by F\u00fcredi [11] and $z_{t}(n, n) \\geqslant(1-o(1)) n^{2-1 / t}$ for $t=2,3$. Third, (E3) holds trivially because adding a vertex with $t-1$ edges to a $K_{t, t}$-free graph will not create a copy of $K_{t, t}$.\n\nWe do not know whether similar properties hold when $k>2 r$ : in (E2) we must deal with the $[k / r]$-partite Zarankiewicz number; we also need to replace $t-1$ by $\\Omega\\left(a^{2} t\\right)$ in (E3), which seems out of reach at present.\n\nTheorems 2 and 3 show that our problem is more complex than its non-partite counterpart, Theorem 1. Finally, we show that, when $r$ divides $k$, this additional complexity does not exist, and we give an analogue of Theorem 1, modulo the existence of a set of constantly many exceptional vertices.\nTheorem 4. For $r, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $r \\mid k$ and $t=2,3$, there exist $C_{0}, n_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that the following holds for $n \\geqslant n_{0}$. Let $G$ be a $K_{r+1}(t)$-free $k$-partite graph with $n$ vertices in each part and $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$ edges. Then there is a vertex partition of $G$ into $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}$, each consisting of exactly $k / r$ parts of $G$, and a vertex set $Z \\subseteq V(G)$ with $|Z| \\leqslant C_{0}$ such that\n\n- $G\\left[U_{i} \\backslash Z, U_{j} \\backslash Z\\right]$ is almost complete for all $i \\neq j$,\n- $G\\left[U_{1} \\backslash Z\\right]$ is $K_{t, t}$-free, and\n- $G\\left[U_{2} \\backslash Z\\right], \\ldots, G\\left[U_{r} \\backslash Z\\right]$ are $K_{1, t}$-free.\n\nShowing $Z=\\varnothing$ in Theorem 4 requires an $a$-partite analogue of (E2), which is unknown for $a \\geqslant 3$.\nFor the rest of this paper we only consider $r \\geqslant 2$, as it is easy to see that Theorems 2-4 hold for $r=1$.\n\nNotation. Given integers $n \\geqslant m \\geqslant 1$, let $[n]=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $[m, n]=\\{m, m+1, \\ldots, n\\}$. We omit floors and ceilings unless they are crucial, e.g., we may choose a set of $\\varepsilon n$ vertices even if our assumption does not guarantee that $\\varepsilon n$ is an integer.\n\nWhen $X, Y \\subseteq V(G)$ intersect, $E_{G}(X, Y)$ is defined as the collection of ordered pairs in $(x, y) \\in$ $X \\times Y$ such that $\\{x, y\\} \\in E(G)$. Write $e_{G}(X, Y)=\\left|E_{G}(X, Y)\\right|$. For a vertex $v$ in $G$, let $N(v, X)=$ $N(v) \\cap X$ and $d(v, X)=|N(v, X)|$. Moreover, given $X \\subseteq V(G)$, let $e(X, G)$ be the number of edges of $G$ incident to the vertices of $X$. Given two graphs $G$ and $H$ on a common vertex set $V, G \\cap H$ denotes a graph on $V$ with $E(G \\cap H)=E(G) \\cap E(H)$. Given a $k$-partition $\\left\\{V_{1}, V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right\\}$, a set $S$ is called crossing if $\\left|S \\cap V_{i}\\right| \\leqslant 1, i \\in[k]$.\n\nWhen we choose constants $x, y>0, x \\ll y$ means that for any $y>0$ there exists $x_{0}>0$ such that for any $x<x_{0}$ the subsequent statement holds. Hierarchies of other lengths are defined similarly. Furthermore, all constants in the hierarchy are positive and for a constant appearing in the form $1 / s$, we always mean to choose $s$ as an integer.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Proof of Theorem 2 \n\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2, that is, $\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right) \\geqslant g(n, r, k, t)$ for $r<k \\leqslant 2 r$. Our proof needs a $t$-regular $K_{2,2}$-free bipartite graph with $n$ vertices in each part. It is well known (see [20]) that such graph exists for infinitely many $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n \\geqslant t^{2}$. The following proposition from [25, Section 2] allows $n$ to be any integer that is at least $8 t^{2}$.\n\nProposition 2.1. [25] For $t \\geqslant 1$ and $n \\geqslant 8 t^{2}$, there exists a t-regular $K_{2,2}$-free bipartite graph with $n$ vertices in each part.\n\nNow we prove our lower bound on $\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$ stated in Theorem 2.\nProof of Theorem 2. First assume $r<k \\leqslant 2 r$ and $t \\geqslant 2$. Let $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ be disjoint sets of size $n$ and, if $k<2 r$, let $V_{k+1}, \\ldots, V_{2 r}$ be empty sets. Let $G^{\\prime}$ be a complete $r$-partite graph with parts $V_{1} \\cup V_{r+1}, V_{2} \\cup V_{r+2}, \\ldots, V_{r} \\cup V_{2 r}$. Moreover, we add to $G^{\\prime}$ a maximum $K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graph with bipartition $V_{1} \\cup V_{r+1}$, and a $(t-1)$-regular $K_{2,2}$-free bipartite graph on $V_{i} \\cup V_{i+r}$ for $2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant k-r$ (the existence of such graph is guaranteed by Proposition 2.1). The resulting graph is $K_{r+1}(t)$ free because a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ has at most $2 t-1$ vertices in $V_{1} \\cup V_{r+1}$ and at most $t$ vertices in $V_{i} \\cup V_{i+r}$ for $2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant k-r$. This graph has $t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n)+(t-1)(k-r-1) n$ edges, and thus, $\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right) \\geqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n)+(t-1)(k-r-1) n$. This proves the theorem when $t=2$ or $k=2 r$.\n\nNow assume $r<k<2 r$ and $t \\geqslant 2$. Let $b=k-r$. Our goal is to give a better construction that shows\n\n$$\n\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right) \\geqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+\\min \\{b-1, r-b\\}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{(t-1)^{2}}{4}\\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nLet $V_{i, j},(i, j) \\in[r] \\times[2]$ be vertex sets, where $V_{b+1,2}, \\ldots, V_{r, 2}$ are empty sets and other sets have size $n$. Let $G=K\\left(V_{1,1} \\cup V_{1,2}, \\ldots, V_{r, 1} \\cup V_{r, 2}\\right)$ be the complete $r$-partite graph with parts $V_{1,1} \\cup$ $V_{1,2}, \\ldots, V_{r, 1} \\cup V_{r, 2}$. Thus $e(G)=t_{r}(k) n^{2}$.\n\nWe first revise the partition as follows. Let $t^{\\prime}:=[(t-1) / 2]$ and $b^{\\prime}:=\\min \\{b-1, r-b\\}$. Let $\\left\\{V_{i, j}^{\\prime},(i, j) \\in[r] \\times[2]\\right\\}$ be obtained from $\\bigcup V_{i, j}$ by moving a set $S_{i, 1}$ of $t^{\\prime}$ vertices from $V_{i, 1}$ to $V_{i+b-1,1}$, and moving a set $S_{i, 2}$ of $t^{\\prime}$ vertices from $V_{i, 2}$ to $V_{i+b-1,2}$, for every $i \\in\\left[2, b^{\\prime}+1\\right]$. For $i \\in[r]$, let $U_{i}:=V_{i, 1}^{\\prime} \\cup V_{i, 2}^{\\prime}$ and $H:=K\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right) \\cap K\\left(V_{1,1}, \\ldots, V_{r, 1}, V_{1,2}, \\ldots, V_{r, 2}\\right)$. Let $H^{\\prime}$ be obtained from $H$ by adding\n\n- a $K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graph on $U_{1}$ of size $z_{t}(n, n)$, and\n- a maximum $\\left\\{K_{1, t}, K_{2,2}\\right\\}$-free bipartite graph on $U_{i}$ for $i \\in[2, b]$.\n- $2 t^{\\prime}$ vertex-disjoint copies of $K_{1, t-1}$ on each $U_{i}, i \\in\\left[b+1, b+b^{\\prime}\\right]$, where the centers of stars are the $2 t^{\\prime}$ vertices of $S_{i-b+1,1} \\cup S_{i-b+1,2}$; then add a copy of $K_{t^{\\prime}, t^{\\prime}}$ on $S_{i-b+1,1} \\cup S_{i-b+1,2}$. See Figure 1.\nFor $i \\in[2, b]$, Proposition 2.1 implies that each $H^{\\prime}\\left[U_{i}\\right]$ is $(t-1)$-regular and thus for $i \\in\\left[2, b^{\\prime}+1\\right]$, $H^{\\prime}\\left[U_{i}\\right]$ has $\\left(n-t^{\\prime}\\right)(t-1)$ edges, and for $i \\in\\left[b^{\\prime}+2, b\\right]$ it has $n(t-1)$ edges; for $i \\in\\left[b+1, b+b^{\\prime}\\right]$, each $H^{\\prime}\\left[U_{i}\\right]$ has $2 t^{\\prime}(t-1)+\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ edges. Therefore, the number of edges in $H^{\\prime \\prime}, H$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& z_{t}(n, n)+\\left(n-t^{\\prime}\\right)(t-1) b^{\\prime}+n(t-1)\\left(b-b^{\\prime}-1\\right)+b^{\\prime}\\left(2 t^{\\prime}(t-1)+\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+b^{\\prime}\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+b^{\\prime} t^{\\prime}(t-1) \\\\\n= & z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+2 b^{\\prime}\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+b^{\\prime} t^{\\prime}\\left(t-1-t^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n= & z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+2 b^{\\prime}\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{(t-1)^{2}}{4}\\right\\rfloor\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. The lower bound construction for $K_{r+1}(t)$ with $r=5, k=8$ and $t=3$. The left figure is the standard construction similar to the one given in Theorem 1; the right figure is the construction presented in our proof of Theorem 3.\n\nWe claim that $H$ contains $t_{r}(k) n^{2}-2 b^{\\prime}\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ edges. Indeed, for every $i \\in\\left[2, b^{\\prime}+1\\right]$, the vertices of $S_{i, 1}$ moved from $V_{i, 1}$ to $V_{i+b-1,1}$ lose $n$ edges to $V_{i+b-1,1}$ and gain $n-t^{\\prime}$ edges to $V_{i, 2}$, thus having a net loss $\\left(t^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}$ edges between $U_{i}$ and $U_{i+b-1}$; the same holds for $S_{i, 2}$. Thus, our claim holds after summing over all $b^{\\prime}$ such rows, which implies that $e\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n, n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+b^{\\prime}\\left[\\frac{(t-1)^{2}}{4}\\right]$.\n\nAt last, we show that $H^{\\prime}$ is $K_{r+1}(t)$-free. Recall that by construction, every $U_{i}$ is triangle-free, $U_{1}$ is $K_{t, t}$-free, $U_{2}, \\ldots, U_{b}$ are $\\left\\{K_{1, t}, K_{2,2}\\right\\}$-free, and each of $U_{b+1}, \\ldots, U_{U_{b+b^{\\prime}}}$ induces vertex-disjoint copies of $K_{1, t-1}$ whose centers are joined by copies of $K_{t^{\\prime}, t^{\\prime}}$. Suppose $K$ is a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ in $H^{\\prime}$. By construction, $K$ contains at most $2 t-1$ vertices in $U_{1}$. We claim that $\\left|V(K) \\cap\\left(U_{i} \\cup U_{i+b-1}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant 2 t$ for $i \\in\\left[2, b^{\\prime}+1\\right]$ and $\\left|V(K) \\cap U_{j}\\right| \\leqslant t$ for $i \\in\\left[b^{\\prime}+2, b\\right] \\cup\\left[b+b^{\\prime}+1, r\\right]$, which will lead to a contradiction with $|V(K)|=(r+1) t$. Indeed, for $i \\in[2, r]$, if $K$ contains at least $t+1$ vertices in $U_{i}$, then these vertices induce either a copy of $K_{1, t}$ or $K_{2,2}$. By construction, this is only possible for $i \\in\\left[b+1, b+b^{\\prime}\\right]$ and in that case $V(K) \\cap U_{i}$ must intersect both $S_{i-b+1,1}$ and $S_{i-b+1,2}$. Furthermore, there exists $v \\in V(K) \\cap S_{i-b+1,1}$ and $v^{\\prime} \\in V(K) \\cap S_{i-b+1,2}$ such that $v$ and $v^{\\prime}$ are in different color classes of $K$. Since $v$ and $v^{\\prime}$ have no common neighbor in $U_{i} \\cup U_{i-b+1}, K$ induces at most two classes on $U_{i} \\cup U_{i-b+1}$. Thus, $\\left|V(K) \\cap\\left(U_{i} \\cup U_{i-b+1}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant 2 t$ and we are done.\n\nRemark. Note that for $t=2$, both our constructions give the same value, which means that the extremal graph is not unique.

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. Stability and proof outline \n\nLet us first consider extremal graph for $\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}\\right)$. Given $r, k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $k>r$, write $k=a r+b$ for $0 \\leqslant b \\leqslant r-1$. By Tur\u00e1n's theorem, the Tur\u00e1n graph $T_{r}(k):=K_{a, \\ldots, a, a+1, \\ldots, a+1}$ (with $b$ parts of size $a+1$ and $r-b$ parts of size $a$ ) is the unique largest $K_{r+1}$-free graph on $k$ vertices. The following definition shows that there are many extremal graphs for $\\exp _{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}\\right)$.\nDefinition 3.1. Let $\\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$ be the collection of $k$-partite graphs with parts $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ of size $n$ defined as follows. If $b>0$, we arbitrarily divide $V_{a r+1}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ into $r$ sets $W_{1}, \\ldots, W_{r}$ (some of them may be empty) such that each $W_{i}$ is a subset of $V_{j}$ for some $j$; if $b=0$, then let $W_{1}, \\ldots, W_{r}$ be empty sets. Now let $T$ be the $r$-partite graph with parts $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}$ such that\n\n$$\nU_{i}=W_{i} \\cup Z_{i}, \\text { where } Z_{i}:=V_{(i-1) a+1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup V_{i a}\n$$\n\nobtained from the complete $r$-partite graph $K\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right)$ by removing edges between $W_{i}$ and $W_{i^{\\prime}}$, $i \\neq i^{\\prime}$, whenever $W_{i}, W_{i^{\\prime}} \\subseteq V_{j}$ for some $j$ (in other words, $T=K\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right) \\cap K\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right)$ ).\n\nSince $T$ is $r$-partite, it is $K_{r+1}$-free. Let $U=\\bigcup_{i \\in[r]} U_{i}$ and $W=\\bigcup_{i \\in[r]} W_{i}$. Note that $e_{T}(U)=$ $\\binom{r}{2} a^{2} n^{2}$ while the number of edges of $T$ incident to $W$ is equal to $|W|(k-a-1) n=b(k-a-1) n^{2}$. Since $t_{r}(k)=\\binom{r}{2} a^{2}+b(k-a-1)$, it follows that $e(T)=t_{r}(k) n^{2}$. By (1.1), $T$ is an extremal graph for $K_{r+1} \\cdot{ }^{1}$\n3.1. A stability theorem. We need the following stability result for $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}(t)\\right)$. Given two graphs $G, H \\in \\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)$ on the same parts $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}$, we say that $G$ and $H$ are $\\gamma$-close if $|E(G) \\triangle E(H)| \\leqslant \\gamma n^{2}$.\nTheorem 5. For any $k, r, t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any $\\gamma>0$, there exist $\\varepsilon>0$ and $n_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that the following holds for every integer $n \\geqslant n_{0}$. Suppose $G \\in \\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)$ is $K_{r+1}(t)$-free and $e(G) \\geqslant\\left(t_{r}(k)-\\varepsilon\\right) n^{2}$. Then $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to a member of $\\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$. In particular, we have $e(G) \\leqslant\\left(t_{r}(k)+\\gamma\\right) n^{2}$.\n\nIn the earlier version of this paper, we gave a self-contained proof of Theorems 5. Here we derive it from a stronger result of Chen, Lu and Yuan [5, Theorem 1.5], in which they provide more structural information. Their definition and result are more general by allowing the parts $V_{i}$ of $G$ to have different sizes. Here we only state their definition and result that we need for the balanced case.\nDefinition 3.2 (Stable partition). Let $k \\geqslant r \\geqslant 2$ be integers. Let $\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{r}\\right\\}$ and $\\mathcal{V}=$ $\\left\\{V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right\\}$ where $\\left|V_{i}\\right|=n$ for all $i \\in[k]$ be partitions of a common vertex set. For $i \\in[r], j \\in[k]$, a set $W=P_{i} \\cap V_{j}$ is called an integral part if $W=V_{j}$, and called a partial part otherwise. We say that $\\mathcal{P}$ is stable to $\\mathcal{V}$, if each of $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{r}$ has the same number of integral parts and at most one partial part.\nDefinition 3.3 ( $(X, \\varepsilon)$-stable). Let $n, r, k$ be integers with $n \\geqslant k \\geqslant r \\geqslant 2$. For a given spanning subgraph $G$ of $K_{k}(n)$, let $\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{r}\\right\\}$ be a partition of $V(G)$ and $\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right\\}$ be the natural $k$-partition. Given $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1)$ and a set $X \\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $\\varepsilon n$, we say that $\\mathcal{P}$ is an $(X, \\varepsilon)$-stable partition if\n\n- $G-X$ is $\\varepsilon$-close to $K\\left(P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{r}\\right)-X$\n- $\\left\\{P_{1} \\backslash X, \\ldots, P_{r} \\backslash X\\right\\}$ is stable to $\\left\\{V_{1} \\backslash X, \\ldots, V_{k} \\backslash X\\right\\}$.\n\nTheorem 6. [5, Theorem 1.5] Let $F$ be a graph with chromatic number $r+1 \\geqslant 3$. For every $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $\\delta>0$ and integer $n_{0}>0$ such that the following holds for $n \\geqslant n_{0}$. Let $G$ be an $F$-free subgraph of $K_{k}(n)$ with $k>r$ such that $e(G) \\geqslant \\operatorname{ex}_{k}(n, F)-\\delta n^{2}$. Then, $G$ has an $(X, \\varepsilon)$-stable partition $\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{t-1}\\right\\}$ for some set $X \\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $\\varepsilon n$.\n\nNow Theorem 5 follows from Theorem 6 by setting $F=K_{r+1}(t)$ and noticing that i) a partition is stable if and only if it is a partition required in Definition 3.1 and ii) as $|X| \\leqslant \\varepsilon n, X$ is incident to at most $\\varepsilon n^{2}$ edges that we have no control on.\n\nWe remark that although Theorem 6 is stronger, the additional structural information is not immediately useful to us. For example, the set $X$ introduced in Theorem 6 is the set of atypical vertices of $G$ (see also the proof outline in next section). However, we need a stronger control and indeed we need to distinguish two kinds of atypical vertices. Identifying them from $X$ is almost equivalent to identifying them from $V(G)$. So we choose to present and use the easier and more classical version, Theorem 5, in this paper.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Indeed, Chen, Lu, and Yuan [5] showed that $\\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$ are all the extremal graphs for $\\operatorname{ex}_{k}\\left(n, K_{r+1}\\right)$ and described all extremal graphs for $\\operatorname{ex}\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k} ; K_{r+1}\\right)$.\n\n3.2. Outline of the proofs. Now we give an outline of our proofs. Let $G \\in \\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)$ be $K_{r+1}(t)$-free and has the maximum number of edges. Since $e(G)>t_{r}(k) n^{2}$, we can assume that $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to some $T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$. Since $e(G)$ is maximum, we can easily derive a minimum degree condition by symmetrization arguments.\n\nNext we define atypical vertices. Roughly speaking, there are two types of atypical vertices: the first type of vertices, denoted by $Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}$, are the \"wrong\" ones that do not exist in $\\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$; the second type of vertices, denoted by $\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right) \\cup \\bigcup_{j \\neq i} Z_{j}^{\\prime}$ for $i \\in[r]$, are the vertices that are not in $U_{i}$ but behave like the vertices of $U_{i}$, in other words, they are in the wrong place. We temporarily ignore the first type of atypical vertices because there are only a constant number of them (see $(P 1)$ and $(P 3))$ and they contribute only $O(n)$ to $e(G)$. For the second type of atypical vertices, there are only $o(n)$ of them (see $(P 1)$ and $(P 3)$ ) and we move them to appropriate rows and redefine our partition as $\\tilde{U}_{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{U}_{r}$ (see (4.2)). A key observation is that $Z_{j}^{\\prime} \\neq \\varnothing$ (namely, there is a vertex in $Z_{j}$ but behaves as a vertex in $Z_{i}$ ) only if $\\left|W_{j}\\right| \\geqslant(1-o(1)) n$.\n\nNow we estimate $e(G)$. We split $E(G)$ into $E_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right), \\ldots, E_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{r}\\right)$, and $E\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$, where $G^{\\prime}:=G \\cap$ $K\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{U}_{r}\\right)$. We have a relatively good estimate of $e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$ (see Claim 4.3) taking into account that the partition is no longer balanced. In contrast, due to the second type of atypical vertices, we can only show that each $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]$ is \"almost\" $K_{t, t}$-free (see Claim 4.4). Similarly, we show that all but at most one rows are \"almost\" $K_{1, t}$-free (see Claim 4.6). Assuming that $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right)$ is the largest among all $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right), i \\in[r]$, we can use these properties and give an upper bound of $e(G)$. Next we show that $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ has no atypical vertices (Claim 4.8), and thus $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right) \\leqslant z_{t}^{(a+1)}(n)$. We further refine our estimate on $\\tilde{U}_{i}, i>1$, and show that each second type atypical vertex contributes at most a constant number of edges to $E(G) \\backslash E\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$ (Claim 4.9). In summary, $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ is indeed $K_{t, t}$-free, $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)=O(n)$ for $i>1$, and $\\left|Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}\\right|=O(1)$, from which we conclude the proof of Theorem 4.\n\nTo prove Theorem 3, we refine earlier estimates as follows. We first show that $\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|=(1-o(1)) n$ and $Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$, where we use $(E 2)$. The rest of the proofs are further refinements of our estimates. In particular, we show that if $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|$ is not too small, then $\\tilde{U}_{i}$ essentially contains no vertex from other rows.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3.3. Two quick proofs. We first derive $(E 1)$ from $(Z)$. \n\nProof of $(Z) \\Rightarrow(E 1)$. Given $a+1$ sets $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{a+1}$ of size $n$, we define an $(a+1)$-partite graph $G$ on $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{a+1}$ as follows. Let $V_{2}^{\\prime}$ be a set of $n$ vertices consisting of $[n / 2]$ vertices from $V_{1}$ and $[n / 2]$ vertices from $V_{2}$. We place an extremal graph $G^{\\prime}$ for $z_{t}^{(a)}(n)$ on $V_{2}^{\\prime}, V_{3}, \\ldots, V_{a+1}$, in other words, $G^{\\prime}$ is an $a$-partite $K_{t, t}$-free graph with $z_{t}^{(a)}(n)$ edges. Next we add a maximum bipartite $K_{t, t}$-free graph $G^{\\prime \\prime}$ on the remaining vertices of $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$.

Suppose further that $e(G)>g(n, r, k, t)>t_{r}(k) n^{2}$. By Theorem $5, G$ is $\\gamma$-close to some $T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{r, k}(n)$ such that $T=K\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right) \\cap K\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right)$, where $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}$ is a partition of $V(T)$ satisfying the following properties:\n\n- $U_{i}=W_{i} \\cup Z_{i}$ such that $Z_{i}=V_{(i-1) a+1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup V_{i a}$, and\n- $W_{i}=\\varnothing$ if $b=0$ and $W_{i}$ is a subset of $V_{q_{i}}$ for some $q_{i}$ with $a r<q_{i} \\leqslant k$ otherwise.\n\nFor simplicity, we write $z_{t}(n)=z_{t}^{([k / r]}(n)$.\nThe fact that $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $T$ gives the following observation.\n(D0) for any $i \\in[r]$, there exists $B_{i} \\subseteq U_{i}$ of size at most $2 \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ such that for any $v \\in U_{i} \\backslash B_{i}$ and $A \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\}} U_{j}$ satisfying that none of the vertices of $A$ is in the same cluster as $v$ is, we have $\\bar{d}(v, A) \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$.\nTo see it, fix $i \\in[r]$ and write $U^{*}:=\\bigcup_{j \\neq i} U_{j}$.

The displayed line above implies that $\\left|B_{i}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ and $\\left|B_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. Now (D0) holds by setting $B_{i}=B_{i}^{\\prime} \\cup B_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nMinimum degree. For $i \\in[k]$, let $N_{i}:=N_{T}\\left(u_{i}\\right)$ for some $u_{i} \\in V_{i}$. Note that this is well-defined as the vertices of $V_{i}$ share the same neighborhood in $T$. Using the maximality of $e(G)$, we derive that for every $u \\in V_{i}, i \\in[k]$\n\n$$\nd_{G}(u) \\geqslant d_{T}(u)-2 t \\gamma n\n$$\n\nIndeed, since $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $T$, that is, $|E(G) \\triangle E(T)| \\leqslant \\gamma n^{2}$, for each $i \\in[k]$, we can greedily pick distinct $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t} \\in V_{i}$, such that $\\left|N_{G}\\left(u_{j}\\right) \\triangle N_{i}\\right| \\leqslant \\gamma n^{2} /(n-j) \\leqslant 2 \\gamma n$, for $j \\in[t]$. Let $N_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\bigcap_{j \\in[t]} N_{G}\\left(u_{j}\\right)$ and note that $\\left|N_{i}^{\\prime} \\triangle N_{i}\\right| \\leqslant 2 t \\gamma n$. In particular, $\\left|N_{i}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant\\left|N_{i}\\right|-2 t \\gamma n$. Now for a contradiction suppose there is $u \\in V_{i}$ such that $d_{G}(u)<d_{T}(u)-2 t \\gamma n=\\left|N_{i}\\right|-2 t \\gamma n$. Then we replace $N_{G}(u)$ by $N_{i}^{\\prime}$, that is, we disconnect all the edges of $u$ in $G$ and connect $u$ to the vertices of $N_{i}^{\\prime}$. Thus, we obtain a $k$-partite graph on the same vertex set as $G$ and has more edges than $G$. Therefore, by the maximality of $G$, this new graph contains a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$, denoted by $K$. Clearly, $K$ must contain the vertex $u$, as $G$ is $K_{r+1}(t)$-free. Moreover, $K$ must miss at least one vertex from $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t}$, say $u_{j}$, because the set $\\left\\{u, u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t}\\right\\}$ is independent in $G$ and $K$ has independence number $t$. However, as the neighborhood of $u N_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a subset of $N_{G}\\left(u_{j}\\right)$, we can replace $u$ by $u_{j}$ and still get a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$, which is in $G$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, comparing with the degrees in $T$, we derive that for any vertex $u$,\n\n$$\nd_{G}(u) \\geqslant \\begin{cases}(k-a) n-\\left|W_{i}\\right|-2 t \\gamma n, & \\text { if } u \\in Z_{i} \\text { for } i \\in[r] \\\\ (k-1-a) n-2 t \\gamma n, & \\text { if } u \\in W\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAtypical vertices. In this step we identify a set of atypical vertices, that is, those behave differently from the majority of the vertices. Let $W:=\\bigcup_{i \\in[r]} W_{i}=V_{a r+1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup V_{k}$. We define $W^{\\prime \\prime}:=$ $\\left\\{v \\in W: d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon n\\right.$, for all $\\left.j \\in[r]\\right\\}$ and $W_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\left\\{v \\in W: d\\left(v, Z_{i}\\right)<\\varepsilon n\\right\\}$. Then we have $W=W^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cup \\cdots \\cup W_{r}^{\\prime}$. Next, for $i \\in[r]$, let $Z^{\\prime \\prime}:=\\bigcup_{i \\in[r]} Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$, where\n\n$$\nZ_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}:=\\left\\{v \\in Z_{i}: d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon n, \\text { for all } j \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad d\\left(v, U_{i}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon n\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, let $Z_{i}^{\\prime}:=Z_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and write $Z_{i}^{\\prime}$ as $\\bigcup_{j \\in[r]} Z_{i}^{j}$, where $Z_{i}^{j}, j \\neq i$, consists of the vertices $v \\in Z_{i}$ such that $d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$, and $Z_{i}^{i}$ consists of the vertices $v$ such that $d\\left(v, U_{i}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$. The following are some useful properties of these sets.\n\nClaim 4.1. The following properties hold for all $i \\in[r]$.\n$(P 1)\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\gamma n$ and $\\left|W^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant C_{0}:=2 t \\varepsilon^{-r t}$.\n$(P 2) W=W^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cup \\cdots \\cup W_{r}^{\\prime}$ is a partition of $W$.\n$(P 3)\\left|Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant C_{0},\\left|Z_{i}^{j}\\right| \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ for $j \\neq i$, and $\\left|Z_{i}^{i}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) a n$.\n$(P 4) \\bigcup_{j \\in[r]} Z_{i}^{j}$ is a partition of $Z_{i}^{\\prime}$.\nProof. Recall the definition of $W^{\\prime \\prime}$ and that $d\\left(Z_{i}, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant 1-\\gamma$ for distinct $i, j \\in[r]$. Applying Proposition 3.4 to the graph $G\\left[W^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup Z\\right]$ with vertex partition $\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right)$, we obtain that $\\left|W^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant$ $C_{0}:=2 t \\varepsilon^{-r t}$. We next show that $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\gamma n$ for each $i \\in[r]$. Indeed, because $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $T$, we have $e_{G}\\left(Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right) \\geqslant a n\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right|-\\gamma n^{2}$. On the other hand, by definition, $e_{G}\\left(Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right)<$ $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right| \\cdot \\varepsilon n$. Thus, we get $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime \\prime} \\backslash W_{i}\\right|<\\gamma n /(a-\\varepsilon)<2 \\gamma n$, verifying ( $P 1$ ).\n\nTo see $(P 2)$, suppose there is a vertex $v \\in W_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap W_{j}^{\\prime}$. By definition, $d(v) \\leqslant(k-1) n-2(a-\\varepsilon) n<$ $(k-1-a) n-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$, contradicting (4.1).\n\nNext we show (P3). Fix $i \\in[r]$. Since $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $T$, we have $d\\left(Z_{j}, Z_{j^{\\prime}}\\right) \\geqslant 1-\\gamma$ and $d\\left(U_{i}, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant 1-\\gamma$ for distinct $j, j^{\\prime} \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\}$. Thus, we can apply Proposition 3.4 on $G\\left[U_{i} \\cup \\bigcup_{j \\neq i} Z_{j}\\right]$ (with the obvious $r$-partition) and obtain $\\left|Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant C_{0}$. Moreover, for $i \\neq j$, from $d\\left(Z_{i}, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant 1-\\gamma$ we infer $\\left|Z_{i}^{j}\\right| \\leqslant(\\gamma / \\varepsilon) n \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$, as $\\gamma \\ll \\varepsilon$. Therefore, we also get $\\left|Z_{i}^{i}\\right| \\geqslant\\left|Z_{i}\\right|-\\left|Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right|-\\sum_{j \\neq i}\\left|Z_{i}^{j}\\right| \\geqslant$ $a n-C_{0}-(r-1) \\gamma n / \\varepsilon \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) a n$.\n\nNow we show (P4). By definition, if $v \\in Z_{i}^{\\prime}$, then $d\\left(v, U_{i}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$; if $v \\in Z_{i}^{j}$ for $j \\neq i$, then $d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$. Thus, we have $Z_{i}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\in[r]} Z_{i}^{j}$ by definition. A vertex $v \\in Z_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap Z_{i}^{j}, j \\neq i$, satisfies that $d(v)<k n-\\left(\\left|U_{i}\\right|-\\varepsilon n\\right)-(a-\\varepsilon) n \\leqslant(k-a) n-\\left|W_{i}\\right|-(1-2 \\varepsilon) n$, contradicting (4.1). A vertex $v \\in Z_{i}^{j} \\cap Z_{i}^{j^{\\prime}}$ for distinct $j, j^{\\prime} \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\}$ satisfies that $d(v)<(k-1) n-2(a-\\varepsilon) n \\leqslant(k-a-2) n+2 \\varepsilon n$, contradicting (4.1) as well. Thus, $\\bigcup_{j \\in[r]} Z_{i}^{j}$ is a partition of $Z_{i}^{\\prime}$.\n\nFor $i \\in[r]$, our refined partition is defined by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{U}_{i}:=\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup W_{i}^{\\prime}, \\text { where } \\tilde{Z}_{i}:=\\bigcup_{j \\in[r]} Z_{j}^{i}\n$$\n\nThen $V(G)=Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup \\bigcup_{i \\in[r]} \\tilde{U}_{i}$. Note that for any $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{i}$, we have $d\\left(v, Z_{i}^{i}\\right) \\leqslant d\\left(v, Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant \\varepsilon n$, and thus $d\\left(v, \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right) \\leqslant \\varepsilon n+(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ by $(P 3)$.\n\nFor every $i \\in[r]$, note that $(P 1)$ implies that $\\left|W_{i} \\backslash W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant C_{0}+(r-1) 2 \\gamma n \\leqslant 2 r \\gamma n$, and similarly ( $P 3$ ) implies that $\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right| \\leqslant C_{0}+(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n \\leqslant r \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$.\n\nWe now derive a more handy minimum degree condition. For convenience, define $\\bar{d}(v, A)=$ $|A|-d(v, A)$. For $v \\in Z_{i}^{\\prime}$, we have $\\bar{d}\\left(v, \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right) \\geqslant \\bar{d}\\left(v, U_{i}\\right)-\\left|U_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right|$. Since $\\bar{d}\\left(v, U_{i}\\right)>a n+\\left|W_{i}\\right|-\\varepsilon n$ and $\\left|U_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right| \\leqslant\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|+\\left|W_{i} \\backslash W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant \\varepsilon n / 2$, we have $\\bar{d}\\left(v, \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right) \\geqslant a n+\\left|W_{i}\\right|-\\varepsilon n-\\varepsilon n / 2$. By (4.1), $\\bar{d}(v) \\leqslant a n+\\left|W_{i}\\right|+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. It follows that $\\bar{d}\\left(v, V \\backslash \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right) \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$. Now consider $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{\\prime}$. The definition of $\\tilde{U}_{i}$ implies that $d\\left(v, Z_{i}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$ and $\\bar{d}\\left(v, Z_{i}\\right)>a n-\\varepsilon n$. Assume $v \\in V_{j}$. Then $V_{j} \\cap Z_{i}=\\varnothing$ and trivially $\\bar{d}\\left(v, V_{j}\\right)=n$. It follows that $\\bar{d}\\left(v, Z_{i} \\cup V_{j}\\right)>(a+1) n-\\varepsilon n$. Hence $\\bar{d}\\left(v, \\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup V_{j}\\right) \\geqslant$ $\\bar{d}\\left(v, Z_{i} \\cup V_{j}\\right)-\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|>(a+1) n-\\frac{3}{2} \\varepsilon n$. On the other hand, either case of (4.1) implies that $\\bar{d}(v) \\leqslant(a+1) n+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. Consequently, $\\bar{d}\\left(v, V \\backslash\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup V_{j}\\right)\\right) \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$. In summary, for $i \\in[r]$ and $j \\in[k]$,\n(Deg) If $v \\in Z_{i}^{\\prime}$, then $\\bar{d}\\left(v, V \\backslash \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right) \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$; if $v \\in\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap V_{j}$, then $\\bar{d}\\left(v, V \\backslash\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup V_{j}\\right)\\right) \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$.\nNext we prove further properties on $Z_{i}^{j}$ and $\\tilde{Z}_{j}$.\nClaim 4.2. If $Z_{i}^{j} \\neq \\varnothing$ for some $i \\neq j$, then the following holds.\n(Q1) For $v \\in Z_{i}^{j}$ and $A \\subseteq V(G) \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{j}\\right)$, we have $d(v, A) \\geqslant|A|-\\varepsilon n-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$.\n(Q2) $\\left|W_{i}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\varepsilon-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n$.\n(Q3) If $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right| \\geqslant t$, then $\\left|W_{j}\\right| \\leqslant 2 t \\varepsilon n$.\nProof. Note that $d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right) \\leqslant \\varepsilon n$ and $d\\left(v, Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant(a-1) n$, that is, $v$ has at least $n+(a n-\\varepsilon n)=$ $(a+1) n-\\varepsilon n$ non-neighbors in $Z_{i} \\cup Z_{j}$. On the other hand, (4.1) says that $v$ has at most $a n+\\left|W_{i}\\right|+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ non-neighbors in $G$. Combining these two we get that $v$ has at most $\\left|W_{i}\\right|-n+\\varepsilon n+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n \\leqslant \\varepsilon n+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ non-neighbors outside $Z_{i} \\cup Z_{j}$, and thus (Q1) holds. The fact that $\\left|W_{i}\\right|-n+\\varepsilon n+\\sqrt{\\gamma} n \\geqslant 0$ implies $(Q 2)$.\n\nFor (Q3), suppose to the contrary, $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right| \\geqslant t$ and $\\left|W_{j}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n$. By (Q1) with $A=W_{j}$, arbitrary $t$ vertices in $\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}$ have at least $\\left|W_{j}\\right|-t(\\varepsilon+\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n \\geqslant t$ common neighbors in $W_{j}$. We thus obtain a copy of $K_{t, i}$ with one part in $\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}$ and the other part in $W_{j}$ - denote its vertex set by $B$. For any $i^{\\prime} \\in[r] \\backslash\\{j\\}$ such that $B \\cap Z_{i^{\\prime}}^{j} \\neq \\varnothing$, we have $\\left|W_{i^{\\prime}}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\varepsilon-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n$ by (Q2). Since $\\left|W_{j}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n, W_{i^{\\prime}}$ and\n\n$W_{j}$ do not belong to the same cluster, and thus no vertex of $B$ is in the same cluster that contains $W_{i^{\\prime}}$, which implies that the vertices of $B$ have at least $\\left|W_{i^{\\prime}}\\right|-2 t(2 \\varepsilon n) \\geqslant n / 2$ common neighbors in $W_{i^{\\prime}}$ by (Deg). For any $i^{\\prime \\prime} \\in[r] \\backslash\\{j\\}$ such that $B \\cap Z_{i^{\\prime \\prime}}^{j}=\\varnothing$ (and thus $B \\cap Z_{i^{\\prime \\prime}}=\\varnothing$ ), by (Deg) we have that the vertices of $B$ have at least $n / 2$ common neighbors in $Z_{i^{\\prime \\prime}}$. Because $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $T$, these common neighborhoods, each of size at least $n / 2$, have densities close to one between each pair, and thus contain a copy of $K_{r-1}(t)$. Together with $B$, they form a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ in $G$, a contradiction.\n\nIn particular, when $b=0$ (and thus $W_{i}=\\varnothing$ for all $i$ ), (Q2) implies that $Z_{i}^{j}=\\varnothing$ whenever $i \\neq j$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{U}_{i}=Z_{i}^{i}=Z_{i} \\backslash Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\quad \\text { for all } i \\in[r] \\text { when } b=0\n$$\n\nLet $L \\subseteq[r]$ be the set of indices $i$ such that $\\left|W_{i}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\varepsilon-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n$. (Q2) and (Q3) imply that\n\n- for $i \\in[r] \\backslash L$, we have $Z_{i}^{j}=\\varnothing$ for $j \\neq i$.\n- for $i \\in L,\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$ and thus $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right| \\leqslant a n+t-1$.\n\nFirst Estimate on $e(G)$. Let $G^{\\prime}=G \\cap K\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{U}_{r}\\right)$. We have $e(G)=e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)+\\sum_{i=1}^{r} e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)+$ $e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}, G\\right)$. Since $G^{\\prime}$ is $r$-partite, it is $K_{r+1}$-free. As $G^{\\prime}$ is a subgraph of $G \\in \\mathcal{G}_{k}(n)$, we have $e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}$ (but this is not good enough when $b>0$ ). Below we give an upper bound for $e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$, which will be used throughout the proof. Recall that $T=K\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right) \\cap K\\left(U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{r}\\right)$ has precisely $t_{r}(k) n^{2}$ edges.\nClaim 4.3. We have $e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\alpha_{i}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\beta_{i}:=\\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right) \\text { and } \\\\\n& \\alpha_{i}:=\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|+e_{T}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. We first obtain $G^{(0)}:=K\\left(Z_{1} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, Z_{r} \\cup W_{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap K\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right)$ from $T$. During this process, we lose the edges of $T$ between $W_{i}$ and $W_{j}, j \\neq i$, if both ends of the edges are placed in $W_{i}^{\\prime}$. Thus\n\n$$\ne\\left(G^{(0)}\\right)=t_{r}(k) n^{2}-\\sum_{i \\in[r]} e_{T}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe imagine a dynamic process of obtaining $G^{\\prime}$ from $G^{(0)}$ by recursively moving vertices. To estimate $e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)$, we track the changes of the edges with respect to complete $r$-partite graphs (but also respecting the $k$-partition of $G$ ). More precisely, for $l>0$, let\n\n$$\nG^{(l)}:=K\\left(Z_{1}^{(l)} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, Z_{r}^{(l)} \\cup W_{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap K\\left(V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nsuch that the $r$-partition of $G^{(l)}$ can be obtained by moving exactly one vertex from the partition of $G^{(l-1)}$. The process terminates after $m:=\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|$ steps and thus $G^{\\prime}$ is a subgraph of $G^{(m)}$. Furthermore, throughout the process, we only move vertices from the color classes in $L$ to other color classes. Therefore, we can give a linear ordering to the members of $L$, and for $i \\in L$ we move vertices from $Z_{i}$ only after we have moved the vertices in color classes $j$ prior to $i$ (denoted by $j<_{L} i$ ). Now, in the $l$-th step, suppose we move $v$ from $Z_{j}^{(l-1)}$ to $Z_{i}^{(l-1)}$, namely, $v \\in Z_{j}^{i}$, then the change is\n\n$$\ne\\left(G^{(l)}\\right)-e\\left(G^{(l-1)}\\right)=\\left|Z_{j}^{(l-1)} \\backslash V_{p}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}^{(l-1)}\\right|-\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\n$$\n\nwhere $V_{p} \\ni v$ and $\\tilde{Z}_{i}^{(l-1)}=Z_{i}^{(l-1)} \\backslash V_{p}$.\n\nNote that we have $\\left|Z_{j}^{(l-1)} \\backslash V_{p}\\right| \\leqslant(a-1) n+\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|$. Moreover for any $j^{\\prime}<_{L} j$, we have $Z_{j^{\\prime}}^{i} \\subseteq Z_{i}^{(l-1)}$. Therefore, we have $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}^{(l-1)}\\right| \\geqslant a n-\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}<_{L} j}\\left|Z_{j^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right|$. Putting all these together, we get\n\n$$\ne\\left(G^{(l)}\\right)-e\\left(G^{(l-1)}\\right) \\leqslant\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|-\\sum_{j^{\\prime}<_{L} j}\\left|Z_{j^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right|-\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\n$$\n\nRecalling that we moved $v$ from $Z_{j}^{(l-1)}$ to $Z_{i}^{(l-1)}$ at the $l$-th step, we obtain\n\n$$\ne\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)-e\\left(G^{(0)}\\right) \\leqslant \\sum_{l=1}^{m}\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|-\\sum_{j^{\\prime}<_{L} j}\\left|Z_{j^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right|-\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $i, j$ depends on $l$. Since $m=\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{l=1}^{m}\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|-\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{i \\in[r]} \\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|-\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right) \\\\\n= & \\sum_{i \\in[r]} \\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right)-\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, it is not hard to see that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{l=1}^{m} \\sum_{j^{\\prime}<_{L} j}\\left|Z_{j^{\\prime}}^{i}\\right|=\\sum_{i \\in[r]} \\sum_{\\left\\{j_{1}, j_{2}\\right\\} \\in\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c,L \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right\\}}\\left|Z_{j_{1}}^{i}\\right|\\left|Z_{j_{2}}^{i}\\right|=\\sum_{i \\in[r]} e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow the claim follows by combining these estimates with (4.4).\nWhat remains is to estimate the number of edges in each $\\tilde{U}_{i}$. For $i \\in[r]$, we have $e\\left(G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]\\right)=$ $e\\left(Z_{i}^{i}, G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}\\right)$. To bound $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}\\right)=e_{G}\\left(\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\cup W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, we note that $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant$ $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|$ and $e_{G}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$. However, we may not have $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right)$ because each $Z_{j}^{i}$ is an independent set in $T$, but may not be independent in $G$ when $a \\geqslant 2$. Thus, $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant$ $e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right)+\\sum_{j \\neq i} e_{G}\\left(Z_{j}^{i}\\right)$. Putting these together, for each $i \\in[r]$, we have\n\n$$\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}\\right)=e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant \\alpha_{i}+\\sum_{j \\neq i} e_{G}\\left(Z_{j}^{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet $f_{i}:=e\\left(Z_{i}^{i}, G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]\\right)$. By Claim 4.3, (4.5) and $e(G)=e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)+e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}, G\\right)+\\sum_{i \\in[r]} e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)$, we derive that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(G) & \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}, G\\right)+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(f_{i}+\\beta_{i}-\\alpha_{i}+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}, G\\right)+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(f_{i}+\\beta_{i}+\\sum_{j \\neq i} e_{G}\\left(Z_{j}^{i}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe now focus on the structure of each $\\tilde{U}_{i}$. We first show that $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]$ is \"almost\" $K_{t, t}$-free.\nClaim 4.4. The following holds for all $i \\in[r]$.\n$(K 1)$ Both $G\\left[\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right]$ and $G\\left[Z_{i}^{i} \\cup W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right]$ are $K_{t, t}$-free.\n$(K 2)$ If $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n+2 \\gamma n$, then $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{i}}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$.\n\n$(K 3)$ If $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n+2 \\gamma n$, then $G\\left[\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{i}}\\right)\\right]$ is $K_{t, t}$-free.\nProof. For (K1), suppose there is a copy of $K_{t, t}$ in $\\tilde{U}_{i}$, with vertex set denoted by $B$, contained in $\\tilde{Z}_{i}$ or in $Z_{i}^{t} \\cup W_{i}^{\\prime}$. Let $N_{B}$ be the set of common neighbors of these $2 t$ vertices of $B$. First assume that $B \\subseteq \\tilde{Z}_{i}$. Then for any $j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}$, by (Deg) we have $\\left|N_{B} \\cap W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-4 t \\varepsilon n$, and thus by $(P 1)\\left|N_{B} \\cap W_{j} \\cap W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-4 t \\varepsilon n-2 \\gamma n \\geqslant n / 2$. For any $j \\notin L \\cup\\{i\\}$, because $B \\cap Z_{j}=\\varnothing$ by $(Q 2)$, we have $\\left|N_{B} \\cap Z_{j}\\right| \\geqslant a n-4 t \\varepsilon n \\geqslant n / 2$ by (Deg). Note that every set in $\\left\\{N_{B} \\cap Z_{j}: j \\notin L\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{N_{B} \\cap W_{j} \\cap W_{j}^{\\prime}: j \\in L\\right\\}$ has size at least $n / 2$ and every pair of them has density at least $1-4 \\gamma$. Therefore we can find a copy of $K_{r-1}(t)$ in the union of these sets, which gives rise to a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ together with $B$, a contradiction.\n\nSecond we assume that $B \\subseteq Z_{i}^{i} \\cup W_{i}^{\\prime}$. In this case we note that for any $j \\neq i$, we have $B \\cap Z_{j}=\\varnothing$ and thus by (Deg), we have $\\left|N_{B} \\cap Z_{j}^{j}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) a n-4 t \\varepsilon n \\geqslant n / 2$. Then as these sets have high pairwise densities, as in the previous case, we can find a copy of $K_{r-1}(t)$ in the union of these sets, yielding a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ together with $B$, a contradiction. Now $(K 1)$ is proved.\n\nNow we turn to $(K 2)$, and suppose $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n+2 \\gamma n$ and thus $\\left|W_{i} \\cap W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n$ by $(P 1)$. First, if $W_{i}^{\\prime}$ contains at least $t$ vertices which are not from $V_{q_{i}}$ (the cluster containing $W_{i}$ ), then by (Deg), each of these vertices have at most $2 \\varepsilon n$ non-neighbors in $W_{i} \\cap W_{i}^{\\prime}$, and thus we can find a copy of $K_{t, t}$ in $W_{i}^{\\prime}$, contradicting (K1). So we have $\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{i}}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$.\n\nFor (K3), suppose there is a copy of $K_{t, t}$ as stated in the claim, whose vertex set is denoted by $B$. As in the previous paragraph, we have $\\left|W_{i}\\right|>2 t \\varepsilon n$ by $(P 1)$. Now observe crucially that if $B \\cap Z_{j}^{i} \\neq \\varnothing$, then by $(Q 2)\\left|W_{i}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}\\right|>n$, and thus, $W_{i}$ and $W_{j}$ are not from the same cluster. So by (Deg), for any $j \\in[r-1] \\backslash\\{i\\}$, if $B \\cap Z_{j}^{i}=\\varnothing$, then the vertices of $B$ have large common neighborhoods in $Z_{j}^{j}$; if $B \\cap Z_{j}^{i} \\neq \\varnothing$, then the vertices of $B$ have large common neighborhoods in $W_{j} \\cap W_{j}^{\\prime}$ (note that $\\left|W_{j}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\varepsilon-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n$ by $(Q 2)$ ). Since each of these common neighborhoods have size at least $n / 2$ and each pair of them has high density, we can find a copy of $K_{r-1}(t)$ in the union of these sets, yielding a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$ together with $B$, a contradiction.\n\nWe now derive a lower bound for $\\sum f_{i}$ from Claims 4.3 and 4.4. For $i \\in[r]$, we have $\\beta_{i} \\leqslant$ $\\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{j}}\\right|+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right)$ as $\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n \\leqslant\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{j}}\\right|$. Fix $j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}$. Note that $\\left|W_{j}\\right| \\geqslant(1-2 \\varepsilon) n$. We have $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$ by $(Q 3)$, and $\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{j}}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$ by $(K 2)$. If $\\left|W_{i}\\right|>n / 2$, then $\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right| \\leqslant t-1$ by $(Q 3)$. Furthermore, since $\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right| \\leqslant(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n+C_{0}$ by $(P 3)$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{j}}\\right|+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right) \\leqslant(t-1)(t-1+t-1+(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n+C_{0}) \\leqslant(t-1) r \\sqrt{\\gamma} n\n$$\n\nOtherwise $\\left|W_{i}\\right| \\leqslant n / 2$, and by $(Q 2)$, we have $Z_{i}^{i^{\\prime}}=\\varnothing$ for any $i^{\\prime} \\neq i$. This implies $\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|=\\left|Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\leqslant$ $C_{0}$. Using $\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right| \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n,(Q 3)$, and $(K 2)$, we derive that\n\n$$\n\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{j}}\\right|+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right) \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\gamma} n\\left(2(t-1)+C_{0}\\right) \\leqslant 2 C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n\n$$\n\nSummarizing these two cases for all $j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}$, we obtain that $\\beta_{i} \\leqslant(r-1) 2 C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$, and consequently,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in[r]} \\beta_{i} \\leqslant 2(r-1) r C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, for all $i \\neq j$, the graph $G\\left[Z_{j}^{t}\\right]$ is $K_{t, t}$-free by $(K 1)$ and thus, by $(P 3)$, $\\sum_{i, j: i \\neq j} e_{G}\\left(Z_{j}^{i}\\right) \\leqslant r(r-1) C(\\sqrt{\\gamma} n)^{2-1 / t}$. Applying this with (4.7), (4.8), and the fact that $e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup\\right.$\n\n$W^{\\prime \\prime}, G) \\leqslant(r+1) C_{0} k n$, we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(G) & \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+(r+1) C_{0} k n+\\sum_{i \\in[r]} f_{i}+2(r-1) r C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n+\\sum_{i, j: i \\neq j} e_{G}\\left(Z_{j}^{i}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+\\sum_{i \\in[r]} f_{i}+r^{2} C \\sqrt{\\gamma} n^{2-1 / t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $\\gamma \\ll 1$. Using the assumption $e(G) \\geqslant g(n, r, k, t) \\geqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n)$, we infer that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in[r]} f_{i} \\geqslant z_{t}(n)-r^{2} C \\sqrt{\\gamma} n^{2-1 / t} \\geqslant \\frac{c}{2} n^{2-1 / t}\n$$\n\nby using $(Z), z_{t}(n) \\geqslant z_{t}^{(2)}(n) \\geqslant c n^{2-1 / t}$, and $\\gamma \\ll 1$.\nWe next study the existence of $K_{1, t}$ in each color class. To do so, we consider a copy of $K_{3}(t)$ in $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i} \\cup \\tilde{U}_{j}\\right]$ for some $i \\neq j$.\n\nClaim 4.5. For any $i \\neq j$, if $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i} \\cup \\tilde{U}_{j}\\right]$ contains a copy $K$ of $K_{3}(t)$, then there exists $l \\notin\\{i, j\\}$ such that $V(K)$ intersects $V_{\\# i}$ and every cluster in $Z_{l}$.\n\nProof. We may assume that $r>2$ as otherwise the claim is trivial. Suppose to the contrary that there is a copy $K$ of $K_{3}(t)$ in, say, $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ and $\\tilde{U}_{2}$, such that for every $l \\in[3, r]$, there is a cluster in $U_{l}$ which does not intersect $B:=V(K)$. Let $V_{i_{l}}$ be a cluster in $Z_{l}$ such that $B \\cap V_{i_{l}}=\\varnothing$, and if there is no such cluster in $Z_{l}$, then we choose $V_{i_{l}}=V_{\\# i}$. Note that in the former case, we have $\\left|\\tilde{U}_{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}\\right|=\\left|Z_{l}^{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma} a) n$. In the latter case, we have $Z_{l}^{1} \\neq \\varnothing$ or $Z_{l}^{2} \\neq \\varnothing$, which implies that $\\left|W_{l}\\right| \\geqslant(1-2 \\varepsilon) n$ by $(Q 2)$, and thus $\\left|\\tilde{U}_{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}\\right|=\\left|W_{l}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{i_{l}}\\right| \\geqslant(1-3 \\varepsilon) n$. Now, by (Deg), every vertex in $B$ has at most $2 \\varepsilon n$ non-neighbors in $\\tilde{U}_{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}$ for each $l \\in[3, r]$. Since for every $l$ we have $\\left|\\tilde{U}_{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}\\right| \\geqslant 0.9 n$, one can find large common neighborhoods (e.g. of size $n / 2$ ) of all vertices of $B$ in each $\\tilde{U}_{l} \\cap V_{i_{l}}$, and then find a copy of $K_{r-2}(t)$ in these sets. Altogether we obtain a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, for such a copy $K$ of $K_{3}(t)$, there exists $l \\notin\\{i, j\\}$ such that $K$ must intersect all clusters of $U_{l}$. Since $V(K) \\cap Z_{l} \\neq \\varnothing$, we have $Z_{l}^{i} \\neq \\varnothing$ or $Z_{l}^{j} \\neq \\varnothing$. Then by $(Q 2),\\left|W_{l}\\right| \\geqslant(1-2 \\varepsilon) n$ and in particular, $V_{\\# i} \\neq \\varnothing$. Therefore $V(K) \\cap V_{\\# i} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nClaim 4.6. For all but exactly one $j \\in[r]$, we have $d\\left(v, Z_{j}^{j}\\right) \\leqslant t-1$ for all $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{j}$.\nProof. First assume that there exists $j \\in[r]$ such that $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{j}\\right]$ contains a copy of $K_{1, t}$, with vertex set denoted by $\\left\\{v, u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t}\\right\\}, v \\in \\tilde{U}_{j}$ and $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t} \\in Z_{j}^{j}$. Fix $i \\in[r] \\backslash\\{j\\}$ and let $N^{\\prime}$ be the set of common neighbors of $u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{t}$ in $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\cap U_{i}$. Suppose $v \\in V_{p}$ and let $N$ be the set of common neighbors of these $t+1$ vertices in $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\cap U_{i}$. In particular, $N \\subseteq N^{\\prime}$ and $N$ is almost equal to the union of $a$ or $a+1$ clusters in $\\tilde{U}_{i}$. Suppose there is a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$ with parts $S_{1}$ of size $t-1$ and $S_{2}$ of size $t$ such that $S_{1} \\subseteq N^{\\prime}$ and $S_{2} \\subseteq N$. Then by Claim 4.5, there exists $l \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i, j\\}$ such that $B \\cap Z_{l} \\neq \\varnothing$ and $B \\cap V_{\\# i} \\neq \\varnothing$, where $B$ denotes the vertex set of the copy of $K_{3}(t)$. This is impossible since $v$ is the only possible vertex in $B \\cap\\left(Z_{l} \\cup V_{\\# i}\\right)$ and can not satisfy both. Therefore, letting $N^{*}=N \\cup\\left(N^{\\prime} \\cap V_{p}\\right)$, we infer that $e_{G}\\left(N^{*}\\right)=e_{G}(N)+e_{G}\\left(N, N^{\\prime} \\backslash N\\right)=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)$.\n\nBy $(P 1),(P 3)$ and (Deg), we have $\\left|\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash N^{*}\\right| \\leqslant 3(t+1) \\varepsilon n$. Let $E^{i}$ be the set of the edges incident to $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash N^{*}$ and counted in $f_{i}$. We split it to $E^{i} \\cap E_{G}\\left(Z_{i}^{i}\\right)$ and $E^{i} \\cap E_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}, Z_{i}^{i}\\right)$. Note that by ( $K 1$ ), each of the terms can be split further into at most $k K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graphs, each with one part\n\nof size at most $3(t+1) \\varepsilon n$ and the other part of size at most $(1+(r-2) \\sqrt{\\gamma}) a n$. Therefore, we obtain that\n\n$$\nf_{i}=O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)+O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)=O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow assume there exist distinct $j_{1}, j_{2} \\in[r]$ such that each $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{j_{i}}\\right]$ contains a copy of $K_{1, t}$ whose part of size $t$ is in $Z_{j_{i}}^{j_{i}}$. The arguments above imply that (4.10) holds for all $i \\in[r]$, and consequently, $\\sum_{i \\in[r]} f_{i}=O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$, contradicting (4.9).\n\nOn the other hand, if $d\\left(v, Z_{j}^{j}\\right) \\leqslant t-1$ for all $j \\in[r]$ and all $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{j}$, then $\\sum_{j \\in[r]} f_{j} \\leqslant(t-1) k n$, again contradicting (4.9).\n\nBy Claim 4.6, without loss of generality, we assume that,\n\n$$\n\\text { for } i \\geqslant 2, \\quad d\\left(v, Z_{i}^{i}\\right) \\leqslant t-1 \\text { for all } v \\in \\tilde{U}_{i}, \\quad \\text { and thus, } \\quad f_{i} \\leqslant \\begin{cases}(t-1)\\left|\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right| & \\text { if } a \\geqslant 2 \\\\ (t-1)\\left|\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{i}\\right| & \\text { if } a=1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIf $b=0$, then $\\tilde{U}_{i}=Z_{i}^{i}=Z_{i} \\backslash Z^{\\prime \\prime}$ for all $i$ by (4.3). In this case $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ is $K_{t, t}$-free by ( $K 1$ ) and $\\tilde{U}_{i}$ is $K_{1, t}$-free for all $i \\geqslant 2$ by (4.11). Since $G$ is $\\gamma$-close to $K_{r}(a n), G\\left[U_{i} \\backslash Z^{\\prime \\prime}, U_{j} \\backslash Z^{\\prime \\prime}\\right]$ is almost complete for all $i \\neq j$. This completes the proof of Theorem 4 with $Z:=Z^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nBy (4.9) and (4.11), we get\n\n$$\nf_{1} \\geqslant z_{t}(n)-\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we claim that\n\n$$\n\\left|W_{1}\\right|>3 t \\varepsilon n \\quad \\text { if } b>0\n$$\n\n(which we will refine a moment later). Indeed, the edges counted in $f_{1}$ can be covered by $G\\left[Z_{1}^{1}\\right]$, $G\\left[Z_{1}^{1}, W_{1} \\cap W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right]$, and at most $k K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graphs, each with a part of size at most $\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ and a part of size at most $a n$. If $\\left|W_{1}\\right| \\leqslant 3 t \\varepsilon n$, then $e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{1}, W_{1} \\cap W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$. Together with $e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{1}\\right) \\leqslant z_{t}^{(a)}(n)$, we have\n\n$$\nf_{1} \\leqslant z_{t}^{(a)}(n)+O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)<z_{t}^{(a+1)}(n)-\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\n$$\n\nby $(E 1)$, contradicting (4.12).\nNow we can give a much cleaner structure, shown in a series of claims below. A key step is to show that $Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$. From now on we only consider $k \\leqslant 2 r$.\nClaim 4.7. Suppose $v_{0} \\in V(G)$ and $i \\in[r]$ satisfy that $v_{0}$ has at least $\\varepsilon n$ neighbors in $Z_{j}$ for every $j \\neq i$. Then $v_{0}$ has less than $\\varepsilon n$ neighbors in $U_{i}$. In particular, we have $Z^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$ and $W^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$.\nProof. The second part of the claim follows immediately from the definitions of $Z^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $W^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nSuppose to the contrary, that there exist $v_{0} \\in V(G)$ and $i \\in[r]$ such that $v_{0}$ has at least $\\varepsilon n$ neighbors in $Z_{j}$ for every $j \\neq i$ and at least $\\varepsilon n$ neighbors in $U_{i}$. Since $\\left|Z_{j}^{j}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) a n$ for all $j \\in[r]$, there exist sets $N_{1}, \\ldots, N_{r-1}$ each of size $\\varepsilon n-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ such that $N_{j} \\subseteq Z_{j}^{j} \\cap N\\left(v_{0}\\right)$ for $j \\neq i$ and $N_{i} \\subseteq\\left(Z_{i}^{i} \\cup W_{i}\\right) \\cap N\\left(v_{0}\\right)$. Recall that $W_{1}^{\\prime}=W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}}$. By averaging, there exists $N_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq N_{1}$ with $\\left|N_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant(\\varepsilon n-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n-2 r \\gamma n) / 2 \\geqslant \\varepsilon n / 3$ such that all vertices of $N_{1}^{\\prime}$ are in $Z_{1}^{1} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}$ and from the same cluster, that is,\n\n$$\nN_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq Q, \\text { where } Q \\in\\left\\{Z_{1}^{1}, W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNote that $N_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq W_{1}^{\\prime}$ is possible only if $i=1$ and $a=1$. If $i \\neq 1$, then let $N_{i}^{\\prime}:=N_{i} \\backslash\\left(\\left(W_{i} \\backslash W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\cup V_{q_{1}}\\right)$ and for every $j \\in[r] \\backslash\\{1, i\\}$, let $N_{j}^{\\prime}:=N_{j}$. By $(P 1),\\left|W_{i} \\backslash W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant 2 r \\gamma n$, and by (4.16), $\\left|W_{i} \\cap V_{q_{1}}\\right| \\leqslant \\gamma n$. Thus, we have $\\left|N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant \\varepsilon n / 3$ for all $j \\in[r]$. Because the sets $N_{j}^{\\prime}$ are small, we can not apply the degree conditions (Deg) to them and instead, we use (D0).\n\nRecall that $B_{1}$ is given by (D0). Next we show that $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash B_{1}\\right]$ does not contain a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$ such that the part of size $t$ is in $N_{1}^{\\prime}$. Suppose instead, there is such a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$, with parts denoted by $A$ and $B$, such that $|A|=t, A \\subseteq N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}$ and $B \\subseteq \\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash B_{1}$. Recall that $N_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}}=\\varnothing$ and for each $j \\in[r] \\backslash\\{1, i\\}, N_{j}^{\\prime} \\subseteq Z_{j}^{j}$. Observe that for every $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash B_{1}$, we have $d\\left(v, N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\geqslant\\left|N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. Indeed, if $j \\neq i$, then $N_{j}^{\\prime} \\subseteq Z_{j}^{j}$ and we have $d\\left(v, N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\geqslant\\left|N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ by (D0); otherwise note that $N_{i}^{\\prime} \\subseteq Z_{i}^{i} \\cup\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap W_{i}\\right)$, and by (D0) and $N_{i}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}}=\\varnothing$ we have $d\\left(v, N_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\geqslant\\left|N_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. Therefore, we obtain that the vertices in $A \\cup B$ have at least $\\left|N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-(2 t-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n \\geqslant\\left(1-\\gamma^{1 / 3}\\right)\\left|N_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|$ common neighbors in each $N_{j}^{\\prime}, j \\in[2, r]$. Because each pair $N_{j}^{\\prime}, N_{j^{\\prime}}^{\\prime}$ has a high density, we can find a copy of $K_{r-1}(t)$ in the union of these common neighborhoods, which together with $A \\cup B \\cup\\left\\{v_{0}\\right\\}$ form a copy of $K_{r+1}(t)$, a contradiction.\n\nNow given that $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash B_{1}\\right]$ does not contain a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$ such that the part of size $t$ is in $N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}$, we give a refined estimate on $f_{1}$. Indeed, since $G\\left[N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}, Z_{1}^{1} \\backslash B_{1}\\right]$ does not contain a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$ such that the part of size $t$ is in $N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}$, we get $e_{G}\\left(N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}, Z_{1}^{1} \\backslash B_{1}\\right)=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)$. Similarly $e_{G}\\left(N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}, W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}\\right)=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)$. Suppose $N_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq V_{q}$ for some $q \\in\\left\\{1, q_{1}\\right\\}$, then we have\n\n$$\nE\\left(G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right]\\right)=E\\left(G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash\\left(N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}\\right)\\right]\\right) \\cup E\\left(G\\left[N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}, \\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash\\left(B_{1} \\cup V_{q}\\right)\\right]\\right) \\cup E\\left(G\\left[N_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash B_{1}, B_{1} \\cap \\tilde{U}_{1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\left|N_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant \\varepsilon n / 3$ and $\\left|B_{1}\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$. Therefore, (regardless of $a=1$ or $(a, b)=(2,0)$ ) we can bound $f_{1} \\leqslant\\left|E\\left(G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right]\\right)\\right|$ by\n\n$$\nf_{1} \\leqslant z_{t}\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{3}\\right) n, n\\right)+O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)+O\\left(\\sqrt{\\gamma} n^{2-1 / t}\\right)<z_{t}(n)-3 r C_{0} k n\n$$\n\nwhere we used (E2) and $\\gamma \\ll \\varepsilon$. This contradicts (4.12).\nWhen $a=2$ and $b=0$ (i.e., $k=2 r$ ), since $Z_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$ and $W_{i}=\\varnothing$ for all $i \\in[r]$, by (4.3), we get $\\tilde{U}_{i}=Z_{i}$ for all $i \\in[r]$. Therefore $e(G)=e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)+\\sum_{i=1}^{r} e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)+e\\left(Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}, G\\right) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n)+$ $(r-1)(t-1) n$ by $(K 1)$ and (4.11), proving Theorem 3 for $k=2 r$.\n\nFor the remaining of the proof, we only need to consider $a=1$ (and thus $b>0$ ). Moreover, now for $i, j \\in[r]$ each $Z_{i}^{j} \\subseteq Z_{i}$ is an independent set and thus $e_{G}\\left(Z_{i}^{j}\\right)=0$. So we can first update our bounds on $e(G)$ and $f_{1}$. Recall the bounds $(4.7),(4.8)$ and (4.11) and we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne(G) & \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(f_{i}+\\beta_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+f_{1}+(r-1)(t-1)(1+\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n+2(r-1) r C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\nf_{1} \\geqslant z_{t}(n, n)-C_{0} n\n$$\n\nClaim 4.8. Suppose $b>0$. Then $\\tilde{U}_{1}=Z_{1}^{1} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $W_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq V_{q_{1}}$.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary, there is a vertex $v$ in $\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash\\left(Z_{1}^{1} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ or $W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}$, namely, $v \\in Z_{i}^{1}$ for some $2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant r$ or $v \\in W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}$. Suppose $v \\in V_{l}$. Then $l \\neq q_{1}$. Moreover, if $i$ is defined, then $W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}} \\subseteq V \\backslash\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\cup V_{l}\\right)$; otherwise, $W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}} \\subseteq V \\backslash V_{l}$. By (Deg), we have $\\bar{d}\\left(v, W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}}\\right) \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$. Let $N:=W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}} \\cap N(v)$. We have $\\left|\\left(W_{1}^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{1}}\\right) \\backslash N\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon N$. Since $\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}\\right| \\leqslant\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| W_{1} \\mid \\leqslant 2 \\gamma n$, it follows that $\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash N\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\varepsilon n+2 \\gamma n \\leqslant 3 \\varepsilon n$.\n\nRecall (4.13), $\\left|W_{1}\\right|>3 t \\varepsilon n$. By (K3) (if $v \\in \\tilde{Z}_{1} \\backslash Z_{1}$ ) or (K1) (if $v \\in W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}$ ), we know that $G\\left[Z_{1}^{1}, N\\right]$ contains no $K_{t-1, t}$ with the part of size $t$ in $N$. This implies that $e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{1}, N\\right)=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)$. Furthermore, by $(P 3)$ and $(K 1), G\\left[\\tilde{Z}_{1} \\backslash Z_{1}^{1}, Z_{1}^{1}\\right]$ is a $K_{t, t}$-free bipartite graph with one part of size at\n\nmost $(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ and the other part of size at most $n$. Thus, $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{1} \\backslash Z_{1}^{1}, Z_{1}^{1}\\right) \\leqslant C(r-1) \\sqrt{\\gamma} n^{2-1 / t}$. By the similar arguments, we have $e_{G}\\left(W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash N, Z_{1}^{1}\\right) \\leqslant C(3 \\varepsilon n) n^{1-1 / t}$.\n\nPutting these bounds together (and note that $Z_{1}^{1}$ is an independent set, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{1} & =e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{1}, N\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{1} \\backslash Z_{1}^{1}, Z_{1}^{1}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(W_{1}^{\\prime} \\backslash N, Z_{1}^{1}\\right) \\\\\n& =O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)+O\\left(\\sqrt{\\gamma} n^{2-1 / t}\\right)+O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (E1), this contradicts (4.14).\nClaim 4.8 shows that $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ has no atypical vertices and is thus $K_{t, t}$-free by ( $K 1$ ). Furthermore, since $\\tilde{U}_{1}=Z_{1}^{1} \\cup W_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $W_{1}^{\\prime} \\subseteq V_{q_{1}}$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{1}=\\beta_{1}=0, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right)=f_{1} \\leqslant z_{t}\\left(\\left|Z_{1}^{1}\\right|,\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, if $\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant(1-\\gamma) n$, then we have $f_{1} \\leqslant z_{t}\\left(n,\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right) \\leqslant z_{t}(n, n)-\\delta n^{2-1 / t}$ for some $\\delta>0$ by (E2). This contradicts (4.14). So we obtain\n\n$$\n\\text { if } a=1 \\text {, then }\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\gamma) n \\quad(\\text { and thus } \\quad 1 \\in L)\n$$\n\nNext we study $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]$ for $i \\geqslant 2$. A key observation is that copies of $K_{1, t}$ in $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]$ together with copies of $K_{t-1, t}$ in $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ may form copies of $K_{3}(t)$, which are restricted by Claim 4.5.\nClaim 4.9. Suppose $i \\in[2, r]$.\n(1) If there is a copy of $K_{1, t}$ in $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{1} \\cup V_{q_{1}}\\right)$, then there exists $l \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\}$ such that the vertex set of $K_{1, t}$ intersects both $V_{q_{l}}$ and $Z_{l}$.\n(2) Both $\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}$ and $Z_{i}^{i} \\cup\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}\\right)$ are $K_{1, t}$-free.\n\nProof. For Part (1), let $B$ be the vertex set of a copy of $K_{1, t}$ in $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{1} \\cup V_{q_{1}}\\right)$. Since $B \\cap\\left(Z_{1} \\cup V_{q_{1}}\\right)=\\varnothing$ and $\\tilde{U}_{1} \\subseteq Z_{1} \\cup V_{q_{1}}$, by (Deg), all vertices of $B$ have at most $2 \\varepsilon n$ non-neighbors in $\\tilde{U}_{1}$. Letting $N:=\\tilde{U}_{1} \\cap \\bigcap_{w \\in B} N(w)$, we have $|N| \\geqslant|\\tilde{U}_{1}|-(t+1) 2 \\varepsilon n$.\n\nFirst assume that $N$ is $K_{t-1, t}$-free and thus $e_{G}(N)=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)$. Note that, since $\\left|\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash N\\right| \\leqslant$ $(t+1) 2 \\varepsilon n$, the edges in $\\tilde{U}_{1}$ incident to $\\tilde{U}_{1} \\backslash N$ can be split into two bipartite $K_{t, t}$-free graphs each with one part of size at most $(t+1) 2 \\varepsilon n$ and the other part of size at most $n$. Thus, the number of such edges is $O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$. This gives $f_{1}=O\\left(n^{2-1 /(t-1)}\\right)+O\\left(\\varepsilon n^{2-1 / t}\\right)$, contradicting (4.12).\n\nWe thus assume $N$ contains a copy of $K_{t-1, t}$. Together with $B$, they form a copy of $K_{3}(t)$ in $G\\left[\\tilde{U}_{1} \\cup \\tilde{U}_{i}\\right]$ and we denote its vertex set by $B^{\\prime}$. By Claim 4.5, there exists $l \\notin\\{1, i\\}$ such that $B^{\\prime}$ intersects $V_{q_{l}}$ and $Z_{l}$. By Claim 4.8, $\\tilde{U}_{1} \\cap U_{l}=\\varnothing$, so $B^{\\prime} \\cap Z_{l}=B \\cap Z_{l}$ and $B$ indeed intersects $Z_{l}$. Since $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\cap Z_{l} \\supseteq B \\cap Z_{l} \\neq \\varnothing$, we infer that $\\left|W_{l}\\right| \\geqslant(1-2 \\varepsilon) n$ from (Q3), which implies that $q_{l} \\neq q_{1}$ because of (4.13). It follows that $W_{1} \\cap V_{q_{l}}=\\varnothing$ and thus $B \\cap V_{q_{l}}=B^{\\prime} \\cap V_{q_{l}} \\neq \\varnothing$, as desired.\n\nFor Part (2), let $A_{i}:=Z_{i}^{i} \\cup\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime} \\backslash V_{q_{1}}\\right)$ and $B$ be the vertex set of a copy of $K_{1, t}$ in $\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}$ or in $A_{i}$. Then, by the first part of the claim, there exists $l \\in[r] \\backslash\\{i\\}$ such that $B$ intersects $V_{q_{l}}$ and $Z_{l}$. This is impossible if $B \\subseteq A_{i}$ because $A_{i} \\cap Z_{l}=\\varnothing$ for any $l \\notin\\{1, i\\}$, and also impossible if $B \\subseteq \\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}$ because in which case $B \\cap W=\\varnothing$ and thus $B \\cap V_{q_{l}}=\\varnothing$ for any $l \\notin\\{1, i\\}$.\n\nThe following claim shows a clean structure for the $\\tilde{U}_{i}$ such that $W_{i}^{\\prime}$ is not too small.\nClaim 4.10. For $i \\in[2, r]$ such that $\\left|W_{i}\\right| \\geqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$, we have $\\tilde{U}_{i} \\subseteq U_{i} \\cup V_{q_{i}}$.\nProof. Suppose instead, for some $i_{0} \\in[2, r]$ with $\\left|W_{i_{0}}\\right| \\geqslant 2 \\varepsilon n$, there exists $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{i_{0}} \\backslash\\left(U_{i_{0}} \\cup V_{q_{i_{0}}}\\right)$. By $(P 4)$ and the fact that $v \\in \\tilde{U}_{i_{0}} \\backslash U_{i_{0}}$, we infer that $d\\left(v, Z_{j}\\right) \\geqslant \\varepsilon n$ for all $j \\neq i_{0}$. Then, by Claim 4.7, we have $d\\left(v, U_{i_{0}}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$. Consequently, $d\\left(v, W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime} \\cap W_{i_{0}}\\right)<\\varepsilon n$, namely, $v$ has at least\n\n$2 \\varepsilon n-2 \\gamma n-\\varepsilon n \\geqslant(1 / 2) \\varepsilon n$ non-neighbors in $W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime} \\cap W_{i_{0}}$ (in $G$ ). Note that $v$ is adjacent to all the vertices of $W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime} \\cap W_{i_{0}}$ in $T$. Since $G\\left[W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right] \\subseteq T\\left[W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right]$, we infer that\n\n$$\ne_{G}\\left(W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}, W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right)+\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right|\\left|W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right|-(1 / 2) \\varepsilon n\n$$\n\nSince $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right) \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right)$ and $\\alpha_{i_{0}}=\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right|\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|+e_{T}\\left(W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right) & =e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}, W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right)+e_{T}\\left(W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right)+\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i_{0}} \\backslash Z_{i_{0}}\\right|\\left|W_{i_{0}}^{\\prime}\\right|-(1 / 2) \\varepsilon n \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\alpha_{i_{0}}-(1 / 2) \\varepsilon n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCombining (4.5) and (4.17) gives\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in[r]} e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant \\sum_{i \\in[r]} \\alpha_{i}-(1 / 2) \\varepsilon n\n$$\n\nRecall that $f_{i} \\leqslant(t-1)\\left|\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|(i \\geqslant 2)$ by $(4.11),\\left|W_{1}^{\\prime}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\gamma) n$ by (4.16), and $\\left|Z_{i}^{i}\\right| \\geqslant(1-\\sqrt{\\gamma}) n$ by $(P 3)$. Therefore, as $\\sum_{i=1}^{r}\\left|\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right| \\leqslant(b-1) n+r \\sqrt{\\gamma} n+\\gamma n$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=2}^{r} f_{i} \\leqslant(t-1)((b-1) n+r \\sqrt{\\gamma} n+\\gamma n) \\leqslant(t-1)(b-1) n+\\sqrt[3]{\\gamma} n\n$$\n\nSince $Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$, (4.7) becomes $e(G) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(f_{i}+\\beta_{i}+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right)-\\alpha_{i}\\right)$. Recall that $\\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\beta_{i} \\leqslant 2 r^{2} C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n$ by (4.8). Together with (4.18) and (4.19), we derive that\n\n$$\ne(G) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+z_{t}(n)+(t-1)(b-1) n+\\sqrt[3]{\\gamma} n+2 r^{2} C_{0} \\sqrt{\\gamma} n-\\varepsilon n / 2<g(n, r, k, t)\n$$\n\nas $\\gamma \\ll \\varepsilon$. This is a contradiction.\nLet $L_{1} \\cup L_{2} \\cup L_{3}$ be a partition of $[2, r]$ such that $i \\in L_{1}$ if and only if $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|<n, i \\in L_{2}$ if and only if $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|=n$, and $i \\in L_{3}$ if and only if $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|>n$. The following properties hold for $L_{1}, L_{2}$ and $L_{3}$.\n(R1) If $i \\in L_{1}$, then $Z_{i}^{j} \\neq \\varnothing$ for some $j \\neq i$. By (Q2), we have $i \\in L$ and, by Claim 4.10, $\\tilde{Z}_{i}=Z_{i}^{i} \\subsetneq V_{i}$ and $W_{i}^{\\prime} \\subseteq V_{q_{i}}$.\n(R2) If $i \\in L_{2}$, then $\\tilde{Z}_{i}=Z_{i}^{i}=V_{i}$. Indeed, otherwise $\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\neq Z_{i}^{i}$, then $\\left|Z_{i}^{i}\\right|<n$ and $Z_{i}^{j} \\neq \\varnothing$ for some $j \\neq i$. By (Q2) and Claim 4.10, we have $\\tilde{Z}_{i}=Z_{i}^{i}$, a contradiction.\n(R3) If $i \\in L_{3}$, then $\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\nsubseteq Z_{i}$ (otherwise $\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right| \\leqslant n$ ). By Claim 4.10, we have $\\left|W_{i}\\right|<2 \\varepsilon n$, which implies that $Z_{i}^{j}=\\varnothing$ for $j \\neq i$ by $(Q 2)$. Thus, $Z_{i}^{i}=Z_{i}=V_{i} \\subsetneq \\tilde{Z}_{i}$.\nNow we derive our final bound on $e(G)$. Write $z_{i}:=\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|$ and $w_{i}:=\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|$ for $i \\in[r]$.\nBy Claim 4.3 and the fact that $Z^{\\prime \\prime} \\cup W^{\\prime \\prime}=\\varnothing$, we have\n\n$$\ne(G)=e\\left(G^{\\prime}\\right)+\\sum_{i \\in[r]} e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right) \\leqslant t_{r}(k) n^{2}+\\sum_{i \\in[r]}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\alpha_{i}+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, as $a=1$, (4.5) becomes $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant \\alpha_{i}$. It follows that $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)=f_{i}+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant f_{i}+\\alpha_{i}$. For $i \\in\\{1\\} \\cup L_{1} \\cup L_{2}$, we simply use $f_{i}$ as the upper bound and thus we get\n\n$$\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)-\\alpha_{i} \\leqslant f_{i} \\leqslant \\begin{cases}z_{t}\\left(z_{1}, w_{1}\\right) & \\text { if } i=1 \\text { by (4.15) } \\\\ (t-1) \\min \\left\\{z_{i}, w_{i}\\right\\} & \\text { if } i \\in L_{1} \\text { by }(R 1) \\text { and Claim 4.9 (2) } \\\\ (t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right) & \\text { if } i \\in L_{2} \\text { by }(R 2) \\text { and (4.11) }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAdditional work is needed for $i \\in L_{3}$. We let $\\lambda=\\max \\left\\{0,\\left|L_{1}\\right|-\\left|L_{3}\\right|\\right\\}$ and for $i \\in L_{3}$, let $\\lambda_{i}$ be the number of indices $j \\in L_{1}$ such that $Z_{j}^{i} \\neq \\varnothing$. By $(R 1)-(R 3)$, we know that if $Z_{j}^{i} \\neq \\varnothing$, then $i \\in L_{3}$ and $j \\in L_{1}$. This implies that $\\lambda_{i} \\geqslant 1$ for every $i \\in L_{3}$, and $\\sum_{i \\in L_{3}} \\lambda_{i} \\geqslant\\left|L_{1}\\right|$, yielding that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in L_{3}}\\left(\\lambda_{i}-1\\right) \\geqslant \\lambda\n$$\n\nRecall that $G\\left[t Z_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}^{i}\\right]$ is $K_{1, t}$-free by Claim 4.9 (2). Since $Z_{i}^{i}=Z_{i}$ is an independent set, it follows that $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}^{i}\\right) \\leqslant(t-1)\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{1}^{i}\\right)\\right|$. Together with (4.11), this gives\n\n$$\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}^{i}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{i}, Z_{i}\\right) \\leqslant(t-1)\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{1}^{i}\\right)\\right|+(t-1)\\left|Z_{1}^{i}\\right|=(t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, for $i \\in L_{3}$, writing $\\varrho_{i}:=e_{T}\\left(Z_{1}^{i}, \\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{1}^{i}\\right)\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right)=e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{1}^{i}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{i}, Z_{i}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(Z_{1}^{i}, \\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{1}^{i}\\right) \\leqslant(t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n\\right)+\\varrho_{i}\\right.\n$$\n\nMoreover, the definition of $\\alpha_{i}$ implies that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne_{G}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)-\\alpha_{i} & \\leqslant e_{T}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right|\\left|W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|-\\alpha_{i}=-e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\varrho_{i}-e_{T}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash\\left(Z_{i} \\cup Z_{1}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\leqslant-\\varrho_{i}-\\binom{\\lambda_{i}}{2} \\leqslant-\\varrho_{i}+1-\\lambda_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, by (4.11), we have $e_{G}\\left(Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant(t-1) w_{i}$ for $i \\in L_{3}$. Combining all these inequalities together, we obtain that, for $i \\in L_{3}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ne_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)-\\alpha_{i} & =e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)+e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}, W_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)-\\alpha_{i} \\\\\n& \\leqslant(t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right)+\\left(1-\\lambda_{i}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\sum_{i \\in L_{3}}\\left(e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)-\\alpha_{i}\\right) \\leqslant \\sum_{i \\in L_{3}}(t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right)-\\lambda$ by using (4.20).\nUsing $\\sum_{i=2}^{r}\\left(z_{i}-n\\right)=n-z_{1}$ and $\\sum_{i=2}^{r} w_{i}=b n-w_{1}$, we derive that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i \\in L_{1}} \\min \\left\\{z_{i}, w_{i}\\right\\}+\\sum_{i \\in L_{2} \\cup L_{3}}\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right) & =\\sum_{i \\in L_{1}} \\min \\left\\{n-w_{i}, n-z_{i}\\right\\}+\\sum_{i=2}^{r}\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i \\in L_{1}} \\min \\left\\{n-w_{i}, n-z_{i}\\right\\}+b n-w_{1}+n-z_{1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i=2}^{r}\\left(e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{i}\\right)-\\alpha_{i}\\right) & \\leqslant \\sum_{i \\in L_{1}}(t-1) \\min \\left\\{z_{i}, w_{i}\\right\\}+\\sum_{i \\in L_{2} \\cup L_{3}}(t-1)\\left(z_{i}-n+w_{i}\\right)-\\lambda \\\\\n& =(t-1)\\left(b n-w_{1}+n-z_{1}\\right)+\\sum_{i \\in L_{1}}(t-1) \\min \\left\\{n-w_{i}, n-z_{i}\\right\\}-\\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, we work on the $\\beta_{i}$ 's and recall that $\\beta_{i}=\\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}\\right|+\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n+\\left|Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}\\right|\\right)$. For $i \\in$ $\\{1\\} \\cup L_{1} \\cup L_{2}$, as $\\tilde{Z}_{i} \\backslash Z_{i}=\\varnothing, \\beta_{i}=0$. For $i \\in L_{3}$, as $\\left|W_{i}\\right|<2 \\varepsilon n$, we have $Z_{i} \\backslash \\tilde{Z}_{i}=\\varnothing$; for any $j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}$, we have $\\tilde{Z}_{j} \\backslash Z_{j}=\\varnothing$ and $W_{j}^{\\prime} \\subseteq V_{q_{j}}$ again by Claim 4.10. Hence $\\beta_{i}=\\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n\\right) \\leqslant 0$\n\nbecause $\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right| \\leqslant n$. It then follows that (noting that $L \\cap L_{3}=\\varnothing$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} \\beta_{i} & =\\sum_{i \\in L_{3}} \\beta_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in L_{3}} \\sum_{j \\in L \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{j \\in L} \\sum_{i \\in L_{3} \\backslash\\{j\\}}\\left|Z_{j}^{i}\\right|\\left(\\left|W_{j}^{\\prime}\\right|-n\\right)=\\sum_{j \\in L}\\left(n-z_{j}\\right)\\left(w_{j}-n\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $1 \\in L$ by (4.16) and $\\left(n-z_{1}\\right)\\left(w_{1}-n\\right) \\leqslant 0$ by Claim 4.8. Furthermore, since $n-z_{j}=0$ for $j \\in L_{2}$, it follows that $\\sum_{i \\geqslant 1} \\beta_{i}=\\sum_{j \\in L_{1}}\\left(n-z_{j}\\right)\\left(w_{j}-n\\right)$.\n\nRecall that $e_{G}\\left(\\tilde{U}_{1}\\right)=f_{1} \\leqslant z_{t}\\left(z_{1}, w_{1}\\right)$. By (E3), we have $z_{t}\\left(z_{1}, w_{1}\\right)+(t-1)\\left(n-z_{1}+n-w_{1}\\right) \\leqslant z_{t}(n)$.

This implies $\\left|L_{1} \\cup L_{2}\\right| \\geqslant b-1$, and $\\left|L_{3}\\right| \\leqslant r-b$. Since $\\left|L_{1}\\right|-\\lambda=\\min \\left\\{\\left|L_{1}\\right|,\\left|L_{3}\\right|\\right\\} \\leqslant$ $\\left|L_{3}\\right| \\leqslant r-b$, it follows that $\\left|L_{1}\\right|-\\lambda \\leqslant \\min \\{b-1, r-b\\}$.
