InTRODUCTION\n\nAs is well known, the geometric flow is one of the most powerful tools for understanding the structure of Riemannian manifolds. In particular, the Yamabe flow is one of the central fields of the theory and has developed rapidly (cf. [2], [3]). Gradient Yamabe solitons are self similar solutions of the Yamabe flow and expected to be a singularity model. Therefore, the classification problem is one of the most important ones. To classify gradient Yamabe solitons, there are many studies with curvature assumptions and locally conformally flat conditions (cf. [10], [8], [6] and [12]). These studies give affirmative partial answers to the Yamabe soliton version of the Perelman conjecture, that is, any nontrivial complete steady gradient Yamabe soliton is rotationally symmetric. Recently, the author solved the problem (cf. [13]).\n\nIn order to gain a deeper understanding of gradient Yamabe solitons, we consider complete gradient Yamabe solitons without assuming any curvature assumptions. In this paper, we completely classify nontrivial non-flat three-dimensional complete gradient Yamabe solitons. We also provide examples of complete expanding gradient Yamabe solitons, which do not appear in the steady and shrinking cases.\n\nFor two-dimensional solitons, Yamabe and Ricci solitons can be regarded as equivalent.

To classify them, we consider gradient Ricci solitons from the point of view of Yamabe solitons, more generally gradient conformal solitons. Using this idea, we provide a proof of the classification of nontrivial two-dimensional complete gradient Ricci and Yamabe solitons. For two-dimensional solitons, similar results were given by Bernstein and Mettler (cf. [1]) using different arguments.\n\nRemark 1.1. As is well known, the original Perelman conjecture [14] is that any three-dimensional complete noncompact $\\kappa$-noncollapsed steady gradient Ricci soliton with positive curvature is rotationally symmetric, which was proven by S.

If $F$ is constant, then $M$ is called trivial. If $\\lambda>0, \\lambda=0$, or $\\lambda<0$, then the Yamabe soliton is called shrinking, steady, or expanding, respectively.\n\nTo classify complete gradient Yamabe solitons, we use Tashiro's theorem ([16], see also [12]).\n\nTheorem 2.1 ([16]).

Classification of three-dimensional COMPlete Steady GRADIENT Yamabe SOlItons \n\nIn this section, we classify three-dimensional complete steady gradient Yamabe solitons.\n\nTheorem 3.1.

[11]).\nCase (3) of Theorem 2.1.\nIn this case, by a direct calculation, we can get formulas of the warped product manifold of the warping function $(0<)|\\nabla F|=F^{\\prime}(r)$.

If $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq 0$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, then the positive function $\\rho$ is concave. Hence $\\rho$ is constant. By (3.5), $\\bar{R}=0$. By (3.4) and (3.1), $M$ is flat. Therefore, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ on some interval $\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}\\right)$.\n\nIf $r_{2}=+\\infty$, since $\\rho^{\\prime} \\geq 0, \\rho$ goes to infinity as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$. Hence, the left hand side of (3.5) goes to infinity as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$, which cannot happen.\n\nAssume that $r_{2}<+\\infty$, that is, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ on $\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}\\right)$ and $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0$ at $r_{2}$. By (3.6), we have $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}<0$ at $r_{2}$. Hence, one has $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\left(r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$ for some $r_{3}$. By the same argument, $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is monotone decreasing on $\\left(r_{2},+\\infty\\right)$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the point $r_{2}$ is the first critical one of $\\rho^{\\prime}$. Since $\\rho^{\\prime} \\geq 0$ and $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ on $\\left(-\\infty, r_{2}\\right)$, there exists $r_{0} \\in\\left(-\\infty, r_{2}\\right)$ such that, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}=0$.

Since $\\rho$ is a positive monotone decreasing function on $\\left(r_{1},+\\infty\\right), \\rho \\searrow c$ as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$ for some positive constant c. If $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\left(r_{1},+\\infty\\right)$, then $\\rho$ is a positive concave function, which induces that $\\rho$ is constant, which is a contradiction. Assume that there exists $\\tilde{r} \\in\\left(r_{1},+\\infty\\right)$ such that $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0$. By (3.6), $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}(\\tilde{r})<0$. Hence, by iterating the same argument, $\\rho^{\\prime}$ is weakly monotone decreasing on $(\\tilde{r},+\\infty)$. Hence, $\\rho^{\\prime}<-\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma>0$ on $\\left(r_{2},+\\infty\\right)$ for some $r_{2}$. Since $\\rho>0$, we have a contradiction. Therefore, one has $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ on $\\left(r_{1},+\\infty\\right)$ and $\\rho^{\\prime} \\nearrow \\alpha$ as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$ for some constant $\\alpha \\leq 0$. If $\\alpha \\neq 0$, we have a contradiction, because $\\rho>0$. Hence, $\\alpha=0$, that is $\\rho^{\\prime} \\nearrow 0$ as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$. By (3.5), $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}$ converges to some constant $c$. Since $\\rho>0$ and $\\rho^{\\prime}<0$, we have $c=0$, that is, $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime} \\searrow 0$ as $r \\nearrow+\\infty$. By (3.5), $\\bar{R}$ must be 0 . Assume that $\\left(r_{-2}, r_{-1}\\right)$ is some maximal interval such that $\\rho^{\\prime}>0$. By (3.5), we have $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}<0$ on $\\left(r_{-2}, r_{-1}\\right)$. If $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0$ at some point, by (3.5), we have $\\rho^{\\prime} \\leq 0$ at this point, which means that $r_{-2}$ must be $-\\infty$. However, since $\\rho>0$, it cannot happen.

If $\\rho^{\\prime}=0$ at $r_{3}$, then $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ at $r_{3}$. Hence, $\\rho$ is monotone increasing on $\\left(r_{2},+\\infty\\right)$. If $\\rho^{\\prime}=0$ at $r_{1}$, then $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ at $r_{1}$, which cannot happen. Therefore, $\\rho^{\\prime}<0$ on $\\left(-\\infty, r_{2}\\right)$. Case $2 \\bar{R}=0$.

Hence, $\\rho^{\\prime}<0$ on $\\left(r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$ for some $r_{3}$. If $r_{3}=+\\infty$, by the same argument as above, one has $\\bar{R}=0$, which is a contradiction. Hence $r_{3}<+\\infty$, that is $\\rho^{\\prime}=0$ at $r_{3}$, which means that there exists $\\tilde{r}_{2} \\in\\left(r_{2}, r_{3}\\right)$ such that $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}=0$.

Classification of three-dimensional COMPlete EXPANDING GRADIENT Yamabe SOlItONS \n\nAs is well known, in the study of Ricci solitons, much less is understood about the expanding case compared to the shrinking or steady cases.
