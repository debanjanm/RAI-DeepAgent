Such an informationally constrained planner cannot distinguish between different utility profiles that induce the same rankings over the objects. In this context, we ask what it means to adjudge an allocation as efficient.\n\nWe introduce the concept of unambiguous efficiency, which guarantees no further Pareto improvement regardless of how agents' ordinal preferences extend to lotteries. We compare this concept with the predominant formulation of efficiency in the random allocation literature and explore some structural properties.

      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nIt would not be controversial for us to say that efficiency is the central normative consideration in most economic analyses. We have long converged on a formulation of this concept that says: if moving from $x$ to $y$ makes someone better off without making anyone worse off, $x$ is not efficient. This concept has been studied across different economic contexts. We investigate its application to object allocation through lotteries. We begin our analysis by tracing the intellectual lineage of efficiency, from its origins to the recent literature on random allocation mechanisms.\n\nWe attribute this efficiency notion to Pareto, but Edgeworth refers to it even earlier in his Mathematical Psychics (Edgeworth, 1881, p. 27, emphasis in original): \"the utility of any one contractor must be a maximum relative to the utilities of other contractors being constant, or not decreasing.\" Like Edgeworth, Pareto describes his now-eponymous efficiency concept while formalizing the sense in which an equilibrium allocation is optimal. In Pareto (1902), having drawn indifference curves of two individuals through a point, he remarks on the point of tangency, $m$, as follows (the English translation is from Pareto (2008)): ${ }^{1}$\n\nIl punto $m$ gode dunque della propriet\u00e0 che da esso non ci si pu\u00f2 allontanare, col baratto, o con altro simile ordinamento tale che ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 tolto ad un individuo viene dato all'altro, per modo di fare crescere entrambe le ofelimit\u00e0 totali dei due individui.\n[The point $m$ therefore enjoys the property that it is not possible in departing from it, by barter, or by some similar arrangement such that what is taken away from one individual is given to another, to increase the total ophelimities of both individuals.]\n\nThis description applies to allocations of indivisible goods, but Arrow (1951) expands its scope. In discussing the compensation principle, Arrow states an efficiency criterion that amounts to Pareto efficiency and says \"this formulation is certainly not debatable except perhaps on a philosophy of systematically denying people whatever they want.\" By the 1970s, Pareto-efficiency was accepted as a fundamental normative criterion without need for an explanation. For instance, in imposing the requirement of Pareto-efficiency on\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Pareto used a common origin for both individuals rather than what we have come to call the Edgeworth box. The diagram in Edgeworth (1881) is not what we now know as the Edgeworth box. Pareto subsequently discovered the box in Pareto (1906). So, perhaps we should call them the Pareto-box and Edgeworthefficiency. We thank William Thomson for bringing up the murky issues of attribution for these ideas. For more, see Tarascio (1972).\n\nvoting schemes, Zeckhauser (1973) merely says that it is \"unambiguous,\" yet makes an argument for the other requirement (non-dictatorship).\n\nIn first studying the problem we study here, the allocation of indivisible goods via lottery, Hylland and Zeckhauser's (1979) primary objective is Pareto-efficiency. In their model, each agent has von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility function with which they compare lotteries over the objects. Edgeworth's and Pareto's descriptions of Paretoefficiency translate naturally to such a setting and they mean the same thing. The equivalence relies on agents' preferences over lotteries being complete.\n\nA subsequent line of research on allocation via lotteries pertains to ordinal allocation mechanisms, building on Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), and the current paper contributes to this literature. So, we consider allocation mechanisms that respond only to the ordinal content of agents' preferences without regard for intensities. The restriction to ordinal mechanisms may be driven by cognitive or informational constraints. Specifically, vNM preferences may not be adequate to represent agents' preferences (see, for instance, Kagel and Roth (1995)). Even if they are adequate, incentive compatibility in such settings (alongside some regularity conditions) also implies ordinality. ${ }^{2}$\n\nThe analysis of efficiency in an ordinal context is less straightforward than informationally unconstrained settings. Rather than comparing lotteries on the basis of vNM utilities, a natural approach is to compare based on the first order stochastic dominance. Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001) define \"ordinal efficiency\" (much of the subsequent literature calls it \"sd-efficiency\") so that an allocation $\\pi$ is efficient if there is no $\\pi^{\\prime}$ that stochastically dominates $\\pi$ for each agent. There is a vast literature following this approach. Perhaps because Pareto-efficiency is now a standard concept, this formulation has been accepted and built upon with little discussion of its import.\n\nBoth Edgeworth's and Pareto's descriptions of efficiency are that an agent cannot be made better off subject to a constraint. Edgeworth's constraint is not making others worse off, while Pareto's is making others better off as well. Completeness of the welfare comparisons (preferences) renders these equivalent. However, the first order stochastic dominance relation is incomplete. Thus, the efficiency concept of Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), which corresponds to Pareto's description, is not the only way to define efficiency of an ordinal mechanism. We argue for an alternative that has a more clear-cut normative interpretation. If each agent has a well defined preference over lotteries (whether vNM or not), even if we are interested in ordinal mechanisms, we should still make effi-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Under a strong property called \"uniform cone continuity,\" Ehlers et al. (2020) show that strategyproofness alone implies ordinality in a very general model. Even with a substantially weaker notion of continuity, Heo and Manjunath (2025) show that incentive compatibility alongside efficiency, neutrality and non-bossiness implies ordinality in the case of 3 agents.\n\nciency judgements with regard to these preferences over lotteries. In other words, a social planner may want an allocation whose efficiency is robust to the information they cannot access (specifically, intensity of preferences between objects). However, an ordinally constrained planner cannot distinguish between different utility profiles that induce the same ordinal preferences. Thus, they can only be sure that an allocation is efficient if it is efficient for all the utility profiles that induce the ordinal preferences they see. In this sense, we refer to it as unambiguous efficiency. The ambiguity, from the planner's perspective, is about agents' complete preferences over lotteries. Rather than a single preference profile, they have to make judgements about efficiency for a set of preference profiles. This is the notion in Gibbard (1977) with regard to probabilistic, yet ordinal, voting schemes. Gibbard (1977) refers to \"Pareto optimality ex ante\" with regard to vNM utilities. To extend this definition to ordinal mechanisms, he says that a lottery is \"Pareto optimific ex ante\" at a ordinal preference profile $P$ if it is Pareto optimal ex ante for every profile of vNM utilities consistent with $P .{ }^{3}$ We will eschew the term \"optimificity\" and stick with efficiency. ${ }^{4}$\n\nUnlike this notion, Bogomolnaia and Moulin's (2001) efficiency only amounts to efficiency for some consistent vNM utility profile (McLennan, 2002) (see also Carroll (2010) and Aziz et al. (2015), or Cho and Do\u011fan (2016) for lexicographic preferences). Importantly, an allocation may be deemed efficient in this sense even if it is not efficient for the actual utility profile. For this reason, we will refer to it as ambiguous efficiency. Again, the ambiguity is from the planner's perspective: for the set of utility profiles they have in mind, the allocation is guaranteed to be efficient for some, but not necessarily all of them. We give a graphical illustration of this idea in the Marshak triangle for three objects $a, b$, and $c$ (Fig. 1). Suppose that agent $i$ has a vNM utility function $u_{i}$ such that $u_{i}(a)>u_{i}(b)>u_{i}(c)$. Given a lottery $\\pi_{i}$, the lotteries that stochastically dominate $\\pi_{i}$ are in the cone marked (A). The lotteries that are dominated by $\\pi_{i}$ are in the cone marked (B). The lotteries in the cones marked (C) and (D) neither dominate nor are dominated by $\\pi_{i}$. Since $u_{i}$ is vNM, $i$ 's indifference curve through $\\pi_{i}$ is a line that passes through the cones $(\\mathrm{C})$ and (D). We depict the indifference curve through $\\pi_{i}$ with a dashed line and an arrow showing the direction of increasing utility. For each allocation $\\pi^{\\prime}$, ambiguous efficiency\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ In this paper, We follow the temporal terminology of Gibbard (1977) with regard to the realization of the lottery over sure allocations. Thus, \"ex ante\" means \"before the lottery is realized\" while \"ex post\" means \"after the lottery is realized.\" Though obvious, we hope to avoid any confusion this may cause for readers steeped in the literature where the temporal frame of reference is the realization of individuals' preferences (or types more generally).\n    ${ }^{4}$ For a collective decision where agents have single-peaked preferences, Ehlers et al. (2002) show that this definition of efficiency amounts to placing positive probability only on Pareto efficient deterministic outcomes.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: A graphical illustration of how the incompleteness of the stochastic dominance relation has consequences for the definition of efficiency\nmerely requires that not all agents can receive a lottery in the region corresponding to cone (A). So, at least one agent, perhaps $i$ receives a lottery outside (A), as depicted. The lottery $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ is not comparable by stochastic dominance to $\\pi_{i}$, even though $i$ prefers it. On the other hand, the only way an allocation can be efficient for every ordinally equivalent profile of utility functions is if any change, say to $\\pi^{\\prime \\prime}$, moves some agent into the region corresponding to (B) as shown in the figure. This yields an alternative definition of unambiguous efficiency based on stochastic dominance that is decidedly stronger than ambiguous efficiency. An advantage to this definition of efficiency is that even if agents do not have vNM preferences, as long as actual preferences are completions of the stochastic dominance relation, it does not allow any further improvement with regards to their actual preferences.\n\nIn this paper we explore some implications of unambiguous efficiency. To the best of our knowledge this approach to efficiency has not been pursued in the random allocation setting. However, a corresponding formulation of efficiency has been studied in the literature on fair division of indivisible goods (Brams et al., 2003; Aziz et al., 2016; Manjunath and Westkamp, 2024). Since agents' preferences are over sets of objects, like ordinality in our setting one may wish to compute fair divisions using only agents' marginal preferences over objects. A notion of dominance analogous to the first order stochastic dominance gives a partial order, and there are again two ways to define efficiency.\n\nOur contributions are as follows. First, we formally define unambiguous efficiency as discussed above. We provide a necessary condition on allocations for them to be unambiguously efficient. Moreover, we show that unambiguously efficient allocations are combinatorial (Aziz et al., 2015), meaning that whether or not an allocation is efficient is determined by which objects each agent receives with positive probability regardless\n\nof magnitude. Second, we argue that efficiency, even in probabilistic settings, is hardly compatible with a basic notion of fairness, even though the purpose of randomization is to typically to achieve equity. Symmetry says that agents who have the same preferences ought to receive the same lottery. If the planner only sees ordinal preferences, symmetry is a rather strong property: even agents with vastly different preferences over lotteries are indistinguishable. We demonstrate that symmetric allocations are susceptible to severe efficiency losses. Specifically, we show that as the number of agents grows, the worst case welfare cost of imposing symmetry alongside ordinality is as high as it could possibly be (Example 3). Some well-known ordinal rules, such as the probabilistic serial rule and random serial dictatorship, also suffer such severe losses.\n\nThird, we show that randomization is still feasible under efficiency, albeit to a limited extent, and contrast the strength of unambiguous efficiency to that of ambiguous efficiency on the class of random serial dictatorship allocations, which are frequently used in practice. They involve drawing an ordering of the agents at random and assigning each agent, according the realized ordering, their most preferred object among those remaining. However, these allocations are not necessarily ex ante efficient (Hylland and Zeckhauser, 1979; Bogomolnaia and Moulin, 2001). It turns out that restricting the set of orders over which one randomizes can correct this flaw at the cost of fairness. Harless and Phan (2022) characterize such sets of orders that ensure ambiguous efficiency of random serial dictatorship allocations. They call a set of orders that vary only in how three consecutive agents are ranked \"adjacent-three\" sets and show that these are maximal sets over which randomized serial dictatorship is ambiguously efficient. We show that \"adjacent-two\" sets are maximal if one seeks unambiguous efficiency, rather than ambiguous efficiency (Proposition 3).\n\nFinally, we consider the question of incentives. What mechanisms can an ordinally constrained social planner use to elicit preferences truthfully? We characterize the class of all ordinal mechanisms that are unambiguously efficient, strategy-proof, and satisfy some regularity conditions (non-bossiness, neutrality, and bounded invariance) (Theorem 1). To define this class of mechanisms, we provide a novel recursive algorithm. Given a supply level between zero and one for each object, the algorithm assigns lotteries to one or two agents at a time. When allocating to a single agent (\"monarchy\"), it assigns them their most preferred lottery subject to the supply vector. When allocating to two agents (\"diarchy\"), call them $i$ and $j$, it first computes $i$ 's most preferred lottery, $\\pi_{i}$, subject to supply. Then it computes $i$ 's most preferred lottery, $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$, subject to supply after removing $j$ 's most preferred lottery. It assigns to $i$, for a fixed $\\alpha$, the lottery $\\alpha \\pi_{i}+(1-\\alpha) \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$. It allocates the analogous lottery to $j$. It is as though $i$ and $j$ flip an $\\alpha$-weighted coin, the winner\n\npicks first, and the other picks second. Having allocated lotteries to one or two agents as described above, the algorithm removes these agents and subtracts from the supply vector what it has allocated to them. It solves the remaining problem recursively with the new (residual) supply vector and remaining agents. The choices of successive agents to allocate to can depend on allocations that have already been finalized. Specifically, who comes next can depend on the identities of the preceding agents and the integrality of their allocations. We call a mechanism induced by this algorithm a \"hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies\".\n\nThe class of these mechanisms includes, but is not limited to, serial dictatorship mechanisms characterized by Svensson (1999). In this sense, our characterization is in the spirit of of Svensson's (1999) characterization, but in the context of probabilistic allocation. This characterization is not in conflict with Zhou's (1990) incompatibility between strategy-proofness, ex ante efficiency, and an equity property in the form of symmetry. To the best of our knowledge, an analogous characterization with ambiguous efficiency or ex post efficiency in place of unambiguous efficiency does not exist in the literature. To this end, Basteck and Ehlers (2023) have recently provided a counterexample to the long standing conjecture that strategy-proofness, ex post efficiency, and symmetry characterize random serial dictatorship.\n\nWe have organized the remainder of the paper as follows. In Section 2, we formally define the random allocation problem. We discuss the informational restriction to ordinal preferences in Section 2.1, welfare comparisons in Section 2.2, and efficiency in Section 2.3. In Section 3, we take up an application of our efficiency concept to mechanism design. We offer some concluding remarks in Section 4. All proofs are in the appendix.",

When there are fewer than three objects the issues discussed in this paper become trivial so we omit that case. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}(\\boldsymbol{A})$ be the set of lotteries over $A$. As it does not cause confusion, we identify degenerate lotteries in $\\Delta(A)$ with $A$ itself. So, for each $a \\in A$, we denote the lottery that places probability one on $a$ by $a$. We denote a generic lottery that agent $i$ might consume by $\\pi_{i} \\in \\Delta(A)$ and its support by $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)$. Each agent has preferences over the lottery that they receive.\n\nAssumption 1. Agents' preferences are represented by utility functions, with $u_{i}: \\Delta(A) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ representing agent i's preferences.\n\nWe denote by $\\mathcal{U}$ the universe of possible utility functions for an agent. Fixing the set of agents and the objects to assign to them, an economy is described by a profile of agents' preferences $u \\in \\mathcal{U}^{N}$.\n\nWe are interested in settings where agents are mapped to objects so that each agent consumes a unique object and each object is consumed by a single agent. We consider the possibility of randomizing over such bijections. By the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem, we can think of a (randomized) allocation as a bistochastic matrix (Birkhoff, 1946; von Neumann, 1953). That is, an allocation $\\pi$ specifies a lottery over $A$ for each agent $i \\in N$ such that for each $a \\in A, \\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a}=1$. Denote by $\\Pi$ the set of all such allocations.\n\nGiven that an economy describes each agent's complete preferences over allocations, the definition of efficiency is straightforward. An allocation $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ is efficient at $\\boldsymbol{u}$ if there is no alternative allocation $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$ that makes at least one agent better off without making any other agent worse off. Formally, there is no $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$ such that for some $i \\in N$, $u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)>u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)$ and for no $i \\in N, u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)<u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)$.",

      "text": "# 2.1 The Ordinal Informational Environment \n\nIf the social planner, mechanism designer, or whatever other analyst, is able to successfully elicit from each agent complete preferences over lotteries then the definition of efficiency above is all we need. However, we are interested in an informationally constrained environment where they must make decisions or evaluations based on only some aspects of preferences. A salient constraint is that only ordinal preferences are available. Such a constraint might be driven by individuals having difficulty in articulating, let alone conveying, their full preferences over all lotteries (e.g. Kagel and Roth (1995)). Or it could be due to incentive concerns (e.g. Ehlers et al. (2020); Heo and Manjunath (2025)). Our goal is to draw attention to the definition of efficiency in such an ordinal informational environment.\n\nWe start by formalizing the idea that individuals have well-defined ordinal preferences.\n\nAssumption 2. For every utility function $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ that an agent $i$ may have, there is an ordering $P_{i}$ over $A$ such that for each pair $a, b \\in A, u_{i}(a)>u_{i}(b)$ if and only if a $P_{i} b$.\n\nWe say that such $u_{i}$ induces $P_{i}$. Next, we do not allow indifference between objects.\nAssumption 3. No distinct objects yield the same utility, so $P_{i}$ is a linear order over $A$.\nThe upshot of these two assumptions is that in the ordinally constrained environment, one must take as the primitive of an allocation problem, profiles of preference relations\n\nin $\\mathcal{P}$, the set of strict preference relations (complete, transitive, and antisymmetric binary relations) over $A$. Through the informationally constrained lens, an economy is thereby described not by a utility profile in $\\mathcal{U}^{N}$ but by a preference profile in $\\mathcal{P}^{N}$.",

      "text": "# 2.2 Expected Utility, Stochastic Dominance, and Welfare \n\nA natural model of the allocation problem at hand is one where individuals assess expected utility (Hylland and Zeckhauser, 1979; Zhou, 1990). Suppose an agent $i \\in N$ compares lotteries in this way. So, $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ is a von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility function where there is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{A}$ such that for each $\\pi_{i} \\in \\Delta(A), u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)=x \\cdot \\pi_{i}$. We now make a richness assumption on $\\mathcal{U}$.\n\nAssumption 4. If $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ induces the ordering $P_{i} \\in \\mathcal{P}$, then every von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function $u_{i}^{\\prime}$ that induces $P_{i}$ is also in $\\mathcal{U}$.\n\nIf all the planner knows is that $i$ has a vNM utility function that induces the ordering $P_{i}$, then they can still make some unambiguous comparisons in terms of $i$ 's preferences using stochastic dominance. Given a pair of allocations, $\\pi, \\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$, we say $\\pi_{i}$ stochastically dominates $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ at $P_{i}$ if for each $a \\in A, \\sum_{b P_{i} a} \\pi_{i b} \\geq \\sum_{b P_{i} a} \\pi_{i b}^{\\prime}$ with at least one strict inequality. We denote this by $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$. We use the notation $\\pi_{i} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ if either $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ or $\\pi_{i}=\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$. Since $R_{i}^{s d}$ is only a partial order, it may be that neither $\\pi_{i} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ nor $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}$, in which case we write $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime} N_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}$. By definition, $N_{i}^{s d}$ is a symmetric relation and if $\\pi_{i} N_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ there are $a, b \\in A$ such that $\\sum_{o P_{i} a} \\pi_{i o}>\\sum_{o P_{i} a} \\pi_{i o}^{\\prime}$ and $\\sum_{o P_{i} b} \\pi_{i o}^{\\prime}>\\sum_{o P_{i} b} \\pi_{i o}$.\n\nOur last assumption on $\\mathcal{U}$ is that every utility function in it respects its own stochastic dominance relation.\n\nAssumption 5. For every $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$, if $u_{i}$ induces $P_{i} \\in \\mathcal{P}$, then $u_{i}$ respects $P_{i}^{s d}$. That is, for every pair $\\pi_{i}, \\pi_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\Delta(A)$ such that $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}, u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)>u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nUnder our assumptions,\n\n$$\n\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime} \\quad \\text { if and only if } \\quad\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { for each } u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U} \\text { that induces } P_{i} \\\\\nu_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)>u_{i}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, a planner who sees preferences only through the ordinal lens is still able to identify unambiguous welfare comparisons between lotteries for each agent.

It is equivalent to say that switching from an unambiguously efficient allocation to any other makes at least one agent comparably worse off per their stochastic dominance relation. So, if $\\pi$ is unambiguously efficient at $P$ then for each $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi \\backslash\\{\\pi\\}$, there is some $i \\in N$ such that $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$. This formulation guarantees that we can find no Pareto improvement from an unambiguously efficient allocation even if we can fully access the agents' preferences over lotteries.\n\nThis notion was first proposed by Gibbard (1977) in the context of ordinal voting mechanisms and we adapt it to our allocation model.\n\nWe now present several implications of unambiguous efficiency. First, it restricts the number of objects that any pair of agents can jointly receive with positive probabilities.\n\nLemma 1. If $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ is unambiguously efficient at $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, then for each pair $i, j \\in N,\\left|\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\cap\\right.$ $\\left.\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{j}\\right)\\right| \\leq 2$.\n\nThis observation seems to significantly restrict the size of an agent's support, but we note that it is not always the case. The following example demonstrates that the support size can even be maximal for some agent.\n\nExample 1 (Support of an unambiguously efficient allocation). Let $N=\\{1, \\cdots, 7,8\\}$ and $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, \\cdots, a_{8}\\right\\}$. Consider the following preference profile and an allocation $\\pi$,\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\n\n| $\\pi=\\left[\\begin{array}{c\\|c} 1 & a_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3} & a_{4} & a_{5} & a_{6} & a_{7} & a_{8} \\\\ \\hline 1 & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 2 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 3 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 4 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 7 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & 0 & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ \\hline 8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{7}{8} & \\frac{1}{8} \\end{array}\\right]$ where the preferences over all the unspecified objects in the profile (denoted by dots) can be anything. Note that $\\pi$ is unambiguously efficient at the $P$ and so are any other allocations such that the support of each agent's lottery is exactly the set of objects specified in the preference profile. The condition of limited intersection of support stated in Lemma 1 holds at $\\pi$, yet the support size of agent 1 is maximal.\n\nWe now turn to the structure of the set of unambiguously efficient allocations. An efficiency notion $X$ is combinatorial if it is invariant to shifting mass over the same support. That is, $X$ is combinatorial if whenever $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ satisfies $X$, it is also satisfied by every $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$ such that $\\left\\{(i, a): \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}>0\\right\\}=\\left\\{(i, a): \\pi_{i a}>0\\right\\}$ (Aziz et al., 2015). We can strengthen this to say that $X$ is strongly combinatorial if we replace the condition relating $\\pi$ and $\\pi^{\\prime}$ with $\\left\\{(i, a): \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}>0\\right\\} \\subseteq\\left\\{(i, a): \\pi_{i a}>0\\right\\}$. It turns out that unambiguous efficiency is strongly combinatorial (as is ambiguous efficiency).\n\nProposition 1. Unambiguous efficiency is strongly combinatorial.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem tells us that every allocation in $\\Pi$ is a convex combination of permutation matrices, which correspond to deterministic allocations. In other words, every allocation is a point in the permutohedron. By Proposition 1 if a face of the permutohedron contains an unambiguously efficient allocation, then every allocation on that face is unambiguously efficient. So, rearranging or shifting mass between permutation matrices in the support of an unambiguously efficient allocation does not compromise efficiency.",

      "text": "# 2.3.2 Ambiguous efficiency \n\nWe now consider the alternative approach that says it suffices for the planner to just find some utility profile to justify their choice of allocation as efficient. Seeing the ordinal preference profile $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, this planner would say the allocation $\\pi$ is efficient if there is no other allocation $\\pi^{\\prime}$ that gives every agent either the same lottery as $\\pi$ or a lottery that beats it in stochastic dominance terms. Formally, $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ is ambiguously efficient at $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, if there is no $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi \\backslash\\{\\pi\\}$ such that for each $i \\in N, \\pi_{i}^{\\prime} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}$. An equivalent definition is to say that any alternative to an ambiguously efficient allocation gives at least one agent an allocation that is worse or uncomparable in stochastic dominance terms. This has been the dominant formulation of efficiency in the literature on random assignment (often under the moniker \"sd-efficiency\") since it was first introduced under the name of \"ordinal efficiency\" by Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001). It is a rather weak property of the allocation in that there may be utility profiles where an ambiguously efficient allocation is actually far from efficient. We demonstrate this in the following example.\n\nExample 2 (ambiguous efficiency). Let $N=\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $A=\\{a, b, c\\}$. Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be a preference profile such that each $i \\in N$ prefers $a$ to $b$ and $b$ to $c$. Let $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ be such that $\\pi_{1}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\pi_{2}=\\pi_{3}=\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$. It is easy to verify that this allocation is ambiguously efficient at $P$. Suppose that each $i$ has a vNM utility function $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ that induces $P_{i}$ :\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nwhere $0<\\varepsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$. Consider another allocation $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$ be such that $\\pi_{1}^{\\prime}=(0,1,0)$ and $\\pi_{2}^{\\prime}=$ $\\pi_{3}^{\\prime}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. If we move from $\\pi$ to $\\pi^{\\prime}$, for each $i$ the new lottery $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ is uncomparable to $\\pi_{i}$, so $\\pi^{\\prime}$ does not dominate $\\pi$ as far as ambiguous efficiency is concerned. Yet, each\n\nagent is enjoys a higher expected utility: for agent 1 , it increases from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $1-\\varepsilon$ and for the others it increases from $\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This Pareto improvement at $u$ demonstrates how ambiguous efficiency may be too restrictive in its definition of domination and therefore too permissive in which allocations are deemed efficient.\n\nA common impetus for randomization is the desire for treating agents fairly. This makes feasible what is, perhaps, the oldest form of fairness, going back over two thousand years to Aristotle's argument that one should treat equals equally (Aristotle, 1985). For the random allocation problem that we study, it first appears in Zhou (1990). An allocation $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ is symmetric (or treats equals equally) at $P$ if agents who have the same preference receive the same lottery. That is, for each pair of agents $i, j \\in N$, if $P_{i}=P_{j}$ then $\\pi_{i}=\\pi_{j}$.\n\nThe main methods of choosing allocations that have been studied in the literature (the Probabilistic Serial and Random Serial Dictatorship mechanisms described in Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001)) choose symmetric allocations. However, as we demonstrate in the next example, symmetry can lead to substantial losses of welfare. That is, symmetry comes at a potentially high cost in terms of efficiency.\n\nExample 3 (Cost of symmetry). Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be such that for each $i \\in N, a_{1} \\bar{P}_{i} a_{2} \\ldots \\bar{P}_{i} a_{n}$. Let $u^{\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{N}$ be a vNM utility profile such that for each $i \\in N, u_{i}^{\\varepsilon}$ induces $\\bar{P}_{i}$. Without loss of generality, we normalize $u^{\\varepsilon}$ in a way that for each $i \\in N, i$ attaches a utility of 1 to their most preferred object and zero to their least preferred object. Then, for each pair of lotteries, $\\pi_{i}$ and $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$, the difference $\\left(u_{i}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)-u_{i}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)\\right)$ measures the change in $i$ 's welfare in terms of probability shifted from their least to most preferred object. Let $\\varepsilon>0$ and $u^{\\varepsilon} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{N}$ be as depicted in the following table:\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nSince all of the agents have the same ordinal preferences, the symmetric allocation, $\\bar{\\pi}$ gives each agent each object with equal probability of $\\frac{1}{n}$, that is $\\frac{1}{n}$. Now, consider a trade between agent 1 and any other agent $j \\neq 1,2$ where $j$ gives 1 a portion of $j$ 's share of $a_{2}$ in\n\nexchange for some of 1's shares of $a_{1}$ and, for some $k>2, a_{k}$. Denote the rate of exchange that would leave agent $j$ indifferent to such a trade (so that the gains accrue to agent 1) by $\\mu^{k}$. Solving $j$ 's indifference condition, we see that\n\n$$\n\\mu^{k}=\\frac{(k-2) \\varepsilon}{1-(n-k) \\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nAgent 1 gains from such a trade since, per unit of $a_{2}$ that they receive from $j$, their expected utility changes by\n\n$$\n-\\mu^{k}+(1-\\varepsilon)-\\left(1-\\mu^{k}\\right)(n-k) \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhich is positive for small enough $\\varepsilon$. The volume of this trade is limited by the fact that $j$ can only transfer $\\frac{1}{n}$ units of $a_{2}$ to agent 1 . While agent 1 can engage in such trades with more than one $j$, they are limited by the $\\frac{1}{n}$ of $a_{k}$ that they have and the constraint that they end up with one unit of total probability. Engaging in $(n-2)$ trades (perhaps evenly distributed among all trading partners in $N \\backslash\\{1,2\\}$ ), agent 1 can achieve the following lottery without harm to any other agent:\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1 a_{l}}^{c}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{1}{n}\\left(1-\\sum_{k=3}^{n} \\mu^{k}\\right) & \\text { if } l=1 \\\\\n\\frac{n-1}{n} & \\text { if } l=2 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=3}^{n} \\mu^{k} & \\text { otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nNote that $\\pi^{\\varepsilon}$ does not exhaust all gains from trade, but it suffices to make our point.\nFor any $\\delta>0$, we can find $\\varepsilon$ such that $u_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{1}\\right)-\\frac{2}{n} \\leq \\delta$ and $1-u_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\pi_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\leq \\delta$. That is, for small enough $\\varepsilon, u_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\pi_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\right)-u_{1}^{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{1}\\right)$ is no smaller than $\\frac{n-2}{n}-2 \\delta$. So, 1 can achieve gains from trade close to the equivalent of shifting $\\frac{n-2}{n}$ mass from their least preferred object $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ to their most preferred object $\\left(a_{1}\\right)$. As the number of agents grows, this goes to 1 , the equivalent of going from their worst object with certainty to their best object with certainty.",

      "text": "# 2.3.3 Unambiguous Efficiency Versus Ambiguous Efficiency: Randomizing Over Serial Dictatorship Allocations \n\nA simple way of finding an efficient allocation is to let agents pick their favorite available object one by one. In fact, we can reach every efficient deterministic allocation by varying the order in which agents pick. We call these serial dictatorship allocations. Of course, one can randomize over the ordering, leading to random serial dictatorship allocations. Selecting an allocation by uniformly randomizing over all possible orderings is a simple way to provide strong incentives for agents to truthfully convey their ordinal\n\npreferences (Li, 2017; Pycia and Troyan, 2023), but such allocations are not necessarily unambiguously efficient or even ambiguously efficient. One way to get around this problem is to randomize over a subset of orderings. In what follows, we compare the extent to which this subset has to be restricted to achieve unambiguous efficiency as compared to just ambiguous efficiency. As a point of clarification, in this section we are interested in an allocation's \"punctual\" property of efficiency at a fixed profile of preferences. In the next section we will turn to mechanisms, which map preference profiles to allocations, respond to changes in the preference profile.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{O}$ be the set of all orderings over $N$. For each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and each $>\\in \\mathcal{O}$, denote the serial dictatorship allocation with respect to $>$ by $\\pi^{P}(>)$. Given $P$ and a probability distribution $\\lambda$ over $\\mathcal{O}$, the randomized serial dictatorship allocation with respect to $\\lambda$, which we denote by $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$, is the $\\lambda$-weighted convex combination of $\\pi^{P}(>)$ s. So,\n\n$$\n\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)=\\sum_{>\\in \\mathcal{O}} \\lambda(>) \\pi^{P}(>)\n$$\n\nGiven a subset of orders $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}$, we say that $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ is compatible with property $X$ if for each $\\lambda$ with support $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ and each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, \\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$ satisfies $X$. If, additionally, there is no $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime \\prime} \\supseteq \\mathcal{O}$ that is compatible with $X$, we say that $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ is maximal for $X$.\n\nA set of orders, $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$, is an adjacent- $k$ set if there is a set of $k$ agents $N^{\\prime} \\subseteq N$ such that\n\n1. all orders in $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ agree on $N \\backslash N^{\\prime}$.\n2. for each of $k$ ! orderings of $N^{\\prime}$, there is an ordering in $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ that agrees with it over $N^{\\prime}$.\n3. every order in $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$ ranks the same agents in $N \\backslash N^{\\prime}$ above those in $N^{\\prime}$.\n4. agents in $N^{\\prime}$ are adjacent in every order in $\\mathcal{O}^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe now contrast ambiguous efficiency and unambiguous efficiency in terms of their maximal sets.\n\nProposition 2. (Harless and Phan, 2022) Adjacent-3 sets are maximal for ambiguous efficiency.\n\nProposition 3. Adjacent-2 sets are maximal for unambiguous efficiency.\nThese results show that both ambiguous efficiency and unambiguous efficiency substantially limit the flexibility of randomization for serial dictatorship allocations. However, weakening unambiguous efficiency to ambiguous efficiency only expands the range from adjacent- 2 to adjacent- 3 sets in terms of adjacent- $k$ sets. Though Harless and Phan\n\n(2022) show that there are other maximal sets for ambiguous efficiency, as far as Adjacent$k$ sets go, $k=3$ is maximal.",

      "text": "### 3.1 Strategy-proofness and Other Properties\n\nSince we are now turning to incentives, the object of our analysis is a mechanism, which maps the information that the planner receives to an allocation. That is, a mapping $\\varphi: \\mathcal{P}^{N} \\rightarrow \\Pi$. We are interested only in such mechanisms that choose an unambiguously efficient allocation for every preference profile. We use the notation $\\varphi_{i}(\\boldsymbol{P})$ to denote the lottery that $i \\in N$ receives when the planner sees the ordinal preference profile $P$.\n\nA standard incentive requirement, originating from Black (1948) and Farquharson (1956), is to prevent profitable manipulations by any agent. Stated in terms of stochastic dominance: a mechanism is strategy-proof if for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, each $i \\in N$, and each $P_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}$, $\\varphi_{i}(P) R_{i}^{\\text {sd }} \\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$ (Gibbard, 1977; Bogomolnaia and Moulin, 2001). It is equivalent to saying that there is no utility profile $u \\in \\mathcal{U}^{N}$, agent $i \\in N$, and utility function $u_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{U}$ where $u$ induces ordinal preference profile $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and $u_{i}^{\\prime}$ induces $P_{i}^{\\prime}$, such that\n\n$$\nu_{i}\\left(\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)\\right)>u_{i}\\left(\\varphi_{i}(P)\\right)\n$$\n\nIf the mechanism satisfies this property, the planner can rest assured that, regardless of the true utilities, no agent has an incentive to lie about their preference. This is consistent with our definition of unambiguous efficiency.\n\nFor the version of our problem without randomization, Svensson (1999) characterizes serial dictatorships as the only strategy-proof mechanisms that satisfy certain regularity conditions. In what follows, we state versions of these regularity conditions. They deliver a characterization of a class of unambiguously efficient and strategy-proof mechanisms.\n\nAs mentioned above, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such characterization for random assignment.\n\nThe first regularity condition is neutrality, which says that a mechanism ought to be robust to permuting the names of the objects in $A$. Formally, $\\varphi$ is neutral if for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, and each permutation of the objects $\\rho$, whenever $P^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ rearranges $P$ according to $\\rho$, for each $i \\in N$ and $a \\in A, \\varphi_{i a}\\left(P^{\\prime}\\right)=\\varphi_{i \\rho(a)}(P)$. This concept first appears in May (1952). It has subsequently featured in the literature on allocation of indivisible goods (Svensson, 1999).\n\nSecond, $\\varphi$ is non-bossy if whenever an agent's reported preferences change without affecting what they get, this change does not affect what any agent gets. Formally, for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, each $i \\in N$, and each $P_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\varphi_{i}(P)=\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$, we have $\\varphi(P)=\\varphi\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$. Non-bossiness was first defined by Satterthwaite and Sonnenschein (1981).\n\nThe final condition, bounded invariance, is also a restriction on how a mechanism responds to changes in a single agent's preferences. It says that if the only changes are for objects they rank below $a \\in A$, then this should not affect how probability shares of $a$ are assigned. Formally, $\\varphi$ is boundedly invariant if for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, each $i \\in N$, each $a \\in A$, and each $P_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}$, whenever $\\left\\{o \\in A: o R_{i} a\\right\\}=\\left\\{o \\in A: o R_{i}^{\\prime} a\\right\\}$ and $P_{i}$ and $P_{i}^{\\prime}$ coincide on $\\left\\{o \\in A: o R_{i} a\\right\\}$, for each $j \\in N, \\varphi_{j a}\\left(P_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{j a}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$. This condition, specific to the random allocation problem, first appears in Heo (2010).",

      "text": "# 3.2 Hierarchies of Monarchies and Diarchies \n\nWe describe a class of mechanisms that are characterized by unambiguous efficiency, strategy-proofness and the above three regularity properties. Informally, these mechanisms operate as follows. The supply of each object is initially set to 1 .\n\nStep 1: Select either a single agent or a pair of agents.\nIf we select a single agent, assign to them their most preferred object with certainty. If we select a pair of agents $i$ and $j$, flip a weighted coin to determine who picks first and who picks second to be assigned their most preferred object. Of course, in the latter case, the allocations of $i$ and $j$ are non-deterministic if and only if they have the same favorite object. Reduce the supply of each object by the assignment(s) from this step.\n\nStep $k$ : If at least one object has non-integral supply (strictly between zero and one) at the end of the previous step, then select a single agent whose allocation we have yet\n\nto determine. Otherwise, select a single agent or a pair of agents.\nIf we select a single agent, assign to them their most preferred lottery from the remaining supply of all of the objects. If we select a pair of agents $i$ and $j$, flip a weighted coin to determine who picks first and who picks second to be assigned their most preferred object. Reduce the supply of each object by the assignment(s) from this step.\n\nStop when all agents' assignments have been determined.\nThe selection of single agents or pairs of agents in each step is governed by a selection rule that is fixed a priori. It can only depend some aspects of what has transpired in earlier steps. Specifically, it can depend on:\n\n1. whether the supplies of the remaining objects are integral or not,\n2. who have already been assigned in the previous steps, and\n3. who received deterministic assignments and who received non-deterministic ones.\n\nWe call these mechanisms, which are parameterized by selection rules, Hierarchies of Monarchies and Diarchies (HMD). The \"monarchies\" refer to single agents and \"diarchies\" refer to the pairs of agents. We provide a rigorous definition of the above algorithm and restrictions on the selection of agents in Appendix B along with some detailed demonstrative examples.\n\nTo fix ideas, we present a simple example of how such a mechanism works.\nExample 4. Example of an HMD Let $N=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}, A=\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$ and $P, \\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be preference profiles such that\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nConsider an HMD associated with the following simple selection rules: (i) at step 1, a diarchy of 1 and 2 is chosen with weight $\\frac{1}{3}$ in favor of 1 , (ii) at any subsequent step $k$, if the supplies of all the objects are integral and the assignment from Step $(k-1)$ is also integral, then a diarchy with an equal weight is chosen in the order of 3-4-5 (i.e., the first two agents in this ordering among those who have not yet been allocated); otherwise, a\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The selection rule defining a HMD in Example 4 can be illustrated as a tree, since the selection of a monarchy or a diarchy in each step is contingent on the assignments of the earlier steps.\nmonarchy is chosen in the order of 5-4-3 (i.e., the first agent in this ordering among those have not yet been allocated). We illustrate this selection rule as a tree in Figure 2.\n\nConsider the first profile $P$ above. In Step 1, we have a $\\frac{1}{3}$ weighted diarchy of agents 1 and 2 . They split $a$ with 1 receiving $\\frac{1}{3}$ of it and 2 receiving $\\frac{2}{3}$. They receive the remaining $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ respectively of their second most preferred objects. In Step 2, objects $b$ and $e$ are partially available and the assignments of Step 1 are not integral. Therefore, the selection rule says we have a monarchy of agent 5 next. Agent 5 gets their most preferred lottery from the remaining supply, $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $b$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $c$. Next, in Step 3, objects $c$ and $e$ are partially available and the assignments up to Step 2 are not all integral. Therefore, we have a monarchy of agent 4 . Agent 4 gets $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $e$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $c$. Finally, agent 3 gets 1 of the remaining object $d$. The resulting allocation is $\\pi$ below.\n\nTo highlight the possibility of different execution paths, consider $\\bar{P}$. In Step 1, we again have a $\\frac{1}{3}$ weighted diarchy of agents 1 and 2 , but they receive probability 1 of their respective favorite objects. In The remaining supply after Step 1 as well as the assignments in Step 1 are integral. So, in Step 2 we have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ weighted diarchy of agents 3 and 4. They split their common favorite object $e$ equally and get the remaining half of their next preferred objects. In Step 3, agent 5 gets the remaining probabilities of $c$ and $d$.\n\nThe resulting allocation is $\\bar{\\pi}$ shown below.\n\nHMDs are reminiscent of the \"inheritance trees\" in P\u00e1pai (2000) where allocations are deterministic. An important difference is that an inheritance tree governs the rights to a single object while in an HMD, all objects are \"controlled\" by either a monarch or diarchs at each step. Moreover, the constraints that govern branching of these structures are different because our setting allows partial allocation and that of P\u00e1pai (2000) is not subject to neutrality.\n\nThe combination of properties we impose restricts the degree to which a mechanism can randomize. For the problem of choosing a common lottery by a voting scheme, non-bossiness and bounded invariance are vacuous. For such problems, Gibbard (1977) shows that every ordinal, unambiguously efficient, and strategy-proof mechanism is dictatorial and therefore involves no randomization. For our problem of allocating objects, if we do not allow randomization at all, efficiency is implied by strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and neutrality, so these three properties characterize serial dictatorships (Svensson, 1999). While our mechanisms do involve some randomization, they still have the hierarchical nature of serial dictatorships.\n\nTheorem 1. A mechanism is unambiguously efficient, strategy-proof, non-bossy, neutral, and boundedly invariant if and only if it is a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies.\n\nIn the appendix, we give examples of mechanisms demonstrating that the four properties other than bounded invariance are independent of the others. If there are only three agents, then every hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies is a random serial dictatorship over an adjacent-two set. So, bounded invariance is redundant in our list of properties, yielding the following corollary. Whether this is true for more than three agents and objects remains an open question.\n\nCorollary 1. If $|A|=|N|=3$, then a mechanism is unambiguously efficient, strategy-proof, neutral, and non-bossy if and only if it is a random serial dictatorship over an adjacent-two set.\n\nRemark 1. \"Triarchies\": A straightforward extension of the class of HMD mechanisms is to include the possibility of randomizations of three agents to form triarchies. An easy adaptation of the proofs that HMDs are strategy-proof, neutral, and boundedly invariant would work to show that such hierarchies of monarchies, diarchies, and triarchies also satisfy these properties. Though not unambiguously efficient, they would be ambiguously efficient.",

      "text": "# 4 Concluding Remarks \n\nFor over a century, economists have considered efficient an allocation that cannot be improved from the perspective of every agent. Equivalently, an efficient allocation is one where any change would necessarily make someone worse off. This equivalence breaks down when welfare comparisons are incomplete due to sparseness of information, in which case the first formulation is strictly weaker than the second.\n\nThe allocation of objects via lotteries on the basis of ordinal rankings is a well-studied setting where such comparisons are incomplete. The literature has focused on ambiguous efficiency, which is the weaker form. We have argued that the stronger form has a more natural normative interpretation.\n\nAs we have demonstrated, an ambiguously efficient allocation may be quite far from maximizing each agents' welfare without making others worse off. This property deserves greater scrutiny. A more systematic analysis of the degree to which it does or does not ensure that welfare gains are realized is an important avenue for future research.\n\nThere remain open important questions about normative criteria that unambiguous efficiency is compatible with. Though unambiguous efficiency and symmetry are incompatible, it is worth developing a better sense of how much randomization, and fairness more generally, one can achieve with unambiguously efficient allocations in ordinal settings.\n\nFinally, we have leveraged the strength of unambiguous efficiency in our characterization result. Aside from the question of whether bounded invariance is redundant, counterparts of this theorem for weaker efficiency properties like ex post efficiency or even ambiguous efficiency remain open.",

      "text": "# A Proofs from Section 2.3.1 \n\nProof of Lemma 1. Suppose by contradiction that there are $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, \\pi \\in \\Pi$ that is unambiguously efficient at $P$, and $i, j \\in N$ such that $\\left|\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{j}\\right)\\right| \\geq 3$. For each $a, b \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{j}\\right)$, a $P_{i} b$ if and only if $a P_{j} b$. Otherwise, say if $a P_{i} b$ but $b P_{j} a$, then agent $i$ can transfer a positive probability of $b$ to agent $j$, receiving the same amount of $a$ from $j$, yielding a Pareto improvement. This contradicts unambiguous efficiency. Therefore, there are distinct $a, b, c \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{j}\\right)$ such that $a P_{i} b P_{i} c$ and $a P_{j} b P_{j} c$. Agent $i$ can transfer a positive probability of $a$ and $c$ to agent $j$, receiving the same total amount of $b$ from $j$, yielding a possible Pareto improvement (the result of the trade would not be comparable by $i$ or $j$ to their lottery at $\\pi$ in terms of stochastic dominance). This again contradicts unambiguous efficiency.\n\nProof of Proposition 1. Before proving Proposition 1, we start with some notation. For an agent $i \\in N$, define a probability shift as $\\eta_{i} \\in[-1,1]^{A}$ such that $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\eta_{i a}=0$. Given $\\pi_{i} \\in$ $\\Delta(A)$, we say that the probability shift $\\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$ if $\\pi_{i}+\\eta_{i} \\in \\Delta(A)$. This definition implies that if $v_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$, then for each $a \\in A$ such that $\\eta_{i a}<0$, $-\\eta_{i a} \\leq \\pi_{i a}$. Given a preference relation $P_{i} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ for $i \\in N$, the probability shift $\\eta_{i}$ is not sdworsening at $P_{i}$ if there is $\\underline{a} \\in A$ such that $\\sum_{a: a P_{i} \\underline{a}} \\eta_{i a}>0$. By this definition, if $\\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$ and is not sd-worsening at $P_{i}$, then it is not the case that $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d}\\left(\\pi_{i}+\\eta_{i}\\right)$. This is because for some $\\underline{a} \\in A, \\sum_{a: a P_{i} \\underline{a}} \\pi_{i a}<\\sum_{a: a P_{i} \\underline{a}}\\left(\\pi_{i a}+\\eta_{i a}\\right)=\\sum_{a: a P_{i} \\underline{a}} \\pi_{i a}+\\sum_{a: a P_{i} \\underline{a}} \\eta_{i a}$.\n\nFor any pair $\\pi_{i}, \\pi_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\Delta(A), \\eta_{i}=\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}-\\pi_{i}$ is, by definition, a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$. Moreover, unless $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}, \\eta_{i}$ is not sd-worsening at $P_{i}$. In fact, for any $\\varepsilon \\in(0,1), \\varepsilon \\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$ that is not sd-worsening.\n\nClaim 1. Let $\\pi_{i}, \\pi_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\Delta(A)$ be such that $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\subseteq \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$. If $\\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$ then there is $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $\\varepsilon \\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. Let $\\varepsilon=\\min \\left\\{\\frac{\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}}{-\\eta_{i a}}: a \\in A, \\eta_{i a}<0\\right\\}$. Since $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right) \\subseteq \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}$, for each $a \\in A$ such that $\\eta_{i a}<0$, we know that $\\pi_{i a}>0$ and therefore $\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}>0$. Therefore, $\\varepsilon>0$. Moreover, $-\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a} \\leq \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}$ meaning that $\\pi_{i a}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a} \\geq 0$. Thus, for all $a \\in$ $A, \\pi_{i a}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a} \\geq 0$.\n\nBy definition of a feasible shift, $\\sum_{a \\in A}\\left(\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a}\\right)=\\sum_{a \\in A} \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\sum_{a \\in A} \\varepsilon \\eta_{i a}=1+0=1$. Thus, for each $a \\in A, \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a} \\leq 1$, so we conclude that $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i} \\in \\Delta(A)$ and therefore $\\varepsilon \\eta_{i}$ is a feasible shift from $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 2. For each pair $\\pi, \\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$, if $\\eta=\\pi-\\pi^{\\prime}$, then for any $\\varepsilon \\in[0,1], \\pi^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta \\in \\Pi$.\n\nProof. Let $\\bar{\\pi}=\\pi^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta$. As argued above, for each $i \\in N, \\sum_{a \\in A} \\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=1$. It remains to show that for each $a \\in A, \\sum_{i \\in N} \\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=1$. For each $a \\in A$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i \\in N} \\bar{\\pi}_{i a} & =\\sum_{i \\in N}\\left(\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\eta_{i a}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon \\sum_{i \\in N} \\eta_{i a} \\\\\n& =1+\\varepsilon \\sum_{i \\in N}\\left(\\pi_{i a}-\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& =1+\\varepsilon\\left(\\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a}-\\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\\n& =1+\\varepsilon(1-1)=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe following observation is a direct consequence of Claims 1 and 2.\nClaim 3. For each pair $\\pi, \\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$, such that for each $i \\in N, \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\subseteq \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)$, if $\\eta=\\left(\\eta_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}$ is a profile of feasible shifts from $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ such that $\\pi^{\\prime}+\\eta \\in \\Pi$, then there is $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $\\pi+\\varepsilon \\eta \\in \\Pi$.\n\nWe now prove Proposition 1. Let $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and let $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ be an unambiguously efficient allocation at $P$. Let $\\pi^{\\prime} \\in \\Pi$ be such that for each $i \\in N, \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\subseteq \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)$. If $\\pi^{\\prime}$ is not unambiguously efficient at $P$, then there is $\\bar{\\pi} \\in \\Pi \\backslash\\left\\{\\pi^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ such that for each $i \\in N$, it is not the case that $\\pi_{i}^{\\prime} P_{i}^{s d} \\bar{\\pi}_{i}$. For each $i \\in N$, let $\\eta_{i}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i}-\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$. Therefore, for each $i \\in N, \\eta_{i}$ is not sd-worsening at $P_{i}$. By Claim 3, there is $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $\\hat{\\pi}=\\pi+\\varepsilon \\eta \\in \\Pi$. Since, for each $i \\in N, \\eta_{i}$ is not sd-worsening at $P_{i}$, it is not the case that $\\pi_{i} P_{i}^{s d} \\hat{\\pi}_{i}$. This means $\\pi$ is not unambiguously efficient, a contradiction.\n\nProof of Proposition 3. We prove that $\\lambda$ randomizes over an adjacent-2 set or places full probability a single ordering. Consider a pair $>,>^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\lambda)$ that coincide up to the $(t-1)$ th dictator but differ in the $t$-th dictator (where $t \\in\\{1, \\cdots, n-1\\}$ ). If there is no such pair, $\\lambda$ is a degenerate lottery over $\\mathcal{O}$ and we are done. If there are multiple pairs of such $>$ and $>^{\\prime}$, choose a pair with the smallest $t$. Let $i$ and $j$ be the $t$-th dictator at $>$ and $>^{\\prime}$, respectively. Suppose that agent $k \\neq i$ is the $(t+1)$-th dictator at $>^{\\prime}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nt^{\\text {th }} \\text { dictator } \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\vdots \\quad: \\cdots, \\underline{i}, \\cdots \\\\\n>^{\\prime} \\quad: \\cdots, \\quad \\underline{j}, k, \\cdots, i, \\cdots\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be a profile of identical preferences. Let $a$ and $b$ be the best two remaining objects, in that order, after the first $(t-1)$ agents have been allocated lotteries. Then $i$ receives $a$ with positive probability and some $c$ that every agent ranks below $b$. Moreover, $k$ receives $b$ with positive probability. This contradicts unambiguous efficiency, because,\n\nwith all other agents' lotteries fixed, agents $i$ and $k$ may exchange probabilities of $a, c$ and $b$ between them to obtain lotteries that are uncomparable to what they initially had. Therefore, agent $i$ must be the $(t+1)$-th dictator at $>^{\\prime}$ and by a symmetric argument, agent $j$ must be the $(t+1)$-th dictator at $>$.\n\nNext, suppose that there are at least two pairs of adjacent dictators whose positions are switched in $>$ and $>^{\\prime}$. That is, there are $s, t \\in\\{1, \\cdots, n-1\\}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\ns^{\\text {th }} & \\text { dictator } & t^{\\text {th }} \\text { dictator } \\\\\n& \\downarrow & \\downarrow \\\\\n> & : & \\downarrow, j \\cdots, \\quad \\underline{k}, l, \\cdots \\\\\n>^{\\prime} & : & \\cdots, \\quad \\underline{j}, i, \\cdots, \\quad \\underline{l}, k, \\cdots\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be such that $i$ ranks $a$ first and $b$ second, $j$ ranks $a$ first and $c$ second, both $k$ and $l$ rank $b$ first, $c$ second, and $d$ third, and all remaining agents identically rank $a, b, c$, and $d$ below the other objects. At $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$, both agents $k$ and $l$ are allocated positive probabilities of $b, c$, and $d$. This contradicts Lemma 1. Altogether, we have that $\\lambda$ can only have support of an adjacent-2 set for unambiguous efficiency of $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$.\n\nWe conclude by showing that if $\\lambda$ has support of an adjacent- 2 set or a singleton, then it is unambiguously efficient. The case of a singleton is trivial, so suppose that $\\lambda$ places probability on $>$ and $>^{\\prime}$ that interchange the positions of $i$ and $j$ in the $t^{\\text {th }}$ and $(t+1)^{\\text {th }}$ positions ( $i$ appears $t^{\\text {th }}$ in $>$ and $(t+1)^{\\text {th }}$ in $>^{\\prime}$ ). Fix any $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$. Suppose $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ is such that for each $k \\in N$, either $\\pi_{k} R_{i}^{\\text {sd }} \\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{k}$ or $\\pi_{k} N_{i}^{\\text {sd }} \\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{k}$. For each of $i^{1}, \\ldots, i^{t-1}$, who appear in $>$ and $>^{\\prime}$ before $i$ or $j$, trivially they receive the same lottery from $\\pi$ and $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)-i^{1}$ gets their favorite object with certainty, $i^{2}$ gets their favorite object except for $i^{1}$ 's favorite object with certainty, and so on. Feasibility implies that $\\pi$ cannot give $i$ or $j$ any objects assigned to the first $t-1$ agents with positive probability. If $i$ and $j$ have the same favorite remaining object $a$, unless $\\pi_{i a} \\geq \\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{i a}$ and $\\pi_{j a} \\geq \\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{j a}$ we have a contradiction of $\\pi$ 's definition. Thus, $\\pi_{i a}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{i a}$ and $\\pi_{j a}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{j a}$. Moreover, since $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$ gives $i$ and $j$ their next most preferred object with their remaining probability, we can similarly conclude that $\\pi_{i}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{i}$ and $\\pi_{j}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{j}$. On the other hand, if $i$ and $j$ have different most preferred objects, then since $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$ gives them that object with positive probability, we again conclude that $\\pi_{i}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{i}$ and $\\pi_{j}=\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)_{j}$. Finally, for all agents that appear after $i$ and $j$, in order that they appear $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$ gives them the unambiguously best lottery subject to the feasibility constraint implied by what prior agents receive. Thus, by definition of $\\pi$ it must be that it gives them the same lottery as $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$. Thus, $\\pi^{P}(\\lambda)$ is unambiguously efficient.",

      "text": "# B Formal Definition of Hierarchies of Monarchies and Diarchies\n## B. 1 A Recursive Algorithm\n\nBefore defining the general algorithm, we give some preliminary definitions. A supply vector is $s \\in S=[0,1]^{A}$. Denote by $A(s)$ the set of objects available in positive amounts at $s$ and by $\\underline{A}(s)$ those that are only fractionally available. That is, $A(s)=\\left\\{a \\in A: s_{a}>0\\right\\}$ and $\\underline{A}(s)=\\left\\{a \\in A: 0<s_{a}<1\\right\\}$. A partial allocation is an $|N| \\times|N|$ substochastic matrix $\\pi$ such that every agent receives an allocation in $\\Pi$ or nothing. That is, for each $i \\in N$, either $\\pi_{i}=\\overrightarrow{0}$ or $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\pi_{i a}=1$ and for each $a \\in A, \\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a} \\leq 1$. Let $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}}$ be the set of all partial allocations. A partial allocation $\\pi \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$ is feasible at $s$ if $\\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i} \\leq s$.\n\nA generalized mechanism is a mapping $f: S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Pi}$ such that for each $s \\in S$ and $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, f(s, P) \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$ is feasible at $s$. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all generalized mechanisms.\n\nIf we start with a supply vector $s \\in S$, the residual supply after allocating $\\pi \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$ is $r(s, \\pi) \\in S$ such that for each $a \\in A, \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\boldsymbol{a}}(\\boldsymbol{s}, \\boldsymbol{\\pi})=s_{a}-\\sum_{i \\in N} \\pi_{i a}$.\n\nThe algorithm uses generalized mechanisms to compute a complete allocation part by part. It keeps track of these parts via a history, which is a (possibly empty) list of partial allocations $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{K}\\right)$ such that for each $k=1, \\ldots K, \\pi^{k} \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi^{k} \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$. Let $\\boldsymbol{N}(\\eta)=\\left\\{i \\in N\\right.$ : there is $k$ such that $\\left.\\pi_{i}^{k} \\neq \\overrightarrow{0}\\right\\}$ be the set of agents allocated to along the history $\\eta$. Having collected the history $\\eta$, the next partial allocation can be any $\\pi^{K+1} \\in \\overline{\\Pi}$ such that for each $i \\in N(\\eta), \\pi_{i}^{K+1}=\\overrightarrow{0}$. That is, only partial allocations that allocate to agents not allocated to by any part of $\\eta$ can occur after $\\eta$. We append $\\pi^{K+1}$ to form a new history $\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{K}, \\pi^{K+1}\\right)$ and denote it by $\\eta \\leftrightarrow \\pi^{K+1}$. Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be the set of all histories. The set of terminal histories is $\\mathcal{H}^{T}=\\left\\{\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}: N(\\eta)=N\\right\\}$. Note that for each $\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{K}\\right) \\in$ $\\mathcal{H}^{T}, \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi^{k} \\in \\Pi$ is an allocation, and not just a partial one. The set of non-terminal histories is $\\mathcal{H}^{N T}=\\mathcal{H} \\backslash \\mathcal{H}^{T}$. A sequencing rule, $\\sigma: \\mathcal{H}^{N T} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}$, maps each non-terminal history to a partial mechanism. We require that for each $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}^{N T}$, each $i \\in N(\\eta)$, and each $\\pi \\in \\operatorname{range}(\\sigma(\\eta)), \\pi_{i}=\\overrightarrow{0}$. That is, $\\sigma(\\eta)$ does not allocate to agents who have already been allocated to along $\\eta$.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Each $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ solves a part of the allocation problem.\n2. A history $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}$ keeps track of accumulated parts of the solution.\n3. The sequencing rule $\\sigma$ tells us what partial mechanism solves the next part.\n\nWe now put these components together to recursively compute an allocation for any preference profile. Define the function $\\Psi: \\mathcal{H} \\times S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\Pi}$ by setting, for each $(\\eta, s, P) \\in$ $\\mathcal{H} \\times S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\Psi(\\eta, s, P)= \\begin{cases}\\overrightarrow{0} & \\text { if } \\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}^{T} \\\\ \\pi+\\Psi(\\eta++\\pi, r(s, \\pi), P) \\text { where } \\pi=\\sigma(\\eta)(s, P) & \\text { if } \\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}^{N T}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIf we start with the empty history and the full supply vector and then we have a mechanism for each sequencing rule $\\sigma$. We denote this mechanism by $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$, which we define by setting for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, \\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)=\\Psi((), \\vec{1}, P)$.\n\nTo fix ideas, we demonstrate how one can describe a serial dictatorship in the recursive language we have laid out above.\n\nExample 5 (Recursive formulation of serial dictatorship). In Section 2.3.3, we described serial dictatorship allocations where agents select their best objects according to a priority order.

      "text": "# B. 2 Monarchical and Diarchical Partial Allocation Mechanisms \n\nIt is not for every $\\sigma$ that $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$ satisfies all of the properties on our list. We now define conditions on sequencing rules that are necessary and sufficient for all of the properties to be satisfied. We consider restrictions on the types of generalized mechanisms that can ever be chosen as well as the degree to which the history can influence the choice of generalized mechanism.\n\nPermissible partial allocation mechanisms We first restrict the range of the sequencing rule to partial allocation mechanisms that only allocate to one or two agents at a time. We define these formally here.\n\nWe start by introducing notation to depict an agent's most preferred lottery among those feasible at a given supply vector. For each $i \\in N$, each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, and each $s \\in S$, the top allocation for $i$ subject to $s$ is $\\tau^{i}(s, P)=\\pi_{i}$ such that listing the objects as $a_{1}$ through $a_{|A|}$ in decreasing order of $i$ 's preference $P_{i}, \\pi_{i a_{1}}=s_{a_{1}}, \\pi_{i a_{2}}=\\min \\left\\{1-\\pi_{i a_{1}}, s_{a_{2}}\\right\\}, \\ldots, \\pi_{i a_{|A|}}=$ $\\min \\left\\{1-\\left(\\pi_{i a_{1}}+\\cdots+\\pi_{i a_{|A|-1}}\\right), s_{a_{|A|}}\\right\\}$. In words, we compute $\\pi_{i}$ by greedily allocating as much of each object as possible to $i$ in decreasing order of $i$ 's preference. This is the unambiguously best lottery that we can give $i$, given the supply vector $s$ as it stochastically dominates any other lottery feasible at $s$.\n\nThe first kind of partial allocation mechanisms that our list of properties allows allocate to a single agent. For each $i \\in N$, the monarchy of $i$ is the partial allocation mechanism $\\boldsymbol{m}^{\\boldsymbol{i}}$ such that for each $(s, P) \\in S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and each $j \\in N$,\n\n$$\nm_{j}^{i}(s, P)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\tau^{i}(s, P) & \\text { if } j=i \\\\\n\\overrightarrow{0} & \\text { otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be the set of all monarchical partial allocation mechanisms.\nThe next type of partial allocation mechanism allocates to a pair of agents. For each pair $i, j \\in N$, each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, and each $s \\in S$, the top allocation for $i$ after $j$ subject to $s$ is $\\tau^{j i}(s, P)=\\tau^{i}\\left(s-\\tau^{j}(s, P), P\\right)$. This represents the best lottery for one agent after the other agent has already chosen from a given supply vector. Now, given a pair $i, j \\in N$ and $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, the $\\alpha$-diarchy of $i$ and $j$ is the partial allocation mechanism $\\boldsymbol{d}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}$ such that for each $(s, P) \\in S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and each $k \\in N$,\n\n$$\nd_{k}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}(s, P)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\alpha \\tau^{i}(s, P)+(1-\\alpha) \\tau^{j i}(s, P) & \\text { if } k=i \\\\\n\\alpha \\tau^{i j}(s, P)+(1-\\alpha) \\tau^{j}(s, P) & \\text { if } k=j \\\\\n\\overrightarrow{0} & \\text { otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe order of the parameters matters and $d^{(i, j, \\alpha)}=d^{(j, i, 1-\\alpha)}$. Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all diarchical generalized mechanisms. Observe that $\\mathcal{M} \\subset \\mathcal{D}$, since we allow $i=j$.\n\nRestricting responsiveness to histories The set of all histories is larger than the set of all partial allocations in $\\overline{\\Pi}$ : a history $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}$ specifies what, and in what order, each agent in $N(\\eta)$ gets. However, to satisfy the properties we characterize, a sequencing rule cannot respond to all of this information. Below we define an equivalence between histories so that a permissible (per our properties) sequencing rule would not distinguish between such histories.\n\nConsider a pair of histories $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{K}$ and $\\bar{\\eta}=\\left(\\bar{\\pi}^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{\\bar{K}} \\in \\mathcal{H}$. We say that they are identity-integrality equivalent if:\n\n1. they are of the same length, so that $K=\\bar{K}$,\n2. they allocate to the same agents, so that for each $k \\in\\{1, \\cdots, K\\}, N\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)=N\\left(\\bar{\\pi}^{k}\\right)$, and\n3. each agent who is allocated to receives an integral allocation from both or neither, so that for each $k \\in\\{1, \\cdots, K\\}$ and each $i \\in N\\left(\\pi_{i}^{k}\\right), \\pi_{i}^{k}$ is integral $\\left(\\pi_{i}^{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{A}\\right)$ if and only if $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{k}$ is integral $\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{A}\\right)$.\n\nPutting the restrictions together We are now ready to define the sequencing rules that respect the properties we characterize. A sequencing rule $\\sigma$ is a sequence of monarchies and (integral) diarchies if:\n\n1. it only ever involves monarchies or diarchies, so that range $(\\sigma) \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}$,\n2. it maps to a monarchy if the residual supply is not integral, so that for each $\\eta=$ $\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{K}$ where $\\vec{1}-\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi_{i}^{k}$ is not integral, $\\sigma(\\eta) \\in \\mathcal{M}$, and\n3. it maps to the same partial allocation mechanism for any pair of identity-integrality equivalent histories, so that if $\\eta$ and $\\eta^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{H}$ are identity-integrality equivalent then $\\sigma(\\eta)=\\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nIf $\\sigma$ is a sequence of monarchies and diarchies, then we call $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$ is a Hierarchy of Monarchies and Diarchies and denote it by $\\boldsymbol{M D}^{\\sigma}$. Below is an example of a sequence of monarchies and diarchies and the HMD that it defines.\n\nExample 6 (A hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies). Let $N=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $A=$ $\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. We first specify the values of $\\sigma$, which is a sequence of monarchies and diarchies.\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\nNotice that we have not considered all possible histories in $\\mathcal{H}$ but only those that could appear on an execution path. How we specify $\\sigma$ at any other history than those we have listed above does not affect the output of the algorithm.\n\nWe compute the allocation chosen by $M D^{\\sigma}$ for the preference profile $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ below.\n\n![table_8](table_8)\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Starting with the empty history, it allocates from the initial supply vector of $\\overrightarrow{1}$ according the $1 / 3$-diarchy of agents 1 and 2 . So, agent 1 receives $1 / 3$ of $a$ and $2 / 3$ of $e$ and 2 receives $2 / 3$ of $a$ and $1 / 3$ of $b$. We denote the partial allocation where agents 1 and 2 gets these lotteries and all others get $\\overrightarrow{0}$ by $\\pi^{1}$.\n2. The history after the first step is $\\left(\\pi^{1}\\right)$. The residual supply is not integral, so the table above tells us that $\\sigma$ maps this history to the monarchy of agent 3 . All of $a$ has already been allocated to agents 1 and 2 and only $1 / 3$ of agent 3 's most preferred object $b$ remains. So, agent 3 receives $1 / 3$ of $b$ and $2 / 3$ of their next most preferred object, which is $e$. We denote the partial allocation where agent 3 gets this lottery and all others get $\\overrightarrow{0}$ by $\\pi^{2}$.\n3. The residual supply at the history $\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\pi^{2}\\right)$ is integral. So, the table tells us the next partial allocation mechanism is the $1 / 2$-diarchy of agents 4 and 5 . The only remaining objects are $c$ and $d$. Since agents 4 and 5 rank these two objects in the same order, each of them receives $\\frac{1}{2}$ of each of these objects.\n4. Since all agents have been allocated to, the algorithm stops.\n\nWe write down the input history, residual supply, partial allocation mechanism, calculated partial allocation, and return value of each recursive call in the table below. In it, we denote a lottery that places $\\alpha$ probability on $a, \\beta$ probability on $b, \\gamma$ probability on $c, \\delta$ probability on $d$, and $\\epsilon$ probability on $e$ by $\\alpha a+\\beta b+\\gamma c+\\delta d+\\epsilon e$.\n\n![table_9](table_9)\n\nThe final allocation is calculated as\n$M D^{\\alpha}(P)=\\Psi((), \\vec{i}, P)=(1 / 2 a+2 / 2 e, 2 / 2 a+1 / 2 b, 2 / 2 b+1 / 2 e, 1 / 2 c+1 / 2 d, 1 / 2 c+1 / 2 d)$.",

If $\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, then we are done. Otherwise, Let $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ be the best and second best objects in $A^{\\prime}$ according to, for each $k \\in N^{\\prime},\\left.P_{k}\\right|_{A^{\\prime}}$. Let $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ be such that $\\pi_{i a_{1}}>0$. If $\\pi_{i a_{1}}=1$, we are done. So, suppose $\\pi_{i a_{1}}=\\alpha \\in(0,1)$. By feasibility, there is $j \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\pi_{j a_{1}}>0$. Suppose $\\pi_{j a_{1}}<1-\\alpha$. Then there is $k \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}$ such that $\\pi_{k a_{1}}>0$. By feasibility, for at least one member $l \\in\\{i, j, k\\}, \\pi_{l a_{1}}+\\pi_{l a_{2}}<1$ meaning there is $a_{3} \\in A^{\\prime}$ such that $\\pi_{l a_{3}}>0$. Moreover, feasibility ensures that for some $\\bar{i} \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{l\\}, \\pi_{\\bar{i} a_{2}}>0$. However, since $\\left.P_{l}\\right|_{A^{\\prime}}=\\left.P_{l}\\right|_{A^{\\prime}}$, this contradicts Lemma 2. Thus, $\\pi_{j a_{1}}=1-\\alpha$. Now, suppose $\\pi_{i a_{2}}<1-\\alpha$. Then, by feasibility, there are $k \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}$ and $a_{3} \\in A^{\\prime} \\backslash\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}\\right\\}$ such that $\\pi_{k a_{2}}, \\pi_{i a_{3}}>0$. Again, since $\\left.P_{k}\\right|_{A^{\\prime}}=\\left.P_{i}\\right|_{A^{\\prime}}$, this contradicts Lemma 2. Thus, $\\pi_{i a_{2}}=1-\\alpha$. By the same reasoning, we conclude that $\\pi_{j a_{2}}=\\alpha$.\n\nLemma 4. Let $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ be unambiguously efficient at $P$.

Label the objects in $\\left\\{a \\in A^{\\prime}: s_{a}<1\\right\\}$ as $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{T}$ such that for each $i \\in N^{\\prime}, a_{1} P_{i}$ $a_{2} \\ldots P_{i} a_{T}$. Similarly, label the objects in $\\left\\{a \\in A^{\\prime}: s_{a}=1\\right\\}$ as $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{K}$ such that for each $i \\in N^{\\prime}, b_{1} P_{i} b_{2} \\ldots P_{i} b_{K}$. By feasibility, there is $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\pi_{i a_{1}}>0$. Since $s_{a_{1}}<1$, by feasibility, there is $t>1$ such that $\\pi_{i a_{t}}>0$ (if there are more than one such $t$ 's, choose the largest $t$ ). By Lemma 2, for each $t^{\\prime} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, t-1\\}, \\pi_{i a_{t^{\\prime}}}=s_{a_{t^{\\prime}}}$. Thus, $\\pi_{i}=m_{i}^{i}(s, P)$.\n\nLemmata 3 and 4 enable us to back out an ordered list of monarchies and diarchies as partial allocation mechanisms from a given unambiguously efficient mechanism. We next show that the remaining properties of Theorem 1 ensure that these lists of partial allocation mechanisms are equal for equivalent histories.\n\nLemma 5. Let $\\varphi$ be a strategy-proof mechanism, $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, i \\in N$, and $P_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}$.

Suppose $\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right) \\neq \\varphi_{i}(P)$. By strategy-proofness, $\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}, P_{-i}\\right) P_{i}^{\\text {sd }} \\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$. But the definition of $P_{i}^{\\prime}$ in the statement of the lemma ensure that this implies $\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}, P_{-i}\\right) P_{i}^{\\text {ssd }}$ $\\varphi_{i}\\left(P_{i}^{\\prime}, P_{-i}\\right)$. This contradicts strategy-proofness of $\\varphi$ since at true preference $P_{i}^{\\prime}, i$ gains by misreporting $P_{i}$ when others' preferences are $P_{-i}$.\n\nLemma 6. Let $\\varphi$ be a strategy-proof and non-bossy mechanism and $P, P^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$. If for each $i \\in N$ and each $a \\in A$ such that $\\varphi_{i a}(P)>0,\\left\\{b \\in A: b P_{i}^{\\prime} a\\right\\} \\subseteq\\left\\{b \\in A: b P_{i} a\\right\\}$, then $\\varphi\\left(P^{\\prime}\\right)=\\varphi(P)$.\n\nProof. By Lemma $5, \\varphi_{1}\\left(P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{-1}\\right)=\\varphi_{1}(P)$. By non-bossiness, $\\varphi\\left(P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{-1}\\right)=\\varphi(P)$. Repeating this argument $(n-1)$ more times, we conclude that $\\varphi\\left(P^{\\prime}\\right)=\\varphi(P)$.\n\nThe property of $\\varphi$ described in Lemma 6 is invariance to support monotonic transformations and for each $i \\in N, P_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $P_{i}$ at $\\varphi_{i}(P)$ (Heo and Manjunath, 2017).\n\nNext, given $N^{\\prime} \\subseteq N$, let $\\Pi^{N^{\\prime}}=\\left\\{\\pi \\in \\overline{\\Pi}\\right.$ : for each $\\left.i \\in N \\backslash N^{\\prime}, \\pi_{i}=\\overrightarrow{0}\\right\\}$ be the set of allocations for $N^{\\prime}$. We extend all of our properties to such allocations by considering only preferences of and allocations to agents in $N^{\\prime}$. We say that $f: S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}} \\rightarrow \\Pi^{N^{\\prime}}$ is a generalized rule for $N^{\\prime}$.\n\nLemma 7. For any $N^{\\prime} \\subseteq N$, if a generalized mechanism $f: S \\times \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ is unambiguously efficient, strategy-proof, neutral, non-bossy, and boundedly invariant, then for each $s \\in S$ such that $\\sum_{a \\in A} s_{a}=\\left|N^{\\prime}\\right|$ and $|\\underline{A}(s)| \\leq 2:$\n\n1. If $\\operatorname{int}(s)=1$, there is either $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}, f_{i}(s, P)=m_{i}^{i}(s, P)$ or a pair $i, j \\in N^{\\prime}$ and $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ such that for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ and each $k \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{k}(s, P)=d_{k}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}(s, P)$.\n2. If $\\operatorname{int}(s)=0$, there is $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that for each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}, f_{i}(s, P)=m_{i}^{i}(s, P)$.\n\nProof. Consider a preference profile $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$. Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ be a profile of identical preferences for agents in $N^{\\prime}$. Suppose first that $\\operatorname{int}(s)=1$. Let $\\bar{\\pi}=f(s, \\bar{P})$. By Lemma 3, there is either $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}=m_{i}^{i}(s, \\bar{P})$ or a pair $i, j \\in N^{\\prime}$ and $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ such that for each $k \\in\\{i, j\\}, \\bar{\\pi}_{k}=d_{k}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}(s, \\bar{P})$. We consider each of these possibilities separately:\n\n1. There is $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}=m_{i}^{i}(s, \\bar{P})$. By neutrality, it is without loss of generality to suppose that for each $j \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{j}=P_{i}$. Since $\\operatorname{int}(s)=1$, there is $a \\in A$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=1$. Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ be such that for each $j \\neq i$ and each $b \\in A \\backslash\\{a\\}$, $a \\bar{P}_{j} b$ and $\\left.\\bar{P}_{j}\\right|_{A \\backslash\\{a\\}}=P_{j} \\mid A \\backslash\\{a\\}$. Since $f_{i a}\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)\\right)=1$, by bounded invariance,\n\n$f_{i a}\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right)\\right)=1$. Since for each $j \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}, f_{j a}\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right)\\right)=0, P_{j}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $\\bar{P}_{j}$ at $f_{j}\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right)\\right)$. Thus, by invariance to support monotonic transformations (Lemma 6), $f(s, P)=f\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right)\\right)$, so $f_{i}(s, P)=m_{i}^{i}(s, P)$.\n2. There are $i, j \\in N^{\\prime}$ and $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ such that for each $k \\in\\{i, j\\}, \\bar{\\pi}_{k}=d_{k}^{\\left(i, j, \\alpha\\right)}(s, \\bar{P})$. For each $k \\in\\{i, j\\}$, let $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ be the best and second best objects in $A(s)$ respectively according to $P_{k}$. We distinguish three cases:\n(a) No Conflict $\\left(a_{i} \\neq a_{j}\\right)$ : By neutrality, it is without loss of generality to suppose that for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k}$ ranks $a_{i}$ first and $a_{j}$ second. Let $\\hat{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ be such that for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, a_{j} \\hat{P}_{k} a_{i}$, for each $b \\in A \\backslash\\left\\{a_{i}, a_{j}\\right\\}, a_{i} \\hat{P}_{k} b$, and $\\left.\\hat{P}_{k}\\right|_{A \\backslash\\left\\{a_{i}, a_{j}\\right\\}}=\\left.\\bar{P}_{k}\\right|_{A \\backslash\\left\\{a_{i}, a_{j}\\right\\}}$. Let $\\hat{\\pi}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{j}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{j\\}\\right)\\right.$. We show below that $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}=1$ and $\\hat{\\pi}_{i a_{i}}=1$. By strategyproofness, $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}+\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{j}}=1$. If $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}>0$, then $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{j}}<1$. By feasibility, there is some $k \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{j\\}$ such that $\\hat{\\pi}_{k a_{i}}>0$. This violates unambiguous efficiency. Thus, $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}=$ 1. By invariance to support monotonic transformations, $f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, \\bar{P}_{j}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}\\right)\\right)=$ $\\bar{\\pi}$. Now, consider $\\hat{\\pi}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, \\hat{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{i\\}\\right)\\right)$. Strategy-proofness implies $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}+\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{i}}=$ 1. By neutrality, $f_{i a_{j}}(s, \\hat{P})+f_{i a_{i}}(s, \\hat{P})=1$ since $\\hat{P}$ swaps the names of $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$ compared to $\\bar{P}$. So, by strategy-proofness, $\\hat{\\pi}_{i a_{i}}+\\hat{\\pi}_{i a_{j}}=1$. Then, since $a_{i} \\bar{P}_{i} a_{j}$ and $a_{j} \\hat{P}_{j} a_{i}$, unambiguous efficiency ensures that $\\hat{\\pi}_{i a_{i}}=1$ and $\\hat{\\pi}_{j a_{j}}=1$. Now, by invariance to support monotonic transformations, $\\hat{\\pi}=\\hat{\\pi}$, so $\\hat{\\pi}_{i a_{i}}=1$. Thus, for each $l \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{l}\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{j}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{j\\}\\right)\\right)=d^{\\left(i, j, \\alpha\\right)}(s, P)$.\nNext, consider $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that $\\bar{P}_{j}=\\hat{P}_{j}$, and for each $k \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{j\\}, \\bar{P}_{k}$ ranks $a_{i}$ first, $a_{j}$ second, and agrees with $P_{k}$ on the remaining objects in $A(s)$. By bounded invariance, again, for each $l \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{l}(s, \\bar{P})=d^{\\left(i, j, \\alpha\\right)}(s, P)$. In turn, by invariance to support monotonic transformations, we conclude that for each $l \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{l}(s, P)=d_{l}^{\\left(i, j, \\alpha\\right)}(s, P)$.\n(b) Full Conflict $\\left(a_{i}=a_{j}=a\\right.$ and $\\left.b_{i}=b_{j}=b\\right)$ : By neutrality, it is without loss of generality to suppose that for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k}=P_{i}$. Since $\\operatorname{int}(s)=1, \\bar{\\pi}_{i a}+\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}=1$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{j a}+\\bar{\\pi}_{j b}=1$. We proceed as above by considering $\\hat{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ where, for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k}$ ranks $a$ first, $b$ second, and agrees with $P_{k}$ on the remaining objects in $A(s)$. By bounded invariance, for each $l \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{l}(s, \\bar{P})=f_{l}(s, \\bar{P})$. We conclude, by invariance to support monotonic transformations (from $\\bar{P}$ to $P$ ), that for each $l \\in\\{i, j\\}, f_{l}(s, P)=d_{l}^{\\left(i, j, \\alpha\\right)}(s, P)$.\n(c) Partial Conflict $\\left(a_{i}=a_{j}=a\\right.$ and $\\left.b_{i} \\neq b_{j}\\right)$ : By neutrality, it is without loss of generality to suppose that for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ where $\\bar{P}_{k}$ ranks $a$ first, $b_{i}$ second, and $b_{j}$ third. Let $\\pi^{\\prime}=f\\left(s,\\left(P_{j}, \\bar{P}_{N} \\backslash\\{j\\}\\right)\\right.$. By bounded invariance,\n\n$\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=\\alpha$ and $\\pi_{j a}^{\\prime}=\\bar{\\pi}_{j a}=1-\\alpha$. By strategy-proofness and unambiguous efficiency, $\\pi_{j b_{j}}^{\\prime}=\\alpha$. Since $\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}>0$, by Lemma $2, \\pi_{i b_{i}}^{\\prime}=1-\\pi_{i a}^{\\prime}=1-\\alpha$.\nNow let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that $\\bar{P}_{i}=P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{j}=P_{j}$, and for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k}$ ranks $a$ first, $b_{i}$ second, $b_{j}$ third, and agrees with $P_{k}$ on the remaining objects. Setting $\\bar{\\pi}=f(s, \\bar{P})$, by bounded invariance, if $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}=\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{j}=\\pi_{j}^{\\prime}$. Then, by invariance to support monotonic transformations, $f_{i}(s, P)=\\pi_{i}^{\\prime}=d_{i}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}(s, P)$ and $f_{j}(s, P)=$ $\\pi_{j}^{\\prime}=d_{j}^{(i, j, \\alpha)}(s, P)$.\n\nNext, suppose that $\\operatorname{int}(s)=0$. Unlike the case of $\\operatorname{int}(s)=1$, neutrality does not render it without loss of generality to choose $\\bar{P}$ arbitrarily. However, the rest of our properties do ensure that this is the case. We prove first that there is $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}=m_{i}^{i}(s, \\bar{P})$ for any identical preference profile $\\bar{P}$. Since $\\operatorname{int}(s)=0$ and $\\sum_{o \\in A} s_{o}=\\left|N^{\\prime}\\right|,|\\underline{A}(s)| \\leq 2$ implies that $|\\underline{A}(s)|=2$. So, $\\underline{A}(s)=\\{a, b\\}$ for some pair $a, b \\in A$. Let $c \\in A(s) \\backslash\\{a, b\\}$.\n\nConsider $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that each agent ranks $c$ first, $a$ second, and $b$ third. Let $\\bar{\\pi}=$ $f(s, \\bar{P})$. Since $s_{a}, s_{b} \\in(0,1)$, by Lemma 2 and feasibility, there is $i \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}=m_{i}^{i}(s, \\bar{P})$ so that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}=1$. Even if each agent $j \\neq i$ lowers $c$ while keeping the relative rankings of the remaining objects as in $\\bar{P}_{j}$, agent $i$ is still assigned probability 1 of $c$ by invariance to support monotonic transformations (denote this statement by $(\\dagger)$ ).\n\nConsider another identical preference profile $\\bar{P}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that each agent ranks $a$ first, $c$ second, and $b$ third. Let $\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}=f\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)$. We show that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}=m_{i}^{i}\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)$ so that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=1-s_{a}$. Consider $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)$ and compare it with $\\bar{P}$. Let $\\bar{\\pi}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{j}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)\\right)$. By strategy-proof, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}=0$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}+\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}=1$. If $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}<s_{a}$, then $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}>0$ and by feasibility, there is $j \\neq i$ with $\\bar{\\pi}_{j a}>0$. Agent $i$ prefers $a$ to $c$ and agent $j$ prefers $c$ to $a$, contradicting unambiguous efficiency. Therefore, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}=1-s_{a}$. Since all other agents have the same preferences, by Lemma 2 and feasibility, there is $k \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{k c}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{k b}=1-s_{a}$. Now, consider $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i k}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, k\\}}\\right)$ and compare it with $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)$. Let $\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{i k}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, k\\}}\\right)\\right)$. By strategy-proofness, $\\bar{\\pi}_{k b}^{\\prime}=1-s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{k a}^{\\prime}+\\bar{\\pi}_{k c}^{\\prime}=s_{a}$. Also, by strategy-proonfess, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=1$, because if agent $i$ changes their preference to $\\bar{P}_{i}$ at $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i k}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, k\\}}\\right)$, they will be assigned probability 1 of $c$ by $(\\dagger)$. We claim that $\\bar{\\pi}_{k a}^{\\prime}=0$. Otherwise, both $i$ and $k$ rank $a, c$ and $b$ in order whereas $\\bar{\\pi}_{k a}^{\\prime}, \\bar{\\pi}_{k b}^{\\prime}, \\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}>0$, contradicting Lemma 2. Altogether, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=1-s_{a}$. Since each other agent $l$ is assigned zero probabilities of $a, b$, and $c, \\bar{P}_{l}^{\\prime}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $\\bar{P}_{l}$ at $\\bar{\\pi}_{l}^{\\prime}$. Therefore, $f\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}$. By the same argument, agent $i$ is the monarch at the identical preference profile such that each agent ranks $b$ first, $c$ second, and $a$ third.\n\nLastly, consider an identical preference profile $\\bar{P}^{\\prime \\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that each agent ranks $a$ first, $b$ second, and $c$ third. Let $\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime \\prime}=f\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. We show that the same agent $i$ receives\n\n$\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=m_{i}^{i}\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ so that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime \\prime}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}^{\\prime \\prime}=1-s_{a}$. Consider $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ and compare it with $\\bar{P}^{\\prime}$. Let $\\bar{\\pi}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$. By bounded invariance and unambiguous efficiency, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=s_{a}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}=1-s_{a}$. Choose any $j \\in N \\backslash\\{i\\}$, consider $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i j}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, and let $\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}=f\\left(s,\\left(\\bar{P}_{i j}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$. By $(\\dagger)$ and strategy-proofness, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}+\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}^{\\prime}+\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=1$. By bounded invariance, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}=s_{a}$. We claim that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=0$. Otherwise, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}>0$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}^{\\prime}<1-s_{a}=s_{b}$. By feasibility, there exists $k \\in N \\backslash\\{i\\}$ such that $\\bar{\\pi}_{k b}^{\\prime}>0$. If $k=j$, both agents $i$ and $j$ (with $\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\bar{P}_{j}^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) rank $a, b, c$, in order and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i a}^{\\prime}, \\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}, \\bar{\\pi}_{j b}^{\\prime}>0$, contradicting Lemma 2. If $k \\neq j$, agent $i$ (with $\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) prefers $b$ to $c$, agent $k$ (with $\\bar{P}_{k}^{\\prime}$ ) prefers $c$ to $b$ and $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}, \\bar{\\pi}_{k b}^{\\prime}>0$, contradicting unambiguous efficiency. Altogether, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i c}^{\\prime}=0$ and therefore, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i b}^{\\prime}=1-s_{a}$. Next, from $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i j}^{\\prime \\prime}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}}^{\\prime}\\right)$, choose any other $l \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i, j\\}$ and change $\\bar{P}_{l}^{\\prime}$ to $\\bar{P}_{l}^{\\prime \\prime}$. By the same argument as above, we conclude that agent $i$ receives $s_{a}$ and $s_{b}$ of $a$ and $b$, respectively. Repeat this process until we reach $\\bar{P}^{\\prime \\prime}$. We then obtain $f_{i}\\left(s, \\bar{P}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=\\bar{\\pi}_{i}$. By the same argument, agent $i$ is the monarch at the identical preference profile such that each agent ranks $b$ first, $a$ second, and $c$ third.\n\nWe have now established that for any ordering of $a, b$, and $c$, at the top of an identical preference profile, $i$ is the monarch. By neutrality, $c$ can be any object other than $a$ or $b$. Thus, we have shown this as long as $a$ and $b$ are among the top three objects in $A(s)$. From here, bounded invariance ensures that $i$ is the monarch for all identical profiles.\n\nNow, we turn to $P$ and show $f_{i}(s, P)=m_{i}^{i}(s, P)$. Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ be an identical preference profile such that, without loss of generality, for each $k \\in N^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}_{k}=P_{i}$ and let $\\bar{\\pi}=f(\\bar{P})$. Let $\\bar{A}=\\left\\{o \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right): \\bar{\\pi}_{i o}=s_{o}\\right\\}$. If either $i$ ranks $a$ and $b$ above the other objects in $A(s)$ at $P_{i}$, or $i$ ranks another object $c$ distinct from $a$ and $b$ on top at $P_{i}$, then $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)=\\bar{A}$. If $i$ ranks one of $a$ or $b$ first and $c \\notin\\{a, b\\}$ second at $P_{i}$, then $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right) \\neq \\bar{A}$.\n\nLet $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N^{\\prime}}$ such that for each $k \\neq i$ and each pair $c, d \\in A(s), c \\bar{P}_{k} d$ if and only if either\n\n1. $c \\in \\bar{A}$ and $d \\notin \\bar{A}$,\n2. $c, d \\in \\bar{A}$ and $c P_{k} d$, or\n3. $c, d \\in A(s) \\backslash \\bar{A}$ and $c P_{k} d$.\n\nLet $\\bar{\\pi}=f\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)\\right.$. Since $f_{i}\\left(s,\\left(P_{i}, \\bar{P}_{N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right)\\right)=\\bar{\\pi}_{i}$, by bounded invariance, for each $o \\in \\bar{A}$, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i o}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i o}$. There are two cases to consider.\n(i) If $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)=\\bar{A}$, then for each $a \\in \\bar{A}$, and each $j \\in N \\backslash\\{i\\}, \\bar{\\pi}_{j a}=0$, so $P_{j}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $\\bar{P}_{j}$ at $\\bar{\\pi}_{j}$.\n(ii) If $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right) \\neq \\bar{A}$, then there are $o \\in \\bar{A}$ and $o^{\\prime} \\in A(s) \\backslash \\bar{A}$ with $s_{o^{\\prime}}=1$, such that $o$ and $o^{\\prime}$ are the best and second best objects in $A(s)$ according to $P_{i}$ respectively. By bounded invariance, $\\bar{\\pi}_{i o}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i o}$. We show that $\\bar{\\pi}_{i o^{\\prime}}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i o^{\\prime}}$. Otherwise, by feasibility, there is\n\nsome $o^{\\prime \\prime} \\in A(s)$ such that $o^{\\prime} P_{i} o^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $\\tilde{\\pi}_{i o^{\\prime \\prime}}>0$. Moreover, there is $j \\in N^{\\prime}$ such that $\\tilde{\\pi}_{j o^{\\prime}}>0$. If $o^{\\prime} \\tilde{P}_{j} o^{\\prime \\prime}$, then we have contradicted Lemma 2. If $o^{\\prime \\prime} \\tilde{P}_{j} o^{\\prime}$, then we have contradicted unambiguous efficiency. Thus, $\\tilde{\\pi}_{i}=\\bar{\\pi}_{i}$. Since for each $j \\in N^{\\prime} \\backslash\\{i\\}, \\tilde{P}_{j}$ differs from $P_{j}$ only in the position of $o$ and $\\tilde{\\pi}_{j o}=0$, we then have that $P_{j}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $\\tilde{P}_{j}$ at $\\tilde{\\pi}_{j}$.\n\nThus, by invariance to support monotonic transformations, $f(s, P)=\\tilde{\\pi}$, so $f_{i}(s, P)=$ $m_{i}^{t}(s, P)$.\n\nProof of Theorem 1. From Lemma 7, it follows that there is $\\sigma$ such that $\\varphi$ coincides with $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$ where for each $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}^{N T}, \\sigma(\\eta) \\in \\mathcal{D}$.\n\nTo complete the proof that any $\\varphi$ satisfying the listed properties is a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies, it remains to show that $\\sigma$ is equal for equivalent histories.\n\nWe prove, by induction on histories along possible execution paths, that $\\sigma$ is equal for equivalent histories. The base case for the induction, that $\\sigma(()) \\in \\mathcal{D}$ is implied by Lemma 7. For the induction step, for some $t>0$, consider the $t^{\\text {th }}$ recursive call to $\\Psi$ with histories $\\eta$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$, residual supplies $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$, respectively. Let $P, P^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ be a pair of preference profiles that produce the equivalent histories $\\eta$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$ respectively up to this call. Let $\\pi^{k}=\\sigma(\\eta)(s, P)$ and $\\pi^{\\prime k}=\\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(s^{\\prime}, P^{\\prime}\\right)$. Let $\\bar{s}=r\\left(s, \\pi^{k}\\right)$ and $\\bar{s}^{\\prime}=r\\left(s^{\\prime}, \\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)$. If $\\sigma$ is not equal for equivalent histories, then there would be such $P$ and $P^{\\prime}$ where:\n\n- the same agents are assigned objects from both $\\pi^{k}$ and $\\pi^{\\prime k}$,\n- those agents have the same integrality to their allocations from both $\\pi^{k}$ and $\\pi^{\\prime k}$\n- and both $\\bar{s}$ and $\\bar{s}^{\\prime}$ have the same integrality,\nbut $\\sigma\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)(\\bar{s}, P) \\neq \\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}, P^{\\prime}\\right)$. Denote by $\\bar{N}=N \\backslash N\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)\\left(=N \\backslash N\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\right)$ the set of agents who have not been assigned any object at $\\eta++\\pi^{k}$ (and $\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)$ ). Let $\\bar{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ such that (i) for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}, \\bar{P}_{i}=P_{i}$ and (ii) for each $i \\in \\bar{N}, \\bar{P}_{i}=\\bar{P}_{0}$ where for each $a, b \\in A, a \\bar{P}_{0} b$ if and only if $\\bar{s}_{a} \\geq \\bar{s}_{b}$. That is, all agents in $\\bar{N}$ have an identical preference ordering, which ranks the objects in the weakly decreasing order of supplies of the objects at $\\bar{s}$ (that is, the objects with integral supplies on top, those with fractional supplies next, and unavailable objects at the bottom). Let $\\bar{\\pi}=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(\\bar{P})$. By Lemma $7, \\sigma\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)(\\bar{s}, \\bar{P})=$ $\\sigma\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)(\\bar{s}, P)$ and for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}, \\bar{\\pi}_{i}=\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}(P)$. Note that this allocation is invariant to the relative rankings over $A \\backslash A(\\bar{s})$ at $\\bar{P}_{0}$. Similarly, let $\\bar{P}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ such that (i) for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}$, $\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}=P_{i}^{\\prime}$ and (ii) for each $i \\in \\bar{N}, \\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}=\\bar{P}_{0}^{\\prime}$ where for each $a, b \\in A, a \\bar{P}_{0}^{\\prime} b$ if and only if $\\bar{s}_{a}^{\\prime} \\geq \\bar{s}_{b}^{\\prime}$. Let $\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}=\\varphi^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)$. By the same reasoning, $\\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}, P^{\\prime}\\right)$ and for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}, \\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}=\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}\\left(P^{\\prime}\\right)$. Again, this allocation is invariant to the relative rankings over $A \\backslash A\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}\\right)$ at $\\bar{P}_{0}^{\\prime}$. Since $\\sigma\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)(\\bar{s}, P) \\neq \\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}, P^{\\prime}\\right)$, we have $\\sigma\\left(\\eta++\\pi^{k}\\right)(\\bar{s}, \\bar{P}) \\neq \\sigma\\left(\\eta^{\\prime}++\\pi^{\\prime k}\\right)\\left(\\bar{s}^{\\prime}, \\bar{P}^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nWe further modify $\\bar{P}$ into $\\overline{\\bar{P}} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ such that (i) for each $i \\in \\bar{N}, \\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}=\\bar{P}_{i}$ and (ii) for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}$, each $a \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)$ and each $b \\notin \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right), a \\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i} b$ and\n\n$$\n\\left.\\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}\\right|_{\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)}=\\left.\\bar{P}_{i}\\right|_{\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)} \\text { and }\\left.\\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}\\right|_{A \\backslash \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)}=\\left.\\bar{P}_{0}\\right|_{A \\backslash \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nFor each $i \\in N, \\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}$ is a support monotonic transformation of $\\bar{P}_{i}$ at $\\bar{\\pi}_{i}$, and thus, by invariance to support monotonic transformation, $\\varphi^{\\sigma}(\\overline{\\bar{P}})=\\bar{\\pi}$. Similarly, let $\\overline{\\bar{P}}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ such that for each $i \\in \\bar{N}, \\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}^{\\prime}=\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}$ and for each $i \\notin \\bar{N}$, each $a \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ and each $b \\notin \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right), a \\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}^{\\prime} b$ and\n\n$$\n\\left.\\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|_{\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)}=\\left.\\bar{P}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|_{\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)} \\text { and }\\left.\\overline{\\bar{P}}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|_{A \\backslash \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)}=\\left.\\bar{P}_{0}^{\\prime}\\right|_{A \\backslash \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\bar{\\pi}_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)}\n$$\n\nBy the same reasoning, $\\varphi^{\\sigma}\\left(\\overline{\\bar{P}}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\bar{\\pi}^{\\prime}$. Finally, $\\overline{\\bar{P}}$ and $\\overline{\\bar{P}}^{\\prime}$ are ordinally equivalent and identical up to relabelling objects, but $\\overline{\\bar{\\pi}}$ and $\\overline{\\bar{\\pi}}^{\\prime}$ are not identical up to the same relabelling. This contradicts neutrality.\n\nWe now show that a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies with respect to $\\sigma, \\varphi^{\\sigma}$, satisfies the properties listed in the statement of Theorem 1.\n\n- Unambiguous Efficiency: Given an input $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, let $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{K} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{T}$ be the history accumulated along the execution path of a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies, $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$. Let $\\pi=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$. For each $t \\in\\{1, \\cdots, K\\}$ and each $i \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t}\\right), \\pi_{i}$ beats every lottery in\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\bar{\\pi}_{i} \\in \\Delta(A): \\text { for each } a \\in A, \\bar{\\pi}_{i a} \\leq \\vec{1}-\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right) \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\pi_{j a}\\right\\}\n$$\n\naccording to $R_{i}^{s d}$. If $N\\left(\\pi^{t}\\right)=\\{i\\}$, this means for any allocation $\\pi^{\\prime}$ such that it is not the case that $\\pi_{i} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$, there is $j \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right)$ where $t^{\\prime}<t$ such that $\\pi_{j} P_{j}^{s d} \\pi_{j}^{\\prime}$.\nIf there is $j \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t}\\right) \\backslash\\{i\\}$, by definition of $\\sigma, \\vec{1}-\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right) \\\\ t^{\\prime}<t}} \\pi_{k}$ is integral. By definition of a diarchy, this means $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ have the same best object $a_{1}$ in $A\\left(\\overrightarrow{1}-\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right) \\\\ t^{\\prime}<t}} \\pi_{k}\\right)$. Any allocation that assigns more of $a_{1}$ to $i$ necessarily makes $j$ worse off according to $P_{j}$. Also by definition of a diarchy, if $a_{2}$ is the second best object in $A\\left(\\overrightarrow{1}-\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right) \\\\ t^{\\prime}<t}} \\pi_{k}\\right)$ according to $P_{i}$, then $\\pi_{i a_{2}}=1-\\pi_{i a_{1}}$. Thus, for any $\\pi^{\\prime}$ such that it is not the case that $\\pi_{i} R_{i}^{s d} \\pi_{i}^{\\prime}$, there is $k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right)$ where $t^{\\prime} \\leq t$ such that $\\pi_{k} P_{k}^{s d} \\pi_{k}^{\\prime}$.\n\n- Neutrality: The definition of a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies makes no references to the labels of the objects. Therefore, such rules are, by definition, neutral.\n\n- Strategy-proofness: Let $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$ and $\\pi=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$. Let $i \\in N$. At a history $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{i}$, where $\\sigma(\\eta)=m^{i}$ or $\\sigma(\\eta)=d^{(i, j, \\alpha)}$ for some $j \\in N$ and $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, $i$ 's assignment is chosen to be the best allocation, according to $P_{i}^{\\text {sd }}$, in\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\bar{\\pi}_{i} \\in \\Delta(A): \\text { for each } a \\in A, \\bar{\\pi}_{i a} \\leq \\overrightarrow{1}-\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{i^{\\prime}}\\right) \\backslash\\{i\\} \\\\ t^{\\prime} \\leq t}} \\pi_{k a}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf $\\sigma(\\eta)=m^{i}$, this option set is unresponsive to $i$ 's reported preferences. If $\\sigma(\\eta)=$ $d^{(i, j, \\alpha)}$, this option set only depends on whether $i$ 's reported top object in $A(\\overrightarrow{1}-$ $\\left.\\sum_{\\substack{k \\in N\\left(\\pi^{i^{\\prime}}\\right) \\\\ t^{\\prime}<t}} \\pi_{k}\\right)$ coincides with that of $j$. Let $a_{1}$ be the top object in this set according to $P_{j}$. If $a_{1}$ is also the top object in this set according to $i$ 's report, $P_{i}$, then $\\pi_{j a_{1}}=1-\\alpha$. If $a_{1}$ is not the top object in this set according to $P_{i}$, then $\\pi_{j a_{1}}=1$. Thus, if $a_{1}$ is the true top object in this set for $i, i$ receives it with probability $\\alpha$ if they report it as such, but receives it with probability zero if they do not.\n\n- Non-bossiness: Given an input preference profile $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}$, let $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{K} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{T}$ be the history accumulated along the execution path of a hierarchy of monarchies and diarchies, $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$. Let $\\pi=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$.\nLet $i \\in N$ and $\\bar{P}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ be such that $\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}(P)$. Let $\\bar{\\eta}=\\left(\\bar{\\pi}^{k}\\right)_{k=1}^{L} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{T}$ be the history accumulated along the execution path of the hierarchy at $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$.\nSuppose $i \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t}\\right)$. By definition of $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$, for each $t^{\\prime}<t, \\pi^{t^{\\prime}}=\\bar{\\pi}^{t^{\\prime}}$, and for each $j \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right), \\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}(P)$. Since $\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}(P), \\pi^{t}=\\bar{\\pi}^{t}$. Thus, $\\sigma\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{t}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(\\bar{\\pi}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{\\pi}^{t}\\right)$. Since the residual supply vector is the same, $\\pi^{t+1}=\\bar{\\pi}^{t+1}$ and for each $j \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t+1}\\right), \\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}(P)$. Repeating this argument, we conclude that $\\varphi^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$.\n- Bounded invariance: Let $P \\in \\mathcal{P}^{N}, i \\in N, a \\in A$ and $\\bar{P}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)=U\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, a\\right)$ and $\\left.\\bar{P}_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)}=\\left.P_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)}$, where $U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)=\\left\\{b \\in A: b P_{i} a\\right\\}$ and $U\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, a\\right)=\\left\\{b \\in A: b \\bar{P}_{i} a\\right\\}$. Let $\\pi=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$. Let the history along the execution path at $P$ be $\\eta=\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{K}\\right)$ and at $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$ be $\\bar{\\eta}=\\left(\\bar{\\pi}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{\\pi}^{L}\\right)$. If $i \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t}\\right)$, then, as argued above, for all $t^{\\prime}<t$, $\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}=\\bar{\\pi}^{t^{\\prime}}$ and for each $j \\in N\\left(\\pi^{t^{\\prime}}\\right), \\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}(P)$.\nUnder the profile $P$, at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call to $\\Psi$, if the residual supply of $a$ is zero, then it is zero at $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$ as well and in both cases $a$ is allocated only to agents in $N\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots \\pi^{t-1}\\right)$. As we have shown above, for each such $j, \\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{j}^{\\sigma}(P)$.\nIf $\\varphi_{i a}^{\\sigma}(P)=1$, then $a$ is the best object that has positive availability at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call\n\naccording to $P_{i}$. Since the residual supply is the same with input $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$, and since $\\left.\\bar{P}_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)}=\\left.P_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)}, a$ is also the best object that has positive availability according to $\\bar{P}_{i}$, so $\\varphi_{i a}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=1$. By non-bossiness, $\\varphi^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi^{\\sigma}(P)$.\nIf the residual supply of $a$ at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $P$ is positive, but $\\varphi_{i a}^{\\sigma}(P)=0$, then $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}(P)\\right) \\subseteq U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)$. So, since $\\left.\\bar{P}_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)}=\\left.P_{i}\\right|_{U\\left(P_{i}, a\\right)},\\left.\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)=\\varphi_{i}^{\\sigma}(P)\\right.$ and we conclude by non-bossiness.\n\nFinally, if the residual supply of $a$ at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $P$ is positive, and $0<\\varphi_{i a}^{\\sigma}(P)<1$, then $a$ is either the best object or the second best object according to $P_{i}$ among those with positive residual supplies. If $a$ is the best object at $P_{i}$, then by definition of $\\varphi^{\\sigma}, a$ is allocated entirely to the agents in $N\\left(\\pi^{1}, \\ldots, \\pi^{t}\\right)$, regardless of whether $a$ is allocated to a monarchy or to a diarchy at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $P$. Since $a$ is still $i$ 's best object at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $\\bar{P}_{i}$, the allocation of $a$ is the same at both $P$ and $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$. If $a$ is the second best object at $P_{i}$, then there are two cases. If $a$ 's supply is exhausted at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $P$, then the same argument as above applies. So, suppose that $a$ 's supply is not exhausted at the $t^{\\text {th }}$ call at $P$. Since $i$ 's preference remains the same down to $a$ at $\\bar{P}_{i}$ as in $P_{i}$, the allocation of $t^{\\text {th }}$ call coincides at $P$ and $\\left(\\bar{P}_{i}, P_{-i}\\right)$. By definition of $\\varphi^{\\sigma}$, the subsequent selections by $\\sigma$ do not change, keeping the allocation of $a$ unchanged.",
