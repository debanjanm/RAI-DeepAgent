It strengthens a condition studied in supply chain literature, which forces rules to disincentivize order inflation under capacity allocation and retail competition. The relevance of the axiom is further demonstrated by one of the main results of the present article: it characterizes the weighted constrained equal awards rule together with known natural axioms.\n\n\nKeywords: Game theory, Claims problem, Weighted rule, Axiomatic characterization, Supply chain management\n2020 MSC: 90B06, 91B32", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nFormal studies on claims problems, also known as bankruptcy problems, and rules applicable to them are motivated by needs to distribute some resource claimed by several agents the sum of whose claims adds up to more than the said resource. The vast body of research that began with O'Neill (1982) has been summarized in the monograph by Thomson (2019).\n\nAn object of study appearing in the literature that is important for our purpose is the weighted constrained equal awards rule. This was introduced by Lee (1994) and characterized in the broader context of weighted claims problems by Moulin (2000).\n\nThe present article introduces a new axiom on weighted rules for claims problems. The axiom is inspired by practical issues arising in the supply\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Email address: ykentaro@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp (Kentar\u00f4 Yamamoto)\n\nchain literature. Liu (2012) considers a situation where a single supplier receives orders from many retailers who engage in some Cournot competition of complete information. When the sum of the retailers' orders exceeds his stock, the supplier applies a rule to the associated claims problem whose claimants are the retailers and whose claims are their orders. Lee (1994) pointed out that depending on the rule chosen, a retailer may strategically inflate her order, that is, making an order larger than one expected solely from the Nash equilibrium of the said Cournot competition. Cho and Tang (2014) discussed how to choose a rule that eliminate such strategic inflation of orders.\n\nWhile Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014) assumed that the retailers engage in competitions of a certain form and studied elimination of inflation of orders under this assumption, we instead ask for rules eliminating inflation of orders regardless of what competition the retailers are in. This leads to a new axiom on weighted rules on claims problems, which we call strategyfreedom in the present article. Extracting this axiom from the supply chain literature allows us to apply axiomatic methods to the supply chain issues. We reveal what rules, if any, satisfy strategy-freedom; the relationship between strategy-freedom and other axioms on rules; and the characterization of weighted constrained equal awards rule in terms of strategy-freedom.\n\nThe article is organized as follows. In $\\S 2$, we review standard concepts in claims problem literature while fixing the terminology and the notation. We dedicate $\\S 3$ to the derivation of our new axiom, strategy-freedom, from the works by Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014). We review their model and detail the relationship between their motivation and our axiom. We also note another axiom they implicitly studied, whose special case can be found in the existing claims problem literature. In $\\S 4$, we engage in axiomatic study of rules in terms of the newly-found axioms. We first study the relationship between the two axioms inspired by Cho and Tang (2014) and clarify certain points made by them. We then examine the details of the axiom of strategyfreedom and reveal its interesting behavior across different weights. In light of this, we devise an alternate version of strategy-freedom, continuous strategyfreedom, and characterize it in terms of the original strategy-freedom and continuity. Lastly, we prove the characterization of the weighted constrained equal awards rule in terms of strategy-freedom and several other known axioms. We conclude the article by stating inter alia an open problem in $\\S 5$. The Appendix A has more technical results on the fine details of strategyfreedom.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Preliminaries \n\nOur framework will involve weighted versions of familiar rules and axioms; however, weights will not be part of specifications of problems, and instead we shall discuss families of rules and families of axioms, both indexed by weights. Therefore, a (claims) problem is any vector $(E, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$, where $N$ is the set of claimants. A problem $(E, c)$ is wellformed if $\\sum c \\geq E$, where for a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$, we let $\\sum v=\\sum_{i \\in N} v_{i} .{ }^{1}$ We write $\\mathcal{C}^{N}$ for the set of wellformed problems. A weight is any member of the $(|N|-1)$-dimensional unit simplex $\\Delta:=\\Delta^{|N|-1}$ in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ (our convention is that this refers to what some call the interior of such a simplex). A rule is a function $z^{w}$ mapping a problem to a vector in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum c>E \\Longrightarrow \\sum z^{w}(E, c)=E \\\\\n\\sum c \\leq E \\Longrightarrow z^{w}(E, c)=c\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nz^{w}(E, c) \\leqq c\n$$\n\nFinally, a weighted rule is a family $\\left(z^{w}\\right)_{w \\in \\Delta}$ of rules indexed by weights, and a weighted axiom or a weighted property is a family of axioms indexed by weights.\n\nLet us recall known rules and axioms that are relevant in our work. Our terminology is based on Thomson (2019). The following weighted rule was introduced essentially by Kalai (1977) and studied by Lee (1994).\n\nDefinition 2.1. The constrained equal awards rule with a weight $w, \\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$, is defined by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{CEA}^{w}(E, c)=\\left(c_{i} \\wedge \\lambda w_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is chosen for (1) to hold.\nThe following axioms are standard.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ In the literature, it is customary to define problems to be what we call wellformed problems. We instead allow any vector of the correct index set with nonnegative components to be a problem and demand (2) of rules. This is so that the description of the game $G^{z, E}(\\pi)$ may be simpler in $\\S 3.1$; it does not alter the theory beyond the superficial difference.\n\nDefinition 2.2. 1. A rule $z$ is homogeneous if for every $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$ and $\\lambda>0$, we have $z(\\lambda E, \\lambda c)=\\lambda z(E, c)$.\n2. A rule $z$ is claims monotonic if $z_{i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right) \\geq z_{i}(E, c)$ for every $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}, i \\in N$, and $c_{i}^{\\prime}>c_{i}$.\n3. A rule $z$ is anonymous if $z_{\\sigma(i)}(E, c)=z_{i}\\left(E, c^{\\sigma}\\right)$, where $c^{\\sigma}=\\left(c_{\\sigma(i)}\\right)_{i \\in N}$, for every $i \\in N,(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$, and every permutation $\\sigma$ of $N$, i.e., every bijection on $N$.\n4. A rule $z$ is uniformly claims continuous if $z(E, \\cdot)$ is uniformly continuous as a function $\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ for each $E>0$.\n\nThe following class of rules, which is broad enough to contain both the proportional rule and $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$, was introduced and axiomatized by Harless (2016).\n\nDefinition 2.3. Separable directional rules or, as originally called, weighted proportional rules are rules of the form $P^{u}$, where $u=\\left(u_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}$ is a family of functions $u_{i}: \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$that are strictly positive on $\\mathbb{R}_{++}$with $u_{i}(0)=0$, and\n\n$$\nP^{u}(E, c)=\\left(c_{i} \\wedge \\lambda u_{i}\\left(c_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i \\in N}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is chosen to satisfy (1), for every $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. New axioms\n### 3.1. Motivating model\n\nWe review the model studied by Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014), albeit in an abstract fashion. The model involves a supplier of homogeneous goods and a number of retailers. We denote the set of retailers also by $N$, as they will play the role of claimants in the body of the present article. The supplier has $E$ units of the goods. Each of the retailers $i$ puts an order to the retailer, requesting $c_{i}$ units of goods $(i \\in N)$. The retailer has a function $z^{w}$ that maps a vector $(E, c)$, where $c=\\left(c_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}$, to a vector $z^{w}(E, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$, where $z_{i}^{w}(E, c)$ is the amount of goods that the retailer $i$ receives from the supplier. This function is common knowledge among the retailers and the supplier prior to the orders. Let $c^{\\prime}=z^{w}(E, c)$. We posit that the retailer $i$ obtains the payoff $\\pi_{i}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$. In the works of Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014), $\\pi:=$ $\\left(\\pi_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}$ is the payoff functions of some Cournot competition with a linear inverse demand function. Now, for a moment, let us forget that the supplier had a limited supply of $E$ and assume $z^{w}(E, c)=c$. Then the retailers would play the complete-information game $G_{0}(\\pi)$ of normal form determined\n\nby the payoff function $\\pi$, which we assume, for the sake of simplicity, has a unique Nash equilibrium $c^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$. On the other hand, in view of the limited supply, it is plausible to demand that $z^{w}$ be a rule as defined in \u00a7 2. Thus, in general, $z^{w}(E, c) \\neq c$, and the retailers instead play the game $G^{z^{w}, E}(\\pi)$ determined by $\\left(\\pi_{i} \\circ z^{w, E}\\right)_{i \\in N}$, where $z^{w, E}(c)=z^{w}(E, c)$. The Nash equilibrium $c^{*}$ of the original game $G_{0}(\\pi)$ may cease to be a Nash equilibrium of $G^{z^{w}, E}(\\pi)$. Seeing this as undesirable, Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014) studied conditions on $z^{w}$ for $c^{*}$ to remain a Nash equilibrium of $G^{z^{w}, E}(\\pi)$ (again, where $\\pi$ is determined by Cournot competitions with linear demands, unlike our approach).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3.2. New axioms \n\nThe aforementioned model motivates the following axioms on rules for claims problems. We should like our axiom to state\nthe Nash equilibrium $c^{*}(\\pi)$ of $G_{0}(\\pi)$ is still a Nash equilibrium of $G^{z^{w}, E}(\\pi)$.\n\nLet us call this condition $P\\left(\\pi, E, z^{w}\\right)$. In order to turn this into an axiom on rules, we need to specify $\\pi$ and $E$. Liu (2012) and Cho and Tang (2014) chooses specific $\\pi$, namely, those coming from Cournot competitions. ${ }^{2}$ We, on the other hand, propose that our axiom demand\n$P\\left(\\pi, E, z^{w}\\right)$ for every payoff function $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ with the unique Nash equilibrium $c^{*}$ and every $E \\geq \\sum c^{*}$.\n\nWe call this condition $Q\\left(c^{*}, z^{w}\\right)$. Our proposal is based on the idea that our axiom should be a criterion by which the supplier in the original model can choose a good rule. Since it is more plausible that the supplier is not cognizant of the details of the competition that the retailers are in, the supplier may want to choose a rule that do not alter, and hence obfuscate, the Nash equilibrium of $G_{0}(\\pi)$ no matter what $\\pi$ is (we still assume that the supplier somehow knows the Nash equilibrium $c^{*}$ ).\n\nAs for our treatment of $E$ in the condition $Q(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, the demand that $E \\geq$ $\\sum c^{*}$ is not present in Liu (2012) or Cho and Tang (2014). ${ }^{3}$ We chose to\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Cho and Tang (2014) actually establishes properties of pairs of rules and $E$, not rules per se.\n    ${ }^{3} \\mathrm{~A}$ more precise statement would be that the question of whether or not to allow $E<\\sum c^{*}$ does not arise for Cho and Tang (2014), who in reality study pairs $\\left(E, z^{w}\\right)$.\n\nimpose $E \\geq \\sum c^{*}$ because, otherwise, $z^{w}$ could not possibly allocate $c^{*}$, and whether or not $c^{*}$ remains a Nash equilibrium in $G^{z^{w}, E}(\\pi)$ would depend on $\\pi$. The universal quantifier for $E$ is justified by the same reasoning as was with payoff functions: in absence of prior knowledge on $E$, the supplier may want to demand of the rule that it not disrupt the Nash equilibrium no matter what $E$ is. Our choice is also in line with the existing literature on strategy-freedom, which is usually a universally quantified condition.\n\nThe universal quantifier for $\\pi$ helps simplify $Q(\\cdot, \\cdot)$. Suppose $E \\geq \\sum c^{*}$. The vector $c^{*}$ is the Nash equilibrium of $\\pi \\circ z^{w, E}$ for all $\\pi$ with the unique Nash equilibrium $c^{*}$ if and only if $z_{-i}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\right)=c_{-i}^{*}$ for every $i \\in N$ and every $c_{i} \\geq E-\\sum c_{-i}^{*}$ (note that this condition is just a paraphrase of \" $z_{-i}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\right)=c_{-i}^{*}$ for every $i \\in N$ and every $c_{i}$ with $\\left.\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\right) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}\\right)$ ). To see the \"only if\" direction, given $i \\in N$ and $c_{i}$ with $z_{-i}^{w}\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right) \\neq c_{-i}^{*}$, whence $z^{w}\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right) \\neq c^{*}$, choose $\\pi_{i}$ so that $\\pi_{i}\\left(z^{w}\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\right)<\\pi_{i}\\left(c^{*}\\right)$. To see the other direction, note that if $z_{-i}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\right)=c_{-i}^{*}$ for all $i$ and $c_{i} \\geq E-\\sum c_{-i}^{*}$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(\\pi \\circ z^{w, E}\\right)\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right)= \\begin{cases}\\pi\\left(c_{i}, c_{-i}^{*}\\right), & \\left(c_{-i}^{*} \\geq E-\\sum c_{-i}^{*}\\right) \\\\ \\pi\\left(c^{*}\\right), & \\left(c_{-i}^{*}<E-\\sum c_{-i}^{*}\\right)\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich does not exceed $\\pi\\left(c^{*}\\right)$ by assumption.\nLet us recall that, under our current convention, (weighted) axioms are indexed by weights, not vectors of amount of goods. Also relevant is our assumption that weights are members of $\\Delta=\\Delta^{|N|-1}$. Our axiom, therefore, should not depend on the original Nash equilibrium $c^{*}$ itself, but $c^{*} / \\sum c^{*}$. Given a weight $w$, it would then demand of a rule $z$ that $Q(\\lambda w, z)$ for every $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. We have now arrived a new definition:\n\nDefinition 3.1. A rule $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for a weight $w$ if for every $i \\in N$, $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}, E \\geq \\sum \\lambda w$, and $c_{i} \\geq E-\\sum \\lambda w_{-i}$,\n\n$$\nz_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)=\\lambda w_{-i}\n$$\n\nRemark. 1. As before, the last part of the definition is equivalent to saying \"for every $c_{i}$ with $\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$, equation (4) obtains.\"\n2. Expecting Lemma A.1, let a binary relation $D \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}^{N} \\times \\Delta$ consist of tuples $((E, c), w) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N} \\times \\Delta$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\exists i=: i(c, w) \\in N)\\left(\\exists c_{i}^{\\prime}=: c_{i}^{\\prime}(c, w) \\stackrel{(5)}{<} c_{i}\\right)\\left[\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right) \\| w, E \\geq \\sum c_{-i}+c_{i}^{\\prime}\\right]\\right.\n$$\n\nnote the strict inequality (5). Then, a rule $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ if and only if $z_{-i}(E, c)=c_{-i}$ for every $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$ with $(c, w) \\in D$.\n\nIn addition to requiring (4) of a rule $z$, one might want to demand that (4) hold approximately for close arguments of $z$. Corollary 4.8 of $\\S 4$ motivates such an additional requirement. There are several ways in which to formalize this idea. Expecting Proposition 4.9, we propose the following axiom.\n\nDefinition 3.2. A rule $z$ is continuously strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ if for arbitrary $\\epsilon>0$ there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for every $E>0, c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}, i \\in N$, and $c_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the conditions $E \\geq \\sum \\lambda w,\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$, and $\\left\\|\\lambda w_{-i}-c_{-i}\\right\\|<\\delta$ imply $\\left\\|z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right)-c_{-i}\\right\\|<\\epsilon$.\n\nInformally, this condition requires that $z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right)$ is close to $c_{-i}$ whenever there is $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda w_{-i}$ is close enough to $c_{-i}$.\n\nCho and Tang (2014) inspire another family of axioms. First, we need a definition:\n\nDefinition 3.3. For a rule $z$, the vector $\\alpha(z) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{i}(z)=\\inf \\left\\{\\rho \\geq 0 \\mid \\forall(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N} z_{i}(E, c) \\stackrel{(6)}{\\geq} c_{i} \\wedge \\rho E\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNote that (6) is an equality whenever $c_{i}=c_{i} \\wedge \\rho E$.\nFor each weight $w$, \" $\\alpha(\\cdot)=w$ \" is a property of a rule. It is worth noting that $\\sum \\alpha(z)$ may be strictly less than 1 , i.e., $\\alpha(z)$ may not be a weight as they are usually understood. Cho and Tang (2014) call such rules individually responsive, and other rules individually unresponsive. Also note that if $w=(1 /|N|, \\ldots, 1 /|N|)$, then this rule is nothing but what Moulin (2002) introduced and Thomson (2019) called min-of-claim-and-equal division lower bounds on awards.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4. Main results \n\nThe theory for the case $|N|=2$ is quite different from the rest. The following two Facts are pointed out by, e.g., Moulin (2002) for the unweighted case, e.g., $w_{i}=w_{j}$ for all $i, j \\in N$.\n\nFact 4.1 (folklore). If $|N|=2$, then for each weight $w \\in \\Delta$, the axiom $\\alpha(\\cdot)=w$ characterizes $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$.\n\nTherefore, we assume $|N| \\geq 3$ for the entirety of this section.\nFact 4.2 (folklore). Let $w$ be a weight.\n\n1. $\\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}\\right)=w$ (hence $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$ is individually unresponsive).\n2. The axiom $\\alpha(\\cdot)=w$ does not characterize $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$.\n\nThis Fact be strengthened to the following, which may well be known but whose proof the author was unable to find.\n\nProposition 4.3. Claims monotonicity and $\\alpha(\\cdot)=w$ does not characterize $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$.\n\nProof. For simplicity, an argument for the case $N=\\{0,1,2\\}$ and $w=$ $(1 / 3,1 / 3,1 / 3)$ will be presented. We construct the desired rule $z$ by the following. Let $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$ be arbitrary. If $I(E, c):=\\left\\{i \\in N \\mid c_{i}<E / 3\\right\\}$ is not a singleton, then $\\alpha(z)=w$ indeed determines $z(E, c)$. Otherwise, let $\\{i\\}=I(E, c)$. We still are forced to set $z_{i}(E, c)=c_{i}$. Let $j \\in N$ be the least number such that $c_{j}=\\max _{k \\in N \\backslash\\{i\\}} c_{k}$. Let $z_{j}(E, c)=\\left(E-c_{i}\\right) \\wedge c_{j}$; the other claimant's award is determined by (1).\n\nIn light of the Proposition, Theorem 2 of Cho and Tang (2014) should be read as merely establishing the equivalence between a special case of strategyfreedom ${ }^{w}$ and $\\alpha(\\cdot)=w$ under the assumption of claims monotonicity ${ }^{4}$, as those conditions do not determine a rule uniquely. In any case, the following generalizes their Theorem 2.\n\nTheorem 4.4. Let $z$ be an individually unresponsive rule, i.e., $\\sum \\alpha(z)=1$. It is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for a weight $w$ if and only if $\\alpha(z)=w$.\n\nProof. Suppose first $\\alpha(z)=w$. Take an arbitrary $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}, E \\geq \\sum \\lambda w, i \\in N$, and $c_{i}>E-\\sum \\lambda w_{-i}$. Then $\\lambda w_{-i} \\leq \\alpha_{-i}(z) E$, and, by the definition of $\\alpha$, we have $z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)=\\lambda w_{-i}$ as desired.\n\nOn the other hand, if $\\alpha(z) \\neq w$, then since $\\sum \\alpha(z)=\\sum w=1$, there exists $i \\in N$ such that $\\alpha_{i}(z)>w_{i}$. Take a positive $\\lambda$, and let $E=\\sum \\lambda w$ and $c_{i}=E \\alpha_{i}(z)$, which is greater than $\\lambda w_{i}$. Again by the definition of $\\alpha$, we have $z_{i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)=c_{i}>\\lambda w_{i}$. Since $\\sum z\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)=E=\\sum \\lambda w$, it follows that $\\sum z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)<\\sum \\lambda w_{-i}$, whence $z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right) \\neq \\lambda w_{-i}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Note that in Cho and Tang (2014), claims monotonicity is part of the definition of rules.\n\nCorollary 4.5. Let $w$ and $w^{\\prime}$ be weights.\n\n1. If an individually unresponsive $z$ is both strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ and strategyfree $^{w^{\\prime}}$, then $w=w^{\\prime}$.\n2. If $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w^{\\prime}}$, then $w=w^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe now move on to individually responsive rules.\nProposition 4.6. There exists an individually responsive strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ rule.\nProof. Consider the following rule $z$ for $N=\\{0,1,2\\}$ and $w=(1 / 3,1 / 3,1 / 3)$. Given $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$ with $c_{0} \\geq c_{1} \\geq c_{2}$, define\n\n$$\nz(E, c)= \\begin{cases}\\left(\\left(E-2 c_{2}\\right) \\vee E / 3, c_{2} \\wedge E / 3, c_{2} \\wedge E / 3\\right) & \\text { if } c_{1}=c_{2} \\\\ \\left(c_{1} \\wedge E / 2, c_{1} \\wedge E / 2,\\left(E-2 c_{1}\\right) \\vee 0\\right) & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand extend the definition using anonymity.\nRemark. 1. The rule above is claims monotonic as well. Hence it satisfies the conditions Corollary 1 of Cho and Tang (2014), despite what is claimed at the end of their $\\S 4$.\n2. The Proposition alternatively follows from Corollary Appendix A.2. The rule defined above has the advantages of being explicit and claims monotonic.\n\nCorollary 4.5 leaves unanswered the possibility of strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$ of an individually responsive rule for different $w$ 's at once. We give an affirmative, albeit non-constructive, answer in the Appendix (Corollary Appendix A.2). We instead present a related negative result here. Going back to the original model, even if we have a good reason to believe the original Nash equilibrium is $w$ after normalization, we may have committed errors in estimation and measurement. It is therefore truly desirable for a rule $z$ to be strategy-free ${ }^{w^{\\prime}}$ for all $w^{\\prime}$ close enough to $w$. Mathematically, this is about existence of an open neighborhood $U$ of $w$ such that $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w^{\\prime}}$ for all $w^{\\prime} \\in U$. Unfortunately, this is ruled out by the corollary below.\n\nIn the following, let us call pairs $\\left(u^{i}, u^{j}\\right)$ of distinct weights bad (or $(i, j)$ bad, if we want to be explicit on the indices) if there are distinct $i, j \\in N$ such that $u_{-i-j}^{i} \\| u_{-i-j}^{j}$, that $u_{i}^{i} \\sum u_{-i-j}^{j}<u_{i}^{j} \\sum u_{-i-j}^{i}$ and that $u_{j}^{i} \\sum u_{-i-j}^{j}>$ $u_{j}^{j} \\sum u_{-i-j}^{i}$.\n\nLemma 4.7. Let $\\left(u^{i}, u^{j}\\right)$ be an $(i, j)$-bad pair of weights. There is no rule that is both strategy-free ${ }^{u^{i}}$ and strategy-free ${ }^{u^{j}}$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{u^{k}}$ for each $k \\in\\{i, j\\}$. Take some $c_{-i-j} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N-\\{i, j\\}}$ parallel to $u_{-i-j}^{i}$ (and thus to $u_{-i-j}^{j}$ ). Then, for each of $k \\in\\{i, j\\}$, every $E$ at least $L_{k}:=\\sum c_{-k}+u_{k}^{k}\\left(\\sum c_{-k}^{k}\\right) /\\left(\\sum u_{-k}^{k}\\right)$ and at most $\\sum c$, and $c_{i}, c_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, strategy-freedom ${ }^{u^{k}}$ implies that $z_{-k}(E, c)=c_{-k}$. Let $c_{k}=u_{k}^{k^{\\prime}}\\left(\\sum c_{-k}^{k}\\right) /\\left(\\sum u_{-k}^{k}\\right)$ for $\\left(k, k^{\\prime}\\right)=(i, j),(j, i)$. By badness, $L_{k}<\\sum c$ $(k=i, j)$. Let $E=L_{i} \\vee L_{j}$; without loss of generality, assume $L_{i} \\geq L_{j}$ and thus $E=L_{i}$. Then by strategy-freedom ${ }^{u_{i}}$,\n\n$$\nz_{i}(E, c)=E-\\sum z_{-i}(E, c)=E-\\sum c_{-i}=u_{i}^{i}\\left(\\sum c_{-k}^{k}\\right) /\\left(\\sum u_{-k}^{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy strategy-freedom ${ }^{u_{j}}$,\n\n$$\nz_{i}(E, c)=\\left(z_{-j}(E, c)\\right)_{i}=c_{i}\n$$\n\nThese cannot all be equal due to badness.\nCorollary 4.8. Suppose that a rule $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for all $w \\in S$, where $S \\subseteq \\Delta$. Then $S$ is a null set.\n\nProof. Choose distinct $i \\neq j$ in $N$. For $p \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N-\\{i, j\\}}$, the line $l_{p}:=\\{w \\in \\Delta \\mid$ $w_{-i-j}=p\\}$ intersects $S$ with at most one point. Indeed, if $u, v \\in l_{p} \\cap S$ are distinct, either $(u, v)$ or $(v, u)$ is an $(i, j)$-bad pair. The claim then follows from a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nBy Corollary 4.8, for any weight $w$, there is no open neighborhood $U$ of $w$ a rule $z$ such that $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w^{\\prime}}$ for all $w^{\\prime} \\in U$. The next best thing to hope for, therefore, is something like continuous strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$. The following fact suggests that this particular formalization is a natural axiom.\n\nProposition 4.9. A rule is continuously strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ if and only if it is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ and uniformly claims continuous on $\\mathcal{C}^{N}$.\n\nProof. We prove the \"if\" direction first. Let $\\epsilon>0$ be given. We may take $\\delta_{\\mathrm{uc}}>0$ witnessing the uniform continuity of $z$ for $\\epsilon$ and let $\\delta=\\delta_{\\mathrm{uc}} \\wedge \\epsilon$. Let $E, \\lambda, i, c, c_{i}^{\\prime}$ be arbitrary as in Definition 3.2, so that $\\left\\|\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)-\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right\\|=$\n\n$\\left\\|c_{-i}-\\lambda w_{-i}\\right\\|<\\delta$. By strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$, we have $z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)=\\lambda w_{-i}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right)-c_{-i}\\right\\| \\leq & \\left\\|z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, c_{-i}\\right)\\right)-z_{-i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right)\\right\\| \\\\\n& +\\left\\|\\lambda w_{-i}-c_{i}\\right\\| \\\\\n\\leq & 2 \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas desired.\nThe \"only if\" part can be proved as follows. The strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$ is clear. Let $\\epsilon>0$ be arbitrary. Take $\\delta_{\\text {sf }}$ witnessing the continuous strategyfreedom ${ }^{w}$ of $z$ for $\\epsilon$. Define $\\delta=\\delta_{\\text {sf }} \\wedge \\epsilon$. Consider arbitrary $c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ with $\\|c-d\\|<\\delta$. Take any $i \\in N$. There exist $\\lambda, \\mu>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|c-d\\| \\geq\\left(\\left\\|c_{-i}-\\lambda w_{-i}\\right\\|+\\left\\|d_{-i}-\\mu w_{-i}\\right\\|\\right) \\vee\\left\\|\\lambda w_{i}-\\mu w_{i}\\right\\|\n$$\n\nNote that $z_{i}(E, x)=E-\\sum z_{-i}(E, x)$ for $x=c, d$, whence $\\left|z_{i}(E, c)-\\right.$ $\\left.z_{i}(E, d)\\right| \\leq\\left\\|z_{-i}(E, c)-z_{-i}(E, d)\\right\\|_{1}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|z(E, c)-z(E, d)\\| \\leq & \\left|z_{i}(E, c)-z_{i}(E, d)\\right|+\\left\\|z_{-i}(E, c)-z_{-i}(E, d)\\right\\| \\\\\n\\leq & \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+1\\right)\\left\\|z_{-i}(E, c)-z_{-i}(E, d)\\right\\| \\\\\n\\leq & \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+1\\right)\\left(\\left\\|z_{i}\\left(E, c\\right)-z_{i}\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}, \\lambda w_{i}\\right)\\right)\\right\\|\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left\\|\\lambda w_{i}-\\mu w_{i}\\right\\|\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left\\|z_{i}\\left(E,\\left(d_{i}, \\mu w_{i}\\right)\\right)-z_{i}(E, d)\\right\\|\\right) \\\\\n\\leq & 3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}+1\\right) \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas desired.\nWe conclude the section by a characterization of $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$ in terms of strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$ for general $N$. It is instructive to present our result as a corollary of a characterization of the following class of rules containing $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$.\n\nDefinition 4.10. For a $\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$and a weight $w \\in \\Delta$, the rule $\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}(E, c)=\\left(c_{i} \\wedge w_{i}\\left(c_{i} / w_{i}\\right)^{-\\kappa} \\lambda\\right)_{i \\in N}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is chosen to satisfy (1), for every $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$.\n\nObviously, $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}=\\mathrm{CEA}_{0}^{w}$.\nTheorem 4.11. For each $w \\in \\Delta$, the rules of the form $\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}$ are the exactly separable directional ones that are strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ and homogeneous.\n\nProof. It is easy to see that $\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ and homogeneous. Moreover, $\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}=P^{u}$, where $u_{i}(c)=w_{i}\\left(c_{i} / w_{i}\\right)^{-\\kappa}$.\n\nConversely, assume that $P^{u}$ is, strategy-free ${ }^{w}$, and homogeneous. Consider an arbitrary tuple $\\left(\\left(E,\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}, \\lambda w_{-i}\\right)\\right), w\\right) \\in D$. By strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$, for every $j \\in N \\backslash\\{i\\}$, we have\n\n$$\nu_{j}\\left(\\lambda w_{j}\\right) / u_{i}\\left(c_{i}^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq \\lambda w_{j} / c_{i}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nLetting $c_{i}^{\\prime}=\\lambda w_{i}$, (does this require endowment continuity?) we obtain $u_{j}\\left(\\lambda w_{j}\\right) / u_{i}\\left(\\lambda w_{i}\\right) \\geq w_{j} / w_{i}$. Since $i \\neq j$ are arbitrary, $u\\left(j, \\lambda w_{j}\\right) / u\\left(i, \\lambda w_{i}\\right)=$ $w_{j} / w_{i}$. Thus, there exists a function $f: \\mathbb{R}_{++} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{++}$such that\n\n$$\nu_{i}\\left(\\lambda w_{i}\\right)=w_{i} f(\\lambda)\n$$\n\nfor every $i \\in N$ and $\\lambda>0$, i.e., $u_{i}\\left(c_{i}\\right)=w_{i} f\\left(c_{i} / w_{i}\\right)$ for every $c_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$and $i \\in N$.\n\nGoing back to (7), letting $c_{i}^{\\prime}=\\lambda^{\\prime} w_{i}$ for $\\lambda^{\\prime} \\geq \\lambda$ this time, and using the definition (8), we have $f\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq f(\\lambda)$. Thus $f$ is non-increasing.\n\nNow, one can show that homogeneity implies $u_{i}(c) \\| u_{j}(\\alpha c)$ for all $c \\geq 0$ and $\\alpha>0$. In other words, $u_{i}\\left(\\alpha \\lambda w_{i}\\right) / u_{i}\\left(\\lambda w_{i}\\right)=u_{j}\\left(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\prime} w_{j}\\right) / u_{j}\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime} w_{j}\\right)$ for all $\\alpha, \\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}>0$ and $i, j \\in N$. By (8), this implies, in our case,\n\n$$\n\\frac{f(\\alpha \\lambda)}{f(\\lambda)}=\\frac{f\\left(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)}{f\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor arbitrary $\\alpha, \\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}>0$. Define a function $F: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by $F(x)=$ $\\log f(\\exp x)$, where the common base is $f(1)$, which we shall assume henceforth. Since $f$ is non-increasing, so is $F$. Now for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF(x)+F(y)-F(x y) & =\\log \\left(\\frac{f(\\exp x) f(\\exp y)}{f(\\exp (x+y))}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\log f(1) \\\\\n& =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere (9) with $\\left(\\alpha, \\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)=(\\exp x, 1, \\exp y)$ is used to derive (10). Since $F$ is non-increasing, $F(x)=-\\kappa x$ for some $\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Unraveling the relevant definitions leads to the desired conclusion.\n\nCorollary 4.12. For each $w \\in \\Delta$, the rule $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$ is the only separable directional rule that is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$, homogeneous, and claims monotonic.\n\nProof. In light of the Theorem, it suffices to show that $\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}$ is claims monotonic if and only if $\\kappa=0$. Obviously, $\\mathrm{CEA}_{0}^{w}$ is claims monotonic. On the other hand, assume that $\\kappa>0$ and, for simplicity, that $N=\\{0,1,2\\}$. Consider $c \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}$ such that $c_{0} / w_{0}<c_{1} / w_{1}=c_{2} / w_{2}$ and $E \\in\\left(c_{0}, c_{0}+c_{1}+c_{2}\\right)$. Here, one can see that $\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}(E, c)\\right)_{1}=\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}(E, c)\\right)_{2}$. Now take $c_{2}^{\\prime}>c_{2}$, so that $c_{1} / w_{1}<c_{2} / w_{2}$. We then have $\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{2}^{\\prime}, c_{-2}\\right)\\right)\\right)_{1}<\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}\\left(E, c_{2}^{\\prime}, c_{-2}\\right)\\right)_{2}$. On the other hand, $\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}(E, c)\\right)_{0}=\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{2}^{\\prime}, c_{-2}\\right)\\right)\\right)_{0}$, whence by (1), $\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}(E, c)\\right)_{2}>\\left(\\mathrm{CEA}_{\\kappa}^{w}\\left(E,\\left(c_{2}^{\\prime}, c_{-2}\\right)\\right)\\right)_{2}$, which violates claims monotonicity.\n\nThe preceding Theorem and Corollary can be stated in an axiomatic manner by quoting the axiomatization of separable directional rules by Harless (2016).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 5. Concluding remarks \n\nIn the present article, we presented a new axiom, strategy-freedom, on rules for claims problems. The axiom is inspired by, and has potential applications in, supply chain research. If goods whose amount is limited are distributed to retailers according to a strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ rule, the retailers in a competition whose Nash equilibrium is $c^{*}$ have no incentive to change their orders from $c^{*}$ as long as it is a multiple of $w$. The relevance of the axiom is further confirmed by the fact (Theorem 4.4) that, under certain contidions, it is equivalent to a natural generalization of a known axiom (min-of-claim-andequal division lower bounds on awards) and the fact (Corollary 4.12) that it characterizes $\\mathrm{CEA}^{w}$, the weighted constrained equal awards rule, together with other natural conditions.\n\nIt remains an important future task to analyze game-theoretically a variant of strategy-freedom we introduced, continuous strategy-freedom ${ }^{w}$, in the original context of retail competition and evaluate the degree, if any, to which a rule satisfying that axiom might incentivize the retailers to inflate their orders in case their original Nash equilibrium is not a multiple of $w$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "## Acknowledgements\n\nThe author has been financially supported by the Corporate Sponsored Research Program in Advanced Logistic Science at the Research Center for\n\nAdvanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo.

A rule strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for infinitely many $w$ \n\nIf we allow a pathological $W \\subseteq \\Delta$, we can have an infinite $W$ and a single rule that is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for all $w \\in W$ at once. The notion of bad pairs, which we used to derive the negative result earlier, turns out to be relevant.\n\nProposition Appendix A.1. Let $B$ be the binary relation on $\\Delta$ consisting of bad pairs. Recall the definition of the binary relation $D \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}^{N} \\times \\Delta$ right after Definition 3.1. Define $B^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\Delta \\times \\Delta$ as $\\left(w, w^{\\prime}\\right) \\in B^{\\prime}$ if and only if there exists $i \\in N$ with $w_{-i} \\| w_{-i}^{\\prime}$. The union $B \\cup B^{\\prime}$ is the composite of $D$ and $D^{-1}$.\n\nProof. That $B$ is included in the composite of $D$ and $D^{-1}$ follows from the proof of Lemma 4.7. It is easy to see that $B^{\\prime} \\subseteq D \\circ D^{-1}$. Conversely, suppose that $u^{i} D^{-1}(E, c) D u^{j}$, where $u^{i}, u^{j} \\in \\Delta$ and $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$. Suppose first that $i\\left(u^{i}, c\\right)=i\\left(u^{j}, c\\right)=: i$, where $i(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is as in the definition of $D$. Then, $u_{-i}^{i} \\| c_{-i} \\| u_{-i}^{j}$ by the definition of $D$, whence $\\left(u^{i}, u^{j}\\right) \\in B^{\\prime}$. Secondly, assume that $i\\left(u^{i}, c\\right)$ and $i\\left(u^{j}, c\\right)$ are distinct, which we let $i$ and $j$, respectively. We show that $\\left(u^{i}, u^{j}\\right)$ are bad. As before, $u_{-i}^{i} \\| c_{-i}$ and $c_{-j} \\| u_{-j}^{j}$, whence $u_{-i-j}^{i} \\| u_{-i-j}^{j}$. Furthermore,\n\n$$\nc_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(c, u^{k}\\right)<c_{k}\n$$\n\nfor both $k=i, j$, where the left-hand side is also as in the definition of $D$. Because $\\left(c_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(c, u^{k}\\right), c_{-k}\\right) \\| u^{k}(k=i, j)$, we have\n\n$$\nc_{k}^{\\prime}\\left(c, u^{k}\\right)=u_{k}^{k}\\left(\\sum c_{-i-j}\\right) /\\left(\\sum u_{-i-j}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nc_{k}=u_{k}^{k^{\\prime}}\\left(\\sum c_{-i-j}\\right) /\\left(\\sum u_{-i-j}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(k, k^{\\prime}\\right)=(i, j),(j, i)$. Combining equations (A.1-A.3), we obtain the defining inequalities for the badness of $\\left(u^{i}, u^{j}\\right)$.\n\nCorollary Appendix A.2. There exist an infinite set $W \\subseteq \\Delta$ and a rule $z$ such that $z$ is strategy-free ${ }^{w}$ for all $w \\in W$.\n\nProof. By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a maximal $\\left(B \\cup B^{\\prime}\\right)$-independent $W \\subseteq \\Delta$. That is, for every distinct pair $\\left\\{w, w^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq W$, exactly one of the weights is in $W$ if and only if they do not form a bad or $B^{\\prime}$-related pair. By construction, for each $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$, there exists exactly one $w \\in W$, for which we write $w(c)$, such that $((E, c), w) \\in D$. We may define a rule $z$ so for each $(E, c) \\in \\mathcal{C}^{N}$, the award $z(E, c)$ is the unique vector that is parallel to $w(c)$ and is identical to $c$ possibly except in one coordinate. It is evident that $z$ is strategy-free for all $w \\in W$ by construction.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 9, "text": "# References \n\nCho, S.H., Tang, C.S., 2014.
