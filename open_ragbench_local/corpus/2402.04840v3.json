In the high-privacy regime $(\\epsilon \\leq 1)$, we identify an optimal privacy mechanism that minimizes the variance of the estimator asymptotically. Our main technical contribution is the maximization of the Fisher-Information of the sanitized data with respect to the local privacy mechanism $Q$. We find that the exact solution $Q_{\\theta, s}$ of this maximization is the sign mechanism that applies randomized response to the sign of $X_{i}-\\theta$, where $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ are the confidential iid original samples. However, since this optimal local mechanism depends on the unknown mean $\\theta$, we employ a two-stage LDP parameter estimation procedure which requires splitting agents into two groups. The first $n_{1}$ observations are used to consistently but not necessarily efficiently estimate the parameter $\\theta$ by $\\hat{\\theta}_{n_{1}}$. Then this estimate is updated by applying the sign mechanism with $\\hat{\\theta}_{n_{1}}$ instead of $\\theta$ to the remaining $n-n_{1}$ observations, to obtain an LDP and efficient estimator of the unknown mean.",

      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nWe consider the problem of estimating the unknown mean of a unit variance normal distribution in a locally differentially private and statistically efficient way. In this scenario, we have $n$ agents or data-holders, each of which owns data $X_{i}$ sampled independently from the probability distribution $P_{\\theta}=N(\\theta, 1)$ which depends on the unknown mean parameter $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Denote the class of all those potential data generating distributions by $\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{\\theta}: \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$. We protect the privacy of the data owners by local differential\n\n[^0]privacy. This means that each agent generates a sanitized version $Z_{i}$ of their original data $X_{i}$ independently of everybody else by applying a privacy mechanism $Q$, which is a Markov kernel or a conditional distribution of $Z_{i}$ given $X_{i}=x$. In other words, $Q(A \\mid x)=P\\left(Z_{i} \\in A \\mid X_{i}=x\\right)$. From the privacy mechanism $Q$ we can generate random variates in some arbitrary space $\\mathcal{Z}$ endowed with a sigma algebra $\\mathcal{G}$. We say that $Q$ satisfies the $\\epsilon$-local differential privacy property if\n\n$$\nQ(A \\mid x) \\leq e^{\\epsilon} Q\\left(A \\mid x^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $x, x^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all events $A \\in \\mathcal{G}$. We denote by $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}=\\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}(\\mathbb{R})$ the set of all possible such privacy mechanisms taking inputs from $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nAfter each agent applied the privacy mechanism $Q$ we obtain iid samples $Z_{1}, \\ldots Z_{n}$ from the distribution $Q P_{\\theta}$, which formally is the probability measure obtained by integrating $Q$ with respect to $P_{\\theta}(d x)$. We can only use these samples to estimate the unknown parameter $\\theta$ and our goal is to do this with the smallest amount of estimation variance possible, that is, to estimate $\\theta$ in a statistically efficient way. Standard asymptotic theory (cf. van der Vaart, 2007, Chapter 8) shows that a maximum likelihood estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_{n}^{(m l e)}$ based on $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ achieves an asymptotic normal distribution\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{n}^{(m l e)}-\\theta\\right) \\xrightarrow[n \\rightarrow \\infty]{d} N\\left(0, I_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P})^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the inverse of the Fisher-Information\n\n$$\nI_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P}):=\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim Q P_{\\theta}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log Q P_{\\theta}(Z)}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nis the smallest variance achievable by regular estimators (van der Vaart, 2007, Theorem 8.8). Thus, to minimize asymptotic variance, we should solve the optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\max _{Q} I_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P}) \\quad \\text { subject to } \\quad Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}\n$$\n\nThis is a very challenging optimization problem because the set of Markov kernels $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$ is a huge, non-parametric set and we have to even search over all possible output spaces $(\\mathcal{Z}, \\mathcal{G})$ from which $Q$ can draw $Z_{i}$. Furthermore,\n\n\n[^0]:    Proceedings of the $28^{\\text {th }}$ International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025, Mai Khao, Thailand. PMLR: Volume 258. Copyright 2025 by the author(s).\n\nit turns out that for fixed output space $(\\mathcal{Z}, \\mathcal{G})$ the mapping $Q \\mapsto I_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P})$ is convex, but we are trying to maximize this objective function. Hence, we may be confronted with numerous local and global optima at the boundary of the feasible set $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$. Steinberger (2024) provided a numerical scheme for approximately solving (4) based on a linear program representation of Kairouz et al. (2016). However, the runtime of the linear program scales exponentially in the accuracy of approximation. Steinberger (2024) also showed that indeed, $\\left[\\sup _{Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}} I_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P})\\right]^{-1}$ is the smallest possible asymptotic variance among all (sequentially interactive) locally differentially private and regular estimators. Here, regular means that the scaled estimation error $\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{n}-\\theta_{n}\\right)$ converges in distribution to a limiting distribution along the sequence of true parameters $\\theta_{n}=\\theta+h / \\sqrt{n}$ for all $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and such that the limiting distribution does not depend on $h$ (see van der Vaart (2007, Section 8.5) and Theorem 2 below). Regularity is indeed necessary to establish the mentioned lower bound on the asymptotic variance. Without regularity one could still show that the lower bound holds at least for all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ outside of a Lebesgue null set (see van der Vaart (2007, Theorem 8.8) for the classical case and the discussion at the end of Section 3 in Steinberger (2024) for the locally private case), but certain pathologies may arise for irregular estimators (see Lehmann and Casella, 1998, Example 2.5 and Example 2.7). Fortunately, we can show in Theorem 2 below that our proposed locally private estimator is also regular and achieves the asymptotic lower bound.\nOur main contribution is to show that the following simple sign mechanism is an exact solution of (4) in the case where the privacy parameter $\\epsilon$ is sufficiently small: Given that $X_{i}=x$, we generate $Z_{i}$ by\n\n$$\nZ_{i}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\operatorname{sgn}(x-\\theta) \\text { with probability } p_{\\epsilon} \\\\\n-\\operatorname{sgn}(x-\\theta) \\text { with probability } 1-p_{\\epsilon}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{\\epsilon}:=\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{1+e^{\\epsilon}}$ and $\\operatorname{sgn}(0):=1$. In other words, for $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}=\\{-1,1\\}$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we set\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ_{\\theta, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}}(\\{z\\}|x): & =P\\left(Z_{i}=z \\mid X_{i}=x\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\np_{\\epsilon}, & \\text { if } z=\\operatorname{sgn}(x-\\theta) \\\\\n1-p_{\\epsilon}, & \\text { if } z \\neq \\operatorname{sgn}(x-\\theta)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotice that this mechanism can also be represented as a composition $Q_{\\theta, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}}=Q_{\\epsilon}^{R R} T_{\\theta}$, where $T_{\\theta}(x):=\\operatorname{sgn}(x-\\theta)$ and $Q_{\\epsilon}^{R R}$ is the randomized response mechanism of Warner (1965) that flips the sign of the input with probability $1-p_{\\epsilon}$. In particular, we easily conclude that $Q_{\\theta, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}} \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$. We can now state and prove the following result.\nTheorem 1. If $\\epsilon \\leq 1.04$ then\n\n$$\nI_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P}) \\leq I_{\\theta}\\left(Q_{\\theta, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}} \\mathcal{P}\\right)=\\frac{2\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)^{2}}{\\pi\\left(e^{\\epsilon}+1\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all $Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$. In particular, the sign mechanism solves (4).\n\nOur proof is based on the idea of quantizing the normal distribution and solving the problem of maximizing the private Fisher Information for discrete distributions simultaneously for all quantization levels. We apply results from Kairouz et al. (2016) and a delicate duality argument to solve the discrete case. The main steps of the proof are collected in Subsection 2.1.\n\nAn obvious issue with the sign mechanism in (6) is that it depends on the unknown parameter $\\theta$ which we want to estimate. By incorporating the sign mechanism into a twostage scheme as in Steinberger (2024) we end up with the following procedure for asymptotically efficient parameter estimation: Split the agents into two groups of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}:=n-n_{1}$ such that $\\lim \\frac{n_{1}}{n}=0$ and $n_{1}(n) \\rightarrow \\infty .^{1}$ Use the first group to get a consistent but not necessarily efficient estimate of the unknown mean $\\theta$ and the second group to update the first-stage estimate to make it asymptotically efficient. The two stages of the procedure are described below, where $\\theta_{0}$ is an arbitrary initial guess for the unknown mean $\\theta$.\n\n1.     - Apply the sign mechanism $Q_{\\theta_{0}, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}}$ at the initial value $\\theta_{0}$ to $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n_{1}}$ to obtain iid sanitized data $Z_{i} \\sim Q_{\\theta_{0}, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}} P_{\\theta}, i=1, \\ldots, n_{1}$.\n\n- Compute\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}=\\theta_{0}-\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1} \\bar{Z}_{n_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nif $\\left|\\bar{Z}_{n_{1}}\\right|<\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}$, otherwise $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}=\\theta_{0}$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and $\\bar{Z}_{n_{1}}=\\frac{1}{n_{1}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{1}} Z_{i}$.\n2.     - Apply the sign mechanism $Q_{\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{2}}, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}}$ at the first stage estimate $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}$ to the data $X_{n_{1}+1}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ in the second group to generate values $Z_{i} \\sim$ $Q_{\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}, \\epsilon}^{\\operatorname{sgn}} P_{\\theta}, i=n_{1}+1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n- Compute\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\theta}_{n}=\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}-\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1} \\bar{Z}_{n_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nif $\\left|\\bar{Z}_{n_{2}}\\right|<\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}$, otherwise $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n}=\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_{1}}$ where $\\bar{Z}_{n_{2}}=\\frac{1}{n_{2}} \\sum_{i=n_{1}+1}^{n} Z_{i}$.\n\nRelying on our main Theorem 1, we show that the above two-stage estimation procedure is regular and asymptotically achieves minimal variance. Let $R_{\\theta}$ denote the distribution of the full sanitized data $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ when the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ We parametrize $n_{1}=n_{1}(n)$ by $n$ such that all limits are understood as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\ntrue unknown mean of the $X_{i}$ is $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $R_{\\theta+h / \\sqrt{n}}$ is the distribution of the sanitized data when the true unknown mean of the $X_{i}$ is $\\theta_{n}:=\\theta+h / \\sqrt{n}$. Hence, on top of asymptotic normality with optimal asymptotic variance (i.e., the case $h=0$ ), the following result also establishes regularity of the locally private estimator sequence $\\hat{\\theta}_{n}$. Please refer to Appendix A. 1 for the proof.\nTheorem 2. If $\\epsilon \\leq 1.04$ then the two-stage locally private estimation procedure described above satisfies\n$\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{n}-\\theta-\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) \\xrightarrow[n \\rightarrow \\infty]{R_{\\theta+\\frac{h}{n}}} N\\left(0,\\left[\\sup _{Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{c}} I_{\\theta}(Q \\mathcal{P})\\right]^{-1}\\right)$,\nfor any value $\\theta_{0}, h$ and $n_{1}=o(n)$ such that $n_{1}(n) \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nNotice, however, that the two-stage estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_{n}$ for a finite $n$ depends on the choice of initial value $\\theta_{0}$ and on the size $n_{1}$ of the first group. Hence, $\\theta_{0}$ and $n_{1}$ are tuning parameters in our estimation procedure. In Section 3, we investigate the impact of $\\theta_{0}$ and $n_{1}$ on the performance of our locally private estimator in a finite sample simulation study.",

      "text": "### 1.1 Related Literature\n\nLocal differential privacy originated about 20 years ago (see Dinur and Nissim, 2003; Dwork and Nissim, 2004; Dwork et al., 2006; Dwork, 2008; Evfimievski et al., 2003) and has since become an incredibly popular way of data privacy protection when there is no trusted third party available. Despite its popularity, some of the most basic learning problems, such as the one considered here, have not been fully solved under LDP. Much attention has recently been paid to discrete distribution estimation and deriving upper bounds on the estimation error. For instance, Wang et al. (2016) have suggested an optimal mechanism for mutual information maximization for discrete distributions under LDP. Ye and Barg (2018) are studying the locally private minimax risk for discrete distributions. Nam and Lee (2022) is perhaps closer to our work. They consider the problem of maximizing a Fisher-Information in the local privacy mechanism, but they restrict to the 1-bit communication constraint which, for our purpose, is an oversimplified case. Barnes et al. (2020) also investigate and bound Fisher-Information when original data are perturbed using a differentially private randomization mechanism. But they have not attempted to find an optimal randomization mechanism or an efficient estimation procedure. Gaussian mean estimation is considered by Joseph et al. (2019) and they also use a two-stage procedure for parameter estimation. They obtain high-probability bounds for the estimation error, which is of order $n^{-1 / 2}$ for the two-stage protocol, but unlike our work, they do not obtain the optimal asymptotic constant. Duchi and Rogers (2019) proposed a one-stage algorithm for Gaussian mean estimation, which resembles\nour first-stage estimator. While their method can outperform a two-stage protocol, this advantage holds primarily when the initial guess $\\theta_{0}$ is close to the true parameter $\\theta$ and the sample size is relatively small. Asi et al. (2022) introduced the PrivUnitG algorithm, designed specifically for high-dimensional problems where the data resides on the unit sphere. While their method is effective in these settings, it is worth noting that for one-dimensional data, where the values are $\\pm 1$, their approach differs from the randomized response, which is provably optimal for this problem. Consequently, their method is inefficient for onedimensional cases. Building on these insights, Asi et al. (2023) developed the ProjUnit framework, which further optimizes mean estimation by projecting data into lowerdimensional subspaces before applying an optimal randomizer. A recent work by Liu et al. (2023) introduced a continual, gradient-like procedure to iteratively refine the estimate of $\\theta$. They have shown that the procedure achieves a variance that is optimal among binary mechanisms. However, we will show that this variance is asymptotically optimal among all LDP mechanisms.\n\nThe conceptual foundation to the problem of finding the optimal Fisher-Information mechanism was laid by Steinberger (2024). However, while in that work the optimal mechanism and locally private estimation procedure have to be approximated by a computationally expensive numerical optimization routine, we here derive an exact and simple closed-form privacy mechanism and estimator.",

For an even positive integer $k$ and for $j=$\n\n$1, \\ldots, k-1$, let $B_{j}:=\\left(x_{j-1}, x_{j}\\right]$ and $B_{k}:=\\left(x_{k-1}, \\infty\\right)$, where $x_{j}:=\\Phi^{-1}(j / k)$ and $\\Phi$ is the cdf of the standard normal distribution.

Notice that $T_{k, \\theta}$ maps the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ into the discrete set $[k]:=\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, hence, it is called a quantizer.

From Kairouz et al. (2016, Theorem 2) we know that an optimal mechanism $Q^{*}$ has at most $k$ non-zero rows.

By weak duality, any feasible value of the dual provides an upper bound on the objective function of the primal problem. Hence, the challenge is to identify a feasible value of the dual that achieves an objective function equal to $I_{\\theta}\\left(Q_{\\theta, \\epsilon}^{\\text {ign }} \\mathcal{P}\\right)$. The dual program reads as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\min _{\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}} & \\widetilde{I}^{T} \\beta \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & \\left(S^{(k)}\\right)^{T} \\beta \\geq \\vec{\\mu}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}:=\\left(\\mu_{j}\\right)_{j=1}^{2^{k}}:=\\left(\\mu\\left(S_{. j}^{(k)}\\right)\\right)_{j=1}^{2^{k}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{k}}$. The proof of Theorem 1 is finished if we can identify a feasible point $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ of (16) satisfying $\\widetilde{I}^{T} \\beta=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_{j}=\\frac{2}{\\pi} t_{\\epsilon}^{2}$, where $t_{\\epsilon}:=\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}$. Our guess for such a $\\beta^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ is\n\n$$\n\\beta_{j}^{*}:=-\\frac{2 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi k}+\\left|y_{j}\\right| t_{\\epsilon}^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nThis clearly satisfies $\\widetilde{I}^{T} \\beta^{*}=\\frac{2}{\\pi} t_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. It is the main technical challenge of the proof to show that $\\beta^{*}$ is a feasible point of (16).\n\nFor fixed $j \\in\\left[2^{k}\\right]$, we have to verify $\\left(S_{. j}^{(k)}\\right)^{T} \\beta^{*} \\geq \\mu\\left(S_{. j}^{(k)}\\right)$. It will be convenient to partition the index set $[k]$ as follows $[k]=I_{1}^{0} \\cup I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{0} \\cup I_{1}^{1} \\cup I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}$ where $I_{1}^{0}=\\left\\{i \\mid i \\leq \\frac{k}{2}, S_{i, j}^{(k)}=1\\right\\}$,\n$I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{0}=\\left\\{i \\mid i \\leq \\frac{k}{2}, S_{i, j}^{(k)}=e^{\\epsilon}\\right\\}$ and $I_{1}^{1}, I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}$ defined similarly for the second half of indices $i=\\frac{k}{2}+1, \\ldots, k$. Then we can rewrite the required inequality $\\left(S_{. j}^{(k)}\\right)^{T} \\beta^{*} \\geq \\mu\\left(S_{. j}^{(k)}\\right)$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*} \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{1}} y_{i}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} y_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{1}} y_{i}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} y_{i}\\right)^{2}}{\\frac{1}{k}\\left(\\left|I_{1}^{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}^{1}\\right|+e^{\\epsilon}\\left|I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{0}\\right|+e^{\\epsilon}\\left|I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}\\right|\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor convenience let us denote $m_{1}=\\left|I_{1}^{0}\\right|, m_{2}=\\left|I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}\\right|, a_{1}=$ $\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{0}}\\left|y_{i}\\right|, a_{2}=\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}}\\left|y_{i}\\right|$ such that $m_{1}, m_{2} \\leq \\frac{k}{2}$ and $a_{1}, a_{2} \\in[0,1]$. With this new notation, we can rewrite the sum on the left-hand-side as\n$\\left(1-e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right) \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i=1}^{k / 2} \\beta_{i}^{*}+\\sum_{i=k / 2+1}^{k} \\beta_{i}^{*}$\nand the ratio on the right-hand-side as\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} a_{1}+\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} a_{2}-\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\right)^{2}}{\\frac{1}{k}\\left(k / 2+m_{1}-m_{2}+e^{\\epsilon}\\left(k / 2+m_{2}-m_{1}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $\\beta^{*}$ we simplify the expression in (18) to obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(1-e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\sum_{i \\in I_{1}^{0}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right) \\sum_{i \\in I_{e^{\\epsilon}}^{1}} \\beta_{i}^{*}+e^{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i=1}^{k / 2} \\beta_{i}^{*}+\\sum_{i=k / 2+1}^{k} \\beta_{i}^{*} \\\\\n& =\\left(1-e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\frac{2 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi}\\left(-\\frac{m_{1}}{k}+a_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\quad+\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right) \\frac{2 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi}\\left(-\\frac{m_{2}}{k}+a_{2}\\right)+\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\frac{t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi} \\\\\n& =\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right) \\frac{2 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi}\\left[\\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{k}+a_{2}-a_{1}\\right]+\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\frac{t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNext, we simplify (19) to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} a_{1}+\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} a_{2}-\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\right)^{2}}{\\frac{1}{k}\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+m_{1}-m_{2}+e^{\\epsilon}\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+m_{2}-m_{1}\\right)\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}-1\\right)^{2}\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)^{2}}{\\frac{2 \\pi}{k}\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right)+\\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\\right)\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}-1\\right)^{2}\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)^{2}}{\\pi\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1+2 t_{e} \\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{k}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAfter these simplifications, we see that the inequality we need to verify is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right) \\frac{2 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi}\\left[\\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{k}+a_{2}-a_{1}\\right]+\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right) \\frac{t_{\\epsilon}^{2}}{\\pi} \\\\\n& \\quad \\geq \\frac{\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}-1\\right)^{2}\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)^{2}}{\\pi\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1+2 t_{\\epsilon} \\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{k}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDividing by $\\left(1+e^{\\epsilon}\\right) t_{\\epsilon}^{2} / \\pi$, this can be further simplified to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{L}\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\frac{m_{1}}{k}, \\frac{m_{2}}{k}\\right):=\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right)\\left[2 t_{\\epsilon}+4 t_{\\epsilon}^{2} \\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{k}\\right] \\\\\n& \\quad-4 t_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\left(\\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{k}\\right)^{2}-\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}-1\\right)^{2}+1 \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume $a_{1}+a_{2} \\leq 1$; otherwise, we could have chosen $a_{1}=\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i \\in I_{i}^{\\prime}}\\left|y_{i}\\right|$ and $a_{2}=\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i \\in I_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}}\\left|y_{i}\\right|$, maintaining the same inequality due to the symmetry of $\\beta_{\\epsilon}^{*}=\\beta_{k+1-i}^{*}$ and antisymmetry in $y_{i}=$ $-y_{k+1-i}$, but with the sum $a_{1}+a_{2} \\leq 1$, because the total sum equals $\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left|y_{i}\\right|=2$. Given this, we can prove the inequality $\\mathcal{L}\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\frac{m_{1}}{k}, \\frac{m_{2}}{k}\\right) \\geq 0$ using the following four lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. For any $k$, the sequence $y_{j}=\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}((j-\\right.$ $1) / k))-\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(j / k)\\right), j=1, \\ldots, k$, is increasing.\n\nProof. For $x \\in(1, k]$, define $g(x):=\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}((x-1) / k)\\right)-$ $\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(x / k)\\right)$ and $g(1):=-\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(1 / k)\\right.$. Since $g$ is continuous on $[1, k]$, it suffices to show that $g$ is strictly increasing on $(1, k)$. Using the fact that $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=(-x) \\phi(x)$ and the inverse function theorem we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng^{\\prime}(x) & =\\frac{1}{k}\\left(\\frac{\\phi^{\\prime}}{\\phi} \\circ \\Phi^{-1}((x-1) / k)-\\frac{\\phi^{\\prime}}{\\phi} \\circ \\Phi^{-1}(x / k)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{k}\\left(\\Phi^{-1}(x / k)-\\Phi^{-1}((x-1) / k)\\right)>0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $g$ is strictly increasing on $(1, k)$.\nLemma 2. For $x \\in\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$ we have\n\n$$\n\\phi(0)-\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+x\\right)\\right) \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} x^{2}\n$$\n\nProof. For $x \\in\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$, define $g(x):=\\phi(0)-$ $\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+x\\right)\\right)-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} x^{2}$ then $g(0)=0, g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=+\\infty$. Since $g$ is continuous on $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$, it suffices to show that $g$ is strictly increasing on $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Using the fact that $\\phi^{\\prime}(x)=$ $(-x) \\phi(x)$ and the inverse function theorem we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng^{\\prime}(x) & =-\\frac{\\phi^{\\prime}}{\\phi} \\circ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+x\\right)-\\sqrt{2 \\pi} x \\\\\n& =\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+x\\right)-\\sqrt{2 \\pi} x \\\\\ng^{\\prime \\prime}(x) & =\\frac{1}{\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+x\\right)\\right)}-\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the first derivative is equal to zero at zero and nondecreasing, we see that the function $g$ itself must be nondecreasing.\n\nBy combining these two lemmas, we can easily show\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{2} & =\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i \\in I_{i}^{\\prime}} y_{i} \\geq \\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sum_{i=k / 2+1}^{k / 2+m_{2}} y_{i} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\left(\\phi(0)-\\phi\\left(\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{m_{2}}{k}\\right)\\right)\\right) \\geq \\pi \\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{k^{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA similar lower bound holds for $a_{1}$ as well, namely $a_{1} \\geq$ $\\pi \\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{k^{2}}$. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove the inequality (20) under restrictions that $a_{1}+a_{2} \\leq 1, \\quad a_{1} \\geq \\pi \\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{k^{2}}$, $a_{2} \\geq \\pi \\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{k^{2}}$, and $m_{1}, m_{2} \\leq \\frac{k}{2}$. Consider the derivative of $\\mathcal{L}\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\frac{m_{1}}{k}, \\frac{m_{2}}{k}\\right)$ with respect to $a_{2}$,\n\n$$\n2 t_{\\epsilon}\\left(1+2 t_{\\epsilon} \\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{k}\\right)+2\\left(1-\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\\right)\\right) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nIt is non-negative, therefore $\\mathcal{L}\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\frac{m_{1}}{k}, \\frac{m_{2}}{k}\\right)$ is an increasing function of $a_{2}$ reaching its minimum at $a_{2}=$ $\\pi \\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{k^{2}}$. For $a_{1}$, we have a concave quadratic function that should reach minimum at one of the boundaries, which are $a_{1}=\\pi \\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{k^{2}}$ and $a_{1}=1-a_{2}=1-\\pi \\frac{m_{2}^{2}}{k^{2}}$. Unfortunately, the minimum could occur at either point depending on the configuration. Therefore, we should consider two cases, which we formulate as the following lemmas, denoting $\\frac{m_{1}}{k}=x$ and $\\frac{m_{2}}{k}=y$.\nLemma 3. For $0 \\leq x, y \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\pi x^{2}+\\pi y^{2} \\leq 1$ for the parameter $0<t_{\\epsilon} \\leq \\frac{4 \\pi}{1+\\theta \\pi} \\approx 0.4808$ we have the following inequality:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(1-\\pi y^{2}, \\pi y^{2}, x, y\\right) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nLemma 4. For $0 \\leq x, y \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\pi x^{2}+\\pi y^{2} \\leq 1$ for the parameter $0<t_{\\epsilon} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ we have the following inequality:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\pi x^{2}, \\pi y^{2}, x, y\\right) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nCombining these we conclude that for $t_{\\epsilon} \\leq \\frac{4 \\pi}{1+\\theta \\pi}$ the statement of Theorem 1 holds. But this condition is satisfied for all $\\epsilon \\leq \\log \\left(\\frac{1+12 \\pi}{1+4 \\pi}\\right) \\approx 1.04822$, which concludes the proof.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Left panel: Scaled MSE of the private estimator as a function of the number $n_{1}$ of first-stage samples.

      "text": "### 2.2 One-Stage Variance\n\nIn this subsection, we address the limitations of using a single-stage procedure. The asymptotic variance of an estimator based on only one stage as in (8) with $n_{1}=n$ can be expressed by the following formula:\n$\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1}{\\phi\\left(\\theta-\\theta_{0}\\right)^{2}}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}\\right)^{2}\\left(1-2 \\Phi\\left(\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right)$.\nThis expression resembles the optimal asymptotic variance derived in Theorem 1 when $\\theta_{0} \\approx \\theta$. A crucial observation is that for single-stage estimation, the asymptotic variance deteriorates exponentially as $\\left|\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right|$ increases. This motivates the introduction of a two-stage procedure.\n\nProof. The estimator from the first stage, as described in (8), is updated according to the following formula. We assume that all $n$ samples are used for this estimate, that is, we calculate the asymptotic variance of\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\theta}_{n}=\\theta_{0}-\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1} \\bar{Z}_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\bar{Z}_{n}=\\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_{i}$, where $Z_{1}, \\ldots, Z_{n}$ are iid random variables taking values in $\\{-1,1\\}$ according to (5) and $X_{i} \\sim N(\\theta, 1)$. To calculate the asymptotic variance of $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n}=f\\left(\\bar{Z}_{n}\\right)$ with $f(x):=\\theta_{0}-\\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1} x\\right)$, we apply the delta method,\n$\\sqrt{n}\\left(f\\left(\\bar{Z}_{n}\\right)-f\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)\\right) \\frac{D}{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\right) N\\left(0,\\left[f^{\\prime}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)\\right)$.\nThus, we need the expectation and variance of $Z_{1}$, which are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)=\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}\\left(1-2 \\Phi\\left(\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Var}\\left(Z_{1}\\right)=1-\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}\\right)^{2}\\left(1-2 \\Phi\\left(\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right)\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince the inverse function theorem gives $f^{\\prime}(x)=$ $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1}\\left(\\phi \\circ \\Phi^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1} x\\right)\\right)^{-1} \\quad$ and we have $f\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_{1}\\right]\\right)=\\theta$, the asymptotic variance of $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n}$ is given by $\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}+1}{e^{\\epsilon}-1}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1}{\\phi\\left(\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right)^{2}}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{e^{\\epsilon}-1}{e^{\\epsilon}+1}\\right)^{2}\\left(1-2 \\Phi\\left(\\theta_{0}-\\theta\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right)$, which concludes the proof.",

      "text": "### 2.3 General variance\n\nIn this subsection, we describe how our efficient method for mean estimation can be adjusted to the case of a general, but known, variance. Consider original sensitive data $X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}$ that are independently and identically distributed as $P_{\\theta, \\sigma^{2}}=N\\left(\\theta, \\sigma^{2}\\right)$ with a known variance $\\sigma^{2}>0$. Hence, in this subsection, the statistical model is given by $\\mathcal{P}_{\\sigma^{2}}=\\left\\{N\\left(\\theta, \\sigma^{2}\\right): \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$. The only conceptual challenge is to determine a lower bound on the asymptotic variance of any locally private method. Let\n\n$$\nI_{\\theta}\\left(Q \\mathcal{P}_{\\sigma^{2}}\\right):=\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim Q P_{\\theta, \\sigma^{2}}}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\log Q P_{\\theta, \\sigma^{2}}(Z)}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\ndenote the information about $\\theta$ contained in the $Q$-sanitized data when $\\sigma^{2}$ is fixed. In particular, with our previous notation we have $\\mathcal{P}_{1}=\\mathcal{P}$. The following result extends Theorem 1 to the case of general $\\sigma^{2}>0$.\nTheorem 3. For $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\sigma^{2}>0, \\epsilon>0$ and $Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$ we have\n\n$$\nI_{\\theta}\\left(Q \\mathcal{P}_{\\sigma^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}} I_{\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}}\\left(Q_{\\sigma} \\mathcal{P}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some mechanism $Q_{\\sigma} \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$ that depends only on $\\sigma$. In particular, by Theorem 1, if $\\epsilon \\leq 1.04$, it holds that\n\n$$\nI_{\\theta}\\left(Q \\mathcal{P}_{\\sigma}\\right) \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}} I_{\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}}\\left(Q_{\\frac{\\sigma}{2}, \\epsilon}^{q g} \\mathcal{P}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma^{2}} \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{\\left(e^{\\epsilon}-1\\right)^{2}}{\\pi\\left(e^{\\epsilon}+1\\right)^{2}}\n$$\n\nfor all $Q \\in \\mathcal{Q}_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nIn accordance with standard statistical intuition, Theorem 3 now shows that for general known $\\sigma^{2}>0$ we should rescale the original data $X_{i} / \\sigma \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\sigma}, 1\\right)$, estimate the ratio $\\frac{\\theta}{\\sigma}$ using the two-stage procedure in (8) and (9) based on the sign-mechanism and then scale back by $\\sigma$ to achieve the optimal variance given by the inverse of the upper bound in (24). It is then clear that this final rescaling by the true $\\sigma$ amounts exactly to the additional factor $\\sigma^{2}$ in the asymptotic variance (cf. (24)).\nIf the variance $\\sigma^{2}$ is actually unknown and has to be estimated from appropriately sanitized data, things become much more involved. Estimating the vector $\\left(\\theta, \\sigma^{2}\\right)$ efficiently appears to be an ill-posed problem under local differential privacy in the sense that there is no maximizing element $Q$ in the partial Loewner ordering of semidefinite matrices which maximizes the $2 \\times 2$ Fisher-Information matrix $I_{\\theta, \\sigma^{2}}\\left(Q \\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\\right), \\mathcal{P}^{(2)}:=\\left\\{N\\left(\\theta, \\sigma^{2}\\right): \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\sigma^{2}>0\\right\\}$. Intuitively, this can be understood by noticing that in order to estimate both $\\theta$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ we would have to extract two different features of each sensitive $X_{i}$ in a locally private way and we have to make a decision on how to distribute the privacy budget $\\epsilon$ over these two tasks, while for estimation of a single parameter, we can use the full privacy budget on that one. Even if $\\sigma^{2}$ is only considered to be a nuisance parameter and the goal is still an efficient estimation of $\\theta$, it is currently not clear what the appropriate lower bound for the asymptotic variance and an efficient procedure would look like. We defer these important and fundamental issues to future research.\n\nWe close this discussion by mentioning that for general unknown $\\sigma^{2}>0$ our first stage estimator (8) is not even consistent for $\\theta$. However, consistent locally private, yet inefficient, estimators for both $\\theta$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ can be constructed using the method of moments and clipping as explained, for instance, in Theorem 4.3 of Steinberger (2024).",

      "text": "## 3 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we provide numerical experiments to investigate the finite sample performance of our two-stage locally private estimation procedure described in (8) and (9) in dependence on the tuning parameters $\\theta_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $n_{1} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, for different sample sizes $n$ and $\\epsilon=1$. For the plots, we generated 50000 Montecarlo samples and computed the $95 \\%$ confidence intervals via bootstrapping. In the left panel of Figure 1, we plot the scaled mean squared error (MSE) of $\\hat{\\theta}_{n}$ as a function of the number $n_{1}$ of samples in the first stage of our private estimation procedure. From the plots, we see that a proper choice of $n_{1}$ is crucial to get a small MSE. Especially too small values of $n_{1}$ must be avoided.\n\nIn the right panel of Figure 1, we plot the scaled MSE as a function of the difference $\\theta_{0}-\\theta$, where $n_{1}$ was chosen\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The plot compares the performance of our enhanced 3-stage mechanism with the original mechanism from Joseph et al. (2019), including a tuned version in which we adjusted the number of samples allocated to the first stage. Additionally, it is compared with Liu et al. (2023), which has been enhanced by a preliminary stage from Joseph et al. (2019). The horizontal lines represent the theoretical variance limits for each mechanism.\nsuch that the corresponding MSE function in the left panel is minimized. The results are not surprising. The MSE increases as the initial guess $\\theta_{0}$ moves away from the true value $\\theta$. Notice that our results do not provide uniform convergence in $\\theta$, and in fact it is known that with differential privacy it is impossible to achieve uniformity over an unbounded parameter space.",

      "text": "### 3.1 3-Stage Mechanism\n\nEstimating the true mean $\\theta$ for large initial differences $\\left|\\theta-\\theta_{0}\\right|$ is challenging for our two-stage mechanism. To enhance performance, we incorporate the first stage of the mechanism from Joseph et al. (2019), which estimates $\\theta$ bitwise with high probability, provided an upper bound on the number of bits to estimate. In their approach, the same sign mechanism is used for the second stage. However, our theory predicts that splitting the data equally between these stages is suboptimal. Even when tuned with a better choice of steps allocated to the first stage, their mechanism remains suboptimal because the first stage fails to consistently estimate $\\theta$.\n\nWe provide additional results of a 3-stage mechanism in Figure 2, with $\\theta=84.5$, under the assumption that the unknown $\\theta$ is in the range $[0,128]$. With varying sample sizes $n$, we observe that the MSE converges to the optimal value for our 3-stage procedure. Specifically, we allocate $n_{0}=15,000$ samples to the preliminary stage based on Joseph et al. (2019), which we find to be close to optimal\n\nfor estimating the first 7 bits of $\\theta$. We also provide the theoretical limits for the 2 -stage mechanisms based on the formula (2.2) We optimized over the choice of $n_{1}$ for the 3 -stage mechanism and found that for values of $n$ ranging from 30,000 to 200,000 , the optimal $n_{1}$ initially grows from 400 to 700 before almost saturating around 700 . We conjecture that as $n$ continues to grow, $n_{1}$ might increase logarithmically; however, we lack the theoretical understanding to confirm this. We also compare our approach with the method of Liu et al. (2023), enhanced by the preliminary stage of Joseph et al. (2019). Our results show that for large $n$, their method performs almost identically to ours, while for smaller $n$, it may perform slightly worse. The method of Liu et al. (2023) has been proven to achieve a variance that we have shown to be asymptotically optimal. We illustrate its performance in Figure 2 as well.\n\nOur results show that the 3 -stage mechanism allows us to estimate $\\theta$ asymptotically optimally across a broader range of $\\theta$ for a finite $n$.",

      "text": "## 4 Discussion\n\nThis study addressed the problem of estimating the unknown mean $\\theta$ of a unit variance Gaussian distribution under local differential privacy (LDP). We proved that the sign mechanism, which computes the sign of the difference $X_{i}-\\theta$ and applies randomized response, has the lowest asymptotic variance among all locally differentially private mechanisms in the high-privacy regime $(\\epsilon \\leq 1.04)$. However, this mechanism is purely theoretical since it requires knowledge of $\\theta$, which we are trying to estimate. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage mechanism that allows for the estimation of $\\theta$ without any assumptions. For practical considerations, we enhanced our mechanism with an additional pre-step from Joseph et al. (2019) to provide a better initial guess for $\\theta$, enabling a good private estimate over a wide range of $\\theta$ with a finite sample size $n$.\nHowever, extending our theoretical approach to more complex scenarios presents challenges. For $\\epsilon \\geq 2$, the binary mechanism becomes provably suboptimal, as evidenced by the Fisher Information, which converges to $\\frac{2}{5}$ as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow \\infty$, rather than to 1 , which is the Fisher Information in classical (non-private) estimation. Identifying exact bounds or closed form expressions of optimal mechanisms for larger $\\epsilon$ remains an open question. Additionally, extending our method to the multidimensional case is difficult, as optimizing the inverse Fisher Information matrix is ill-posed. The current theoretical framework also does not apply to minimizing the sum of variances in this context. Future research will need to develop new approaches to address these challenges and fully characterize optimal LDP mechanisms in more complex settings.",

In the high-privacy regime ($\\epsilon\\le 1$), we identify an optimal\nprivacy mechanism that minimizes the variance of the estimator asymptotically.\nOur main technical contribution is the maximization of the Fisher-Information\nof the sanitized data with respect to the local privacy mechanism $Q$. We find\nthat the exact solution $Q_{\\theta,\\epsilon}$ of this maximization is the sign\nmechanism that applies randomized response to the sign of $X_i-\\theta$, where\n$X_1,\\dots, X_n$ are the confidential iid original samples. However, since this\noptimal local mechanism depends on the unknown mean $\\theta$, we employ a\ntwo-stage LDP parameter estimation procedure which requires splitting agents\ninto two groups. The first $n_1$ observations are used to consistently but not\nnecessarily efficiently estimate the parameter $\\theta$ by\n$\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_1}$. Then this estimate is updated by applying the sign\nmechanism with $\\tilde{\\theta}_{n_1}$ instead of $\\theta$ to the remaining\n$n-n_1$ observations, to obtain an LDP and efficient estimator of the unknown\nmean.",
