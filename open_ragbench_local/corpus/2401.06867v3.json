Due to the Calabi-Yau Theorem [34] these are precisely the compact manifolds that admit Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metrics. Later, Cao [6] used the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow to prove the Calabi-Yau theorem which shows global existence and convergence to a Ricci-flat metric with arbitrary initial data. In recent years, these profound results have been extended to a more general settings in complex geometry. Given a Hermitian manifold $(M, g, J)$ with the K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$, we say that the metric is pluriclosed if\n\n$$\nd d^{c} \\omega=0\n$$\n\nThis is a natural generalization of the K\u00e4hler condition $d \\omega=0$. In fact, pluriclosed metrics exist on all compact complex surfaces [11]. The pluriclosed metrics are studied in the theory of non-K\u00e4hler manifolds and in the physics of supersymmetry. In the following, we focus on the Bismut connection ([4])\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{B}=\\nabla+\\frac{1}{2} g^{-1} H\n$$\n\nwhere $H=-d^{c} \\omega$ and $\\nabla$ denotes the Levi-Civita connection. To generalize the Ricci form, we then define\n\n$$\n\\rho_{B}=\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{tr} R^{B} J \\in \\Lambda^{2}(M)\n$$\n\nwhich determines a representative of $2 \\pi c_{1}(M)$. We say that a pluriclosed metric is Bismut Hermitian-Einstein if\n\n$$\n\\rho_{B}=0\n$$\n\nIn fact, as shown in [10] Proposition 8.10,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho_{B}^{1,1}(\\cdot, J \\cdot) & =\\operatorname{Rc}-\\frac{1}{4} H^{2}+L_{g t} g \\\\\n\\rho_{B}^{2,0+0,2}(\\cdot, J \\cdot) & =-\\frac{1}{2} d^{*} H+\\frac{1}{2} d^{B} \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the Lee form given by $\\theta=-d^{*} \\omega \\circ J, d^{B}$ is the exterior derivative with respect to the Bismut connection $\\nabla^{B}$ and $H^{2}(X, Y)=\\left\\langle\\iota_{X} H, \\iota_{Y} H\\right\\rangle$. One may view the equation $\\rho_{B}=0$ as a generalization of the Calabi-Yau condition to non-K\u00e4hler, pluriclosed manifolds.\n\nNext, we consider the Einstein-Hilbert functional (also known as the total scalar curvature functional, see [3] for detail)\n\n$$\nS(g)=\\int_{M} R(g) d V_{g}\n$$\n\nIt is well known that the Einstein metrics are critical points of the Einstein-Hilbert functional restricted to the space of Riemannian metrics with total volume 1. ([16]). Define the generalized Einstein-Hilbert functional $\\mathcal{F}$, a generalization of Perelman's functional [21], which is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{F}: \\quad & \\Gamma\\left(S^{2} M\\right) \\times \\Omega^{2} \\times C^{\\infty}(M) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\\\\n& (g, b, f) \\longmapsto \\int_{M}\\left(R-\\frac{1}{12}\\left|H_{0}+d b\\right|^{2}+|\\nabla f|^{2}\\right) e^{-f} d V_{g}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand write\n\n$$\n\\lambda(g, b):=\\inf \\left\\{\\mathcal{F}(g, b, f) \\mid f \\in C^{\\infty}(M), \\int_{M} e^{-f} d V_{g}=1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{0}$ is a fixed closed 3-form ([20]). Critical points of the generalized Einstein-Hilbert functional are steady generalized Ricci solitons (c.f Definition 2.11) and they satisfy\n\n$$\n0=\\operatorname{Rc}-\\frac{1}{4} H^{2}+\\nabla^{2} f, \\quad 0=d_{g}^{*} H+i \\nabla_{f} H\n$$\n\nThese match the equations of motion in compactifications of type II supergravity [5]. In the following, we focus on pluriclosed steady solitons which are pluriclosed metrics satisfying the generalized Ricci soliton equations (1). Furthermore, one can also see that any compact Bismut Hermitian-Einstein metric must be a pluriclosed steady soliton (See [9] Proposition 2.6). However, the converse statement is false (c.f Example 2.13). It is interesting to ask whether Bismut Hermitian-Einstein metrics and generalized Einstein metrics are equivalent or not (c.f Definition 2.11). Until now, we still do not know the answer to the problem, but in the 4-dimensional case, we can prove that Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein metrics are definitely generalized Einstein metrics. In fact, they are not only generalized Einstein metrics, but they are also Bismut-flat (See [10] Theorem 8.26).\n\nIn this work, we discuss the stability of pluriclosed steady solitons. As shown in [13], Hall and Murphy proved that a K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton with $\\operatorname{dim} H^{(1,1)}(M) \\geq 2$ is linearly unstable. However, in [33], Tian and Zhu showed that the second variation of Perelman's entropy on K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold $(M, g)$ is non-positive in the space of K\u00e4hler metrics with K\u00e4hler classes cohomologous to $2 \\pi c_{1}(M)$ (Notice that complex structures on $M$ may vary). We then see that K\u00e4hler Ricci solitons may not be linearly stable in general but they are stable under some situations. Later, Hall and Murphy generalized Tian and Zhu's result and conjectured that the second variation of Perelman's entropy on shrinking K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton is non-positive in [12].\n\nIn our case, let $(M, g, H, J, f)$ be a pluriclosed steady soliton with a closed 3 -form $H=-d^{c} \\omega$. Consider a family $\\left(M, g_{t}, H_{t}, J_{t}, f_{t}\\right)$ with\n\n$$\nH_{t}=H_{0}+d b_{t}, \\quad\\left(M, g_{0}, H_{0}, J_{0}, b_{0}\\right)=(M, g, H, J, 0)\n$$\n\nand $f_{t}$ is the minimizer of $\\lambda\\left(g_{t}, b_{t}\\right)$. Denote\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} g=h,\\left.\\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} b=\\beta,\\left.\\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} \\omega=\\phi,\\left.\\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t=0} J=I\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is an infinitesimal variation of complex structure. Since $\\lambda$ is diffeomorphism invariant, we may take our general variation $\\gamma=h-\\beta \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\widetilde{\\operatorname{div}}_{f}$ (See (7) for the definition of $\\widetilde{\\operatorname{div}}$ ). Our goal is to study the general variation $\\gamma$ in the pluriclosed setting. Incorporating information on the deformation of complex structure [3, 16], we are able to precisely analyze $\\gamma$. More precisely, we derive the following proposition.\n\nProposition 1.1. Let $(M, g, H, J, f)$ be a pluriclosed steady soliton with a closed 3-form $H=-d^{c} \\omega$. For any $\\gamma \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\widetilde{\\operatorname{div}}_{f}$, there exists a 2-form $\\xi$ with $\\left(d_{f}^{B}\\right)^{*} \\xi=0$ and a symmetric 2-tensor $\\eta$ with $\\operatorname{div}_{f}^{B} \\eta=0$, satisfying (31) such that\n\n$$\n\\gamma(X, Y)=\\xi(X, J Y)+\\eta(X, Y)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{div}_{f}^{B}$ is the divergence operator and $\\left(d_{f}^{B}\\right)^{*}$ is the formal adjoint of $d^{B}$ with respect to the Bismut connection (15). Moreover, the pair $(\\xi, \\eta)$ is unique.\n\nBased on the proper decomposition of variation, we further compute the second variation at $\\gamma$. Recall that in [19] Theorem 1.1, the second variation is given by the operator $\\overline{\\mathcal{L}}_{f}(\\gamma)=\\frac{1}{2} \\overline{\\triangle}_{f} \\gamma+\\bar{R}^{+}(\\gamma)$ where $\\overline{\\triangle}_{f}$ is defined in (9) and $R^{+}$is the Bismut curvature given in Proposition 2.3. For $\\xi$-part, we reduce $\\bar{\\triangle}$ to the Hodge Laplacian $\\triangle_{d}^{R}$ with respect to the Bismut connection. For $\\eta$-part, we apply the properties of infinitesimal complex structure to simplify the operator $\\overline{\\mathcal{L}}_{f}$. Our result is given by\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let $(M, g, H, J, f)$ be a compact pluriclosed steady soliton and $\\gamma \\in \\operatorname{ker} \\overline{\\operatorname{div}}_{f}$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\\right|_{t=0} \\lambda(\\gamma)=-2\\left\\|d_{f}^{*} \\xi\\right\\|_{f}^{2}-\\frac{1}{6}\\|d \\xi-C\\|_{f}^{2}+\\int_{M}|\\eta|^{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} S_{B}+\\mathcal{L}_{V} f\\right) e^{-f} d V_{g}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma=\\xi \\circ J+\\eta$ is the decomposition given in (32), $C$ is defined in (34), $\\|\\cdot\\|_{f}$ denotes the norm of $f$-twisted $L^{2}$ inner product (4), $S_{B}=\\operatorname{tr}_{\\omega} \\rho_{B}$ denotes the Bismut scalar curvature and the vector field $V=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\theta^{\\sharp}-\\nabla f\\right)$. In particular, when $(M, g, H, J, f)$ is a Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein manifold,\n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\\right|_{t=0} \\lambda(\\gamma)=-2\\left\\|d_{f}^{*} \\xi\\right\\|_{f}^{2}-\\frac{1}{6}\\|d \\xi-C\\|_{f}^{2} \\leq 0\n$$\n\nAs an application, we obtain stability result for generalized Ricci flow which is defined as a solution of a one parameter pair of Riemannian metrics and 2-forms $\\left(g_{t}, b_{t}\\right)$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} g=-2 \\operatorname{Rc}+\\frac{1}{2} H^{2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} b=-d^{*} H\n$$\n\nwhere $H=H_{0}+d b$ and $H_{0}$ is a fixed closed 3 -form. Notice that the generalized Ricci flow is closely related to the mathematical physics [22] and generalized geometry [8, 14]. In the complex case, the generalized Ricci flow is gauge equivalent to pluriclosed flow [31]. This geometric flow is first introduced by Streets and Tian [30, 29]. More precisely, a one parameter family of pluriclosed metrics and 2 -forms $\\left(g_{t}, \\beta_{t}\\right)$ is called a solution of pluriclosed flow if it satisfies\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\omega=-\\rho_{B}^{1,4}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\beta=-\\rho_{B}^{2,0}\n$$\n\nBy now there are many global existence and convergence results for pluriclosed flow ([2, 9, 26]). We note that fixed points of pluriclosed flow are Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein manifolds. As a matter of fact, Bismut-flat manifolds are the only known examples of non-K\u00e4hler Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein to the present day. As proved in [9] Theorem 1.2, given a pluriclosed metric $\\omega_{0}$ with $\\left[\\partial \\omega_{0}\\right]=\\left[\\partial \\omega_{F}\\right]$ where $\\left(M, \\omega_{F}, J\\right)$ is a compact Bismut-flat manifold, the solution to pluriclosed flow with initial data $\\omega_{0}$ exists for all time and converges to a Bismut-flat metric. We expect that all Bismut-flat metrics should be linearly stable and [19] Corollary 1.2 justified this result. In [18], the author proved that the dynamically stable and linearly stable are equivalent (c.f [18] Theorem 1.8 in Riemannian manifold case) if all infinitesimal deformation is integrable (c.f Definition 3.15). Thus, we prove that\n\nCorollary 1.3. Let $(M, g, H, J)$ be a compact Bismut-Hermitian-Einstein metric. If all infinitesimal deformation is integrable, then $(M, g, H, J)$ is dynamically stable. In other words, for any neighborhood of $(g, 0) \\in \\mathcal{M} \\times \\Omega^{2}$, where $\\mathcal{M}$ denotes the space of Riemannian metrics, there exists a smaller neighborhood $\\mathcal{V} \\subset \\mathcal{U}$ such that the pluriclosed flow $\\left(g_{t}, b_{t}\\right)$ starting in $\\mathcal{V}$ stays in $\\mathcal{U}$ for all $t \\geq 0$ and converges to a critical point up to a diffeomorphism.\n\nIn [19], the author also discussed infinitesimal solitonic deformations of generalized Ricci solitons. In the Bismut flat manifolds case, infinitesimal solitonic deformations could be understood as the kernel of second variation. We then prove that\n\nProposition 1.4. Let $\\left(M^{2 n}, g, H, J\\right)$ be a compact Bismut-flat, pluriclosed manifold. Suppose that the Ricci curvature is $(2 n-1)$-positive, i.e., there is at most one non-positive eigenvalue then there is no essential infinitesimal generalized solitonic deformation on directions of fixing the complex structure.\n\nAs examples, we recall that the Hopf surface is a Bismut-flat manifold that is diffeomorphic to $S^{1} \\times S^{3}$ and the CalabiEckmann space is also a Bismut-flat manifold that is diffeomorphic to $S^{3} \\times S^{3}$ (See Example 2.13 and Example 2.14 for details). Besides, compact Bismut-flat Hermitian manifolds are classified by Q. Wang, B. Yang and F. Zheng in [23]. We have the following corollary.\n\nCorollary 1.5. The Hopf surface and Calabi-Eckmann space with the Bismut flat pluriclosed metrics described in Example 2.13 and Example 2.14 respectively are strictly linearly stable on the directions fixing the complex structure.\n\nHere is an outline of the rest of the paper. In section 2, we discuss the non-K\u00e4hler geometry, including Bismut connection, generalized Einstein-Hilbert functional. Besides, we introduce a special complex coordinate that we will use in later computation. In section 3, we first study the infinitesimal complex structure and studied the decomposition of variation space. Then, we prove the main result by discussing anti-symmetric part and symmetric part respectively. In the last part, we focus on Bismut-flat manifolds with $(2 n-1)$ positive Ricci curvature and show that there is no infinitesimal deformation on the direction of fixing the complex structure.\n\nAcknowledgements: The author is grateful to his advisor Jeffrey D.

Given complex numbers $\\alpha, \\beta$ satisfying $0<|\\alpha| \\leq|\\beta|<1$, we obtain a Hopf surface\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\} /\\left\\langle\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(\\alpha z_{1}, \\beta z_{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor any $\\alpha, \\beta$ this is a complex manifold diffeomorphic to $S^{3} \\times S^{1}$. In particular, we say that the Hopf surface is diagonal if $|\\alpha|=|\\beta|$. For diagonal Hopf surfaces, consider the Hopf/Boothby metric defined by the invariant K\u00e4hler form on $\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ by\n\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text {Hopf }}=\\frac{\\sqrt{-1}}{|z|^{2}}\\left(d z_{1} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{1}+d z_{2} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn [10] Proposition 8.25, one deduce that this metric is a pluriclosed metric, In fact, we observe that the metric on the universal cover $\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ is isometric to the standard cylinder $\\left(S^{3} \\times \\mathbb{R}, g_{S^{3}} \\oplus d t^{2}\\right)$. Therefore, this metric is Bismut-flat and $\\rho_{B}=0$. Besides, the Hopf/Boothby metric is the only compact non-K\u00e4hler example of a Bismut Hermitian-Einstein metric in complex dimension 2. Moreover, in [27] Theorem 1.1, the author also construct a non-trivial pluriclosed steady soliton on Hopf surface.\n\nExample 2.14. Consider $\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ endowed with the $\\mathbb{C}-$ action given by\n\n$$\n\\gamma(z, \\omega)=\\left(e^{\\gamma} z, e^{\\sqrt{-1} \\gamma} z\\right)\n$$\n\nThis action is free and proper and the quotient space $(M, J)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^{3} \\times S^{3}$. This is an example of a CalabiEckmann space. Moreover, $M$ is the total space of a holomorphic $T^{2}$ fibration over $\\mathbb{C P}^{1} \\times \\mathbb{C P}^{1}$ and it is the product of the standard Hopf fibration $\\pi_{i}: S^{3} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C P}^{1}$. Let $\\xi_{i}$ denotes the canonical vector fields associated to this fibration on the two factors, with $\\mu_{i}$ the associated canonical connections satisfying $d \\mu_{i}=\\pi_{i}^{*} \\omega_{F S}$. We consider the K\u00e4hler form associated to the product of round metrics,\n\n$$\n\\omega=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{F S}+\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{F S}+\\mu_{1} \\wedge \\mu_{2}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\nd \\omega=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{F S} \\wedge \\mu_{2}-\\mu_{1} \\wedge \\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{F S}\n$$\n\nNote that $J \\xi_{1}=\\xi_{2}$, it shows that\n\n$$\nd H=-d^{c} \\omega=\\pi_{1}^{*} \\omega_{F S} \\wedge \\mu_{1}-\\pi_{2}^{*} \\omega_{F S} \\wedge \\mu_{2}\n$$\n\nWe may view its geometric structure as a product of two copies of the $S^{3}$ factor of the Hopf metric so $d H=0$. It can be checked that $(M, J, \\omega)$ is a Bismut-flat metric and the Lee form $\\theta^{\\sharp}$ is a Killing field which preserves $H$.
