Context and motivations. The significance of the Dirac equation lies on the fact that it describes, not only relativistic particles in quantum mechanics, but also advanced materials such as graphene. Mathematically, the study of this equation is notoriously difficult, partly because of the spinorial structure of the underlying Hilbert space and partly because of the lack of semi-boundedness and positivity-preserving properties. In this respect, the spectral analysis of the underlying matrix differential operator is considerably more challenging than that of its non-relativistic counterpart, the scalar Schr\u00f6dinger operator.\n\nRecently, we have seen unprecedented interest in the study of non-selfadjoint electromagnetic perturbations of the Dirac equation $[8,6,7,9,4,19,14,10,11,24,16,18]$. This is justified, on the one hand, by the availability of new proper connections with quantum mechanics [26, 22], and, on the other hand, by the new conceptual paradigms posed by the notions of pseudospectra of linear operators.\n\nThis paper is motivated by the current lack of understanding of the structure of the pseudospectra of non-selfadjoint Dirac operators. Indeed, the only available work in this direction seems to be the recent non-semiclassical construction of pseudomodes given in [19].\n\nIn order to provide an insight into the pseudospectral properties of the Dirac equation in general, and at the same time set a benchmark that differs from the available scalar models given by the classical nonselfadjoint Schr\u00f6dinger operator, the present paper is devoted to introducing and examining in close detail the non-selfadjoint Dirac operator,\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nm & -\\partial_{x} \\\\\n\\partial_{x} & -m\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\ni \\operatorname{sgn}(x) & 0 \\\\\n0 & i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)\n\\end{array}\\right)+V(x)\n$$\n\non a suitable domain of $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ where $V: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}$ is a long-range possibly non-Hermitian matrix potential. The unperturbed operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}=\\mathscr{L}_{m, 0}$ is a relativistic non-selfadjoint version of the quantum mechanical infinite square well.\n\nThe choice is motivated by the scalar Schr\u00f6dinger case on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C})$ considered in [15],\n\n$$\n-\\partial_{x}^{2}+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)\n$$\n\nwith potential perturbations, and it serves as a link with the analysis conducted in [8]. The scalar model (1.2) was instrumental for the non-semiclassical construction of pseudomodes established in [21], which eventually solved a notorious open problem raised during a workshop at the American Institute of Mathematics in 2015, cf. [1, Open Problem 10.1]. The relativistic variant of this construction has now been reported in [19].\n\nThe simplicity of the linear operator (1.2) is deceiving, as it hides a non-trivial structure on its pseudospectrum. Our findings reveal two main distinctions between (1.1) and this scalar model. One is about this structure and one is about the available tools to analyse it. The latter is to be expected, given the higher degree of complexity of a matrix versus a scalar operator. But the former is rather surprising. As we shall see in the next section, the linear operator (1.1) has a resolvent norm that grows quadratically, rather than linearly, at infinity inside the band forming the spectral instability region.\n1.2. Structure of the paper. The organisation of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a proper mathematical description of our main contributions. The body of the paper is Sections 3-5, where we establish the proofs of these results. After this, Appendix A includes complete details of the Birman-Schwinger-type principle formulated in [13] which is crucial to our analysis.\n\nThe core Sections $3-5$ consist of two parts.\n\n- The unperturbed operator, comprising Sections 3 and 4. We begin our study of (1.1) in Section 3 by finding the explicit expression of the matrix Green function of the unperturbed operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. This allows to determine the spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. As it turns out, the latter is purely essential and it comprises four symmetric segments on the boundary of the band $\\Sigma=\\{|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}$ for $m>0$, while by contrast it is equal to $\\bar{\\Sigma}$ for $m=0$. In Section 4 we find enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. In one of our main contributions, we compute the explicit asymptotic constants, up to order 0 , of the resolvent norm of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ inside the instability region $\\Sigma$. The latter coincides with the interior of the numerical range.\n- Perturbations, comprising Section 5. The second part of the paper is devoted to the case $V \\neq 0$. By applying a non-selfadjoint version of the classical Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how spectrum and pseudospectrum change, under two general hypotheses, $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<$ 1 or $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right) \\cap L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ for some $p>1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged in both cases and that the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\\varepsilon>0$ whenever $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<1$. Then, we formulate our two other main contributions of this part. On the one hand, we determine sharp asymptotics for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$\n\nsatisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. On the other hand, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model, corresponding to potential $\\epsilon V$ in the regime $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$.\n1.3. Notation used throughout the work. The following specific conventions will be used throughout this paper.\n\n- $\\mathbb{R}_{+}=[0,+\\infty)$ and $\\mathbb{R}_{-}=(-\\infty, 0]$.\n- $[[m, n]]=\\{k \\in \\mathbb{N}: m \\leq k \\leq n\\}$ for $m, n \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- For a closed operator $\\mathscr{L}: \\operatorname{Dom}(\\mathscr{L}) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}$, the spectrum is denoted by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathscr{L})=\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\mathscr{L}) \\cup \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathscr{L}) \\cup \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\mathscr{L})\n$$\n\nwhere the point, residual and continuous spectrum denote, as usual,\n$\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\mathscr{L})=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: \\mathscr{L}-z$ is not injective $\\}$\n$\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{r}}(\\mathscr{L})=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: \\mathscr{L}-z$ is injective and $\\overline{\\operatorname{Ran}(\\mathscr{L}-z)} \\subsetneq \\mathcal{H}\\}$,\n$\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\mathscr{L})=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: \\mathscr{L}-z$ is injective and $\\overline{\\operatorname{Ran}(\\mathscr{L}-z)}=\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\operatorname{Ran}(\\mathscr{L}-z) \\subsetneq \\mathcal{H}\\}$.\nThe resolvent set is denoted by $\\rho(\\mathscr{L})$.\n\n- We use the classical definitions of the five types of essential spectrum, [12, Sec. IX] or [20, Sec. 5.4]. We write $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} j}(\\mathscr{L})$ for $\\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,5]]$, where $\\mathscr{L}-z$\n- is not semi-Fredholm for e1,\n- possess a singular Weyl sequence for e2,\n- is not Fredholm for e3,\n- is not Fredholm of index 0 for e4,\n- is such that either $z \\in \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 1}(\\mathscr{L})$ or the resolvent set does not intersect the connected component of the complement of $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 1}(\\mathscr{L})$ where $z$ lies, for e5.\n- The discrete spectrum is denoted as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{dis}}(\\mathscr{L})=\\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}(\\mathscr{L})\n$$\n\nand it is the set of isolated eigenvalues such that the Riesz projector has a finite-dimensional range.\n\n- For $\\varepsilon>0$, the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum is denoted by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathscr{L}) & =\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathscr{L}) \\cup\\left\\{z \\in \\rho(\\mathscr{L}):\\left\\|(\\mathscr{L}-z)^{-1}\\right\\|>\\varepsilon^{-1}\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\bigcup_{\\|V\\| \\leq \\varepsilon} \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathscr{L}+V)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy convention, we set $\\operatorname{Spec}_{0}(\\mathscr{L})=\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathscr{L})$.\n\n- $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}$ is the Euclidean norm for vectors.\n- $\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$ is the operator norm induced by $|\\cdot|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}$ for matrices.\n- $|\\cdot|_{\\mathrm{F}}$ is the Frobenius norm for matrices.\n- For a measurable matrix-valued function $V: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}$, we write $V \\in L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ for $p \\in[1, \\infty]$ to indicate that $|V|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\in L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C})$. We denote the $L^{p}$ norm of $V$ by\n\n$$\n\\|V\\|_{L^{p}}=\\left\\|\\left|V\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}}\n$$\n\n- For a positive function $\\nu^{\\prime}(x)$, we define the measure $\\mathrm{d} \\nu(x)=\\nu^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x$. We say that $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu\\right)$ if\n\n$$\n\\|V\\|_{L^{1}(\\mathrm{~d} \\nu)}=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\nu^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x<\\infty\n$$\n\n2. Mathematical framework and summary of results\n\nBelow, we set\n\n$$\nS_{m}= \\begin{cases}\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq m,|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\}, & \\text { if } m>0 \\\\ \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1\\}, & \\text { if } m=0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand we write $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)=L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}) \\oplus L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C})$ with the inner product\n\n$$\n\\langle f, g\\rangle=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f_{1}(x) \\overline{g_{1}(x)}+f_{2}(x) \\overline{g_{2}(x)} \\mathrm{d} x \\quad \\text { for components } f_{j}, g_{j} \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C})\n$$\n\nAs usual,\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{1}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad \\sigma_{2}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sigma_{3}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\ndenote the Pauli matrices. For mass $m \\geq 0$, let $\\mathcal{D}_{m}: H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\longrightarrow L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ be the one-dimensional free particle Dirac operator, given by\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m} f\\right)(x)=\\left(-i \\partial_{x}\\right) \\sigma_{2} f(x)+m \\sigma_{3} f(x)\n$$\n\nIt is well-known that $\\mathcal{D}_{m}$ is a selfadjoint linear operator and that its spectrum is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m}\\right)=(-\\infty,-m] \\cup[m,+\\infty)\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{D}_{m}$ is unitarily equivalent to the selfadjoint operator $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}_{m}=\\left(-i \\partial_{x}\\right) \\sigma_{1}+m \\sigma_{3}: H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\longrightarrow$ $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ via transformation by $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{array}\\right)$. This other realisation of the free particle Dirac operator is the one considered in $[8,9,19]$. In the present paper we prefer the formulation (2.2), noting that the results we report below, map in a straightforward manner onto $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{D}}_{m}$.\n2.1. The Dirac operator with a dislocation. In the present paper we examine the linear operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}: H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\longrightarrow L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ given by\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m} f\\right)(x)=\\mathcal{D}_{m} f(x)+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) f(x)\n$$\n\nand its perturbations by a potential. Since multiplication by $i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) I$ is a bounded operator, $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is also closed. From the explicit expression of the adjoint,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}^{*} f\\right)(x)=\\mathcal{D}_{m} f(x)-i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) f(x)\n$$\n\nit follows that $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is not a normal operator. As we shall see below, the spectral and pseudospectral properties of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ and its perturbations, are rather unusual and very interesting.\n\nThe numerical range of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is the infinite closed strip\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\mathbb{R}+i[-1,1]\n$$\n\nSee Figure 1 and the beginning of Section 3. Unlike the Schr\u00f6dinger operator with dislocated potential analysed in [15], $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is neither sectorial nor $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric. However, $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is $\\mathcal{T}$-selfadjoint and this implies that the spectrum respects some of the symmetries that the Schr\u00f6dinger model possesses.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. The numerical range of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$.\n\nHere and everywhere below a distinction of the case $m=0$, is evident, unavoidable and it is typical of families of non-selfadjoint operators dependent on a parameter, $c f$. the examples in [2] and references therein. Moreover, setting an unitary operator $S f=g$ such that $g(x)=a f\\left(a^{2} x\\right)$ for fixed non-zero $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup i \\mathbb{R}$, it is readily seen that $S$ preserves the domains and\n\n$$\n\\left(S^{*} \\mathscr{L}_{a^{2} m} S f\\right)(x)=a^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m} f(x)+\\frac{i}{a^{2}} \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\frac{x}{a^{2}}\\right) f(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis shows that both the case $m<0$ and the case of a dislocated potential of the form $c \\operatorname{sgn}(x) I$, where $c>0$ is a constant, are covered by our results below.\n\nAs we shall see in Section 3, the spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ can be determined analytically using arguments based on resolvent construction and Weyl sequences. For all $m>0$, the spectrum is purely continuous\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}_{c}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=S_{m}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, all essential spectra coincide,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right), \\quad \\forall \\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,5]]\n$$\n\nNote that $\\mathcal{T}$-selfadjointness implies equality of the essential spectra for $\\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,4]]$ only, so the proof of equality of the full set requires extra arguments given below. An illustration of the spectrum is included in Figure 2.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2. The red lines represent the spectrum of the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ when $m>0$.\nIn contrast, for $m=0$, the spectrum is characterized by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\}\n$$\n\nUnlike the case $m>0$, the essential spectra are not identical:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\}, \\quad \\forall \\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,4]] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nSee the illustration in Figure 3.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3. The red lines show the continuous spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$. These lines coincide with the essential spectra e1,.., e4. The inner part in light colour shows the point spectrum. The union of both these regions form the essential spectrum e5 and also the full $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFor all $m \\geq 0$, the comparison with the spectrum of $\\mathcal{D}_{m}$ is obvious and striking. Despite the seemingly simple structure of the dislocation $i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) I$, the perturbation splits the spectrum into two halves. In the case $m>0$, this phenomenon mimics the findings of [15, Thm. 2.1] for the Schr\u00f6dinger case. For $m=0$, rather than a clear-cut split, the spectrum smears throughout the full band that forms the numerical range. In Lemma 3.4 we show that, at any $z$ in the point spectrum, $\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)$ is Fredholm with index zero. Moreover, the geometric multiplicity of $z$ is one while its algebraic multiplicity is infinite. This is neither obvious, nor a consequence of general principles.\n\nLet us now describe the pseudospectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. We adopt the following terminology, which is convenient in order to articulate our findings. We say that a closed operator $\\mathscr{L}$ has a trivial pseudospectrum, if there exists a constant $C \\geq 1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathscr{L}) \\subseteq\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}: \\operatorname{dist}(z, \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathscr{L}) \\leq C \\varepsilon\\}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\varepsilon>0$. Any normal operator has a trivial pseudospectrum with $C=1$, since in this case the $\\varepsilon$ pseudospectrum coincides with the $\\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of the spectrum. Any closed operator which is similar to a normal operator, via a bounded invertible similarity transformation $S$, has also trivial pseudospectrum with $C=\\|S\\|\\left\\|S^{-1}\\right\\|$, the condition number of $S$.\n\nAccording to the well-known inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{dist}\\left(z, \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)} \\leq\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{dist}\\left(z, \\operatorname{Num} \\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\notin \\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$, it is readily seen that for $|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1$,\n\n1) and for $|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq m$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|=\\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1}\n$$\n\n2) while for $|\\operatorname{Re} z|<m$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(|\\operatorname{Re} z|-m\\right)^{2}+\\left(|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1\\right)^{2}}} \\leq\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1}\n$$\n\nIn the next theorem we see that, in stark contrast, the resolvent norm increases at a quadratic rate as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$ inside the numerical range. This statement is our first main contribution.\nTheorem 2.1. Let $m>0$ and let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be the operator given by (2.3). Assume that $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is such that $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|=\\frac{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)}\\left(1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{-2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nas $|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\rightarrow \\infty$. The $\\mathcal{O}$ term is uniform in $|\\operatorname{Im} z|$ and locally uniform in $m$ (i.e., the constants involved can be chosen independent of $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for all $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$ and $m$ on any fixed compact subset of $(0, \\infty)$ ).\n\nAccording to this theorem, when we consider the level set\n\n$$\n\\left\\{z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right):\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor some $\\varepsilon>0$, we obtain curves whose points $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}=1-\\frac{\\varepsilon|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m}\\left(1+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nin the asymptotic regime $|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\rightarrow+\\infty$. Motivated by this, for $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ and $\\varepsilon>0$, we set regions\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{+}^{\\alpha}(\\varepsilon)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1+\\varepsilon \\text { and }|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2} \\geq \\frac{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)}{(1 \\pm \\alpha) \\varepsilon}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThese are illustrated in Figure 4 for two different values of $\\varepsilon$.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4. Regions $\\Lambda_{+}^{0.1}(\\varepsilon)$ and $\\Lambda_{-}^{0.1}(\\varepsilon)$ in the box as shown, for $m=1, \\varepsilon=0.02$ (left) and $\\varepsilon=0.01$ (right). The part in blue corresponds to $\\Lambda_{+}^{0.1}(\\varepsilon) \\backslash \\Lambda_{-}^{0.1}(\\varepsilon)$ and $\\Lambda_{-}^{0.1}(\\varepsilon)$ is shows in brick.\n\nIn the next corollary we establish sharp inclusions and exclusion zones for the pseudospectra of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ in terms of these regions. Note that $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$ has trivial pseudospectra although it is a non-normal operator.\n\nCorollary 2.2. Let $m \\geq 0$ and let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be the operator given by (2.3).\n\n1) If $m=0$, then the pseudospectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$ is trivial and for all $\\varepsilon>0$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1+\\varepsilon\\}\n$$\n\n2) If $m>0$, then the pseudospectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is non-trivial. Namely, for every fixed $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, there exists $M>0$ such that,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Lambda_{+}^{\\alpha}(\\varepsilon) \\cap\\{|\\operatorname{Re} z|>M\\} & \\subset\\left(\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon} \\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\cap\\{|\\operatorname{Re} z|>M\\} \\\\\n\\left(\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon} \\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\cap\\{|\\operatorname{Re} z|>M\\} & \\subset \\Lambda_{+}^{\\alpha}(\\varepsilon) \\cap\\{|\\operatorname{Re} z|>M\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\varepsilon>0$.\nProof. For $m=0$, the statement follows directly from the spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$ and (2.5). Here is the proof for $m>0$. According to Theorem 2.1, there exists a constant $C>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left(1-\\frac{C}{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}\\right) \\frac{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)}<\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|<\\left(1+\\frac{C}{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}\\right) \\frac{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor large $|\\operatorname{Re}(z)|$ and $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$. Thus, for fixed $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ and $|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{\\alpha}}$ we have the following. For $\\varepsilon>0,(2.7)$ is ensured whenever $|\\operatorname{Re} z|$ is such that\n\n$$\n(1-\\alpha) \\frac{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)} \\geq \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, if\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\leq\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}<(1+\\alpha) \\frac{|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}}{m\\left(1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}\\right)}\n$$\n\nTherefore (2.8) is valid. For $|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1$, we recall (2.5).\n2.2. Long-range potential perturbations. In Section 5 we examine perturbations of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ by an integrable matrix-valued function $V$. We establish results about the localisation of eigenvalues and pseudospectrum, under general assumptions on the decay of $V$ at infinity.\n\nOur starting point is the construction of a specific closed densely defined extension of the differential operator\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{L}_{m}+V: H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Dom}(V) \\longrightarrow L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nvia a version of the classical selfadjoint framework of Kato [17], obtained in [13]. Concretely, for almost ${ }^{1}$ all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let\n\n$$\nV(x)=B(x) A(x) \\quad \\text { where } \\quad B(x)=U(x)|V(x)|^{1 / 2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad A(x)=|V(x)|^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nin the polar decomposition $V(x)=U(x)|V(x)|$, for $U(x)$ partial isometries and $|V|(x)=\\left(V^{*}(x) V(x)\\right)^{1 / 2}$. Consider the family of closed operators\n\n$$\nQ(z)=\\overline{A R_{0}(z) B}, \\quad \\text { where } \\quad R_{0}(z)=\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nfor $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. According to Theorem A. 1 quoted in Appendix A, if\nH1: there exists $z_{0} \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$ such that $-1 \\in \\rho\\left(Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)$,\nthen there exists a closed extension $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V} \\supseteq \\mathscr{L}_{m}+V$, whose resolvent coincides with the family of bounded operators\n\n$$\nR_{0}(z)-\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\\left(I+Q(z)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nOur analysis below refers to the closed operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$.\nWe begin Section 5 by showing that the abstract condition H1 holds, for a measurable function $V$ satisfying either of the following hypotheses;\n\nH2: $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<1$,\nH3: $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right) \\cap L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ for some $p \\in(1, \\infty]$.\nOnce we settle that, we formulate the next spectral stability result.\nProposition 2.3. Let $m \\geq 0$ and let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be as in (2.3). Let $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ and assume that either H2 or H3 holds true. Then, there exists a closed densely defined extension $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V} \\supseteq \\mathscr{L}_{m}+V$ with a non-empty resolvent set and its spectrum is as follows.\nIf $m>0$,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Here and elsewhere below we assume without further mentioning that all the identities involving point-wise evaluation are valid almost everywhere with respect to the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1) all the essential spectra of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ are stable and coincide, namely\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=S_{m}, \\quad \\forall \\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,5]]\n$$\n\nIf $m=0$,\n2) all the first four notions of essential spectra are stable and coincide, namely\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\}, \\quad \\forall \\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,4]]\n$$\n\nMoreover,\n3) If $V$ satisfies the assumption $\\mathbf{H} 2$, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}\\right) \\subset S_{0}\n$$\n\n4) If $V$ satisfies the assumption $\\mathbf{H} 3$ for $p<\\infty$, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1+\\frac{2(p-1)}{p}\\|V\\| \\frac{\\varepsilon}{L^{p}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf $V$ satisfies the assumption $\\mathbf{H} 3$ for $p=\\infty$, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1+\\|V\\|_{L^{\\infty}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn Remark 5.1, we expand further on the justification for the condition $\\mathbf{H} 2$ and compare with the case of the dislocated Schr\u00f6dinger operator. This assumption has already been documented in [8] for $\\mathcal{D}_{m}$ in place of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. Noticeably, it gives regions of inclusion for the perturbed eigenvalues. Our next result shows that a control on $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}$ also gives inclusions for the spectrum and pseudospectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$.\n\nTheorem 2.4. For $m \\geq 0$, let\n\n$$\nD=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<\\frac{3}{2},|\\operatorname{Re} z|<\\frac{5}{2} m\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThere exists a constant $0<C(m) \\leq 1$ such that, if $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<C(m)$, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\varepsilon}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}\\right) \\subseteq \\bar{D} \\cup\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1+\\varepsilon\\left(1+\\frac{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}{4 C(m)\\left(C(m)-\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}\\right)}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\varepsilon \\geq 0$. Moreover, for $C(0)=1$ this statement is valid.\nAccording to [8, Cor. 4.6], $\\mathcal{D}_{m}+V$ has point spectrum lying on a strip covering the real axis for $m=0$. According to [8, Thm. 2.1], for $m>0$, it lies inside two disks centered near the endpoints of the essential spectrum. The radius of these disks decreases as $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\rightarrow 0$. Our next result shows that, rather unexpectedly, the point spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ behaves differently from that of $\\mathcal{D}_{m}+V$, under fast rates of decay of the perturbation at infinity. Namely, it escapes to infinity through the channel created by the numerical range, rather than concentrating at the end-points of the essential spectrum, as $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\rightarrow 0$. The condition we impose is analogous to the one considered in [15, Thm. 2.3] and in turn allows refined versions of the conclusions 3) - 4) of Proposition 2.3 for $m>0$.\n\nHere and everywhere below we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x)=\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}, & \\mathrm{~d} \\nu_{1}(x)=\\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\\\\n\\nu_{2}^{\\prime}(x)=\\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x)^{2}=1+x^{2}, & \\mathrm{~d} \\nu_{2}(x)=\\nu_{2}^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nTheorem 2.5. Let $m>0$ be fixed. Then, there exists a constant $C(m)>0$, ensuring the following. For all $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu_{1}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|V\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\mathrm{~d} \\nu_{1}\\right)}<C(m)\n$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}\\right) \\subseteq\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1,|\\operatorname{Re}(z)|>\\frac{C(m)}{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSuccinctly, this theorem says that for potentials $V$ decaying sufficiently rapidly at $\\infty$, the discrete spectrum escapes to $\\infty$ inside the instability band, $\\{|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}$, at a rate proportional to $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ in the regime $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\rightarrow 0$. In the conclusion, the norm is taken with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n\nFor Schr\u00f6dinger operators, a similar result was established in [15, Thm. 2.3]. In the latter, the density considered was $\\nu_{2}^{\\prime}$ instead of $\\nu_{1}^{\\prime}$, and upper bounds for the norm of $Q(z)$ were obtained via the HilbertSchmidt norm. Here we employ the Schur Test instead, which allows a better control of the upper bounds for the norm of the integral operator $Q(z)$. Therefore, we manage to weaken the condition on the decay of $V$.\n\nTheorem 2.5 opens the question of whether there exist $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ with non-empty discrete spectrum for $m>0$. We give an answer to this question in Subsection 5.3. Our concrete finding in this respect is the following. Consider the step potential\n\n$$\nV(x)=V_{a, b}(x)=(-i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)-b) \\chi_{]-a, a]}(x) I\n$$\n\nwhere $a>0$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Set $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V_{a, b}}\\right)=H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. According to Proposition 2.3, the essential spectra of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V_{a, b}}$ are\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V_{a, b}}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1,|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq m\\}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,4]]$, including $\\mathrm{j}=5$ if $m>0$.\nProposition 2.6. For $m \\geq 0$, let $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V_{a, b}}$ be as in the previous paragraph.\n\n1) If $m=0$, then the point spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{0, V_{a, b}}$ is the band\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V_{a, b}}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}\n$$\n\n2) If $m>0$, then the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V_{a, b}}$ has infinitely many isolated real eigenvalues accumulating at $\\pm \\infty$.\n\nIn the context of Theorem 2.5, it is also natural to examine the behaviour of the family of operators $\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}$ for fixed $m>0$, fixed potential $V$ and a small moving complex parameter $\\epsilon \\in \\mathbb{C}$, in the regime $|\\epsilon| \\rightarrow 0$. This is the so-called weakly coupled model. For this model we establish the following in Subsection 5.4.\n\nLet $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu_{1}\\right)$. From Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.5, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{ej}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1,|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq m\\}, \\quad \\forall j \\in[[1,5]]\n$$\n\nand, for a suitable constant $C(m)>0$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{dis}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) \\subseteq\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1,|\\operatorname{Re} z|>\\frac{C(m)}{|\\epsilon|^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\|V\\|_{L}^{1}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\epsilon|$ small enough. If $V$ satisfies additional conditions of regularity and decay at infinity, then Theorem 2.5 refines as follows.\n\nTheorem 2.7. Let $m>0$. For any $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu_{2}\\right) \\cap W^{2,1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$, there exists a constant $C(m)>0$ independent of $\\epsilon$, such that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{dis}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im}

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. RESOLYENT AND SPECTRUM OF $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ \n\nIn this section we settle the framework of the differential expression (2.3) and the associated linear operator. We begin by determining $\\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. We then compute the Green matrix associated with the resolvent $\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}$ and find $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\mathcal{D}_{m}^{*}=\\mathcal{D}_{m}$ and multiplication by $i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) I$ is bounded, it follows that the domain of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}^{*}$ is also $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the antilinear operator of complex conjugation, $\\mathcal{T} g=\\bar{g}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$ be the parity operator, $(\\mathcal{P} g)(x)=g(-x)$. For $f \\in H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$, direct substitution of the operators involved, gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\mathcal{T} \\mathscr{L}_{m} \\mathcal{T} f\\right)(x) & =\\overline{\\left(-i \\partial_{x}\\right) \\sigma_{2} \\overline{f(x)}+m \\sigma_{3} \\overline{f(x)}+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\overline{f(x)}} \\\\\n& =\\left(-i \\partial_{x}\\right) \\sigma_{2} f(x)+m \\sigma_{3} f(x)-i \\operatorname{sgn}(x) f(x)=\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}^{*} f\\right)(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nhowever,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T} \\mathscr{L}_{m} f \\neq \\mathscr{L}_{m} \\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T} f\n$$\n\nTherefore, $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is $\\mathcal{T}$-selfadjoint but it is not $\\mathcal{P} \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric.\nNow we show that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1\\}\n$$\n\nIndeed, let $f=\\binom{f_{1}}{f_{2}} \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$ be such that $\\|f\\|=1$. Integration by parts gives\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathscr{L}_{m} f, f\\right\\rangle=m\\left(\\left\\|f_{1}\\right\\|^{2}-\\left\\|f_{2}\\right\\|^{2}\\right)+2 \\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle f_{1}^{\\prime}, f_{2}\\right\\rangle+i\\left(\\|f\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)}^{2}-\\|f\\|_{L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}_{-}\\right)}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\|f\\|=1$, it follows immediately that $\\left|\\operatorname{Im}\\left\\langle\\mathscr{L}_{m} f, f\\right\\rangle\\right| \\leq 1$, which implies that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\subseteq\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1\\}\n$$\n\nConversely, for the reverse inclusion, we construct appropriate test functions as follows. Choose smooth $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ with supports in $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$such that $\\left\\|g_{1}\\right\\|^{2}+\\left\\|g_{2}\\right\\|^{2}=1$ and $\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle g_{1}^{\\prime}, g_{2}\\right\\rangle>0$. For $\\lambda>0$, let\n\n$$\nf_{j}(x)=\\lambda^{1 / 2} g_{j}(\\lambda x)\n$$\n\nThen, $\\|f\\|=1$ and\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\mathscr{L}_{m} f, f\\right\\rangle=m\\left(\\left\\|g_{1}\\right\\|^{2}-\\left\\|g_{2}\\right\\|^{2}\\right)+2 \\operatorname{ARe}\\left\\langle g_{1}^{\\prime}, g_{2}\\right\\rangle+i\n$$\n\nHence, by increasing $\\lambda$, it follows that $\\mathbb{R}_{+}+i \\subseteq \\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. Similar arguments, choosing $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ with support in $\\mathbb{R}_{-}$or changing the sign of $\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle g_{1}^{\\prime}, g_{2}\\right\\rangle$, give $\\mathbb{R} \\pm i \\subseteq \\operatorname{Num}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. The convexity of the numerical range completes the proof of (3.2).\n\nBelow, we often write $\\Sigma=\\operatorname{Int}\\left(\\operatorname{Num} \\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$ and call this set the instability band.\n3.1. Integral form of the resolvent. In this subsection we compute explicitly the integral kernel associated to the resolvent of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. We also establish preliminary estimates on its norm. We begin by fixing a notation that will prove crucial for simplifying our expressions and subsequent analysis.\n\nFor $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash\\{ \\pm m \\pm i\\}$, we write\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mu_{z}^{-}=\\sqrt{(m+i+z)(m-i-z)}, & \\mu_{z}^{+}=\\sqrt{(m-i+z)(m+i-z)} \\\\\nw_{z}^{-}=\\frac{m-i-z}{\\mu_{z}^{-}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{m-i-z}}{\\sqrt{m+i+z}}, & w_{z}^{+}=\\frac{m+i-z}{\\mu_{z}^{+}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{m+i-z}}{\\sqrt{m-i+z}}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHere and throughout the paper, we pick the principal branch $z \\mapsto \\sqrt{z}=z^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ defined on $\\mathbb{C}$, holomorphic on $\\mathbb{C} \\backslash(-\\infty, 0]$ and having a positive imaginary part on $(-\\infty, 0)$. This choice ensures that $w_{z}^{ \\pm}$have the stated expressions in (3.3).\n\nSince\n\n$$\n(m \\pm i+z)(m \\mp i-z) \\in(-\\infty, 0] \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\geq m \\text { and } \\operatorname{Im} z=\\mp 1\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}>0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad z \\notin\\{\\tau \\pm i: \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R},|\\tau| \\geq m\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\overline{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}}=\\mu_{y}^{ \\mp}$and $\\overline{w_{z}^{ \\pm}}=w_{z}^{ \\mp}$ for all $z$ satisfying (3.4). Below we will use these facts repeatedly, often without further explicit mention.\n\nRecall $S_{m}$ given by (2.1). In the next subsection, we will establish that $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=S_{m}$. For $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$, define the matrices\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nN_{1, z}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{w_{z}^{+}-w_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 / w_{z}^{-} & 1 \\\\\n1 & w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right), & N_{0, z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 / w_{z}^{+} & 1 \\\\\n-1 & w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\nN_{2, z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 / w_{z}^{-} & -1 \\\\\n1 & w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right), & N_{7, z}=N_{4, z} \\\\\nN_{3, z}=\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 & -w_{z}^{-} \\\\\nw_{z}^{+} & w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right), & N_{8, z}=\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 & w_{z}^{+} \\\\\n-w_{z}^{-} & w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\nN_{4, z}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{w_{z}^{+}-w_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 / w_{z}^{+} & 1 \\\\\n1 & -w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right), & N_{9, z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 / w_{z}^{-} & 1 \\\\\n-1 & w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\nN_{5, z}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 / w_{z}^{+} & -1 \\\\\n1 & w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right), & N_{10, z}=N_{1, z}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFor $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}, x \\neq y$, let the matrix kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)$ be given in regions of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)= \\begin{cases}N_{1, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x+y)}+N_{2, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)}, & \\text { for } y<x<0 \\\\ N_{3, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} x+\\mu_{z}^{-}y}, & \\text { for } y<0<x \\\\ N_{4, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x+y)}+N_{5, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}, & \\text { for } 0<y<x \\\\ N_{6, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}+N_{7, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x+y)}, & \\text { for } 0<x<y \\\\ N_{8, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} x-\\mu_{z}^{+} y}, & \\text { for } x<0<y \\\\ N_{9, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)}+N_{10, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x+y)}, & \\text { for } x<y<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNote that $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$ is continuous across the lines $x=0$ and $y=0$, but discontinuous across the line $x=y$. Here it is not important what values we give to this matrix function on these lines, so we leave them unassigned.\n\nWe also mention that, in contrast to the case of the resolvent kernel of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator $-\\frac{d^{2}}{d z^{2}}+$ $i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, considered in [15, Prop. 3.1], $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$ is not symmetric with respect to the line $x=y$. We will see in Lemma 3.2 that the induced operator norm of $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$ is nonetheless symmetric. That is, $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}=$ $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(y, x)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$ for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nAs we shall see from the next statements, $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$ is the (matrix) Green function associated to the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z$. This explicit formula has a far reaching role in the analysis that we conduct below. Remarkably, we will see that it enables the systematic study of perturbation of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ via a Birman-Schwinger principle, as described in Section 5.\nProposition 3.1. For $m \\geq 0$, let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be the operator given by (2.3). Then, $\\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m} \\subset \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. Moreover,\n\n$$\n\\left[\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1} f\\right](x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$ and $f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$,\nBefore proceeding to the proof, we highlight that the resolvent kernel of the free Dirac operator [8, Proof of Thm. 2.1], is a convolution kernel and it contains only exponential terms involving the difference $x-y$. By contrast, for $m>0, \\mathcal{R}_{z}$ also includes mixed exponential terms and it cannot be expressed as a pure tensor product of two matrix functions. We will see below that this more complex structure of the Green function is responsible for the asymptotic growth of the resolvent norm inside the numerical range.\n\nThe remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 3.1. Although this proof follows a routine argumentation, we include crucial details that will aid in the computation of sharp estimates for the resolvent norm. We split it into 4 steps.\nStep 1. Fix $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$ and $f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Consider the eigenvalue equation\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right) u=f\n$$\n\nwhich in matrix form reads\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nm+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)-z & -\\partial_{x} \\\\\n\\partial_{x} & -m+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)-z\n\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{u_{1}(x)}{u_{2}(x)}=\\binom{f_{1}(x)}{f_{2}(x)}\n$$\n\nOur final goal in the proof is to determine the explicit integral expression for the solution. Multiplying by the matrix $J=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right)$ on the left of the two sides of (3.7), gives the equivalent non-homogeneous linear system of first order,\n\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u(x)=A_{z}(x) u(x)+g(x)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nA_{z}(x)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & m-i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)+z \\\\\nm+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)-z & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad g(x)=-J f(x)\n$$\n\nWe now seek for the solution of this system.\nConsider the equation (3.8) for $x>0$ and $x<0$, where the corresponding solutions are indicated as $u_{-}$ and $u_{+}$. Let\n\n$$\nA_{z}^{-}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & m+i+z \\\\\nm-i-z & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad A_{z}^{+}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & m-i+z \\\\\nm+i-z & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nbe the expressions for $A_{z}(x)$ for $x>0$ and $x<0$, respectively. Let $\\Phi_{z}^{\\pm}(x)$ be fundamental matrices for $\\partial_{x} u_{ \\pm}=A_{z}^{ \\pm} u^{ \\pm}$. The columns of $\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x)$ ought to be linear independent for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, thus, we can pick the choice\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x)=\\exp \\left(A_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\cosh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right) & \\frac{\\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)}{w_{z}^{ \\pm}} \\\\\nw_{z}^{ \\pm} \\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right) & \\cosh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x)\\right)^{-1}=\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(-x) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) \\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(y)=\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x+y)\n$$\n\nWe now determine the solutions $u_{ \\pm}$of the inhomogeneous system\n\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u_{ \\pm}(x)=A_{z}^{ \\pm} u_{ \\pm}(x)+g(x) \\quad \\text { on } \\quad \\mathbb{R}_{ \\pm}\n$$\n\nin the form $u_{ \\pm}(x)=\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) v_{ \\pm}(x)$, where $v_{ \\pm}: \\mathbb{R}_{ \\pm} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{2}$ are to be determined. Taking the derivative of $u_{ \\pm}$ and using (3.9), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\partial_{x} u_{ \\pm}(x)=A_{z}^{ \\pm} \\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) v_{ \\pm}(x)+\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) \\partial_{x} v_{ \\pm}(x)=A_{z}^{ \\pm} u_{ \\pm}(x)+\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) \\partial_{x} v_{ \\pm}(x) \\quad \\text { on } \\quad \\mathbb{R}_{ \\pm}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $u_{ \\pm}$are solutions of (3.11) if and only if $\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) \\partial_{x} v_{ \\pm}(x)=g(x)$ on $\\mathbb{R}_{ \\pm}$. Hence, we choose\n\n$$\nv_{ \\pm}(x)=\\int_{0}^{x}\\left(\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(y)\\right)^{-1} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\binom{\\alpha_{ \\pm}}{\\beta_{ \\pm}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{ \\pm}, \\beta_{ \\pm} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are constants to be determined. Then, the general solutions of (3.11) are given by\n\n$$\nu_{ \\pm}(x)=\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x) \\int_{0}^{x}\\left(\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(y)\\right)^{-1} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x)\\binom{\\alpha_{ \\pm}}{\\beta_{ \\pm}}\n$$\n\nAs the condition\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0^{-}} u_{-}(x)=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0^{+}} u_{+}(x)\n$$\n\nis needed for a solution to be in the domain of the operator, then necessarily\n\n$$\n\\binom{\\alpha_{-}}{\\beta_{-}}=\\binom{\\alpha_{+}}{\\beta_{+}}=\\vdots\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\n\nThis gives the appropriate regularity to the solution for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 2. Our next objective is to determine $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $u_{ \\pm}$decay to zero at infinity. According to (3.10), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{ \\pm}(x) & =\\int_{0}^{x} \\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y) g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\Phi_{z}^{ \\pm}(x)\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\\\\n& =\\int_{0}^{x}\\binom{\\cosh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y)\\right)}{w_{z}^{ \\pm} \\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y)\\right)} \\frac{\\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y)\\right)}{\\frac{w_{z}^{ \\pm}}{w_{z}^{ \\pm}} \\frac{\\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)}{w_{z}^{ \\pm}} \\frac{\\sinh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)}{w_{z}^{ \\pm}} \\cosh \\left(\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x\\right)}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWriting the right-hand side in exponential form, reduces to\n\n$$\nu_{ \\pm}(x)=\\int_{0}^{x} e^{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y)} S_{z}^{ \\pm} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+e^{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x} S_{z}^{ \\pm}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}+\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}(x-y)} T_{z}^{ \\pm} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x} T_{z}^{ \\pm}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nS_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 / w_{z}^{ \\pm} \\\\\nw_{z}^{ \\pm} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad T_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & -1 / w_{z}^{ \\pm} \\\\\n-w_{z}^{ \\pm} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe seek for conditions ensuring $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty} u_{ \\pm}(x)=0$. Since the function $g$ belongs to $L^{2}$ but not necessarily to $L^{1}$, we cannot use directly the Dominated Convergence Theorem. Instead, we appeal to the density of $C_{\\epsilon}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ in $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ as follows. For $\\epsilon>0$ small, let $g_{\\epsilon} \\in C_{\\epsilon}^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ be such that $\\left\\|g-g_{\\epsilon}\\right\\|<\\epsilon$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} T_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\leq & \\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}\\left|T_{z}^{+}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\left|g(y)-g_{\\epsilon}(y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}\\left|T_{z}^{+}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\left|g_{\\epsilon}(y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n\\leq & \\left|T_{z}^{+}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1-e^{-2 \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+} x}}{2 \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}}}\\left\\|g-g_{\\epsilon}\\right\\| \\\\\n& +\\left|T_{z}^{+}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}\\left|g_{\\epsilon}(y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRecall (3.4). Since $\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}>0$, the integrand $e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}\\left|g_{\\epsilon}(y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}$ is bounded by the $L^{1}$ function $\\left|g_{\\epsilon}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}$, then, according to the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left|\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} T_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\leq\\left|T_{z}^{+}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}}}\n$$\n\nBecause $\\epsilon$ is arbitrary, the limit on the left-hand side is zero. In turn, we gather that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} u_{+}(x)=0 & \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} e^{\\mu_{z}^{+} x}\\left(\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} S_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+S_{z}^{+}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)=0 \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad S_{z}^{+}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}=-\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} S_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\alpha+\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}} \\beta=-\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\left(g_{1}(y)+\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}} g_{2}(y)\\right) e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} \\mathrm{~d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the latter note that $\\operatorname{det} S_{z}^{+}=0$.\nSimilarly, by considering the limit to $-\\infty$, we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow-\\infty} u_{-}(x)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\alpha-\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{-}} \\beta=\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}\\left(g_{1}(y)-\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{-}} g_{2}(y)\\right) e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} y} \\mathrm{~d} y\n$$\n\nNow, (3.14)-(3.15) can be re-written as a single linear system of equations,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 / w_{z}^{+} \\\\\n1 & -1 / w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}= & \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} y}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 & -1 / w_{z}^{+} \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) g(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} y}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & -1 / w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right) g(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 / w_{z}^{+} \\\\\n1 & -1 / w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$, then\n\n$$\n\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}=\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} M_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} y} M_{z}^{-} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nM_{z}^{+}=\\frac{-1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nw_{z}^{+} & 1 \\\\\nw_{z}^{+} w_{z}^{-} & w_{z}^{-}\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad M_{z}^{-}=\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\nw_{z}^{-} & -1 \\\\\n-w_{z}^{+} w_{z}^{-} & w_{z}^{+}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nStep 3. We now verify the expression for the matrix integral kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$. Replacing the constant vector $\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ into the formula for $u_{ \\pm}$, gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{ \\pm}(x)= & \\int_{0}^{x} e^{\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} S_{z}^{ \\pm} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} S_{z}^{ \\pm} M_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x+\\mu_{z}^{-} y} S_{z}^{ \\pm} M_{z}^{-} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} T_{z}^{ \\pm} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} T_{z}^{ \\pm} M_{z}^{+} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x+\\mu_{z}^{-} y} T_{z}^{ \\pm} M_{z}^{-} g(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $S_{z}^{+} M_{z}^{+}=-S_{z}^{+}, S_{z}^{+} M_{z}^{-}=0$ and $g=-J f$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{+}(x)= & \\int_{x}^{+\\infty} N_{9, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{0}^{x} N_{5, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} N_{4, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x+y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} N_{3, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} x+\\mu_{z}^{-} y} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, since $T_{z}^{-} M_{z}^{-}=T_{z}^{-}$and $T_{z}^{-} M_{z}^{+}=0$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{-}(x)= & \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} N_{2, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{x}^{0} N_{9, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} N_{1, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x+y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{0}^{+\\infty} N_{8, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} x-\\mu_{z}^{+} y} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nStep 4. So far, we have obtained a solution to (3.7) on $\\mathbb{R}$, which is continuous and decaying at infinity. This solution has the form\n\n$$\nu(x)= \\begin{cases}u_{+}(x) & \\text { if } x \\geq 0 \\\\ u_{-}(x) & \\text { if } x \\leq 0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand has the integral representation\n\n$$\nu(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nas in the statement of Proposition 3.1. To complete the proof, it remains to check that $u \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ and thus $\\mathscr{L}_{m} u=z u+f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$, so that $u \\in H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. This will be the consequence of the next two lemmas, which will be useful in their own right later on.\n\nFirstly, we explicitly compute the matrix norm of the kernel.\nLemma 3.2. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$ be as defined in (3.5). Assume that $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$ is fixed. Let\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{z}(t)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}}}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}}\\left|k_{z} e^{2 \\mu_{z}^{-} t}-1\\right|^{2}+\\left|k_{z} e^{2 \\mu_{z}^{-} t}+1\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}, & \\text { for } t \\leq 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}}}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}}\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+} t}+1\\right|^{2}+\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+} t}-1\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}, & \\text { for } t \\geq 0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nk_{z}=\\frac{w_{z}^{+}-w_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\n$$\n\nThen, $\\varphi_{z}: \\mathbb{R} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$is bounded and continuous, and\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}= \\begin{cases}\\varphi_{z}(\\max \\{x, y\\}) e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{-}|x-y|}, & \\text { for } x<0, y<0 \\\\ \\varphi_{z}(\\min \\{x, y\\}) e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{+}|x-y|}, & \\text { for } x>0, y>0 \\\\ \\varphi_{z}(0) e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{+}|x|-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{-}|y|}, & \\text { for } x>0, y<0 \\\\ \\varphi_{z}(0) e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{-}|x|-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{+}|y|}, & \\text { for } x<0, y>0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProof. The function $\\varphi_{z}$ is continuous, since\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0_{-}} \\varphi_{z}(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\left|w_{x}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\left|w_{x}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right)}}{\\left|w_{x}^{ \\pm}+w_{x}^{-}\\right|}=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0^{+}} \\varphi_{z}(t)\n$$\n\nIt is bounded, since\n\n$$\n\\sup _{t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}} \\varphi_{z}(t) \\leq\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{x}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}}}{2} \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{x}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right)\\left(\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, recall that, for a singular matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}$, the operator norm and the Frobenius norm coincide\n\n$$\n|A|_{L^{2 \\times 2}}=\\sqrt{\\sum_{1 \\leq i, j \\leq 2}\\left|A_{i j}\\right|^{2}}\n$$\n\nIndeed, $\\operatorname{det}\\left(A^{*} A\\right)=0$, therefore the two non-negative eigenvalues of $A^{*} A$ are 0 and $\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(A^{*} A\\right)$. Applying this, alongside a straightforward computation, gives\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}}}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}}\\left|k_{z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|x+y|} \\pm e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|x-y|}\\right|^{2}\\right. \\\\\n\\left.+\\left|k_{z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|x+y|} \\mp e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|x-y|}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}, \\quad \\text { for } \\pm x>0 \\text { and } \\pm y>0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right)}}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right|} e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|x|-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}|y|}, \\quad \\text { for } \\pm x>0 \\text { and } \\pm y<0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFactoring out suitable exponential terms and substitution of the expression (3.18) yields (3.20).\n\nThe next lemma directly implies that the function $u$ given by (3.17) belongs to $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$, and hence $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. This conclusion completes the proof of Proposition 3.1. Additionally, the lemma provides an initial estimate for the upper bound of the resolvent norm of the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. This estimate is derived directly from the explicit expression of $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$ in terms of the supremum of $\\varphi_{z}(t)$, using the Schur Test. We will refine this upper bound in the next section.\n\nLemma 3.3. Let $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash S_{m}$.

From this, (3.23) follows.\n3.2. The spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. According to Proposition 3.1,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\subseteq S_{m}\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is $\\mathcal{T}$-selfadjoint, the residual spectrum is empty [20, Sec. 5.2.5.4] and the first four essential spectra coincide [12, Thm. IX.1.6(ii)]. In this subsection we show that the spectrum coincides exactly with $S_{m}$ and find $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. We treat the case $m=0$ separately.\nCase $m>0$. Let $z^{ \\pm}=\\tau \\pm i$ for fixed $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|\\tau| \\geq m$, so $z^{ \\pm} \\in S_{m}$. Our goal is to construct singular Weyl sequences $\\left(\\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ for $z^{ \\pm}$, to conclude that they are in the appropriate part of the spectrum. With this purpose in mind, let\n\n$$\nu(x)=\\binom{\\sqrt{|m+\\tau|}}{i \\operatorname{sgn}(\\tau) \\sqrt{|m-\\tau|}} e^{i \\sqrt{\\tau^{2}-m^{2}} x}\n$$\n\nwhich is one of the solutions of\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m}-\\tau I\\right) u=0\n$$\n\nfor the free Dirac operator (2.2). Let\n\n$$\n\\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}(x)=c_{n} \\varphi_{n}( \\pm x) u(x)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nc_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2|\\tau|\\left(n+\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}}\n$$\n\nand $\\varphi_{n}$ is the continuous compact support cut-off function given by\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{n}(x)= \\begin{cases}x-n & \\text { for } x \\in[n, n+1] \\\\ 1 & \\text { for } x \\in[n+1,2 n+1] \\\\ 2 n+2-x & \\text { for } x \\in[2 n+1,2 n+2] \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen, $\\left\\|\\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}\\right\\|=1$.\nBy considering the location of the supports and from (3.25), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z^{ \\pm} I\\right) \\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}(x) & =\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m}-\\tau I\\right) \\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}(x) \\\\\n& =c_{n} \\varphi_{n}( \\pm x)\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{m}-\\tau I\\right) u(x)+c_{n}\\left[\\mathcal{D}_{m}-\\tau I, \\varphi_{n}( \\pm x) I\\right] u(x) \\\\\n& = \\pm c_{n} \\varphi_{n}^{\\prime}( \\pm x) J u(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z^{ \\pm} I\\right) \\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}(x)\\right\\|=\\left\\|c_{n} \\varphi_{n}^{\\prime}( \\pm x) J u(x)\\right\\|=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n+\\frac{2}{3}}} \\rightarrow 0\n$$\n\nas $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, indeed, $\\left(\\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a Weyl sequence for $z^{ \\pm}$. Thus, $z^{ \\pm} \\in \\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. This completes the proof that $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=S_{m}$ for all $m>0$, which we will use without further explicit mention.\n\nSince the support of the Weyl sequence moves to infinity, $S_{m} \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 2}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. Consequently, $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} j}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=$ $S_{m}$ for $\\mathrm{j} \\in[[1,4]]$. To further deduce that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=S_{m}\n$$\n\nit suffices to note that $\\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 1}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$ is connected [20, Prop. 5.4.4].\nFinally, observe that $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mu}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\varnothing$. Indeed, the expression of the fundamental matrices (3.9) is also valid for $z \\in S_{m}$. Applying (3.12) with $g=0$ and noting that $\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}=0$ for $z \\in\\{\\tau \\pm i:|\\tau| \\geq m\\}$, we conclude that there are no nontrivial solutions to the eigenvalue equation $\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right) u=0$ that belong to $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Therefore, no point in $S_{m}$ can be an eigenvalue. This completes the description of the spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ for $m>0$.\n\nCase $m=0$. For $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$ and $z^{ \\pm}=\\tau \\pm i$ where $\\tau \\neq 0$, the previous argumentation involving $\\left(\\Psi_{n}^{ \\pm}\\right)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is still applicable, so we know that there exist singular Weyl sequences for $z^{ \\pm} \\neq \\pm i$. On the other hand, for $\\tau=0$, we can choose constant $u(x)=\\binom{1}{0}$ instead of (3.24), which is a solution to the eigenvalue equation (3.25), and run a similar proof as above. Thus, we know up front that\n\n$$\n\\partial S_{0}=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\right\\} \\subset \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 2}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} j}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $\\mathrm{j}=1,3,4$.\nOur focus now is to show that all the points $z$ in the interior of the strip $S_{0}$ are eigenvalues with $\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z$ being a Fredholm operator of index zero.\nLemma 3.4. For $m=0$, let $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$ be defined as in (2.3). Let $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ be such that $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$. Then the following holds true.\na) $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{v_{z}\\right\\}$ where\n\n$$\nv_{z}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\binom{1}{-i} e^{(1-i z) x} & \\text { for } x \\leq 0 \\\\ \\binom{1}{-i} e^{-(1+i z) x} & \\text { for } x \\geq 0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nb) $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}^{*}-z\\right)=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{\\widetilde{v}_{z}\\right\\}$ where\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{v}_{z}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\binom{1}{i} e^{(1+i z) x} & \\text { for } x \\leq 0 \\\\ \\binom{1}{i} e^{-(1-i z) x} & \\text { for } x \\geq 0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nc) $\\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)$ is closed.\nd) The algebraic multiplicity of $z$ is infinite.\n\nProof. Consider once again the equation $\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right) u=f$ as in Subsection 3.1. When $m=0$ and $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$, the quantities $\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}, w_{z}^{ \\pm}$in (3.3) reduce to\n\n$$\n\\mu_{z}^{+}=1+i z, \\quad \\mu_{z}^{-}=1-i z, \\quad w_{z}^{+}=i, \\quad w_{z}^{-}=-i\n$$\n\nWe start with the proof of a). Let $u \\in H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ be a solution to this eigenvalue equation. We know that the restrictions of $u$ to $\\mathbb{R}_{ \\pm}$, match (3.12) with $g=0$, namely\n\n$$\nu_{ \\pm}(x)=e^{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x} S_{z}^{ \\pm}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}+e^{-\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} x} T_{z}^{ \\pm}\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$\n\nwith $(\\alpha, \\beta) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and\n\n$$\nS_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & \\mp i \\\\\n\\pm i & 1\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad T_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & \\pm i \\\\\n\\mp i & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}>0$, the decay of $u$ at $\\pm \\infty$ should match the conditions (3.14) and (3.15) for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Therefore, $\\alpha=i \\beta$. Hence\n\n$$\nu_{+}(x)=\\alpha e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} x}\\binom{1}{-i} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad u_{-}(x)=\\alpha e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} x}\\binom{1}{-i}\n$$\n\nThus, indeed a) is valid. The proof of b) is identical, so we omit it.\nTo confirm c), we will show that $\\overline{\\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)} \\subseteq \\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)$. Take $f \\in \\overline{\\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)}$ and seek for $u \\in H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ such that $\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right) u=f$. Now $u_{ \\pm}$are given in the form (3.12) with $g=-J f$. Since\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}-z\\right)}=\\left(\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}^{*}-\\bar{z}\\right)\\right)^{\\perp}\n$$\n\naccording to b), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}\\left(f_{1}(y)-i f_{2}(y)\\right) e^{(1-i z) y} \\mathrm{~d} y+\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(f_{1}(y)-i f_{2}(y)\\right) e^{-(1+i z) y} \\mathrm{~d} y=0\n$$\n\nBy proceeding as in the proof of Proposition 3.1, this is equivalent to the fact that both right-hand sides of the decaying conditions (3.14) and (3.15) are equal. That is,\n\n$$\n-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left(g_{1}(y)-i g_{2}(y)\\right) e^{-\\mu_{*}^{+} y} \\mathrm{~d} y=\\alpha-i \\beta=\\int_{-\\infty}^{0}\\left(g_{1}(y)-i g_{2}(y)\\right) e^{\\mu_{*}^{-} y} \\mathrm{~d} y\n$$\n\nSet $\\beta=0$. Then\n\n$$\n\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 & i \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(y) e^{-\\mu_{*}^{+} y} \\mathrm{~d} y=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & -i \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} g(y) e^{\\mu_{*}^{-} y} \\mathrm{~d} y\n$$\n\nReplacing these constants in (3.12) and writing the expression back in terms of $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, using $g=-J f$, gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{+}(x)= & C_{1}^{+} \\int_{x}^{+\\infty} e^{\\mu_{*}^{+}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+C_{2}^{+} \\int_{0}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{*}^{+}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +C_{3}^{+} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\mu_{*}^{+}(x+y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{-}(x)= & C_{1}^{-} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{-\\mu_{*}^{-}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y+C_{2}^{-} \\int_{x}^{0} e^{\\mu_{*}^{-}(x-y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& +C_{3}^{-} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{\\mu_{*}^{-}(x+y)} f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor suitable constant matrices $C_{j}^{ \\pm}$. Now, by invoking the Schur Test in identical manner as in the proof of Proposition 3.1 - we omit the details, we find that $u \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ and thus $u \\in H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Hence, indeed $f \\in \\operatorname{Ran}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)$. This completes the proof of $c$ ).\n\nFor the final statement, we invoke [23, Thm. 2.16 in Ch. 2], which establishes that only one of the following cases can occur. Either\n\n$$\n\\Sigma=\\{w \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} w|<1 \\text { and the algebraic multiplicity of } w \\text { is finite }\\}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\Sigma=\\{w \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} w|<1 \\text { and the algebraic multiplicity of } w \\text { is infinite }\\}\n$$\n\nFrom the above, the geometric multiplicity of all $z \\in \\Sigma$ is one. Therefore no point in $\\Sigma$ has algebraic multiplicity zero. Thus, according to [23, Thm. 2.15 in Ch. 2], the set on the right-hand side of the first possibility is countable. But this is not the case for $\\Sigma$, hence, the second possibility is the one that holds. This confirms d) and completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nAccording to Lemma 3.4, we now know that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{int} S_{0}=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\} \\subseteq \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right) \\backslash \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 3}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nCombining this with (3.27), we conclude that indeed\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=S_{0} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} j}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 2}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|=1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor $\\mathrm{j}=1,3,4$. Since no eigenvalue on the left-hand side of (3.31) is isolated, and $S_{0}$ is the closure of its interior, then $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=S_{0}$. Finally, since no point on the lines $\\{\\tau \\pm i: \\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ is an eigenvalue, these lines exactly form the continuous spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{0}$. In summary,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}\n$$\n\nWe have therefore completed the analysis of the spectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ for all $m \\geq 0$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4. The Resolvent norm of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ inside the numerical range \n\nLet $m>0$. In the second part of this section we give the proof of the sharp estimate for the resolvent norm of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ claimed in Theorem 2.1. Before that, and in order to visualise the asymptotic behaviour of the different parameters involved in this proof, we establish a sub-optimal version of the statement. Later on, this preliminary estimate will provide a link with the analysis of the pseudospectrum of the perturbations of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$.\n\nFrom now on, we write $\\tau=\\operatorname{Re} z$ and $\\delta=\\operatorname{Im} z$, often without explicit mention.\n\n4.1. Preliminary estimate. A direct application of the Schur Test gives the next preliminary version of Theorem 2.1.\n\nTheorem 4.1. For $m>0$, let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be given by (2.3). Let $z=\\tau+i \\delta$ for $|\\delta|<1$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\geq \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{2} m \\sqrt{1-\\delta^{2}}}\\left[\\tau^{2}+\\frac{m}{2} \\tau+\\frac{8\\left(1+\\delta^{2}\\right)+4 m(1+\\delta)-m^{2}}{8}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-1}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\text { and } \\\\\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{4}{m\\left(1-\\delta^{2}\\right)}\\left[\\tau^{2}+\\frac{1+\\delta^{2}}{4}+m+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-2}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow+\\infty$. Both limits inside the brackets converge uniformly ${ }^{2}$ for all $|\\delta|<1$ and $m$ on compact set.\nAccording to this statement, the resolvent norm of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ has leading asymptotic behaviour $|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}$, as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$ inside the band forming the numerical range. If we assume that Theorem 2.1 has already been proved, then we see that the leading order coefficient of the upper bound in (4.1) is optimal, up to a factor 4 . However, the leading coefficient of the lower bound is sub-optimal. The latter is a consequence of choosing below a sub-optimal pseudo-mode. We have included this calculation, in order to illustrate the construction of the optimal pseudo-mode for the full proof of the main Theorem 2.1 in the next subsection, without too many technical details.\n\nBefore proceeding to the asymptotic analysis of the coefficients involved, we highlight the connection with recent results of the same nature.\n\nAccording to [15, Thm. 2.2], inside the numerical range the Schr\u00f6dinger operator with a dislocated potential, $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, has a resolvent norm with linear leading order of growth at infinity in $|\\operatorname{Re} z|$. This discrepancy is explained by the fact that $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ is an operator of order 1, therefore the perturbation affects the resolvent by a higher order of magnitude.\n\nWhen the potential is smooth and asymptotic to a dislocation, the effect of the perturbation on the Dirac operator appears to become substantially stronger. For instance, in the case of the operator $\\overline{\\mathscr{L}}=$ $\\mathcal{D}_{m}+i \\frac{2}{x} \\arctan (x) I$, by using the recent results of [19, Thm. 3.11], it might be possible to show that there exists a WKB-pseudomode $\\Psi_{\\tau, n}$, such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\left\\|(\\overline{\\mathscr{L}}-\\tau I) \\Psi_{\\tau, n}\\right\\|}{\\left\\|\\Psi_{\\tau, n}\\right\\|}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-n}\\right)\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This maybe closely linked to the fact that interior singularities of a differential expression would create an exponential growth of the resolvent norm away from the spectrum. The phenomenon could be similar to the one reported recently in [3] for the case of a singular Sturm-Liouville operator and is worthy of further exploration.\n\nWe now give the proof of Theorem 4.1. We split the proof into 3 steps.\nStep 1. The first step is an asymptotic analysis of the parameters involved in the resolvent estimate. This result is useful on its own, and will be invoked repeatedly in later sections.\n\nLemma 4.2. For $m>0$, let $\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}$and $w_{z}^{ \\pm}$be as in (3.3), and let $k_{z}$ be as in (3.19). For indices $p \\in[[-4,2]]$ and parameters\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P} \\in\\left\\{\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}, \\frac{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}}{1 \\mp \\delta}, w_{z}^{ \\pm},\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|, k_{z}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nlet the coefficients $C_{p}(\\mathrm{P}) \\in \\mathbb{C}$ be prescribed in Table 1.

This constant can be replaced by a uniform constant for all $m$ on a compact set.\nProof. We only provide a proof sketch, because the details are lengthy routine calculations.\nThe strategy for each of the parameters $P$, is to find a suitable Taylor expansion from which the coefficients $C_{p} \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are obtained from those of the different powers of $\\frac{1}{\\tau}$. The remainder at power 5 in this expansion,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Here and elsewhere below, we adopt the common say that two function are related by $f(z)=g(z)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-p}\\right)$ as $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$ and that the limit converges uniformly for parameters satisfying a condition, iff there exist a constant $K>0$ independent of $\\tau$ and these parameters, such that $|f(z)-g(z)| \\leq K|\\tau|^{-p}$ for all $|\\tau| \\geq 1$ and all such parameters satisfying the condition.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\ngives the uniform bound in terms of $\\delta$ and $m$.

For $\\mathrm{P}=k_{z}$, we use (3.19) and the expansions of $w_{ \\pm}$.\nConcretely, for $\\mathrm{P}=\\mu_{z}^{+}$, we write $\\mu_{z}^{+}=i \\tau f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)$ where $f$ is analytic near 0 . Expanding in power series at that point, gives\n\n$$\ni \\frac{f(x)}{x}=\\sum_{k=-1}^{4} C_{-k}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{+}\\right) x^{p}+\\frac{x^{5}}{6!} \\int_{0}^{1}(1-s)^{5} f^{(6)}(x s) \\mathrm{d} s\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients $C_{p}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{+}\\right)$coincide with those in Table 1. Moreover, $f^{(6)}$ has a denominator involving a term of the form $\\left(a(\\delta, m) x^{2}+b(\\delta, m) x+1\\right)^{\\frac{12}{12}}$ where $a$ and $b$ are bounded uniformly in both variables. Therefore, taking $|x|$ small enough, ensures that $\\left|f^{(6)}(x)\\right|$ is bounded uniformly in $x,|\\delta|<1$ and $m>0$ in compact sets.\n\nFor the expansion of $\\frac{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}}{1 \\mp \\delta}$, recall that $\\operatorname{Re} \\sqrt{\\gamma}=\\frac{|\\operatorname{Im} \\gamma|}{\\sqrt{2(|\\gamma|-\\operatorname{Re} \\gamma)}}$ for $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\mathbb{R}$, and so\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}}{1 \\mp \\delta}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{1-\\frac{m^{2}+(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}+\\sqrt{\\left(1-\\frac{m^{2}+(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{4(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}}{\\tau^{2}}}}}\n$$\n\nStep 2. Consider the upper bound first. According to Lemma 3.3, we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| & \\leq \\frac{\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right) \\max \\left\\{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|},\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\right\\}}{\\min \\left\\{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}, \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}\\right\\}} \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right)\\left(\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. By Lemma 4.2, the asymptotic behaviour of each of the multiplying terms above is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1 & =\\frac{1}{m} \\tau^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1+\\delta^{2}}{m}-m+1\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right) \\\\\n\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|} & =2+m^{2} \\tau^{-2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}} & =\\frac{1}{1-\\delta^{2}}\\left[2-m^{2} \\tau^{-2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$. Note that the first two coefficients of the terms involving the maximum above are identical. Multiplying and collecting terms, gives the upper bound in (4.1) as required. Observe that the fact that the limit inside the bracket is uniform in the parameters, carries over from the conclusion of Lemma 4.2.\n\nStep 3. Now consider the lower estimate of the resolvent in (4.1). Set a pseudo-mode\n\n$$\n\\psi_{0}(x)=\\binom{1}{w_{2}^{+} } e^{\\mu_{2}^{+} x} \\chi(-\\infty, 0)(x)\n$$\n\nwhich belongs to $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ and has a norm $\\left\\|\\psi_{0}\\right\\|=\\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{x}^{-}\\right|^{2}}}{\\sqrt{2 \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{-}}}$. From the formula of the kernel in (3.5) and considering the location of the support of $\\psi_{0}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1} \\psi_{0}\\right\\|^{2} & \\geq \\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\left|\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} N_{3, z}\\left(\\frac{1}{w_{x}^{+}}\\right) e^{-\\mu_{x}^{+} x+2 \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{x}^{-} y} \\mathrm{~d} y\\right|_{C^{2}}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\\\\n& =\\left|N_{3, z}\\left(\\frac{1}{w_{2}^{+}}\\right)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} ^{2} \\frac{1}{8\\left(\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right) \\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}}}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right|}\\right)^{2} \\frac{1}{8\\left(\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}\\right)^{2} \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| & \\geq \\frac{\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1} \\psi_{0}\\right\\|}{\\left\\|\\psi_{0}\\right\\|} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}\\right)}{\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{-}\\right) \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{+}\\right)}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left|w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAccording to Lemma 4.2, the first bracket is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and the second term is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{2}\\right)$. Multiplying and collecting coefficients, gives the lower estimate of the resolvent in (4.1). We omit further details, but this confirms the validity of Theorem 4.1.\n4.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1. We now establish improved estimates, which enable identifying the sharp constants for the resolvent norm asymptotic of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ in the instability band. These will render Theorem 2.1 as a corollary. The strategy for the computation of the different constants has two parts. We first split the resolvent as the sum of two integral operators,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z I\\right)^{-1}=T_{1}(z)+T_{2}(z)\n$$\n\nwhere the norm of the operator $T_{1}(z)$ carries the leading order behaviour and $\\left\\|T_{2}(z)\\right\\|$ is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ at infinity. We then proceed as in the proof of Theorem 4.1, and compute the asymptotic coefficients of $\\left\\|T_{1}(z)\\right\\|$ and $\\left\\|T_{2}(z)\\right\\|$. In the case of the lower bound, we find a pseudo-mode for $T_{1}(z)$ that is sharp for the leading order, by optimising the contribution of the two components of the wave function in an adaptive manner as $z$ moves towards infinity. For a further discussion on the computation of other coefficients see Remark 4.6 at the end of this section.\n\nThe explicit formulas of the two integral operators is the following. For $j=1,2$,\n\n$$\nT_{j}(z) f(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{R}_{j, z}(x, y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}(x, y)= \\begin{cases}N_{1, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x+y)}, & \\text { for }\\{y<x<0\\} \\\\ N_{3, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+} x+\\mu_{z}^{-} y}, & \\text { for }\\{y<0<x\\} \\\\ N_{4, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x+y)}, & \\text { for }\\{0<y<x\\} \\\\ N_{7, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x+y)}, & \\text { for }\\{0<x<y\\} \\\\ N_{8, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-} x-\\mu_{z}^{+} y}, & \\text { for }\\{x<0<y\\} \\\\ N_{10, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x+y)}, & \\text { for }\\{x<y<0\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}(x, y)= \\begin{cases}N_{2, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)}, & \\text { for }\\{y<x<0\\} \\\\ 0, & \\text { for }\\{y<0<x\\} \\\\ N_{5, z} e^{-\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}, & \\text { for }\\{0<y<x\\} \\\\ N_{6, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{+}(x-y)}, & \\text { for }\\{0<x<y\\} \\\\ 0, & \\text { for }\\{x<0<y\\} \\\\ N_{9, z} e^{\\mu_{z}^{-}(x-y)}, & \\text { for }\\{x<y<0\\}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nRecall the definition of the matrices $N_{k, z}$ at the beginning of Section 3.\n\nA crucial reason for the split of the resolvent in this fashion is to observe that the term $\\frac{1}{w_{s}^{+}+w_{s}^{-}}$is the only one responsible for the quadratic growth of the norm and that this term appears only in $N_{k, z}$ for $k \\in\\{1,3,4,7,8,10\\}$. Moreover, now the kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}$ is separable, therefore a sharp upper bound on its norm is obtained by means of H\u00f6lder's Inequality.\n\nFor $j \\in[[1,10]]$, we denote $n_{j}=n_{j}(z)=\\left|N_{j, z}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$. The fact that $\\operatorname{det} N_{j, z}=0$ and substitution give\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nn_{1}=n_{10}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\frac{w_{s}^{+}-w_{s}^{-}}{w_{s}^{+}+w_{s}^{-}}\\right|\\left(\\left|w_{s}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{s}^{-}\\right|}\\right), & n_{2}=n_{9}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|w_{s}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{s}^{-}\\right|}\\right) \\\\\nn_{3}=n_{8}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\left|w_{s}^{+}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\left|w_{s}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right)}}{\\left|w_{s}^{+}+w_{s}^{-}\\right|}, & n_{4}=n_{7}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\frac{w_{s}^{+}-w_{s}^{-}}{w_{s}^{+}+w_{s}^{-}}\\right|\\left(\\left|w_{s}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{s}^{+}\\right|}\\right) \\\\\nn_{5}=n_{6}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|w_{s}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{s}^{+}\\right|}\\right) . &\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNote that the asymptotic of all the terms in the formulas for $n_{j}$ are available from the calculations performed in the previous subsection. Also note that the operator norms of $\\mathcal{R}_{j, z}$ are symmetric with respect to the axis $y=x$, as was the case for $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$.\n\nThe next proposition gives explicit bounds for the norm of the leading operator $T_{1}(z)$. The match of all terms in these bounds except $\\widetilde{B}_{z}$ and $B_{z}$ is the main ingredient that enables the sharp constants below. For $z \\neq 0$, we write\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{csgn}(z)=\\frac{z}{|z|}\n$$\n\nProposition 4.3. Let $m>0$. Let the operator $T_{1}(z)$ be as in (4.4)-(4.5).

Similarly, for $x \\geq 0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\mathrm{~d} y & =\\int_{0}^{x} n_{5} e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{s}^{+}(x-y)} \\mathrm{d} y+\\int_{x}^{+\\infty} n_{6} e^{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{s}^{+}(x-y)} \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& =\\frac{n_{5}}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{s}^{-}}\\left(2-e^{-\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{s}^{+}x}\\right) \\leq \\frac{n_{5}}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{s}^{+}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $n_{5}=n_{6}$. Now recall that $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}=\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}(y, x)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$. Hence, by virtue of the Schur Test, the claimed conclusion follows.\n\nWith the bounds for the norms of the components $T_{j}(z)$ at hand from the previous two propositions, we are now in the position to tackle Theorem 2.1. This will be a direct consequence of the following theorem, which gives slightly more refined asymptotic estimates. This theorem is one of the main contributions of this paper and it directly implies Theorem 2.1.\n\nTheorem 4.5. For $m>0$, let $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ be the dislocated Dirac operator (2.3). Let $z=\\tau+i \\delta$ for $|\\delta|<1$. Then, as $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{m\\left(1-\\delta^{2}\\right)}\\left[\\tau^{2}+\\mathrm{P}_{0}^{+}+\\mathrm{P}_{-2}^{+} \\tau^{-2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\text { and } \\\\\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\geq \\frac{1}{m\\left(1-\\delta^{2}\\right)}\\left[\\tau^{2}+\\mathrm{P}_{0}^{-}+\\mathrm{P}_{-2}^{-} \\tau^{-2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}_{0}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(3+2 \\delta^{2}-2 m^{2}\\right) \\pm 2 m, \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{-2}^{+}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(3 m^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\left(9 m^{2}-8\\right)\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{-2}^{-}=\\frac{1}{8}\\left(5 m^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\left(19 m^{2}-16\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe limits inside the brackets converge uniformly for all $|\\delta|<1$ and $m$ on compact sets.\nThe remainder of this subsection is devoted to sketching the proof of this theorem. That involves computing the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions of the various terms in the expressions (4.8). We only give the intermediate results in the computation of these coefficients.\n\nCoefficients for $\\left(A_{z}-C_{z}\\right)^{2}$.

This gives,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|T_{1}(z)\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{m\\left(1-\\delta^{2}\\right)}\\left[\\tau^{2}+\\mathrm{P}_{0}+\\mathrm{P}_{-2} \\tau^{-2}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{P}_{0}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(3+2 \\delta^{2}-2 m^{2}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\mathrm{P}_{-2}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(3 m^{2}+\\delta^{2}\\left(9 m^{2}-8\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nCoefficients for $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\left(A_{z}-C_{z}\\right)^{2}+\\widetilde{B}_{z}^{2}+A_{z}+C_{z}+2 D_{z}}}$.

According to (4.2)-(4.3), we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|T_{2}(z)\\right\\| \\leq\\left(n_{2}+n_{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}}+\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{1-\\delta^{2}}\\left(2+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\tau^{-4}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$. Thus, we complete the proof of Theorem 4.5, by combining the asymptotic formulas (4.14)(4.15) with this and invoking the triangle inequality.\n\nRemark 4.6. We suspect that with some more effort, it is possible to show that there exists $\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|=\\frac{1}{1-|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}}\\left(\\frac{1}{m}|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2}+\\frac{1}{2 m}\\left[|\\operatorname{Im} z|^{2}+\\mathrm{P}_{0}\\right]+\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{-2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ is a constant independent of $z$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathrm{P}_{0}\\right| \\leq \\frac{3}{2}+4 m+m^{2}\n$$\n\nNote that the only point left to show here is that the coefficient $\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ actually exists. The bound on its magnitude follows directly from our Theorem 4.5. Two comments on this are in place.\n\n- To prove this claim, one possibility is to find sharp lower bounds for $\\left\\|T_{2}(z)\\right\\|$, then feed into the final step above. This might not be easy and a more refined construction of pseudomodes seems to be needed.\n- To confirm existence of $\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ without control on $\\left\\|T_{2}(z)\\right\\|$, perhaps it is possible to begin by proving that the function\n\n$$\ns_{1}(\\tau, \\delta)=\\frac{1}{\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-\\tau-i \\delta\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|}\n$$\n\nbeing the first singular value of the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m}-\\tau-i \\delta$, is real analytic in the variables $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\delta \\in(-1,1)$. This might follow from the fact that $\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z$ is an integral operator with coefficients analytic in $z$, but it is not automatic and an analysis of its multiplicity is required.",

{"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. Perturbations of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ by a long-range potential \n\nWe now consider perturbations of the form $\\mathscr{L}_{m}+V$ where $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$. To aid the reader through this section, we recall the hypotheses,\n\nH2: $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<1$,\nH3: $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right) \\cap L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ for some $p \\in(1, \\infty]$.\nEither will be assumed throughout.\nOur main goal in the first part of the section is to identify a closed extension, $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V} \\supseteq \\mathscr{L}_{m}+V$, which is well defined under either assumptions and preserves the essential spectra. Then, in the second part, we examine the spectrum and pseudospectrum of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ inside the instability band, $\\Sigma=\\{|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}$.\n\nSubsection 5.2 is devoted to the proof of the main Theorem 2.5 about the localisation of the point spectrum for $m>0$. Subsection 5.3 addresses confirmation that there can be potentials with infinitely many eigenvalues in the instability band. Subsection 5.4 discusses the effect of weak coupling, when imposing further concrete hypotheses on the decay and regularity of $V$, and comprises the proof of Theorem 2.7. Finally the proof of Theorem 2.4 about the pseudospectrum is given in Subsection 5.5.\n5.1. Proof of Proposition 2.3. In order to show the existence of the closed extension $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$, and determine its spectrum and pseudospectrum, our main tool is the Birman-Schwinger-type principle formulated in [13]. We quote that result in Theorem A. 1 and apply it as follows.\n\nSet the Hilbert spaces $\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{X}=L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Set the unperturbed operator $H_{0}=\\mathscr{L}_{m}$. The auxiliary factors $A$ and $B$ take the following form. Write\n\n$$\nV(x)=U(x)|V(x)|\n$$\n\nin polar form, where $U(x)$ is the partial isometry and $|V(x)|=\\left(V^{*}(x) V(x)\\right)^{1 / 2}$. We set\n\n$$\nA(x)=|V(x)|^{1 / 2} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B(x)=U(x)|V(x)|^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThen, we have\n\n$$\n|A(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}=|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}^{1 / 2}=|B(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}\n$$\n\nThe first equality follows from the property that the norm of the square root of a matrix equals the square root of the norm of the matrix itself. To establish the second equality in (5.2), observe that $\\operatorname{Ker}(|V(x)|) \\subset$ $\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(|V(x)|^{1 / 2}\\right)$. Consequently, we have $\\overline{\\operatorname{Im}\\left(|V(x)|^{1 / 2}\\right)} \\subset[\\operatorname{Ker}(U(x))]^{\\perp}$, because $\\operatorname{Ker}(|V(x)|)=\\operatorname{Ker}(U(x))$, cf. [5, Prop. 2.85]). Hence, as $U(x)$ is a partial isometry, it follows that\n\n$$\n|B(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}=\\sup _{|v|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}=1}}|U(x)| V(x)|^{1 / 2} v|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}=\\sup _{|v|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}=1}}| | V(x)|^{1 / 2} v|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}}=|A(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}=|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{2}}^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThe operators $A$ and $B$ denote the multiplication operators\n\n$$\nA f(x)=A(x) f(x) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B f(x)=B(x) f(x)\n$$\n\nwith their maximal domains. By construction, they are both closed and densely defined. For each $z \\in$ $\\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$, let\n\n$$\nR_{0}(z)=\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad Q(z)=\\overline{A R_{0}(z) B}\n$$\n\nThis settles the framework of Theorem A.1.\nNow we give the proof of Proposition 2.3. We split it into three steps. In the first step we verify that the hypotheses (B1) and (B2) of Theorem A. 1 hold, for all $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$. In the second step we verify that (B3) is implied by either of the two different assumptions, H2 or H3. In the final step we derive the claims made about the spectrum.\nStep 1: conditions (B1) and (B2). Let $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$. Our goal is to show that, for suitable $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$,\n(B1) the operator $R_{0}(z) B$ is closable, and both $A R_{0}(z)$ and $\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}$ are bounded;\n(B2) the operator $A R_{0}(z) B$ has a bounded closure $Q(z)=\\overline{A R_{0}(z) B}$.\nFirstly, note that the Schur Test conditions,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left[\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right]_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{n} \\mathrm{~d} y \\leq K_{n}(z), & \\text { for a.e. } x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left[\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right]_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{n} \\mathrm{~d} x \\leq K_{n}(z), & \\text { for a.e. } y \\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nholds for all fixed $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The proof of this is the same as for the case of the power $n=1$, addressed in the verification of (3.23), as the integration only involves exponential functions. Here\n\n$$\nK_{n}(z)=\\frac{2}{n \\min \\left\\{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}, \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}\\right\\}}\\left(\\sup _{t \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\varphi_{z}(t)\\right)^{n}\n$$\n\n$\\varphi_{z}$ is as in (3.18) and $K_{n}(z)$ is finite for each $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$.\nNow, since $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\subset L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ and $|V|^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$, it follows that $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}(A)$. Given that\n\n$$\nR_{0}(z): L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\longrightarrow H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwe have $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A R_{0}(z)\\right)=L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$. Therefore, $A R_{0}(z)$ is closed and hence bounded by the Closed Graph Theorem. This confirms the second requirement in (B1). Moreover, $A R_{0}(z)$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. Indeed, from (5.2) and (5.3) with $n=2$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}|A(x) \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} y & \\leq \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n& \\leq K_{2}(z)\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we also have\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left[\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) B(y)\\right]_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} y \\leq K_{2}(z)\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}\n$$\n\nand thus the integral operator\n\n$$\nf(\\cdot) \\longmapsto \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathcal{R}_{z}(\\cdot, y) B(y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nis Hilbert-Schmidt. But the latter is an extension of the operator $R_{0}(z) B$, thus $R_{0}(z) B$ is closable. Furthermore, since the domain $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}(B)$ is dense in $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R} ; \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ and the integral operator above is continuous, $\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}$ coincides with it. This completes the confirmation of (B1).\n\nNow, we address (B2). Once again we appeal to the Schur Test, in order to show that $A R_{0}(z) B$ has a bounded closure. But now we consider the weight,\n\n$$\np(x)= \\begin{cases}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{1 / 2} & \\text { if }|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}>0 \\\\ 1 & \\text { if }|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}=0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nAccording to (5.2), for almost every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|A(x) \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) B(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} p(y) \\mathrm{d} y & \\leq p(x) \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} p(y)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n& =p(x) \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}|V(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\mathrm{~d} y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand, for almost every $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|A(x) \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) B(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} p(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\leq p(y) \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\mathrm{~d} x\n$$\n\nSince $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$ and $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$ (recall Lemma 3.2), then by the Schur Test, the integral operator\n\n$$\nf(\\cdot) \\longmapsto \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} A(\\cdot) \\mathcal{R}_{z}(\\cdot, y) B(y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\n$$\n\nis bounded. Thus, since $H^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}(A), \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A R_{0}(z) B\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}(B)$, and since $\\operatorname{Dom}(B)$ is dense, continuity implies that $Q(z)$ is equal to this integral operator. Moreover,\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq \\sup _{y \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\mathrm{~d} x\n$$\n\nThis ensures the validity of (B2).\nStep 2: hypothesis (B3) and existence of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$. We now need to verify that\n(B3) $\\left\\{z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right):-1 \\in \\rho(Q(z))\\right\\} \\neq \\varnothing$.\nWe split the proof into the two sub-cases depending on the hypothesis on $V$.\nFirst, assume that $\\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{2}$ is the one condition that holds. According to (5.6), (3.20) and (3.21), for all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\sup _{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}{2}\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right) \\max \\left\\{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFrom (3.3) and (3.19), it follows that $w_{i \\delta}^{ \\pm} \\rightarrow-i$ and $k_{i \\delta} \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\delta \\rightarrow \\infty$. Thus, the terms inside the maximum become close to 2 as $\\delta \\rightarrow \\infty$. Since $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<1$, then indeed (B3) follows taking $z$ on the imaginary axis with sufficiently large modulus.\n\nNow, if instead condition H3 holds for $p \\in(1, \\infty]$, by Holder's inequality and (5.3), we get\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq\\|V(x)\\|_{L^{p}}\\left(K_{q}(z)\\right)^{1 / q}, \\quad \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1\n$$\n\nTherefore, a similar argument as the previous sub-case, yields $K_{q}(z) \\rightarrow 0$ for $z$ on the imaginary axis with sufficiently large modulus. Hence, (B3) is also valid under assumption H3.\n\nAs a conclusion to this step we now have that, by virtue of the first part of Theorem A.1, a closed extension $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V} \\supseteq \\mathscr{L}_{m}+V$ indeed exists and\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}-z\\right)^{-1}=R_{0}(z)-\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}(I+Q(z))^{-1} A R_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nfor all $z$ such that $-1 \\in \\rho(Q(z))$. Note that, under the hypotheses, the latter is non-empty.\n\nStep 3: conclusions 1) -4) of the proposition. The crucial point in the proof is to observe that $A R_{0}(z)$ and $\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}$ are Hilbert-Schmidt operators, therefore the difference\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}-\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}-z\\right)^{-1}=\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}(I+Q(z))^{-1} A R_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nis compact. The stability of the first four essential spectra follows directly from [12, Thm. IX.2.4]. Moreover, when $m>0, \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 1}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}\\right)$ has one connected component, then $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{e} 5}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}\\right)$ in that case is also identical to the other essential spectra, cf. [20, Prop. 5.5.4]. This confirms the conclusions 1) and 2).\n\nThe rest of the proof assumes that $m=0$. In that case, notice that $k_{z}=0$ and $\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|=1$. For 3), observe that by direct substitution into (5.7), we have that, if $V$ satisfies $\\mathbf{H 2}$, then $\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<1$ for all\n\n$$\nz \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=\\mathbb{C} \\backslash\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z| \\leq 1\\}\n$$\n\nHence $-1 \\in \\rho(Q(z))$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1$. That is, any eigenvalue of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ should all be located in the strip $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z \\leq 1\\}$ as claimed.\n\nFinally, for 4), if $V$ satisfies $\\mathbf{H 3}$ instead, the estimate (5.8), the fact that\n\n$$\n\\min \\left\\{\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{+}, \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{-}\\right\\}=|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1 \\quad \\text { for } \\quad|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1\n$$\n\nand that $\\varphi_{z}(t)=1$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, ensure that\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{p}}\\left(\\frac{2}{q(|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1)}\\right)^{1 / q}, \\quad q=\\frac{p}{p-1}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1\\}$. Hence, for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $|\\operatorname{Im} z|>1+\\frac{2}{q}\\|V\\|_{L^{p}}^{q}$, the right-hand side is strictly smaller than 1 . This gives 4) for $p<\\infty$. For the case $p=\\infty$, note that $\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}\\right) \\subset$ $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\|V\\|_{\\infty}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{0}\\right)$ (from the second equality in (1.3)). This completes the proof of Proposition 2.3.\n\nFor later purposes, note that the operator $Q(z)$ is also Hilbert-Schmidt. Indeed, the identities (5.2), (3.20) and (3.21), yield\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}|A(x) \\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y) B(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{2} \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n& \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{2} \\sup _{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}}\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{2}}{4} \\max \\left\\{\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right)^{2}\\left(\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|}\\right)^{2},\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right)^{2}\\left(\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\right)^{2}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the right-hand side is finite for each $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$.\nWe close this subsection with a remark that provides the context of our findings about perturbations of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ by long-range potentials.\n\nRemark 5.1. In the case of long-range perturbations of the dislocated Schr\u00f6dinger operator $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\mathrm{~d} x^{2}}+i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)$, considered in [15, Subsec. 5.1], the condition $V \\in L^{1}(\\mathbb{R})$ alone gives the existence of a closed extension directly, via the associated quadratic forms. The distinction with the present case and the need for the condition $\\mathbf{H} \\mathbf{2}$ can be explained through the behaviour of the resolvent kernel, as follows.\n\nThe estimates around [15, Est. (5.6)], ensure that the $L^{\\infty}$ norm of the kernel of the unperturbed resolvent for the Schr\u00f6dinger model decays to zero as $z \\rightarrow \\infty$ along the imaginary axis. By contrast, the kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)$ in the present case does not have a decaying $L^{\\infty}$ norm. Effectively, the right-hand sides in (3.20) and (3.21) do not decay to zero. Note that this is analogous to the contrast between the free Schr\u00f6dinger kernel and the free particle Dirac kernel. For details, see [8, Form. (13)-(14)].\n\n5.2. Proof of Theorem 2.5. The Proposition 2.3, which has been already proven, provides a general statement about exclusion regions (semi-planes) for the eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{0, V}$. We now proceed to give the proof of the first main result of this section, Theorem 2.5. This theorem, in a similar vein, describes regions of exclusion for the eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ in the case $m>0$. Thus, for the remainder of this subsection, we assume that $m \\neq 0$.\n\nOur main arguments involve deriving upper bound for the norm of the Birman-Schwinger operator, $Q(z)$, introduced in (5.6). To achieve this, we give sharp estimates on the matrix norm of the kernel in various regions of the complex $z$-plane. Specifically, we partition the resolvent set into three main disjoint regions as follows:\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)=D \\cup W \\cup U\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nW= & \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Re}(z)| \\geq 5 m / 2,|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\} \\\\\nD= & D(m+i) \\cup D(-m+i) \\cup D(-m-i) \\cup D(m-i) \\quad \\text { for } \\\\\n& D(m \\pm i)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right):\\left|\\begin{array}{l}\n\\operatorname{Re}(z-(m \\pm i)) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Im}(z-(m \\pm i))\n\\end{array}\\right| \\leq 3 m / 2,\\right\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n& D(-m \\pm i)=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right):\\left|\\begin{array}{l}\n\\operatorname{Re}(z-(-m \\pm i)) \\\\\n|\\operatorname{Im}(z-(-m \\pm i))| \\leq 3 / 2\n\\end{array}\\right|, \\quad \\text { and }\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nU=\\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\backslash(D \\cup W)\n$$\n\nSee Figure 5.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5. Partition of the resolvent set of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$ in subdomains for the proof of Theorem 2.5.\n\nWe split the proof of Theorem 2.5 according to this partition, deriving suitable estimates for the norm of $Q(z)$ where $z$ is in each of the sub-regions. In this proof, the parameters $c_{j} \\equiv c_{j}(m)>0$ only depend on $m$.\n\nEstimates on $D$. The region $D \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ is the union of four neighbourhoods of singularities of the matrix kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{z}$. We will see that these singularities are removable. That is, the matrix norm $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}$ is bounded uniformly for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, whenever $z \\in D( \\pm m \\pm i)$. We treat each different component separately.\n\nConsider first that $z \\in D(m+i)$. From the formulae of $\\mu_{z}^{+}, w_{z}^{ \\pm}$in (3.3) and $k_{z}$ in (3.19), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim _{z \\rightarrow m+i} w_{z}^{+}=0, & \\lim _{z \\rightarrow m+i} w_{z}^{-}=\\frac{\\sqrt{-1-i m}}{\\sqrt{m^{2}+1}} \\\\\n\\lim _{z \\rightarrow m+i} \\frac{\\mu_{z}^{+}}{w_{z}^{+}}=2 m, & \\lim _{z \\rightarrow m+i} k_{z}=-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen, we gather the following. According to (3.20), for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $x y \\leq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq \\varphi_{z}(0)=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}\\right)\\left(1+\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right)}}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right|} \\leq c_{1}\n$$\n\nAccording to (3.21), for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $x \\leq 0, y \\leq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq \\sup _{t \\leq 0} \\varphi_{z}(t) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right)\\left(\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|}\\right) \\leq c_{2}\n$$\n\nAccording to (3.20), for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq \\varphi_{z}(\\min \\{x, y\\})\n$$\n\nNow, for all $t \\geq 0$, we know that\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{z}(t)=\\frac{\\sqrt{1+\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}}}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|^{2}}\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}+1\\right|^{2}+\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}-1\\right|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nBecause of (5.10), the term that we should take care of is $\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}+1\\right|$, as it might potentially exhibit a singularity. We show that this is not the case. Indeed, from (3.19) and (5.10), for $z \\in D(m+i)$ and $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\left|k_{z} e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}+1\\right| & =\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\left|k_{z}\\left(e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}-1\\right)+1+k_{z}\\right| \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\left|k_{z}\\left(e^{-2 \\mu_{z}^{+}t}-1\\right)+\\frac{2 w_{z}^{+}}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{\\left|\\mu_{z}^{+}\\right|}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}\\right|}\\left|k_{z}\\right||t|+\\frac{2}{\\left|w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right|} \\\\\n& \\leq c_{3}(|t|+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere we have used the inequality $\\left|e^{-z}-1\\right| \\leq|z|$ for $\\operatorname{Re} z \\geq 0$. Thus, for all $z \\in D(m+i)$ and $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq \\varphi_{z}(\\min \\{x, y\\}) \\leq c_{4}\\left(1+|\\min \\{x, y\\}|\\right) \\leq c_{5} \\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x)\n$$\n\nFinally, by virtue of (5.6), combining the above estimates we obtain,\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq c_{6} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in D(m+i)$.\nNow let $z \\in D(m-i)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\lim _{z \\rightarrow m-i} w_{z}^{-}=0, & \\lim _{z \\rightarrow m-i} w_{z}^{+}=\\frac{\\sqrt{-1+i m}}{\\sqrt{m^{2}+1}} \\\\\n\\lim _{z \\rightarrow m-i} \\frac{\\mu_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{-}}=2 m, & \\lim _{z \\rightarrow m-i} k_{z}=1\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nBy means of an identical proof to the one given in the previous region, we can show that if $x y \\leq 0$ then (5.11) holds true and if $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$ then (5.12) holds true. We omit the details of that. Moreover, in the case $x \\leq 0$ and $y \\leq 0$, the term $\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{-}\\right|}\\left|k_{z} e^{2 \\mu_{z}^{-} t}-1\\right|$ is bounded by $c_{7}(|t|+1)$. Thus, we gather that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} & \\leq \\varphi_{z}(\\max \\{x, y\\}) \\leq c_{8}(1+|\\max \\{x, y\\}|) \\\\\n& \\leq c_{9}\\left(1+\\min \\{|x|,|y|\\}\\right) \\leq c_{10} \\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, by virtue of (5.6), we also obtain the estimate (5.14) for all $z \\in D(m-i)$, perhaps with a larger constant $c_{6}$.\n\nNow, let $z \\in D(-m+i)$.

Hence, combining the estimates, once again we gather that (5.14) also holds true for all $z \\in D(-m+i)$.\n\nFinally, the case $z \\in D(-m-i)$ is similar to the case $z \\in D(-m+i)$, so we omit further details.

According to the estimates (5.18) on $D,(5.20)$ on $U$ and (5.21) on $W$, we conclude that there exists a constant $C(m)>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{C(m)}\\|V\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\operatorname{dr} r_{1}\\right)} \\quad \\text { for all } z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\backslash W\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{C(m)^{2}}(\\operatorname{Re} z)^{2}\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\quad \\text { for all } z \\in W\n$$\n\nHence, if we assume $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}\\left(\\operatorname{dr} r_{1}\\right)}<C(m)$, it follows that $\\|Q(z)\\|<1$ for all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\backslash W$. Hence, -1 is not in the spectrum of $Q(z)$ whenever $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\backslash W$. Theorem A.2, thus implies that all points in $\\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right) \\backslash W$ are not eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$. Moreover, the points $z \\in W$ satisfying $|\\operatorname{Re} z|<C(m) \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}}$ cannot be eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$. Therefore, we deduce that the eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ (if there is any), should lie in the subset of $W$, corresponding to real part larger than or equal to $C(m) \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}}$. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.5 .\n5.3. Step potentials. In this subsection we construct a potential $V \\in L^{1}$ such that $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ has infinitely many eigenvalues inside the instability band. We compute explicitly the eigenfunctions by means of an argument similar to the one employed in the proof of Proposition 3.1. We end the subsection by giving the proof of Proposition 2.6.\n\nSet\n\n$$\nV_{a, b}(x)=(-i \\operatorname{sgn}(x)-b) \\chi_{[-a, a]}(x) I\n$$\n\nfor $a>0$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Let $m=0$. Then, directly from the definition it follows that $w_{z}^{0}$ takes one of two values, $\\pm i$, depending on the location of $z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash\\{ \\pm m-b\\}$. Moreover, substitution shows that, $|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1$, iff $w_{z}^{+}=i$ and $w_{z}^{-}=-i$. Also, we directly see that $z=m-b$ or $z=-m-b$ are eigenvalues, if $|\\operatorname{Im} b|<1$. This gives the first conclusion of Proposition 2.6.\n\nLet $m>0$. We show the existence of infinitely many large real eigenvalues. Since, $\\left(w_{z}^{0}+w_{z}^{+}\\right)\\left(w_{z}^{0}+w_{z}^{-}\\right) \\neq 0$ whenever $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then (5.25) reduces to\n\n$$\ne^{i 4 a \\sqrt{(z+b)^{2}-m^{2}}}=\\frac{\\left(w_{z}^{0}-w_{z}^{+}\\right)\\left(w_{z}^{0}-w_{z}^{-}\\right)}{\\left(w_{z}^{0}+w_{z}^{+}\\right)\\left(w_{z}^{0}+w_{z}^{-}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNow, $\\cot (w)=i \\frac{e^{i 2 w}-1}{e^{i 2 w}+1}$ for $w \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and note that $w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-} \\neq 0$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Thus, we can rewrite this equation as\n\n$$\n\\cot \\left(2 a \\sqrt{(z+b)^{2}-m^{2}}\\right)=-i \\frac{\\left(w_{z}^{0}\\right)^{2}+w_{z}^{+} w_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{0}\\left(w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side of this expression is real for real $z$ with sufficiently large modulus. Indeed,\n\n$$\n-i \\frac{\\left(w_{z}^{0}\\right)^{2}+w_{z}^{+} w_{z}^{-}}{w_{z}^{0}\\left(w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}\\right)}= \\begin{cases}S(z) & \\text { if } z>m-b \\\\ -S(z) & \\text { if } z<-m-b\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nS(z)=\\sqrt{\\frac{z+m+b}{z-m+b}} \\frac{(z-m+b) \\sqrt{(z+m)^{2}+1}-(z+m+b) \\sqrt{(z-m)^{2}+1}}{2(z+m+b) \\operatorname{Re}(\\sqrt{z+m+i \\sqrt{m+i}-z})}\n$$\n\nSince,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{z \\rightarrow+\\infty} S(z)=\\lim _{z \\rightarrow-\\infty} S(z)=b\n$$\n\nby periodicity, we have infinitely many positive and negative solutions. This is the second statement in Proposition 2.6, and completes its proof.\n5.4. The weakly coupled model. At the end of this subsection we give the proof of Theorem 2.7, about localisation of the discrete spectrum for a potential of the form $\\epsilon V$ in the asymptotic regime $|\\epsilon| \\rightarrow 0$, where $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu_{1}\\right)$ satisfies additional hypotheses.\n\nRecall (2.9),\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{dis}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) \\subseteq\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1,|\\operatorname{Re} z|>\\frac{C(m)}{|\\epsilon|^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHence, for small enough $|\\epsilon|$, the eigenvalues of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}$ lie in the instability band\n\n$$\n\\Sigma=\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1\\}\n$$\n\nand they escape to infinity in the regime $|\\epsilon| \\rightarrow 0$ at a rate proportional to $|\\epsilon|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ or faster. We now formulate a more precise statement about this, for $V$ satisfying a faster decay rate at infinity. The next result is a precursor of Theorem 2.7 and it is one of the main contributions of this paper. We recall that the expression of the densities $\\nu_{k}^{\\prime}$ are given in Section 2 in the paragraph above Theorem 2.7.\nTheorem 5.2. Let $m>0$ and let $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} ; \\mathrm{d} \\nu_{2}\\right)$. Let\n\n$$\n\\Upsilon_{z}=\\frac{1}{2\\left(4|z|^{2}+m^{2}\\right)}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-(2 z+m)^{2} & i\\left(4 z^{2}-m^{2}\\right) \\\\\ni\\left(4 z^{2}-m^{2}\\right) & (2 z-m)^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{C}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{dis}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) \\subset\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}:|\\operatorname{Im} z|<1, \\frac{4 m}{4|z|^{2}+m^{2}}=W_{z}(\\epsilon)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nW_{z}(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-2\\left(|z|+i\\left(z-\\frac{m^{2}}{2 \\operatorname{Re} z}\\right) x\\right)} \\langle V(x), \\overline{\\Upsilon_{z}}\\rangle_{\\mathrm{F}} \\mathrm{~d} x+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nin the regime $|\\epsilon| \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nThe verification of the validity of this statement occupies most of this subsection. The explicit dependence on $z$ of $W_{z}(\\epsilon)$ and the constant in the limit, will be established below. The proof of (5.28) will invoke Theorem A. 2 once again. Note that the Birman-Schwinger operator associated to $e V$ is $\\epsilon Q(z)$. We test whether $z \\in \\Sigma$ does not belong to $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, e V}\\right)$, by testing whether $-1 \\notin \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\epsilon Q(z))$. However, for this we will not appeal directly to estimates for the norm $\\|\\epsilon Q(z)\\|$ as we did in Subsection 5.2. Instead, we will find a criterion, involving $W_{z}(\\epsilon)$, to test whether the operator $\\epsilon Q(z)+1$ is bijective. Since $Q(z)$ is compact (see the paragraph above Remark 5.1), this is a test on whether $-1 \\notin \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\epsilon Q(z))$.\n\nThe position of the discrete spectrum is associated with sub-regions of $\\Sigma$ where the norm of the resolvent is singular. In Subsection 4.2, we isolated the singular part of the unperturbed kernel through the term $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}$. Since the latter still carries the leading order information about the singularities of the perturbed kernel (under small enough perturbations), we now consider a decomposition of the kernel of the integral operator associated to $Q(z)$ that takes the singular contribution of $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}$ into account. For this we proceed as follows.\n\nLet\n\n$$\nQ(z)=L(z)+M(z)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nL(z) f(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} A(x) \\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y) B(y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y, \\quad \\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y)=e^{-\\eta_{z}(x)-\\eta_{z}(y)} U_{z} \\\\\n\\eta_{z}(w)=i\\left(z-\\frac{m^{2}}{2 \\operatorname{Re} z}\\right) w+|w| \\quad \\text { and } \\quad U_{z}=\\frac{1}{8 m}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-(2 z+m)^{2} & i\\left(4 z^{2}-m^{2}\\right) \\\\\ni\\left(4 z^{2}-m^{2}\\right) & (2 z-m)^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThen, as we shall see below, $L(z)$ is a rank-one operator for all $z \\in \\Sigma$ and it carries the leading order contribution of the norm of $Q(z)$ in the asymptotic regime $|\\operatorname{Re} z| \\rightarrow \\infty$. Notably, the kernel $\\mathcal{L}_{z}$ encodes the contribution of the singular part of $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}$ in this regime, while $\\|M(z)\\|$ is uniformly bounded with respect to $z$. Before proving all this, we motivate this decomposition and determine the asymptotic coefficients of the different terms involved in the argument. Recall the notation $z=\\tau+i \\delta$ for $\\tau, \\delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $|\\delta|<1$.\n\nOn the one hand, we note that the expression of the powers $\\eta_{z}(w)$, is motivated by the fact that\n\n$$\n-\\eta_{z}(w)= \\begin{cases}\\eta_{z}^{-} w & \\text { if } w \\leq 0 \\\\ -\\eta_{z}^{+} w & \\text { if } w \\geq 0\\end{cases} \\quad \\eta_{z}^{-}=(1+\\delta)-i\\left(\\tau-\\frac{m^{2}}{2 \\tau}\\right), \\quad \\eta_{z}^{+}=(1-\\delta)+i\\left(\\tau-\\frac{m^{2}}{2 \\tau}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta_{z}^{ \\pm}$are the leading order coefficients in the expansion of the terms $\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}$:\n\n$$\n\\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\eta_{z}^{ \\pm}+\\frac{m^{2}(1 \\mp \\delta)}{2 \\tau^{2}}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{|\\tau|^{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow+\\infty$. See Lemma 4.2 and Table 1.\nOn the other hand, the expression of the matrix $U_{z}$, has a more involved motivation which is given after the following lemma.\n\nLemma 5.3. Let the matrices appearing in the expression of the kernel $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}$ in (4.5) be $N_{j, z}$, as defined at the beginning of Subsection 3.1. Let\n\n$$\nU_{r+i \\delta}^{0}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{1}{2 m} \\tau^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i \\delta}{m}\\right) \\tau & \\frac{1}{2 m} \\tau^{2}-\\frac{\\delta}{m} \\tau \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2 m} \\tau^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i \\delta}{m}\\right) \\tau\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen, $N_{j, z}=U_{z}^{0}+\\widehat{N}_{j, z}$ where\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widehat{N}_{j, \\tau+i \\delta}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}=\\mathcal{O}(1)\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow \\infty$ for all $j \\in\\{1,3,4,7,8,10\\}$.\nProof. By writing\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}=\\frac{-i}{4 m}\\left[(m+i+z) \\mu_{z}^{+}-(m-i+z) \\mu_{z}^{-}\\right]\n$$\n\nwe get that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}+w_{z}^{-}}=\\frac{1}{2 m} \\tau^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i \\delta}{m}\\right) \\tau+\\left(\\frac{1-\\delta^{2}}{2 m}-\\frac{m}{4}+\\frac{i \\delta}{2}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\n\nas $|\\tau| \\rightarrow 0$. The claimed asymptotic formula is achieved by substituting the expansions of $w_{z}^{ \\pm}, \\frac{1}{w_{z}^{+}}$and this expression, into the formulas of the different $N_{j, z}$. See Lemma 4.2.\n\nNow we return to the motivation for the expression of $U_{z}$. We pick the latter, so that it approximates all the matrices $N_{j, z}$ up to order $\\tau$. Indeed, writing $U_{z}$ in terms of $\\tau$ and $\\delta$, gives\n\n$$\nU_{\\tau+i \\delta}=U_{\\tau+i \\delta}^{0}+U_{\\delta}^{1}\n$$\n\nfor $U_{z}^{0}$ as in Lemma 5.3 and\n\n$$\nU_{\\delta}^{1}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{2 m}-\\frac{m}{8}-\\frac{i \\delta}{2} & -i\\left(\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{2 m}+\\frac{m}{8}\\right) \\\\\n-i\\left(\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{2 m}+\\frac{m}{8}\\right) & -\\frac{\\delta^{2}}{2 m}+\\frac{m}{8}-\\frac{i \\delta}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that for all $z \\in \\Sigma$, $\\operatorname{det} U_{z}=0$ and $U_{z}$ is of rank one. Then, the matrix norm of $U_{z}$ can be computed explicitly,\n\n$$\n\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}=\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}=\\frac{|z|^{2}}{m}+\\frac{m}{4}\n$$\n\nWe are now ready to formulate the crucial step in the proof of Theorem 5.2.\nLemma 5.4. Let $V \\in L^{1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}, \\mathrm{~d} \\nu_{2}\\right)$. For $A(x)$ and $B(y)$ as in (5.1), let $L(z)$ be the integral operator (5.29) and let $M(z)=Q(z)-L(z)$. Let $\\Upsilon_{z}=\\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}} U_{z}$ be as in (5.27). Then\n\n$$\nL(z) f=\\left(\\frac{|z|^{2}}{m}+\\frac{m}{4}\\right)\\left\\langle f, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle \\phi_{z}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\psi_{z}(w)= \\begin{cases}e^{-\\eta_{z}(w)} B(w)^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11}}{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{12}}\\right) & \\text { if } z \\neq \\frac{-m}{2} \\\\\ne^{-\\eta_{z}(w)} B(w)^{T}\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{21}}{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{22}}\\right) & \\text { if } z=\\frac{-m}{2}\\end{cases} \\\\\n& \\phi_{z}(w)= \\begin{cases}e^{-\\eta_{z}(w)} A(w)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{21} /\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11}}\\right) & \\text { if } z \\neq \\frac{-m}{2} \\\\\ne^{-\\eta_{z}(w)} A(w)\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{12} /\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{22}}{1}\\right) & \\text { if } z=\\frac{-m}{2}\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, there exists a constant $C(m)>0$ such that $\\left\\|M_{z}\\right\\| \\leq C(m)$ for all $z \\in \\Sigma$.\nProof. Assume first that $z \\neq \\frac{-m}{2}$. Since $U_{z}$ is singular and non-zero, then\n\n$$\nU_{z}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\\n\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{21} /\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{11}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{11} & \\left(U_{z}\\right)_{12}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, we can rewrite the action of the operator $L_{z}$ in the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nL_{z} f(x) & =\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-\\eta_{z}(x)-\\eta_{z}(y)} A(x)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\\n\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{21} /\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11} \\quad\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{12}\\right) B(y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\\\\n& =\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-\\eta_{z}(y)}\\left(\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11} \\quad\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{12}\\right) B(y) f(y) \\mathrm{d} y\\right) \\phi_{z}(x) \\\\\n& =\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left\\langle f(y), \\overline{\\psi_{z}(y)}\\right\\rangle_{\\mathbb{C}^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} y\\right) \\phi_{z}(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the claimed expression for the operator $L_{z}$.\nBoth vector-valued functions $\\psi_{z}$ and $\\phi_{z}$ belong to $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$ because $\\operatorname{Re} \\eta_{z}^{ \\pm}=1 \\mp \\delta>0$ and thus, for all $z \\in \\Sigma \\backslash\\left\\{-\\frac{m}{2}\\right\\}$\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\psi_{z}\\right\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{1 / 2} \\sqrt{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11}^{2}+\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{22}^{2}}, \\quad\\left\\|\\phi_{z}\\right\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{1 / 2} \\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{21}^{2}}{\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{11}^{2}}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that, for all $z \\in \\Sigma \\backslash\\left\\{-\\frac{m}{2}\\right\\}, L_{z}$ is an operator of rank-one and\n\n$$\n\\left\\|L_{z}\\right\\|=\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left\\|\\psi_{z}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\phi_{z}\\right\\| \\leq\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}\n$$\n\nNow, to achieve the same conclusion for $z=-\\frac{m}{2}$, we can just write the matrix $U_{z}$ in different form, as\n\n$$\nU_{z}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{12} /\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{22} \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\left(U_{z}\\right)_{21} & \\left(U_{z}\\right)_{22}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nand follow the same argument as above.\nNext, let us complete the proof of the lemma by showing the validity of the claim made about $M_{z}$. Let\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{z}(x, y)=\\mathcal{R}_{z}(x, y)-\\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y)\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{z}(x, y)=\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}(x, y)-\\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y)\\right)+\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}(x, y)\n$$\n\nBy virtue of (4.6), (4.7) and Lemma 4.2, it follows that there exists a constant $c_{1}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{2, z}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq c_{1}\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\tau| \\geq 1$.\nLet us now show that the difference of $\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}-\\mathcal{L}_{z}$ is also uniformly bounded. Let\n\n$$\n\\mu_{z}(x)= \\begin{cases}\\mu_{z}^{-} x & \\text { if } x \\leq 0 \\\\ -\\mu_{z}^{+} x & \\text { if } x \\geq 0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}(x, y)=N_{j, z} e^{\\mu_{z}(x)+\\mu_{z}(y)}\n$$\n\nfor $j$ chosen depending on the signs of $x$ and $y$ as in (4.5). For all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, write\n\n$$\n\\Lambda_{z}(x, y)=\\mu_{z}(x)+\\eta_{z}(x)+\\mu_{z}(y)+\\eta_{z}(y)\n$$\n\nThen,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}(x, y)-\\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y)=U_{z}\\left(e^{\\Lambda_{z}(x, y)}-1\\right) e^{-\\eta_{z}(x)-\\eta_{z}(y)}+\\left(N_{j, z}-U_{z}\\right) e^{\\mu_{z}(x)+\\mu_{z}(y)}\n$$\n\nSince $\\operatorname{Re} \\Lambda_{z}(x, y)<0$ for all $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and by virtue of (5.30), considering $|\\tau|$ sufficiently large so that $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{+}+\\eta_{z}^{+}\\right)>0$ and $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\mu_{z}^{-}+\\eta_{z}^{-}\\right)>0$, gives\n\n$$\n\\left|e^{\\Lambda_{z}(x, y)}-1\\right| \\leq\\left|\\Lambda_{z}(x, y)\\right| \\leq \\frac{c_{2}}{\\tau^{2}}(|x|+|y|)\n$$\n\nTherefore, since $\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}(x)<0$ and $\\operatorname{Re} \\eta_{z}(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, according to Lemma 5.3 and to (5.31), we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{1, z}(x, y)-\\mathcal{L}_{z}(x, y)\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}\\left|e^{\\Lambda_{z}(x, y)}-1\\right|+\\left|N_{j, z}-U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\leq c_{3}(|x|+|y|+1)\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\tau| \\geq \\tau_{0}$.\nFrom (5.36) and (5.37) it follows that, by taking the Hilbert-Schmidt norm in the decomposition (5.35),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|M(z)\\|^{2} & \\leq c_{4} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}}(1+|x|+|y|)^{2}|V(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\mathrm{~d} x \\mathrm{~d} y \\\\\n& \\leq c_{5}\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} \\nu_{2}^{\\prime}}(x) \\mathrm{d} x\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(y)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2} \\nu_{2}^{\\prime}}(y) \\mathrm{d} y\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the right-hand side is finite and independent of $z$, for all $|\\tau| \\geq \\tau_{0}$. On the other hand, according to (5.34) for $L(z)$, and (5.22)-(5.23) for $Q(z)$, the triangle inequality yields,\n\n$$\n\\|M(z)\\| \\leq\\|Q(z)\\|+\\|L(z)\\| \\leq c_{6} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}|V(x)|_{\\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}} \\nu_{1}^{\\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x<\\infty\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\tau| \\leq \\tau_{0}$, where the right-hand side is also independent of $z$. This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nWith this lemma at hand, we complete the proof of Theorem 5.2 as follows.\nProof of Theorem 5.2. Since $\\|M(z)\\|$ is uniformly bounded for all $z \\in \\Sigma$, the operator $I+\\epsilon M(z)$ is invertible whenever\n\n$$\n0<\\epsilon<\\frac{1}{C(m)}\n$$\n\nAssume this from now on. Then, since\n\n$$\nI+\\epsilon Q(z)=I+\\epsilon(L(z)+M(z))=(I+\\epsilon M(z))\\left(I+\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z)\\right)\n$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$\nz \\in \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow-1 \\in \\operatorname{Spec}(\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z))\n$$\n\nBy virtue of Lemma 5.4, $L(z)$ is a rank-one operator. Therefore, $\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z)$ is also a rank-one operator, such that\n\n$$\n\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z) f=\\epsilon\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left\\langle f, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} \\phi_{z}\n$$\n\nHence, $\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z)$, being a compact operator on the infinite-dimension Hilbert space $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2}\\right)$, has spectrum\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Spec}\\left(\\epsilon(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} L(z)\\right)=\\left\\{0, \\epsilon\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left\\langle(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} \\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThus, from (5.38) and by writing $\\left(I+\\epsilon M(z)\\right)^{-1}=I-\\epsilon M(z)(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1}$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nz \\in \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right) & \\Longleftrightarrow-1=\\epsilon\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\\left\\langle\\left(I+\\epsilon M(z)\\right)^{-1} \\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}=-\\epsilon\\left\\langle\\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle+\\epsilon^{2}\\left\\langle M(z)(I+\\epsilon M(z))^{-1} \\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{4 m}{4|z|^{2}+m^{2}}=W_{z}(\\epsilon)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{z}(\\epsilon)$ is the right-hand side of the second line in this expression. This is (5.28).\nWe complete the proof by confirming the claimed asymptotic formula for $W_{z}(\\epsilon)$. Notice that,\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle=-\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}(x)}\\left\\langle V(x), \\overline{\\Upsilon_{z}}\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{F}} \\mathrm{~d} x\n$$\n\nbecause $V(x)=B(x) A(x)$ and $\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{12}=\\left(\\Upsilon_{z}\\right)_{21}$. Now,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left\\langle M(z)\\left(I+\\epsilon M(z)\\right)^{-1} \\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\|M(z)\\|}{1-\\epsilon\\|M(z)\\|}\\left\\|\\phi_{z}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\psi_{z}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{\\left\\|M_{z}\\right\\|\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}{1-\\epsilon\\left\\|M_{z}\\right\\|} \\leq c_{7}\n$$\n\nThis is a consequence of (5.33) and the fact that $\\|M(z)\\|$ is uniformly bounded on $\\Sigma$, and it completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nProof of Theorem 2.7. As setting in (5.39), we write\n\n$$\nW_{z}(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon a_{z}+\\epsilon^{2} b_{z}(\\epsilon)\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{z}=-\\left\\langle\\phi_{z}, \\overline{\\psi_{z}}\\right\\rangle$ is independent of $\\epsilon$ and $\\left|b_{z}(\\epsilon)\\right| \\leq c_{1}$ for all $z \\in \\Sigma$ and sufficiently small $|\\epsilon|$.\nWe aim to show that there exists a constant $c_{2}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{\\tau+i \\delta}\\right| \\leq \\frac{c_{2}}{\\left|U_{\\tau+i \\delta}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\tau| \\geq 1$. To establish this, we first use integration by parts twice to obtain the following results:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} e^{-2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}(x)} v(x) \\mathrm{d} x= & \\left(\\frac{1}{4\\left(\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\right)^{2}}-\\frac{1}{4\\left(\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-}\\right)^{2}}\\right) v^{\\prime}(0)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-}}+\\frac{1}{2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}}\\right) v(0) \\\\\n& +\\frac{1}{4\\left(\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-}\\right)^{2}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-} x} v^{\\prime \\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x+\\frac{1}{4\\left(\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} e^{-2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{+} x} v^{\\prime \\prime}(x) \\mathrm{d} x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor any $v \\in W^{2,1}(\\mathbb{R})$. Now, from the expressions for $\\eta_{z}^{ \\pm}$, it follows that for suitable constants $c_{k}>0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-}}+\\frac{1}{2 \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}}\\right|=\\frac{1}{\\left|\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{-} \\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\right|} \\leq \\frac{c_{3}}{\\tau^{2}} \\leq \\frac{c_{4}}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{1}{\\left|\\eta_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\right|^{2}} \\leq \\frac{c_{5}}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}\n$$\n\nfor all $|\\tau| \\geq 1$. Since the Frobenius norm of $\\Upsilon_{z}$ is one, setting $v(x)=\\left\\langle V(x), \\overline{\\Upsilon_{z}}\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{F}}$ gives\n\n$$\n\\left|v^{(j)}(x)\\right| \\leq\\left|V^{(j)}(x)\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}\n$$\n\nfor $j \\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Hence, according to (5.40), we have that (5.41) is indeed valid under the hypothesis $V \\in W^{2,1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}^{2 \\times 2}\\right)$.\n\nAccording to Theorem 5.2, $z$ belongs to $\\operatorname{Spec}_{\\text {dis }}\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}\\right)$ if and only if\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}=W_{z}(\\epsilon)\n$$\n\nTo satisfy this condition, $z$ must be in $\\Sigma$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}-\\epsilon a_{z}\\right|=\\epsilon^{2}\\left|b_{z}(\\epsilon)\\right|\n$$\n\nThen, $z$ should meet the requirement\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}}\\left(1-\\epsilon c_{2}\\right) \\leq \\epsilon^{2} c_{1}\n$$\n\nTherefore, there must exists a constant $c_{6}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}} \\leq c_{6} \\epsilon^{2}\n$$\n\nfor all sufficiently small $|\\epsilon|$. Consequently, for $z$ to be an eigenvalue of $\\mathscr{L}_{m, \\epsilon V}$ when $|\\epsilon|$ is small, we require\n\n$$\n|\\operatorname{Re} z|^{2} \\geq c_{7}\\left|U_{z}\\right|_{\\mathrm{F}}>c_{8} \\epsilon^{-2}\n$$\n\nThis condition ensures the validity of Theorem 2.7.\n\n5.5. Proof of Theorem 2.4. Assume that $V$ satisfies the condition H2. According to Proposition 2.3, we know that $Q(z)=\\overline{A R_{0}(z) B}$ is well defined for all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$. Moreover, by virtue of (5.9),\n\n$$\n\\|Q(z)\\| \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\frac{\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right) \\max \\left\\{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|}\\right\\}}{2}\n$$\n\nfor all such $z$. Recall the set $U$ defined in Subsection 5.2 and recall that (5.19) is valid for all $z \\in U$. Then, for $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}<\\frac{2}{c_{14}(m)}=: C(m),\\|Q(z)\\|<1$ and so\n\n$$\n\\left\\|(1+Q(z))^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{C(m)}{C(m)-\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in U$. Now, from (5.4) and (5.5), we have\n\n$$\n\\max \\left\\{\\left\\|\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\\right\\|,\\left\\|A R_{0}(z)\\right\\|\\right\\} \\leq\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{\\left(\\left|k_{z}\\right|+1\\right) \\max \\left\\{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|+\\frac{1}{\\left|w_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right|}\\right\\}}{2\\left(\\min \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in \\rho\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}\\right)$.\nConsider the minimum in the denominator of the right-hand side. Since $\\operatorname{Re} \\sqrt{\\gamma}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{|\\gamma|+\\operatorname{Re} \\gamma}$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\left(\\tau^{2}-m^{2}-(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}\\right)^{2}+4(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2} \\tau^{2}}+m^{2}+(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}-\\tau^{2}}\n$$\n\nHence, since $\\tau^{2} \\geq \\tau^{2}-m^{2}$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\tau^{2}-m^{2}-(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}\\right)^{2}+4(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2} \\tau^{2} & \\geq\\left(\\tau^{2}-m^{2}-(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}\\right)^{2}+4(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}\\left(\\tau^{2}-m^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\tau^{2}-m^{2}+(1 \\mp \\delta)^{2}\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} \\geq|1 \\mp \\delta|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and so $\\min \\operatorname{Re} \\mu_{z}^{ \\pm} \\geq|\\delta|-1$ for all $|\\delta|>1$.\nGathering the estimates above, we then have that, if $\\|V\\|_{L^{1}} \\leq C(m)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}-z\\right)^{-1}-\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| & \\leq\\left\\|\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\left(I+Q(z)\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|\\left\\|A R_{0}(z)\\right\\| \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}}{(\\|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1) C(m)\\left(C(m)-\\|V\\|_{L^{1}}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in U$. Moreover, since $U$ lies outside the numerical range of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$, then\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(\\mathscr{L}_{m}-z\\right)^{-1}\\right\\| \\leq \\frac{1}{|\\operatorname{Im} z|-1}\n$$\n\nfor all $z \\in U$.

{"section_id": 6, "text": "# Appendix A. Abstract Birman-Schwinger principle \n\nIn order to characterise the domain of the operator $\\mathscr{L}_{m, V}$ in terms of the resolvent of $\\mathscr{L}_{m}$, we follows the classical approach of [17], which was extended to the non-selfadjoint regime in [13]. We include precise details of this construction in this appendix, as the abstract framework might be applicable to other families of operators related to perturbations of $\\mathscr{D}_{m}$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$ be two Hilbert spaces. Let $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}\\right) \\subset \\mathcal{H}, \\operatorname{Dom}(A) \\subset \\mathcal{H}$ and $\\operatorname{Dom}(B) \\subset \\mathcal{K}$ be three dense subspaces. Let\n\n$$\nH_{0}: \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}\\right) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}, \\quad A: \\operatorname{Dom}(A) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{K} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad B: \\operatorname{Dom}(B) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}\n$$\n\nbe three closed operators, such that $H_{0}$ has a non-empty resolvent set. Let\n\n$$\nR_{0}(z)=\\left(H_{0}-z I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{-1}, \\quad z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe consider the following hypotheses.\n(B1) For some (and hence all) $z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)$,\n\n- the operator $R_{0}(z) B$ is closable, the closure $\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}: \\mathcal{K} \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}$ is bounded,\n- and the operator $A R_{0}(z): \\mathcal{H} \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{K}$ is bounded.\n(B2) For some (and hence all) $z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)$, the operator $A R_{0}(z) B$ has a bounded closure,\n\n$$\nQ(z)=\\overline{A R_{0}(z) B}: \\mathcal{K} \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{K}\n$$\n\n(B3) The set\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}=\\left\\{z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right):-1 \\in \\rho(Q(z))\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis non-empty.\nFor all $z \\in \\mathrm{R}$, we let\n\n$$\nR(z)=R_{0}(z)-\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z): \\mathcal{H} \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}\n$$\n\nTheorem A.1. Assume that the closed operators $H_{0}, A$ and $B$ are related in the above manner, and that (B1)-(B3) hold true. Then, there exists a closed densely defined extension ${ }^{4}$\n\n$$\nH \\supseteq H_{0}+B A: \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Dom}(B A) \\longrightarrow \\mathcal{H}\n$$\n\nwhose resolvent is given by\n\n$$\n\\left(H-z I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{-1}=R(z), \\quad \\text { for all } z \\in \\mathrm{R}\n$$\n\nThe conclusion of Theorem A. 1 can be found in [13, Thm. 2.3], assuming the slightly more stringent conditions [13, Hyp. 2.1 (i)];\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}(A) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}^{*}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(B^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this appendix we show that the assumption (B1) also ensures the claimed conclusion.\nProof. We split the proof into four steps.\nStep 1. Let $z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)$, then the product $A R_{0}(z) B$ is always closable. Indeed, we claim that $A R_{0}(z) B$ is densely defined and its adjoint is also densely defined, see [25, Thm. 1.8 (i)]. The former is an immediate consequence of (B1), so that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A R_{0}(z) B\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}(B)\n$$\n\nFor the latter, according to [25, Prop. 1.7], we know that\n\n$$\n\\left(A R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*} \\supset\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*} A^{*}\n$$\n\nThen, by virtue of [25, Thm. 1.8 (ii)], $\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*}=\\left(\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\\right)^{*}$, so by (B1) we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*} A^{*}\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A^{*}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $A$ is closed, $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ and thus $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(\\left(A R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*}\\right)$ are dense in $\\mathcal{K}$.\nStep 2. Let $z \\in \\mathrm{R}$. Our second task is to construct a closed densely defined operator, $H(z)$, such that\n\n$$\nR(z)=\\left(H(z)-z I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor this purpose, firstly observe that\n\n$$\n\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}(\\mathcal{K}) \\subset \\operatorname{Dom}(A) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad Q(z)=A \\overline{R_{0}(z) B}\n$$\n\nIndeed, for $f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(B)$ and $g \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A^{*}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle R_{0}(z) B f, A^{*} g\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}=\\left\\langle A R_{0}(z) B f, g\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{K}}=\\langle Q(z) f, g\\rangle_{\\mathcal{K}}\n$$\n\nHere the second equality is valid as a consequence of (A.2). Thus, the continuity of $\\overline{R_{0}(z) B}$ and $Q(z)$, combined with the density of $\\operatorname{Dom}(B)$ in $\\mathcal{K}$, imply\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\overline{R_{0}(z) B} f, A^{*} g\\right\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}=\\langle Q(z) f, g\\rangle_{\\mathcal{K}}\n$$\n\nfor all $f \\in \\mathcal{K}$ and $g \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(A^{*}\\right)$. This gives (A.4).\nNow, multiplying $R(z)$ by $A$ on the left, according to (A.1) and (A.4), we get that\n\n$$\nA R(z)=A R_{0}(z)-Q(z)\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z)=\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nThis yields the following. If $R(z) f=0$, where $f \\in \\mathcal{H}$, then $A R_{0}(z) f=0$. Hence, by (A.1), $R_{0}(z) f=0$ and so $f=0$. That is, $R(z)$ is necessarily injective.\n\nThe adjoint of $R(z)$ is given by\n\n$$\nR(z)^{*}=R_{0}(z)^{*}-\\left(A R_{0}(z)\\right)^{*}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*}\n$$\n\nBy virtue of [25, Thm. 1.8 (ii) \\& Prop. 1.7 (ii)], we gather that $Q(z)^{*}=B^{*}\\left(A R_{0}(z)\\right)^{*}$. In conjunction with (A.5), this yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nB^{*} R(z)^{*} & =\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*}-Q(z)^{*}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*} \\\\\n& =\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left(R_{0}(z) B\\right)^{*}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Here $\\operatorname{Dom}(B A)=\\left\\{f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(A): A f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(B)\\right\\}$.\n\nReasoning out as proving the injection of $R(z)$ as above by using (A.5) and (A.6), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ker}\\left(R(z)^{*}\\right)=\\{0\\}\n$$\n\nHence $R(z)(\\mathcal{K})$ is dense in $\\mathcal{H}$.\nFor each $z \\in \\mathrm{R}$, we can then set $H(z)=R(z)^{-1}+z I_{\\mathcal{H}}$. By construction, $H(z)$ is a closed densely defined operator satisfying (A.3). Note that $H(z)$ is ensured to be closed as a consequence of [25, Thm. 1.8 (vi)].\nStep 3. We now show that the operator $H(z)$ from the previous step, does not depend on $z \\in \\mathrm{R}$.\nLet $z_{1}, z_{2} \\in \\mathrm{R}$. Then, $H\\left(z_{j}\\right)$ are such that\n\n$$\nR\\left(z_{j}\\right)=\\left(H\\left(z_{j}\\right)-z_{j} I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $H\\left(z_{1}\\right)=H\\left(z_{2}\\right)$. To prove this claim, note that $R(z)$ satisfies the resolvent identity\n\n$$\nR\\left(z_{1}\\right)-R\\left(z_{2}\\right)=\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) R\\left(z_{2}\\right) R\\left(z_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIndeed, by (A.1), (A.8) and (A.9), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) R\\left(z_{2}\\right) R\\left(z_{1}\\right)= & R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)-R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)-\\left[\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)} \\bar{B}-\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}\\right]\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& -\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A\\left[R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)-R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& +\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left[Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)-Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right]\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & R\\left(z_{1}\\right)-R\\left(z_{2}\\right)+\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}\\left[\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)\\right)^{-1}-\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\right] A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& +\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left[Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)-Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right]\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{1}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\\\\n= & R\\left(z_{1}\\right)-R\\left(z_{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy multiplying both sides of (A.7) by $H\\left(z_{2}\\right)-z_{2} I_{\\mathcal{H}}$ on the left, we get\n\n$$\n\\left(H\\left(z_{2}\\right)-z_{2} I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right) R\\left(z_{1}\\right)-I_{H}=\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) R\\left(z_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\left(H\\left(z_{2}\\right)-z_{1} I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right) R\\left(z_{1}\\right)=I_{\\mathcal{H}}\n$$\n\nMultiplying this identity by $H\\left(z_{1}\\right)-z_{1} I_{\\mathcal{H}}$ on the right, ensures that $H\\left(z_{1}\\right)=H\\left(z_{2}\\right)$ as claimed above. We can therefore write $H=H(z)$.\nStep 4. We complete the proof by showing that $H$ is an extension of the operator $H_{0}+B A$.\nLet $z \\in \\mathrm{R}$ and let $f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}+B A\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(H_{0}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{Dom}(B A)$. We set $g=\\left(H_{0}-z I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right) f$. It follows from (A.1) and (A.6) that\n\n$$\nR(z)=R_{0}(z)-\\overline{R(z) B} A R_{0}(z)\n$$\n\nand thus that $R(z) g=f-R(z) B A f$. This completes the proof of the theorem.\nThe next comments about the validity of the hypotheses (B1) and (B2), when moving $z$, as now in place. The next observations was used in the step 3 in the proof of Theorem A. 1 and will be useful in the proof of Theorem A.2. Here, $z_{1}, z_{2} \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)$.\n\nIf $A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) \\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})$, then $A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) \\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})$. Indeed, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) & =A\\left[R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)+\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\supseteq \\underbrace{A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})}+\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right) \\underbrace{A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})} \\underbrace{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H})}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn particular, since the domain of the right-hand side is total $\\mathcal{H}$, we obtain\n\n$$\nA R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)=A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right)+\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right) A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, $A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) \\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})$.\nIf $R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B$ is closable and $\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B} \\in L(\\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{H})$, then $R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B$ is also closable and $\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B} \\in L(\\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{H})$. Indeed, since $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)=\\operatorname{Dom}(B)$ which is densely define, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)^{*} & =\\left[R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B+\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*} \\\\\n& \\supseteq\\left[R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right)\\left[R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*} \\\\\n& =\\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\\right)^{*}}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right) \\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\\right)^{*}}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})} \\underbrace{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)^{*}}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H})}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used [25, Prop. 1.6 (vi)] for the inclusion and [25, Prop. 1.7(ii) \\& Theo. 1.8 (ii)] for the last equality. Since the domain of the right-hand side is total $\\mathcal{H}$, we deduce that\n\n$$\n\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)^{*}=\\overline{\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right)^{*}}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right) \\overline{\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right)^{*}} R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)^{*} \\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})\n$$\n\nTherefore, from [25, Thm. 1.8 (i) \\& (ii)], $R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B$ is closable and $\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}=\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)^{* *}$ belongs to $L(\\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{H})$, as claimed. Moreover, the following identity holds true,\n\n$$\n\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}-\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B}=\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) \\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\n$$\n\nIf $\\overline{A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B} \\in L(\\mathcal{K})$, then $\\overline{A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B} \\in L(\\mathcal{K})$. This can be proved in the same manner as above:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)^{*}= & {\\left[A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B+\\left(z_{2}-z_{1}\\right) A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*} } \\\\\n\\supset & {\\left[A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right)\\left[A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right]^{*} } \\\\\n= & \\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\\right)^{*}}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{K})}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right) \\underbrace{\\left(\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\\right)^{*}}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{H}, \\mathcal{K})} \\underbrace{\\left(A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)^{*}\\right.}_{\\in L(\\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{H})} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOnce again, since the domain of the right-hand side is total $\\mathcal{K}$,\n\n$$\n\\left(A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) B\\right)^{*}=\\overline{\\left(A R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right)^{*}}+\\left(\\overline{z_{2}}-\\overline{z_{1}}\\right) \\overline{\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B\\right)^{*}}\\left(A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right)^{*} \\in L(\\mathcal{K})\\right.\n$$\n\nand the conclusion follows. Moreover, we get the formula\n\n$$\nQ\\left(z_{1}\\right)-Q\\left(z_{2}\\right)=\\left(z_{1}-z_{2}\\right) A R_{0}\\left(z_{2}\\right) \\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{1}\\right) B}\n$$\n\nTheorem A.2. Assume that the closed operators $H_{0}, A$ and $B$ are related in the above manner, and that (B1)-(B3) hold true. Additionally, assume that R has at least two elements. Then, for all $z \\in \\rho\\left(H_{0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\nz \\in \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(H) \\quad \\text { if and only if } \\quad-1 \\in \\operatorname{Spec}_{\\mathrm{p}}(Q(z))\n$$\n\nProof. We first show that the left-hand side implies the right-hand side. Let $f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(H) \\backslash\\{0\\}$ be such that $H f=z f$. Let $z_{0} \\in \\mathrm{R} \\backslash\\{z\\}$. The equation $H f=z f$ is equivalent to $f=\\left(z-z_{0}\\right) R\\left(z_{0}\\right) f$. By virtue of (A.1), the latter happens if and only if\n\n$$\n\\left(H_{0}-z I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) f=-\\left(z-z_{0}\\right) \\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) B}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) f\n$$\n\nBy setting $v=\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) f \\neq 0$ and applying $\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z)$ on both sides, we obtain\n\n$$\nv=-\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}(z) \\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) B} v\n$$\n\nThen, according to (A.9),\n\n$$\nv=\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)-Q(z)\\right) v \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad Q(z) v=-v\n$$\n\nIn other words, -1 is the eigenvalue of $Q(z)$ with the eigenfunction $v$, as the right-hand side of the conclusion states.\n\nWe now show the converse. Assume that $Q(z) v=-v$ for some $v \\in \\mathcal{K} \\backslash\\{0\\}$. Take $z_{0} \\in \\mathrm{R} \\backslash\\{z\\}$ and write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nv & =v-\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q(z)\\right) v=\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)-Q(z)\\right) v \\\\\n& =\\left(z_{0}-z\\right)\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) \\overline{R_{0}(z) B} v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, in the last step, we applied (A.9). By setting $f=-\\overline{R_{0}(z) B} v \\neq 0$, we get\n\n$$\nv=\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)\\left(I_{\\mathcal{K}}+Q\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right)^{-1} A R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) f\n$$\n\nThen, applying $\\overline{R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) B}$ on both sides, and using (A.8) and (A.1), we gather that\n\n$$\n-f+\\left(z-z_{0}\\right) R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right) f=\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)\\left(R_{0}\\left(z_{0}\\right)-R\\left(z_{0}\\right)\\right) f\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to $\\left(z-z_{0}\\right)\\left(H-z_{0} I_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right)^{-1} f=f$ and thus, $f \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(H)$ and $H f=z f$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n\nD.K. and T.N.D. were supported by the EXPRO grant number 20-17749X of the Czech Science Foundation (GA\u010cR).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[1] AIM workshop: Mathematical aspects of physics with non-self-adjoint operators. http://www.aimath.org/pastworkshops/ nonselfadjoint.html, June 2015.
