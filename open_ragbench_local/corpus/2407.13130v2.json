InTRODUCTION\n\nThe theory of weak solutions of the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations started with the fundamental works of Bedford and Taylor [2, 3]. It has found numerous profound applications in complex geometry (see e.g. the survey [31]). The H\u00f6lder continuous solutions are interesting because such functions often appear in complex dynamic in higher dimension as potentials of Green currents associated to dominating holomorphic maps [16] and [32], as well as in approximation theory [29].\n\nThanks to a series of works [1], [2], [8, 9], [18], [27, 28], [30] and [34] the H\u00f6lder regularity of the solution to the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation is rather wellunderstood. Notably, it was shown in [1] that if the measure on the right hand side has a density in $L^{p}, p>1$ and the boundary data is H\u00f6lder continuous, then the solution is H\u00f6lder continuous. Such a regularity was also proved for the volume form of a generic smooth compact submanifold in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ in [30] and [34]. These measures are singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a H\u00f6lder continuous solution via H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution was proved in [27, 28], which was inspired by [19].\n\nRecently, potential theory has been developed very successfully for the study of weak solutions to complex Hessian equations (of which the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation is a special case) both in domains in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and on compact K\u00e4hler manifolds by Blocki [6], Dinew and the first author [13, 14], and Lu [23, 24, 25]. The study of H\u00f6lder regularity of $m$-subharmonic solutions to the complex Hessian equation is recently very active [4], [7], [10], [17], [21], [22], [26] and [33]. Although the statements are often similar to the ones for the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, the proofs are substantially different and usually the H\u00f6lder exponent of the solutions is probably far from optimal.\n\nWe focus now on the H\u00f6lder regularity of $m$-subharmonic solutions to the complex Hessian equation assuming the existence of a H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution. Let $\\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Let $1 \\leq m<n$ be an integer. Let us denote by $\\beta=d d^{c}|z|^{2}$ the standard K\u00e4hler form and $S H_{m}(\\Omega)$ the set of all $m$-subharmonic functions in $\\Omega$ defined in [6]. For $v \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ its complex Hessian measure\n\nis given by\n\n$$\nH_{m}(v):=\\left(d d^{c} v\\right)^{m} \\wedge \\beta^{n-m}\n$$\n\nLet $\\varphi \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})$ with $0<\\alpha \\leq 1$ and let $\\mu$ be a positive measure in $\\Omega$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\mu \\leq H_{m}(\\varphi)\n$$\n\nTo study the Dirichlet problem we assume that $\\Omega$ is a bounded strictly $m$ - pseudoconvex domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Let $\\rho \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{2}(\\bar{\\Omega})$ be a strictly $m$-subharmonic defining function of $\\Omega$. By adding $\\varphi$ to an $m$-subharmonic envelope whose boundary value is equal to $-\\varphi$ as in [26, Theorem 4.7], we obtain a new H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution (with possibly smaller H\u00f6lder exponent) with zero boundary value. Therefore, without loss of generality we may assume that\n\n$$\n\\varphi=0 \\quad \\text { on } \\partial \\Omega\n$$\n\nGiven the boundary data $\\phi \\in C^{0, \\alpha}(\\partial \\Omega)$ we wish to solve the Hessian equation\n\n$$\nu \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0}(\\bar{\\Omega}), \\quad H_{m}(u)=\\mu, \\quad \\text { and } u=\\phi \\quad \\text { on } \\partial \\Omega\n$$\n\nThe main result of the paper is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let $\\mu$ be the measure satisfying (1.1). Then, the Dirichlet problem (1.3) is solvable and there exists $0<\\alpha^{\\prime} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\nu \\in C^{0, \\alpha^{\\prime}}(\\bar{\\Omega})\n$$\n\nThis result was proved in [21] for a compactly supported measure $\\mu$ in $\\Omega$. Later, Benali-Zeriahi [4, Theorem B] (in a special case) and Charabati and Zeriahi [10, Theorem 4] solved the Dirichlet problem (1.3) \\& (1.4) for any $\\mu$ having finite total mass, i.e., $\\mu(\\Omega)<+\\infty$. More precisely, it was a consequence of a general statement [10, Theorem 3] for the modulus of continuity under such an assumption. In other words, they obtained the H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution theorem for finite mass measures. Here, we are able to remove the finite mass assumption. The method to prove the theorem is inspired by [4] and [21]. As in [21] we do not invoke neither the viscosity solutions nor the rooftop envelopes. However, the H\u00f6lder exponent of the solution is worse than the one in [4] and [10] (see also [5]).\n\nIn general the complex Hessian measure of a H\u00f6lder continuous $m$-subharmonic function may have unbounded total mass. Thus, for applications it is desirable to prove the H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution theorem for possibly unbounded total mass measures. Let us consider specific examples.\n\nExample 1.2. Let $\\Omega$ be a strictly $m$-pseuconvex domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $\\rho$ is a $C^{2}$ strictly $m$-subharmonic defining function of $\\Omega$ as above.\n(a) Consider the function $-(-\\rho)^{\\alpha}$ for some $0<\\alpha<1$. Then, it is H\u00f6lder continuous on $\\bar{\\Omega}$ and $m$-subharmonic in $\\Omega$. It is easy to see that for any $x \\in \\partial \\Omega$ and $U_{x}$ a neighborhood of $x$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega \\cap U_{x}} H_{m}\\left(-|\\rho|^{\\alpha}\\right)=+\\infty\n$$\n\nIt follows that the measure $\\mu=\\mathbf{1}_{U_{x}} \\cdot H_{m}\\left(-|\\rho|^{\\alpha}\\right)$ has unbounded mass on $\\Omega$ and $\\mu \\leq H_{m}\\left(-|\\rho|^{\\alpha}\\right)$.\n\n(b) Take $G \\subset \\Omega$ be such that $\\mu:=\\mathbf{1}_{G} \\cdot H_{m}\\left(-|\\rho|^{\\alpha}\\right)$ satisfies $\\mu(\\Omega)<+\\infty$. Then, it is not clear how to find $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{E}_{m}^{0}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})$ such that $\\mu \\leq H_{m}(\\varphi)$, where $\\mathcal{E}_{m}^{0}(\\Omega)$ is the Cegrell class of bounded $m$-subharmonic functions whose boundary values are zero and whose total masses of complex Hessian measures are finite.\n\nExample 1.3. Take $\\varphi \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})$ such that $\\varphi \\neq 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. Assume $\\mu \\leq H_{m}(\\varphi)$ in $\\Omega$ and $\\int_{\\Omega} H_{m}(\\varphi)<+\\infty$. Then, it is not clear if one can find $\\varphi^{\\prime}$ H\u00f6lder continuous $m$-subharmonic function such that $\\varphi^{\\prime}=0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ and $\\int_{\\Omega} H_{m}\\left(\\varphi^{\\prime}\\right)<+\\infty$.\n\nThe H\u00f6lder regularity of solutions to complex Hessian equations or fully nonlinear elliptic equations on compact K\u00e4hler manifold is also very active field of research see e.g., [11], [12], [15], [20] and [35]. It is worth to point out that the H\u00f6lder regularity of quasi $m$-subharmonic solutions to the equation on a compact K\u00e4hler manifold, under similar hypothesis as the ones mentioned above, is widely open. There is a partial progress made by Cheng and Yu [11] in case nonnegative holomorphic bisectional curvature of the metric.\n\nAcknowledgement.

Hessian measures dominated by CAPACITY \n\nIn this section we consider the positive Radon measure $\\mu$ which is dominated by the complex Hessian measure associated to a H\u00f6lder continuous $m$-subharmonic function $\\varphi$ satisfying (1.1) and (1.2). Our goal is to prove that there exist uniform constants $C, \\alpha_{0}>0$ depending only on $\\varphi$ and $\\Omega$ such that for every compact set $K \\subset \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\mu(K) \\leq C\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K, \\Omega)\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{0}}\n$$\n\nwhere the $m$-capacity defined as in [13], namely\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K, \\Omega)=\\sup \\left\\{\\int_{K} H_{m}(w): w \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega),-1 \\leq w \\leq 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThis inequality was proved under the assumption of the compact support of the measure in [21]. Later it was proved without this extra hypothesis by Benali and Zeriahi [4] and a more general formulation was given by Charabati and Zeriahi [10], where they employed the viscosity solution. Here we give an alternative proof with a smaller exponent but it does not invoke neither viscosity solutions nor the rooftop envelope. This is done by slightly extending the H\u00f6lder continuous subsolution to a neighborhood of $\\bar{\\Omega}$ using the defining function $\\rho$. The cost is the growth of the H\u00f6lder norm of the new subsolution and we need to carefully analyze it.\n\nSince $\\rho$ is a $C^{2}$ defining function of $\\Omega$, we can assume that $\\rho$ is a strictly $m$ subharmonic function in a neighborhood $\\bar{\\Omega}$ of $\\bar{\\Omega}$. Let us define for $\\varepsilon>0$ the sets\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}=\\{z \\in \\Omega: \\operatorname{dist}(z, \\partial \\Omega)>\\varepsilon\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nD_{\\varepsilon}=\\{z \\in \\Omega: \\rho(z)<-\\varepsilon\\}\n$$\n\nThese two domains are comparable as, by the Hopf lemma, there exist constants $c_{0}, \\varepsilon_{0}>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\subset D_{c_{0} \\varepsilon} \\quad \\text { for every } 0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\n\nLet us consider the following extension of the subsolution $\\varphi$\n\n$$\n\\psi:=\\max \\left\\{\\varphi-\\varepsilon, \\frac{M \\rho}{c_{0} \\varepsilon}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $M=1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}$. Clearly, $\\psi$ is defined on $\\widetilde{\\Omega}$. Furthermore, $\\psi=\\varphi-\\varepsilon$ on $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\psi=M \\rho /\\left(c_{0} \\varepsilon\\right)$ near $\\partial \\Omega$. Thus, $\\psi$ is $\\alpha$-H\u00f6lder continuous and $m$-subharmonic in the neighborhood $\\widetilde{\\Omega}$ of $\\bar{\\Omega}$ and\n\n$$\nH_{m}(\\varphi)=H_{m}(\\psi) \\quad \\text { on } \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nLet us fix an $\\varepsilon_{0}>0$ depending only on $\\Omega$ such that for every $0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{0}$,\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\Omega} \\subset\\{z \\in \\widetilde{\\Omega}: \\operatorname{dist}(z, \\partial \\widetilde{\\Omega})>\\varepsilon\\}\n$$\n\nAs $\\varphi-\\varepsilon \\leq \\psi \\leq 0$,\n\n$$\n\\|\\psi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\bar{\\Omega})} \\leq M\n$$\n\nNow we are ready to give a slightly different proof of the following result due to Benali and Zeriahi [4].\n\nTheorem 2.1. There exist constants $A_{1}>0$ and $\\alpha_{0}>0$ such that for any compact set $K \\subset \\Omega$\n\n$$\n\\int_{K} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\leq A_{1}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{0}}\n$$\n\nPrecisely, $A_{1}=C\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}^{m}\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}^{m}$ with $C$ a uniform constant depending only on $\\Omega$ and $\\alpha_{0}$ which is explicitly computable in terms of $\\alpha, m$ and $n$.\n\nFollowing the idea in [4] we divide a compact $K$ into two parts $K \\cap \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$ and $K \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$. To deal with the first part we need\nLemma 2.2. Fix $1<p<n / m$ and $0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{0}$, where $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is given in (2.1). Let $E \\subset \\Omega_{2 \\varepsilon}$ be a Borel set. Then,\n\n$$\n\\int_{E} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\leq A_{2}\\left(\\varepsilon^{\\alpha}+\\varepsilon^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\\right]^{p-1}\\right) \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{2}=C\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}^{m}\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}$.\nProof. Without loss of generality we may assume that $E$ is a regular compact set. This means that the relative extremal function\n\n$$\nu_{E}(z)=\\sup \\left\\{v(z): v \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega): v \\leq 0, v \\leq-1 \\text { on } E\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis a continuous $m$-subharmonic function on $\\bar{\\Omega}$. For the general $E$ one can use the fact that $\\mu$ is a Radon measure and $m$-capacity enjoys the inner regularity property. Recall that $\\psi$ is the extension defined in (2.2). Let us denote by $\\psi_{\\varepsilon}=\\psi * \\chi_{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\left\\{\\chi_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\}_{\\varepsilon>0}$ is the radial smoothing kernels, the standard regularization of $\\psi$ in $\\widetilde{\\Omega}$ for $0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{0}$. We have by (2.4) that the domain of $\\psi_{\\varepsilon}$ contains $\\bar{\\Omega}$. Hence, $\\psi_{\\varepsilon} \\in S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{\\infty}(\\bar{\\Omega})$. Using the H\u00f6lder continuity of $\\psi=\\varphi-\\varepsilon$ we have\n\n$$\n0 \\leq \\psi_{\\varepsilon}-\\psi \\leq c_{1} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}:=\\delta \\quad \\text { on } \\bar{\\Omega}_{2 \\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{1}=\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}$. The compactness of $E$ gives $u_{E}=0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. Also $\\psi_{\\varepsilon} \\geq \\psi$ on $\\bar{\\Omega}$ by the subharmonicity of $\\psi$. Consider the set $E^{\\prime}:=\\left\\{3 \\delta u_{E}+\\psi_{\\varepsilon}<\\psi-2 \\delta\\right\\}$. Then,\n\n$$\nE \\subset E^{\\prime} \\subset\\left\\{u_{E}<-1 / 2\\right\\} \\subset \\subset \\Omega\n$$\n\nwhere we used the fact $E \\subset \\Omega_{2 \\varepsilon}$ for the first inclusion and $\\psi_{\\varepsilon} \\geq \\psi$ for the second one. In what follows we write for any Borel set $G \\subset \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(G):=\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(G, \\Omega)\n$$\n\nClearly, $\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E) \\leq \\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$. On the other hand, by the comparison principle [13, Theorem 1.4],\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right) & \\leq \\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(\\left\\{u_{E}<-1 / 2\\right\\}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq 2^{m} \\int_{\\left\\{u_{E}<0\\right\\}}\\left(d d^{c} u_{E}\\right)^{m} \\wedge \\beta^{n-m} \\\\\n& =2^{m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNext, notice from (2.5) that on $\\bar{\\Omega}$,\n\n$$\nd d^{c} \\psi_{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C\\|\\psi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} \\beta}{\\varepsilon^{2}} \\leq \\frac{C M \\beta}{\\varepsilon^{2}}, \\quad\\left\\|\\psi_{\\varepsilon}+u_{E}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} \\leq M\n$$\n\nSince $E \\subset \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}, \\int_{E} H_{m}(\\varphi)=\\int_{E} H_{m}(\\psi)$. The comparison principle and the above inequalities give us that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{E^{\\prime}} H_{m}(\\psi) & \\leq \\int_{E^{\\prime}} H_{m}\\left(3 \\delta u_{E}+\\psi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq \\int_{E^{\\prime}} 3 \\delta H_{m}\\left(u_{E}+\\psi_{\\varepsilon}\\right)+\\int_{E^{\\prime}} H_{m}\\left(\\psi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq 3 \\delta M^{m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)+C M^{m} \\varepsilon^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)\\right]^{p}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we also used [13, Proposition 2.1] for the last inequality with $1<p<n / m$. Combining with the equivalence (2.7) of $\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)$ and $\\operatorname{cap}_{m}\\left(E^{\\prime}\\right)$ we get that for every Borel set $E \\subset \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{E} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\leq C M^{m}\\left(c_{1} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}+\\varepsilon^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\\right]^{p-1}\\right) \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\n$$\n\nSince we may assume $c_{1}=\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})} \\geq 1$, the desired inequality follows.\nThe next lemma is due to Benali and Zeriahi [4, Lemma 4.1] which takes care of the second part in the decomposition.\n\nLemma 2.3. Let $F \\subset \\Omega \\backslash \\Omega_{2 \\varepsilon}$ be a compact set. Then,\n\n$$\n\\int_{F} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\leq A_{3} \\varepsilon^{m \\alpha} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(F)\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{3}=2^{m \\alpha}\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}^{m}$.\nProof. Without loss of generality we can assume that $F$ is regular in the sense that the relative extremal function $u_{F}$ with respect to $\\Omega$ is continuous as in the proof of Lemma 2.2. Since $\\varphi$ is H\u00f6lder continuous on $\\bar{\\Omega}$ and $\\varphi=0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$, we have for $z \\in F$\n\n$$\n-\\varphi(z) \\leq c_{1} \\operatorname{dist}(z, \\partial \\Omega)^{\\alpha}<2^{\\alpha} c_{1} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}=: \\delta\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{1}=\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\Omega)}$. Consider the set $F^{\\prime}=\\left\\{\\delta u_{F}<\\varphi\\right\\}$. Since $u_{F}=-1$ on $F$, we have $F \\subset F^{\\prime}$. Note that $u_{F}=0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$, hence $F^{\\prime} \\subset \\subset \\Omega$. By the comparison principle\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{F^{\\prime}} H_{m}(\\varphi) & \\leq \\int_{F^{\\prime}} H_{m}\\left(\\delta u_{F}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\delta^{m} \\int_{F^{\\prime}} H_{m}\\left(u_{F}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\delta^{m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(F)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe desired inequality follows.\nEnd of proof of Theorem 2.1. Now for any compact set $K \\subset \\Omega$ we write $K=$ $\\left(K \\cap \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\cup\\left(K \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. Let us denote by $E$ and $F$ the two sets of this union. Then, both of them have $m$-capacity less than $\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)$. It follows from (2.8) and (2.9) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{K} H_{m}(\\varphi) & =\\int_{E} H_{m}(\\varphi)+\\int_{F} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\\\\n& \\leq A_{2}\\left(\\varepsilon^{\\alpha}+\\varepsilon^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)\\right]^{p-1}\\right) \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(E)+A_{3} \\varepsilon^{m \\alpha} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(F) \\\\\n& \\leq A_{4}\\left(\\varepsilon^{\\alpha}+\\varepsilon^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{p-1}+\\varepsilon^{m \\alpha}\\right) \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{4}=\\max \\left\\{A_{2}, A_{3}\\right\\}$. Notice that this inequality holds for every $0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\varepsilon_{0}$, where $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is fixed and defined in (2.4).\n\nThe proof of the theorem will follow by choosing a suitable $\\varepsilon>0$. To this end we define $\\alpha_{1}>0$ by\n\n$$\np-1-2 m \\alpha_{1}=\\alpha_{1} \\alpha \\Leftrightarrow \\alpha_{1}=\\frac{p-1}{2 m+\\alpha}\n$$\n\nIf $\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{\\alpha_{1}} \\geq \\varepsilon_{0}$, then by $(2.10)$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{K} H_{m}(\\varphi) & \\leq A_{4}\\left(\\varepsilon_{0}^{\\alpha}+\\varepsilon_{0}^{-2 m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)^{p-1}+\\varepsilon_{0}^{m \\alpha}\\right) \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K) \\\\\n& \\leq A_{4}\\left(\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{1} \\alpha}+\\varepsilon_{0}^{-2 m}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{p}+\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+m \\alpha_{1} \\alpha}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo, we get the desired inequality in this case. Otherwise, if $\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{\\alpha_{1}}<\\varepsilon_{0}$, then we can choose $\\varepsilon=\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{\\alpha_{1}}$. It follows from (2.10) that $\\int_{K} H_{m}(\\varphi)$ is less than\n\n$$\nA_{4}\\left(\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{1} \\alpha}+\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{p-2 m \\alpha_{1}}+\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+m \\alpha_{1} \\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the inequality\n\n$$\n\\int_{K} H_{m}(\\varphi) \\leq A_{1}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(K)\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{0}}\n$$\n\nholds for $\\alpha_{0}=\\alpha_{1} \\alpha>0$ and $A_{1}=3 A_{4}$.

Set\n\n$$\ns_{0}:=\\inf _{\\Omega}(u-v)\n$$\n\nWe know that for $0<s<\\left|s_{0}\\right|$,\n\n$$\nU(s):=\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s\\right\\} \\subset \\subset \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nThe only difference from [21, Proposition 2.5] is that now the constant $C / \\varepsilon^{m}$ appeared on the right hand side. As shown in [28] for the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation the proof of the proposition will follow once we have the following inequality.\n\nLemma 3.4. Let $\\alpha_{0}>0$ be as in Theorem 2.1. Then, for every $0<s, t<\\frac{\\left\\lfloor\\alpha_{0}\\right\\rfloor}{2}$,\n\n$$\nt^{m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(U(s)) \\leq \\frac{C\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)}{\\varepsilon^{2 m}}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(U(s+t))\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{0}}\n$$\n\nProof of Lemma 3.4. Let $0 \\leq w \\leq 1$ be a $m$-subharmonic function in $\\Omega$. By the comparison principle [13, Theorem 1.4],\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s+t w\\right\\}} H_{m}(v+t w) \\leq \\int_{\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s+t w\\right\\}} H_{m}(u)\n$$\n\nSince $U(s) \\subset\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s+t w\\right\\} \\subset U(s+t)$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{U(s)} H_{m}(v+t w) & \\leq \\int_{\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s+t w\\right\\}} H_{m}(v+t w) \\\\\n& \\leq \\int_{\\left\\{u<v+s_{0}+s+t w\\right\\}} H_{m}(u) \\\\\n& \\leq \\int_{U(s+t)} d \\mu\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs $t^{m} \\int_{U(s)} H_{m}(w) \\leq \\int_{U(s)} H_{m}(v+t w)$, taking supremum over all such $w$ we get\n\n$$\nt^{m} \\operatorname{cap}_{m}(U(s)) \\leq \\int_{U(s+t)} d \\mu\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, by Lemma 3.1\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}_{D_{c_{0} \\varepsilon}} \\cdot d \\mu \\leq H_{m}\\left(\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{c_{0} \\varepsilon}\\right) \\quad \\text { in } \\Omega\n$$\n\nas two measures, where $c_{0}$ is the constant defined in (2.1). Combining this with $U(s+t) \\subset \\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\subset D_{c_{0} \\varepsilon}$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{U(s+t)} d \\mu & \\leq \\int_{U(s+t)} H_{m}\\left(\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{c_{0} \\varepsilon}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)}{\\left(c_{0} \\varepsilon\\right)^{2 m}}\\left[\\operatorname{cap}_{m}(U(s+t))\\right]^{1+\\alpha_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the last inequality follows from Lemma 3.2. Thus, the proof of the lemma follows from (3.6) and (3.7).\n\nThen, the rest of the proof of the proposition is the same as in [18, Theorem 1.1] with obvious change of notations.\n\nAn important step is to derive the $L^{1}-L^{1}$ (with respect to the measure $\\mu$ and the Lebesgue measure) stability estimate of solutions. The one stated below is an analogue of [28, Theorem 4.9] for the complex Hessian equation. For the sake of completeness we give the detailed proof.\n\nTheorem 3.5. Let $u$ be the solution in (3.1). Let $v \\in S H_{m} \\cap L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)$ be such that $v=u$ on $\\Omega \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$. Then, there is $0<\\alpha_{3}<1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}|v-u| d \\mu \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{m+1}}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}|v-u| d V_{2 n}\\right)^{\\alpha_{3}}\n$$\n\nwhere $C>0$ is a uniform constant independent of $\\varepsilon$.\nProof. Put\n\n$$\nS_{k, \\varepsilon}:=\\left(d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{k} \\wedge \\beta^{n-k}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, m\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}=\\max \\{\\varphi-\\varepsilon, M \\rho / \\varepsilon\\}$. Since $\\mu \\leq S_{m, \\varepsilon}$ on $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$, it is enough to show that there is $0<\\tau \\leq 1$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) S_{m, \\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{m+1}}\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\tau}\n$$\n\nfor $v \\geq u$ on $\\Omega$, where here and below we denote by $\\|\\cdot\\|_{1}$ the $L^{1}$-norm with respect to the Lebesgue measure. (In the general case we use the identity\n\n$$\n|v-u|=(\\max \\{v, u\\}-u)+(\\max \\{v, u\\}-v)\n$$\n\nand apply twice the inequality (3.9) to get the theorem.)\nNow we can use the inductive arguments in $0 \\leq k \\leq m$. Clearly it holds for $k=0$ with $\\alpha_{2}=1$. Assume the inequality holds for $k<m-1$. Let us denote $\\left\\{\\chi_{t}\\right\\}_{t>0}$ the family of standard radial smoothing kernels. To pass from the $k$-th step to the step number $(k+1) \\leq m$ we need the following inequality (with the notation $S_{\\varepsilon}:=\\left(d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{k} \\wedge \\beta^{n-k-1}$ )\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon} \\leq & \\left|\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} * \\chi_{t} \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon}\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) d d^{c}\\left(\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} * \\chi_{t}-\\varphi_{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon}\\right| \\\\\n= & : I_{1, \\varepsilon}+I_{2, \\varepsilon}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}$ is well-defined on the neighborhood $\\widetilde{\\Omega}$ of $\\bar{\\Omega}$, so is $\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} * \\chi_{t}$ for $t>0$ small. Moreover, $\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\widetilde{\\Omega})} \\leq C / \\varepsilon$. Since for $t>0$,\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} * \\chi_{t}}{\\partial z_{j} \\partial \\bar{z}_{k}}(z)\\right| \\leq \\frac{C\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}}{t^{2}} \\leq \\frac{C\\left(1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}\\right)}{t^{2}}\n$$\n\nand by the induction hypothesis at $k$-th step, there exists $0<\\tau_{k} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) S_{\\varepsilon} \\wedge \\beta \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{k+1}}\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\tau_{k}}\n$$\n\nwe conclude that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{1, \\varepsilon} & \\leq \\frac{C\\left(1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}\\right)}{t^{2}} \\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) S_{\\varepsilon} \\wedge \\beta \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C\\left(1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}\\right)}{\\varepsilon^{k+1} t^{2}}\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\tau_{k}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy integration by parts, using $u=v$ on $\\Omega \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$, and\n\n$$\n\\left|\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} * \\chi_{t}(z)-\\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}(z)\\right| \\leq \\frac{C t^{\\alpha}}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nit follows that\n\n$$\nI_{2, \\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C t^{\\alpha}}{\\varepsilon} \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}}\\left(d d^{c} v+d d^{c} u\\right) \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nAt this point the total mass of the right hand side may go to infinity as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0^{+}$. However, we can control it uniformly in terms of a negative exponent of $\\varepsilon$. The argument is inspired by [28, Lemma 4.3]. Namely, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}}\\left(d d^{c} u+d d^{c} v\\right) \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C\\|u+v\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}(1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)})^{k}}{\\varepsilon^{k+1}}\n$$\n\nIndeed, we first have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} d d^{c}(u+v) \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{k} \\wedge \\beta^{n-k-1} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon^{\\prime}} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\max \\left\\{\\rho,-\\varepsilon^{\\prime} / 2\\right\\}-\\rho\\right) \\wedge d d^{c}(u+v) \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{k} \\wedge \\beta^{n-k-1} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon}\\|u+v\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(d d^{c} \\rho\\right) \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon}\\right)^{k} \\wedge \\beta^{n-k-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon^{\\prime}=c_{0} \\varepsilon$ with $c_{0}$ defined by (2.1). The desired inequality (3.14) follows from Lemma 3.1. Now, combining (3.13) and (3.14) we get that\n\n$$\nI_{2, \\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C t^{\\alpha}}{\\varepsilon^{k+2}}\n$$\n\nNext, it is easy to see (from Lemma 3.1) that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) S_{m, \\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}(1+\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)})^{m}}{\\varepsilon^{m}}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we can assume that $0<\\|v-u\\|_{1}<0.01$. Thanks to (3.12) and (3.15) we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} \\wedge S_{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{k+1} t^{2}}\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\tau_{k}}+\\frac{C t^{\\alpha}}{\\varepsilon^{k+2}}\n$$\n\nIf we choose $t=\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\frac{\\tau_{k}}{3}}, \\quad \\tau_{k+1}=\\frac{\\alpha \\sigma_{k}}{3}$, then\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}(v-u) S_{\\varepsilon} \\wedge d d^{c} \\widetilde{\\varphi}_{\\varepsilon} \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{k+2}}\\|v-u\\|_{1}^{\\tau_{k+1}}\n$$\n\nThus, the induction argument is completed, and the theorem follows.\nThe next result is from [28, Lemma 4.10] and its proof used only the subharmonicity. Therefore, it is also valid for $m$-subharmonic functions.\n\nLemma 3.6. Let $u$ be the solution in (3.1) and define for $z \\in \\Omega_{\\delta}$,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{u}_{\\delta}(z):=\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{2 n} \\delta^{2 n}} \\int_{|\\zeta| \\leq \\delta} u(z+\\zeta) d V_{2 n}(\\zeta)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{2 n}$ is the volume of the unit ball. Then, for $\\delta>0$ small,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left|\\tilde{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right| d V_{2 n} \\leq C \\delta\n$$\n\nProof. Since $\\Omega_{\\delta} \\subset D_{c_{0} \\delta}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega_{\\delta}} d d^{c} u(z) \\wedge \\beta^{n-1} & \\leq \\frac{2}{c_{0} \\delta}\\left(\\max \\left\\{\\rho,-c_{\\delta} / 2\\right\\}-\\rho\\right) d d^{c} u \\wedge \\beta^{n-1} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}}{\\delta} \\int_{\\Omega} d d^{c} \\rho \\wedge \\beta^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, using the classical Jensen formula for subharmonic functions (see e.g., $[18$, Lemma 4.3]),\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left|\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right| d V_{2 n} & \\leq \\int_{\\Omega_{2 \\delta}}\\left|\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right| d V_{2 n}+\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)} \\int_{\\Omega_{\\delta} \\backslash \\Omega_{2 \\delta}} d V_{2 n} \\\\\n& \\leq C \\delta^{2} \\int_{\\Omega_{\\delta}} \\Delta u+c_{6} \\delta \\\\\n& \\leq C \\delta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the required inequality.\nWe are ready to prove the H\u00f6lder continuity of the solution $u$ in (3.1).\nEnd of Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let us fix $\\delta$ such that $0<\\delta<\\delta_{0}$ small and let $\\varepsilon$ be such that $\\delta \\leq \\varepsilon<\\delta_{0}$ which is to be determined later. Recall that\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\delta}:=\\{z \\in \\Omega: \\operatorname{dist}(z, \\partial \\Omega)>\\delta\\}\n$$\n\nand for $z \\in \\Omega_{\\delta}$ we define\n\n$$\nu_{\\delta}(z):=\\sup _{|\\zeta| \\leq \\delta} u(z+\\zeta)\n$$\n\nDirectly from definitions and the H\u00f6lder continuity of the boundary data as in [28, Lemma 4.1] we have the following inequalities.\nLemma 3.7. We have for $z \\in \\bar{\\Omega}_{\\delta} \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$,\n\n$$\nu_{\\delta}(z) \\leq u(z)+c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{5}=\\|\\varphi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}+\\|\\phi\\|_{C^{0, \\alpha}(\\bar{\\Omega})}$. In particular,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right) \\leq \\sup _{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right)+c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nRemark 3.8. It is important to keep in mind that the uniform constants $C, c_{i}>0$ which appear in the lemma, and several times below are independent of $\\delta$ and $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThanks to Lemma 3.7 and $\\hat{u}_{\\delta} \\leq u_{\\delta}$ we have $\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha} \\leq u$ on $\\partial \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$. Therefore, the function\n\n$$\n\\tilde{u}:= \\begin{cases}\\max \\left\\{\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}, u\\right\\} & \\text { on } \\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\\\ u & \\text { on } \\Omega \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nbelongs to $S H_{m}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0}(\\bar{\\Omega})$. Notice that $\\tilde{u} \\geq u$ in $\\Omega$, and\n\n$$\n\\tilde{u}=u \\quad \\text { on } \\Omega \\backslash \\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\nAgain, by the second part of Lemma 3.7 we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right) & \\leq \\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right)+c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha} \\\\\n& \\leq \\sup _{\\Omega}(\\tilde{u}-u)+2 c_{5} \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy the stability estimate (Proposition 3.3) there exists $0<\\alpha_{2} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sup _{\\Omega}(\\tilde{u}-u) & \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{2 m}}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\max \\{\\tilde{u}-u, 0\\} d \\mu\\right)^{\\alpha_{2}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{2 m}}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}|\\tilde{u}-u| d \\mu\\right)^{\\alpha_{2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used the fact that $\\tilde{u}=u$ outside $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$. Using Theorem 3.5, there is $0<$ $\\alpha_{3} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sup _{\\Omega}(\\tilde{u}-u) & \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{2 m+(m+1) \\alpha_{2}}}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}|\\tilde{u}-u| d V_{2 n}\\right)^{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{3}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\frac{C}{\\varepsilon^{3 m+1}}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}}\\left|\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right| d V_{2 n}\\right)^{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{3}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere we used $0 \\leq \\tilde{u}-u \\leq \\mathbf{1}_{\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}} \\cdot\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right)$ and $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon} \\subset \\Omega_{\\delta}$ for the second inequality. It follows from (3.25), (3.27) and Lemma 3.6 that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right) \\leq C \\varepsilon^{\\alpha}+\\frac{C \\delta^{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{3}}}{\\varepsilon^{3 m+1}}\n$$\n\nNow, we choose $\\alpha_{4}=\\alpha \\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{3} /(3 m+1+\\alpha)$ and\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\delta^{\\frac{\\alpha_{2} \\alpha_{4}}{3 m+1+\\alpha}}\n$$\n\nThen, $\\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(\\hat{u}_{\\delta}-u\\right) \\leq C \\delta^{\\alpha_{4}}$. Finally, thanks to [18, Lemma 4.2] (see also [36]) we infer that $\\sup _{\\Omega_{\\delta}}\\left(u_{\\delta}-u\\right) \\leq C \\delta^{\\alpha_{4}}$.
