IntroduCTION\n\nSuppose we are given a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma \\subseteq \\operatorname{GL}(V) \\ltimes V$ of the affine group of a Euclidean vector space $V$ generated by translations coming from a lattice subgroup of $V$ and dilations that arise as integer powers of an expansive automorphism which leaves the lattice invariant.\n\nIt is a classical problem in wavelet analysis to determine whether there are functions $\\psi^{1}, \\ldots, \\psi^{r} \\in$ $L^{2}(V)$, often called a wavelet set, such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\gamma \\cdot \\psi^{i}: \\gamma \\in \\Gamma, 1 \\leq i \\leq r\\right\\}\n$$\n\nconstitutes an orthonormal Hilbert basis of $L^{2}(V)$. Here $L^{2}(V)$ is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $V$ and $\\Gamma$ acts on $L^{2}(V)$ via $\\gamma \\cdot \\psi(x)=\\psi\\left(\\gamma^{-1} x\\right)$. The standard approach to this problem is to obtain the wavelet basis (1.1) from a multiresolution analysis (see e.g. [BMM99, Mad93, Woj97]), and in general the size $r$ of the wavelet set depends on the determinant of the expansive automorphism. In non-Euclidean settings, such as on manifolds, concepts of multiresolution analysis are often less natural. There is a broad literature on wavelet analysis and multiresolution on spheres, see e.g. [FNS18] and [FFP16] for a more general background about wavelet methods on manifolds. Let us also mention [Pap11] among further concepts of non-Euclidean multiresolution analyses and [OOR06] for a non-Euclidean (continuous) wavelet transform on rectangular matrix spaces.

Multiresolution analysis, spherical functions, analysis on matrix spaces, Schur functions, generalized translations.\n\n    The authors were supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), via the grants RO 1264/4-1 and SFB-TRR 358/1 2023-491392403.\n\nfunctions on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ was introduced. It was based on the natural hypergroup translation on the orbit space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\right)^{S O(3)} \\cong[0, \\infty[$, and the intimate connection of the characters of this hypergroup (certain Bessel functions) to the Tchebychef polynomials of second kind played a crucial role. For structural reasons, this concept cannot be generalized to $S O(n)$-invariant functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n>3$.\n\nIn the present paper, we consider the space $V=\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ of Hermitian $n \\times n$-matrices as a Euclidean space, with the trace form $\\langle X, Y\\rangle=\\operatorname{tr}(X Y)$ as scalar product. It is naturally acted upon by the unitary group $U(n)$ via conjugation, i.e. $(u, X) \\mapsto u . X=u X u^{-1}$. Note that these transformations are orthogonal with respect to the trace form. In various analytic contexts, such as random matrix theory, one is interested in the space $L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$ consisting of functions $f \\in L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))$ which are invariant under this action, i.e. depend only on the eigenvalues of their argument. It seems natural to exploit the additional geometric invariance also in wavelet analysis, in order to obtain a discrete wavelet decomposition of $L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$. Identifying $U(n)$-orbits in $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ with their ordered spectrum via the spectral theorem will also reduce the dimension of the underlying space from $n^{2}$ to $n$. In a closely related way, one could consider functions on the space $\\operatorname{SHerm}(n)=\\left\\{X \\in \\operatorname{Herm}(n): \\operatorname{tr} X=0\\right\\}$, which are radial in the sense of conjugation invariance under $S U(n)$. As we shall describe in the appendix (Section 6), the setting of [RR03] just corresponds to $S U(2)$-invariant analysis on $\\operatorname{SHerm}(2)$.\n\nThe goal of the present paper is to generalize the concepts of [RR03] to higher rank, namely to analysis on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ which is radial in the sense of $U(n)$-invariance. We shall introduce a radial multiresolution on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ and characterize radial orthonormal wavelet bases. A key ingredient will be the definition of a generalized translation operator on $L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$, as classical translations of $U(n)$-invariant function need not to be $U(n)$-invariant again. We identify the orbit space of the action of $U(n)$ on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ with the closed cone\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: x_{1} \\geq \\ldots \\geq x_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nof ordered spectra of Hermitian matrices via $\\{u . X: u \\in U(n)\\} \\mapsto \\sigma(X) \\in \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$. Here $\\sigma(X)$ denotes the set of eigenvalues of $X$, ordered by size. The cone $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$is a closed Weyl chamber of type $A_{n-1}$. It carries a natural hypergroup structure, where the convolution of point measures $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ is a compactly supported probability measure on $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$which describes the possible spectra of sums of Hermitian matrices $X+Y$ with given spectra $\\sigma(X)=x, \\sigma(Y)=y$. For generic $x$ and $y$ the measure $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure in a certain affine plane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with an explicit formula for the density. This is a consequence of results in [GS02], see also the survey [GS16]. The generalized translation of suitable functions on $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$is then given by $T_{x} f(y) \\vDash \\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}(f)$, and harmonic analysis of $L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$ will play out as harmonic analysis on the $L^{2}$-space $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ of this hypergroup, where $\\omega(x)=\\prod_{i<j}\\left|x_{j}-x_{j}\\right|^{2}$. This is due to the fact that by the Weyl integration formula, the classical Fourier transform of $U(n)$-invariant functions on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ coincides with a Hankel transform with respect to the spherical functions of the Cartan motion group $U(n) \\ltimes \\operatorname{Herm}(n)$, which are multivariate Bessel functions. The concept of a radial multiresolution in $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ will thus be that of a multiresolution in $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$. The scale spaces $\\left(V_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ are obtained by (classical) dyadic dilations from $V_{0}$, which is in turn spanned by generalized translations along lattice points of a so-called radial scaling function $\\phi \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$. Similarly to [RR03], and in contrast to classical notions of multiresolution analysis, while still being characterized by a two-scale relation, the scaling function $\\phi$ itself is not contained in $V_{0}$ and the scale spaces are not translation invariant with respect to the generalized translation. While the authors in [RR03] explicitly construct a set of orthonormal wavelets from a given multiresolution consisting (due to dimensionality reasons) of only one wavelet, this approach is not feasible in our higher-rank situation as the number of wavelets needed will grow with $n$.\n\nInstead, we will give a concise criterion characterizing orthonormal wavelet bases of $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ by checking whether a certain matrix-valued function is almost everywhere unitary. This result is analogous to a well-known criterion in classical wavelet theory ([Woj97]) and will allow us to show that given a multiresolution analysis, associated orthonormal wavelet bases always exist and that they in fact consist of $2^{n}-1$ wavelets. As functions on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$, these wavelets reflect the underlying radial symmetry and require reduced computational effort as classical multiresolution on the vector space $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ would need $2^{n^{2}}-1$ wavelets. We are furthermore able to relate radial scaling functions to classical permutation-invariant scaling functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, yielding a simple example of a radial wavelet basis analogous to the classical Shannon wavelets.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we recall facts about radial analysis on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$. We will introduce the generalized translation operators on $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ and study their properties. This will be crucial for Section 3, where we introduce a radial multiresolution analysis on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$. In Section 4, orthonormal wavelet bases are discussed and Section 5 then describes how to obtain radial scaling functions from classical scaling functions in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Finally, Section 6 is dedicated to the discussion of generalizations of the previous results. In fact, many arguments remain valid upon replacing $U(n)$ with an arbitrary connected compact Lie group, the space $V=\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ by $\\mathfrak{p}=i \\operatorname{Lie}(K) \\subseteq \\mathbb{C} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} \\operatorname{Lie}(K)$, and by considering the adjoint action of $K$ on p. In this setting one can see the results of [RR03] as a special case of rank 1, as the situation corresponds to that of $S U(2)$ acting on $\\operatorname{SHerm}(2)$. However, in the general higher-rank case, it would not be clear how to obtain radial scaling functions from classical scaling functions.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. Radial Analysis and Generalized Translation \n\nThe unitary group $U(n), n \\geq 2$ acts naturally on Hermitian matrices $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ by conjugation. By the spectral theorem, the orbit space $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)^{U(n)}$ of this action can be (actually topologically) identified with the closed cone\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}:=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: x_{1} \\geq \\ldots \\geq x_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nvia $U(n) \\cdot X \\mapsto \\sigma(X)$, where $\\sigma(X) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ denotes the ordered spectrum of $X$. We note that $U(n) \\ltimes \\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ is the Cartan motion group of the complex Lie group $G=G L_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$ with maximal compact subgroup $K=U(n)$, coming from the Cartan decomposition $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k} \\oplus \\mathfrak{p}$ with $\\mathfrak{p}=\\operatorname{Herm}(n) . G L_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$ belongs to the so-called Harish-Chandra class (cf. e.g. [GV88]), but in contrast to $S L_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$ it is not semisimple. The space $\\mathfrak{a}=\\left\\{\\operatorname{diag}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right): x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$, which is a maximal abelian subspace of $\\mathfrak{p}$, naturally identifies with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via $\\operatorname{diag}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$. Upon this identification, the set $\\mathfrak{a}_{+}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: x_{1}>\\ldots>x_{n}\\right\\}$ is the positive Weyl chamber corresponding to the positive subsystem\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{+}=\\left\\{e_{i}-e_{j}: 1 \\leq i<j \\leq n\\right\\}\n$$\n\nof the root system $A_{n-1}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This explains the above notion for the orbit space $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)^{U(n)}$, and we shall often identify elements from $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with diagonal matrices in the above way.\n\nRecall the Weyl integration formula ([Far08], Thm. 10.1.4; more generally [GV88], eqn.(2.4.22)) which states that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\operatorname{Herm}(n)} F(X) d X=c \\int_{\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}} \\int_{U(n)} F\\left(u x u^{-1}\\right) d u \\omega(x) d x\n$$\n\nfor $F \\in C_{c}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))$. Here, $c>0$ is a constant independent of $F$ and\n\n$$\n\\omega(x)=\\prod_{i<j}\\left(x_{i}-x_{j}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nWe thus obtain an isometric isomorphism\n\n$$\n\\Phi: L^{2}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)} \\rightarrow L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, c \\omega\\right), \\quad F \\mapsto f \\text { with } f(\\sigma(X)):=F(X)\n$$\n\nAs the action of $U(n)$ on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ is via orthogonal transformations, the Euclidean Fourier transform of a radial function $F \\in C_{\\mathrm{c}}(\\operatorname{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$ is again radial and becomes a Hankel transform of $f$ : for $Y \\in \\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ with $y=\\sigma(Y)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{F}(Y) & :=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n^{2} / 2}} \\int_{\\operatorname{Herm}(n)} F(X) e^{-i(X, Y)} d X \\\\\n& =\\frac{c}{(2 \\pi)^{n^{2} / 2}} \\int_{\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}} f(x) J(x,-i y) \\omega(x) d x=: \\mathcal{H} f(y)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith the Bessel functions\n\n$$\nJ(y, z):=\\int_{U(n)} e^{\\operatorname{tr}\\left(u y u^{-1} z\\right)} d u \\quad\\left(y, z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis is the Harish-Chandra integral for the spherical functions of the Euclidean-type symmetric space $U(n) \\ltimes \\operatorname{Herm}(n) / U(n)$, c.f. [HC57]. By the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula (see [IZ80] as well as [McS21] for a recent overview), it can also be written as\n\n$$\nJ(y, z)=\\frac{\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} k!}{\\pi(y) \\pi(z)} \\sum_{w \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}} \\operatorname{sgn}(w) e^{\\langle w y, z\\rangle}\n$$\n\nHere $\\operatorname{sgn}(w)$ denotes the sign of $w$, the scalar product $\\langle.,$.$\\rangle is extended in a bilinear way to \\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and\n\n$$\n\\pi(z):=\\prod_{i<j}\\left(z_{i}-z_{j}\\right)\n$$\n\ndenotes the fundamental alternating polynomial, also known as the Vandermonde determinant. Thus we get a Plancherel theorem extending the Hankel transform $\\mathcal{H}$ to a unitary operator on $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$. Note that the Bessel function $J$ satisfies $J(\\lambda x, z)=J(x, \\lambda z)$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and that it is $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant in both arguments. We may therefore extend $\\mathcal{H} f$ to an $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant (i.e. symmetric) function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ whenever convenient.\n\nUsual translations $F(\\cdot-y)$ of radial functions on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ need not be radial again. We therefore define generalized translations for $f \\in C_{c}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}\\right)$by averaging with respect to the $U(n)$-action:\n\n$$\nT_{x} f(y):=\\int_{U(n)} f\\left(\\sigma\\left(x+u y u^{-1}\\right)\\right) d u=\\left(\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}\\right)(f) \\quad\\left(x, y \\in \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $\\epsilon_{x}$ denotes the point measure in $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is identified with the corresponding diagonal matrix. Note that $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ defines a compactly supported probability measure on $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$and that $\\epsilon_{y} * \\epsilon_{x}=\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$. As an immediate consequence of Fubini's theorem and the left-invariance of the Haar measure we obtain the product formula\n\n$$\n\\left(\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}\\right) J(\\cdot, z)=J(x, z) J(y, z)\n$$\n\nThis just says that when considered as functions on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the functions $J(., z), z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ are spherical functions of the Gelfand pair $(U(n) \\ltimes \\operatorname{Herm}(n), U(n))$. Indeed, all spherical functions are of this form, which follows e.g. from [Wol06], Theorem 4.4, and the bounded spherical\n\nfunctions are those with $z \\in i \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Moreover, for radial $F, G$ on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}} T_{y} f(x) g(x) \\omega(x) d x=\\int_{\\operatorname{Herm}(n)} F(X+y) G(X) d X \\\\\n& \\quad=\\int_{\\operatorname{Herm}(n)} F(X) G(X-y) d X=\\int_{\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}} f(x) T_{\\bar{y}} g(x) \\omega(x) d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $\\bar{y}=-\\left(y_{n}, \\ldots, y_{1}\\right)$, provided the integrals exist. In a similar way, it is checked that $\\left\\|T_{y} f\\right\\|_{2, \\omega} \\leq\\|f\\|_{2, \\omega}$. Hence the translation operators $T_{y}$ extend to norm-decreasing linear operators on $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$.\nTogether with the above product formula, relation (2.2) implies that for $f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(T_{y} f\\right)(x)=J(x, i y) \\mathcal{H} f(x)\n$$\n\nIndeed, the above convolution $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ of point measures $\\epsilon_{x}$ and $\\epsilon_{y}$ defines a commutative orbit hypergroup structure on $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$in the sense of [Jew75], Sec. 8 (where hypergroups are called convos). The neutral element is $0 \\in \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$, the involution is given by $x \\mapsto \\bar{x}$ as defined above and $\\omega(x) d x$ is a Haar measure. For details on hypergroups related to motion groups as in the present setting, see also $[\\mathrm{RV} 08]$.\nIn Section 3 we shall need some more refined information on the measures $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$. Indeed, a combination and adaption of results from Helgason [Hel00], Graczyk, Sawyer [GS02] and Graczyk, Loeb [GL95] for the semisimple case shows that for $x, y \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$, the measure $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on a certain affine plane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and there is an explicit formula for the density. To make this precise, we orthogonally decompose $\\mathbb{R}^{n}=\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\oplus \\mathbb{R} \\underline{1}$ with\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}: x_{1}+\\ldots+x_{n}=0\\right\\}, \\quad \\underline{1}=(1, \\ldots, 1)\n$$\n\nand denote by $x^{0}$ and $x^{1}$ the orthogonal projections of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ onto $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\underline{1}$, respectively. We further put $\\mathbb{C}_{0}^{n}:=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}: z_{1}+\\ldots+z_{n}=0\\right\\}$ and\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}:=\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\cap \\mathfrak{a}_{+}\n$$\n\nA canonical basis of $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ is given by the vectors\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{i}:=e_{i}-e_{i+1}, \\quad 1 \\leq i \\leq n-1\n$$\n\nwhich form the (unique) simple system in $\\Sigma_{+}$. Denote the remaining elements in $\\Sigma_{+} \\backslash\\left\\{\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n-1}\\right\\}$ by $\\alpha_{n}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{q}$. Let $q:=\\left|\\Sigma_{+}\\right|=\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$. Following [GL95, GS02], we express $\\alpha_{k}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_{k j} \\alpha_{j}$ for $k=n, \\ldots, q$ in the basis above and define the subset $\\Delta\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n-1}\\right) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{q-n+1}$ via\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(y_{n}, \\ldots, y_{q}\\right) \\in \\Delta\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n-1}\\right) \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad & y_{n}, \\ldots, y_{q} \\geq 0 \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n& \\sum_{k=n}^{q} y_{k} a_{k j} \\leq y_{j}, \\quad j=1, \\ldots, n-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that $a_{k j} \\geq 0$ for all $k, j$, since positive roots are non-negative linear combinations of roots from the associated simple subsystem ([Hum90]). Therefore $\\Delta\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n-1}\\right) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{q-n+1}$ is compact.\nFor $n \\geq 3$, we further define a function $T: \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ by\n\n$$\nT\\left(y_{1} \\alpha_{1}+\\ldots+y_{n-1} \\alpha_{n-1}\\right):=\\int_{\\Delta\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n-1}\\right)} d y_{n} \\ldots d y_{q}\n$$\n\nIf $n=2$, then we define $T$ to jump from 1 inside $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}}$ to 0 on $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{2} \\backslash \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}}$.\n\nIn order to describe some further properties of $T$, we introduce in $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ the dual cone of $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}}$, which is given by\n\n$$\n{ }^{+} \\mathfrak{a}=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}: x=\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} c_{j} \\alpha_{j}, c_{j}>0\\right\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}\n$$\n\nWe first state some general facts which will be useful later on. For $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we denote by\n\n$$\nC(x):=\\operatorname{conv}\\left(\\mathcal{S}_{n} \\cdot x\\right)\n$$\n\nthe convex hull of the $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-orbit of $x$.\nLemma 2.1. (1) If $x \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$, then $x-w x \\in \\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$ for all $w \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$.\n(2) If $x \\in \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$and $h \\in C(x)$, then $x-h \\in \\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$.\n(3) $\\rho \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+0}$.\n\nProof. See [Hel00], Ch. IV, Lemma 8.3. and observe that $x-w x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\nWe shall need the following facts about $T$, established by Graczyk and Loeb:\nLemma 2.2 ([GL95], Prop. 2). $T$ is supported in $\\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$ and continuous and nonnegative on $\\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$. If $x, y \\in \\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$ with $y-x \\in \\overline{+\\mathfrak{a}}$, then $T(x) \\leq T(y)$.\n\nFor regular arguments $x, y \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$, the convolution product $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ is now described as follows in terms of $T$ :\n\nProposition 2.3. For $x, y \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$, the measure $\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $x^{1}+y^{1}+\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}} \\subseteq x^{1}+y^{1}+\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$.

Throughout the paper, we denote the pushforward of a measure $\\mu$ under a measurable mapping $\\varphi$ by $\\varphi_{*}(\\mu)$. As $U(n)=H \\ltimes S U(n)$ with $H=\\left\\{a_{z}=\\operatorname{diag}(z, 1, \\ldots, 1), z \\in U(1)\\right\\}$, Weyl's integration formula gives\n$\\left(\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}\\right)(f)=\\int_{U(1)} \\int_{S U(n)} f\\left(\\sigma\\left(x+a_{z} k y k^{-1} a_{z}^{-1}\\right)\\right) d k d z=\\int_{S U(n)} f\\left(x^{1}+y^{1}+\\sigma\\left(x^{0}+k y^{0} k^{-1}\\right)\\right) d k$ for $x, y \\in \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$. This shows that\n\n$$\n\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}=\\left[\\xi \\mapsto \\xi+x^{1}+y^{1}\\right]_{*}\\left(\\epsilon_{x^{0}} *_{0} \\epsilon_{y^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\left(\\epsilon_{x^{0}} *_{0} \\epsilon_{y^{0}}\\right)(g):=\\int_{S U(n)} g\\left(\\sigma\\left(x^{0}+k y^{0} k^{-1}\\right)\\right) d k\n$$\n\nfor $g \\in C\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}}\\right)$.

Now the claim follows from [GS02], Thm. 2.1 and Prop. 3.1, which contain an explicit expression for the density in the product formula of the $\\phi_{z}$ and thus for $\\epsilon_{x^{0}} *_{0} \\epsilon_{y^{0}}$.\n\nRemark 2.4. Note that in [GS02], the authors work with $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant measures on $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$, while we work with measures supported in $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+0}}$. This results in a factor $1 /\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{n}\\right|$ in [GS02], Prop. 3.1. We further note that in [GS02] the authors missed a factor $2^{\\left|\\Sigma_{+}\\right|}=2^{\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)}$ in equation (3), which leads to a missing factor $2^{-\\left|\\Sigma_{+}\\right|}$in Prop. 3.1.\n\nRemark 2.5.

Note again that the authors there work with an $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant formulation. As we assumed $y+C(x) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$, the pushforward measures $w_{*}\\left(\\epsilon_{x} * \\epsilon_{y}\\right)$ have disjoint supports, resulting in the expression above.\n\nBesides the norm-decreasing translation operators $T_{y}$ on $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$, we will need dilation operators in order to establish a radial multiresolution.

Let $\\left(V_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ be a radial MRA. Then $f \\in V_{0}$ implies $T^{(\\lambda)} f \\notin V_{0}$ for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$.\n\nProof. Recall that $\\mathcal{H}\\left(T^{(\\lambda)} f\\right)=J(., i(\\lambda+\\rho)) \\mathcal{H} f$. But if $\\beta \\in X$, then $J(\\cdot, i(\\lambda+\\rho)) \\beta \\notin X$ as the functions $J(\\cdot, i(\\lambda+\\rho))$ are not periodic. Now the previous lemma implies the assertion.\n\nTheorem 3.7 (Orthonormalization).

Note first that as a consequence of condition (RB), the right side in (3.1) belongs to $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$. By definition $P_{\\phi^{*}}=1$ a.e., so by Corollary 3.4 it only remains to prove $V_{\\phi}=V_{\\phi^{*}}$. For this, it suffices to verify that $M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi^{*} \\in V_{\\phi}$ and $M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi \\in V_{\\phi^{*}}$ for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$. We employ Lemma 3.5 and see\n\n$$\nM_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi^{*} \\in V_{\\phi} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi^{*}\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta \\beta}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\phi \\quad \\text { for some } \\beta \\in X\n$$\n\nBut\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi^{*}\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\lambda}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\mathcal{H} \\phi}{\\sqrt{P_{\\phi}}}\n$$\n\nAnalogously we get\n\n$$\nM_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi \\in V_{\\phi^{*}} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta \\widetilde{\\beta}}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\phi^{*}=\\frac{\\Delta \\widetilde{\\beta}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\mathcal{H} \\phi}{\\sqrt{P_{\\phi}}} \\quad \\text { for some } \\widetilde{\\beta} \\in X\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\lambda}}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\phi\n$$\n\nThis gives, for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$, the conditions\n\n$$\n\\frac{S_{\\lambda}}{\\sqrt{P_{\\phi}}} \\in X \\quad \\text { and } \\quad S_{\\lambda} \\sqrt{P_{\\phi}} \\in X\n$$\n\nBut these conditions are guaranteed by our assumption on $P_{\\phi}$.\n\nGiven a function $\\phi \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ satisfying (RB) plus some additional conditions (see Proposition 3.8 and Theorem 3.9 below), we will now construct a radial MRA having $\\phi$ as scaling function. Recall the unitary dilations 2.4 and define scale spaces $\\left\\{V_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ by\n\n$$\nV_{0}:=V_{\\phi}, \\quad V_{j}:=D_{2^{-j}} V_{0}\n$$\n\nThen property (4) of Definition 3.1 is satisfied by construction.

Thus $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, \\lambda}: \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}$is a Riesz basis of $V_{j}$ with the same Riesz constants $A, B>0$ as for $\\phi$. In particular,\n\n$$\nV_{j}=\\overline{\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{\\phi_{j, \\lambda}: \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nMoreover, if $B_{\\phi}=\\left\\{\\phi_{0, \\lambda}: \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}$is an orthonormal basis of $V_{0}$, then $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, \\lambda}: \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}$constitutes an orthonormal basis of $V_{j}$. We shall now analyze the further required properties of Definition 3.1 in this case. We start with the condition that the scale spaces should be nested.\n\nProposition 3.8. For $\\phi \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$satisfying ( $R B$ ) and the spaces $V_{j}$ defined above, the following statements are equivalent:\n(1) $V_{j} \\subseteq V_{j+1}$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n(2) $V_{-1} \\subseteq V_{0}$.\n(3) There exists a function $\\gamma \\in X$ such that $\\phi$ satisfies the two-scale relation\n\n$$\n\\Delta(2 \\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)=\\gamma(\\xi) \\Delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$\n\nIn this case, if we expand $\\phi_{-1,0}$ in $V_{0}$ as $\\phi_{-1,0}=\\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} \\alpha_{\\lambda} \\phi_{0, \\lambda}$ with $\\alpha=\\left(\\alpha_{\\lambda}\\right)_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} \\in \\ell^{2}\\left(P_{+}\\right)$, then $\\gamma=c \\cdot \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} \\alpha_{\\lambda} S_{\\lambda}$ with $c=2^{-\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{2}} i^{\\left|\\Sigma_{+}\\right|} \\sqrt{n!}$.\n\nProof. The equivalence of (1) and (2) is immediate by rescaling. Suppose now $V_{-1} \\subseteq V_{0}$. Then by Lemma 3.5 shows that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\phi_{-1,0}=\\frac{\\Delta \\beta}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\phi\n$$\n\nwith some $\\beta \\in S$. On the other hand, using equations (2.8) and (2.5) we calculate\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{H} \\phi_{-1,0}(\\xi) & =\\mathcal{H}\\left(D_{2} M_{0} T^{(0)} \\phi\\right)(\\xi)=D_{1 / 2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{0}}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\phi\\right)(\\xi) \\\\\n& =2^{m / 2} \\frac{\\Delta(2 \\xi) S_{0}(2 \\xi)}{\\pi(2 \\xi)} \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)=\\frac{2^{n^{2} / 2}}{i^{\\left|\\Sigma_{+}\\right|} \\sqrt{n!}} \\frac{\\Delta(2 \\xi)}{\\pi(\\xi)} \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe conclude that\n\n$$\n\\Delta(2 \\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)=c \\cdot \\beta(\\xi) \\Delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$\n\nwith $c$ as stated and obtain the desired result with $\\gamma=c \\beta \\in X$. If $\\phi_{-1,0}=\\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} \\alpha_{\\lambda} \\phi_{0, \\lambda}$, we employ Lemma 3.5 and see that $\\beta=c^{-1} \\gamma=\\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} \\alpha_{\\lambda} S_{\\lambda}$.\n\nConversely, assume that (3) is satisfied. Performing the same calculation as above for $\\phi_{-1, \\lambda}$ leads to\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\phi_{-1, \\lambda}=\\text { const. } \\frac{S_{\\lambda}(2 \\xi)}{\\pi(\\xi)} \\Delta(2 \\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)\n$$\n\nand an application of Lemma 3.5 shows that $\\phi_{-1, \\lambda} \\in V_{0}$ if and only if\n\n$$\nS_{\\lambda}(2 \\xi) \\Delta(2 \\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)=\\gamma_{\\lambda}(\\xi) \\Delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$\n\nfor some $\\gamma_{\\lambda} \\in X$. Recall that $\\phi$ satisfies the two-scale relation (3). Choosing\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\lambda}(\\xi):=\\text { const. } \\gamma(\\xi) S_{\\lambda}(2 \\xi) \\in X\n$$\n\nwe thus conclude $\\phi_{-1, \\lambda} \\in V_{0}$ and therefore $V_{-1} \\subseteq V_{0}$.\nTheorem 3.9. Let $\\phi \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ satisfy condition ( $R B$ ) and assume that the scale spaces are nested, i.e. $V_{j} \\subseteq V_{j+1}$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Suppose further that $|\\mathcal{H} \\phi|$ is continuous at 0 . Then $\\left(V_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ is a radial MRA if and only if $\\mathcal{H} \\phi(0) \\neq 0$. Moreover, if $\\phi$ is an orthonormal scaling function then $|\\mathcal{H} \\phi(0)|=1$.\n\nProof. The idea is the same as in the proof of [RR03], Thm. 4.9, but now the proof is much more involved, as sufficient knowledge of the generalized translation will be needed, which was simple and explicit in [RR03]. To start with, we use Theorem 3.7 and obtain an orthonormal scaling function $\\phi^{*} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ with the same scale spaces. In order to prove that $\\bigcap_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{j}=\\{0\\}$ we have to show $\\lim _{j \\rightarrow-\\infty}\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}=0$ for all $f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$, where\n\n$$\nP_{j}: L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right) \\rightarrow V_{j}, \\quad f \\mapsto \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, \\lambda}^{*}\\right\\rangle \\phi_{j, \\lambda}^{*}\n$$\n\ndenotes the orthogonal projection and $\\phi_{j, \\lambda}^{*}$ is defined as in (3.2). As continuous functions with compact support are dense in $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ we may assume that $f \\in C_{c}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}\\right)$. Denoting $K:=\\operatorname{supp} f$ and using Parseval's identity we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}^{2} & =\\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left|\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, \\lambda}^{*}\\right\\rangle\\right|^{2} \\\\\n& \\leq\\|f\\|_{2}^{2} \\cdot \\int_{K} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left|\\phi_{j, \\lambda}^{*}(\\xi)\\right|^{2} \\omega(\\xi) d \\xi \\\\\n& =\\text { const. } \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}^{j} K} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} M_{\\lambda}^{2}\\left|T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi^{*}(\\xi)\\right|^{2} \\omega(\\xi) d \\xi \\\\\n& =\\text { const. } \\int_{\\mathbb{Z}^{j} K \\cap \\mathfrak{a}_{+}} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}} M_{\\lambda}^{2}\\left|\\left(\\delta_{\\lambda+\\rho} * \\delta_{\\xi}\\right)\\left(\\phi^{*}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\omega(\\xi) d \\xi\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere above and in the sequel, const. denotes a varying positive constant depending on $f$ and $n$ only. Observe that $\\lambda+\\rho \\in \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$and therefore Proposition 2.3 applies to $\\delta_{\\lambda+\\rho} * \\delta_{\\xi}$ in the integral above. We may further assume that $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is negative and already so small that $\\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$. Hence, by Lemma 2.6, $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\delta_{\\lambda+\\rho} * \\delta_{\\xi}\\right) \\in \\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)$ for all $\\lambda$. In view of Proposition 2.3 we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left(\\delta_{\\lambda+\\rho} * \\delta_{\\xi}\\right)\\left(\\phi^{*}\\right)=\\int_{\\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)} \\phi^{*}(x) \\frac{\\pi(\\rho) \\pi(x)}{\\pi(\\lambda+\\rho) \\pi(\\xi)} \\sum_{v, w \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}} \\operatorname{sgn}(v) \\operatorname{sgn}(w) T(v \\xi+w(\\lambda+\\rho)-x) d x\n$$\n\nHere $d x$ denotes the Lebesgue volume in the affine hyperplane $\\lambda^{1}+\\xi^{1}+\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which contains $\\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)$, where still $\\xi \\in 2^{j} K \\cap \\mathfrak{a}_{+}$with $j<0$. Recall at this point the decomposition\n\n$\\mathbb{R}^{n}=\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\oplus \\mathbb{R} \\underline{1}$, with orthogonal projections $x^{0}$ of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ onto $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ and $x^{1}$ onto $\\mathbb{R} \\underline{1}$. Using Lemmata 2.2 and 2.1 we further see that for all $x \\in \\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)$ and $v, w \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$,\n\n$$\nT(v \\xi+w(\\lambda+\\rho)-x) \\leq T(\\lambda+\\rho+\\xi-x)\n$$\n\nMoreover, as $x-(\\lambda+\\rho) \\in C(\\xi)$, we may estimate the argument of $T$ as $\\|x-(\\lambda+\\rho)-\\xi\\|_{2} \\leq$ $2\\|\\xi\\|_{2} \\leq \\sup _{x \\in K}\\|x\\|_{2}$. By its properties noted in Lemma 2.2, $T$ is therefore uniformly bounded on the domain of integration in (3.5), i.e. with a bound independent of $\\lambda$ and $\\xi$. By the CauchySchwarz inequality and recalling that $\\pi^{2}=\\omega$, we may therefore estimate\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left(\\delta_{\\lambda+\\rho} * \\delta_{\\xi}\\right)\\left(\\phi^{*}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\leq \\frac{\\text { const. }}{\\pi(\\lambda+\\rho)^{2} \\omega(\\xi)} \\int_{\\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)}|\\phi^{*}(x)|^{2} \\omega(x) d x\n$$\n\nwhere the constant is again independent of $\\lambda$ and $\\xi$. Now fix $R>0$ such that $K \\subseteq A+B$ with\n\n$$\nA=\\left\\{x=x^{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n} \\cap \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}:\\|x\\|_{2} \\leq R\\right\\}, \\quad B=\\left\\{x=x^{1} \\in \\mathbb{R} \\underline{1} \\cap \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}:\\|x\\|_{2} \\leq R\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand recall that $M_{\\lambda}=\\frac{\\pi(\\lambda+\\rho)}{\\sqrt{n!\\prod_{k=1}^{n} k!}}$. Then we may continue our previous estimate as follows:\n\n$$\n\\|P_{j} f\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq \\text { const. } \\int_{2^{j}(A+B)} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left(\\int_{\\lambda+\\rho+C(\\xi)}|\\phi^{*}(x)|^{2} \\omega(x) d x\\right) d \\xi\n$$\n\nNoting that $C(\\xi)=\\xi^{1}+C\\left(\\xi^{0}\\right)$ with $C\\left(\\xi^{0}\\right) \\subseteq 2^{j} A, \\xi^{1} \\in 2^{j} B$, we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}^{2} & \\leq \\text { const. } \\int_{2^{j} A} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left(\\int_{2^{j} B} \\int_{\\lambda+\\rho+\\xi^{1}+C\\left(\\xi^{0}\\right)}\\left|\\phi^{*}(x)\\right|^{2} \\omega(x) d x d \\xi^{1}\\right) d \\xi^{0} \\\\\n& \\leq \\text { const. } \\int_{2^{j} A} \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left(\\int_{\\lambda+\\rho+2^{j}(A+B)}\\left|\\phi^{*}(t)\\right|^{2} \\omega(t) d t\\right) d \\xi^{0}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nChoosing $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ sufficiently small, we can achieve that the sets $\\lambda+\\rho+2^{j}(A+B)$ with $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$ are pairwise disjoint. This finally leads to the estimate\n\n$$\n\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq \\text { const. } \\int_{2^{j} A}\\left(\\int_{\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}}\\left|\\phi^{*}(t)\\right|^{2} \\omega(t) d t\\right) d \\xi^{0}\n$$\n\nThe inner integral being finite, it follows that $\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2} \\rightarrow 0$ for $j \\rightarrow-\\infty$ as claimed. This finishes the proof of condition (2) in the definition of a radial MRA, which is satisfied without requirements on $\\mathcal{H} \\phi$.\n\nIt remains to analyze condition (3) concerning the density of $\\bigcup_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{j}$ in $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$. Here we closely follow [RR03]. Suppose first that $\\mathcal{H} \\phi(0) \\neq 0$ and let $h \\in\\left(\\bigcup_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{j}\\right)^{\\perp}$, i.e. $P_{j} h=0$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\varepsilon>0$. By the Plancherel theorem for the Hankel transform, we can find $f \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ such that $\\mathcal{H} f$ has compact support and $\\|f-h\\|_{2} \\leq \\varepsilon$. This implies\n\n$$\n\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}=\\left\\|P_{j}(f-h)\\right\\|_{2} \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. By the Riesz basis assumption on $\\phi$, we further have\n\n$$\nA \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left|\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, \\lambda}\\right\\rangle\\right|^{2} \\leq\\left\\|P_{j} f\\right\\|_{2}^{2} \\leq B \\sum_{\\lambda \\in P_{+}}\\left|\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, \\lambda}\\right\\rangle\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nSuppose now that $\\operatorname{supp} \\mathcal{H} f \\subseteq K$ with some compact $K \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$.

This proves that $\\bigcup_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{j}$ is dense in $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$.\nConversely, suppose that $\\bigcup_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} V_{j}$ is dense in $L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$.

Recalling formula (2.8), we calculate the left hand side of the previous equation as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{0} D_{2} T^{(0)} \\psi^{i}\\right)(\\xi) & =D_{2^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{0}}{\\pi} \\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}\\right)(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\text { const. } \\frac{\\Delta(2 \\xi)}{\\pi(\\xi)} \\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2 \\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $M_{0} D_{2} T^{(0)} \\psi^{i} \\in W_{-1}$ if and only if\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2 \\xi)=\\beta^{i}(\\xi) \\delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$\n\nfor some $\\beta^{i} \\in X$ such that $\\left(\\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)\\right)_{p \\in L / I} \\perp(\\gamma(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p))_{p \\in L / I}$ almost everywhere. By Proposition 4.1 we see that $\\left\\{M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\psi^{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq r-1, \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}$is an orthonormal system if and only if\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta_{i j} & =\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{q \\in I} \\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2 \\xi+q) \\overline{\\mathcal{H} \\psi^{j}(2 \\xi+q)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{p \\in L} \\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2(\\xi+p)) \\overline{\\mathcal{H} \\psi^{j}(2(\\xi+p))} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{p \\in L / I} \\sum_{q \\in I} \\beta^{i}(\\xi+p+q) \\overline{\\beta^{j}(\\xi+p+q)}|\\delta(\\xi+q+p)|^{2}|\\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi+p+q)|^{2} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{p \\in L / I} \\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\overline{\\beta^{j}(\\xi+p)}|\\delta(\\xi+p)|^{2} \\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{q \\in I}|\\mathcal{H} \\phi((\\xi+p)+q)|^{2} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{p \\in L / I} \\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\overline{\\beta^{j}(\\xi+p)}|\\delta(\\xi+p)|^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nalmost everywhere. This is equivalent to the condition that the set\n\n$$\nM:=\\left\\{\\left(\\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)\\right)_{p \\in L / I}: 1 \\leq i \\leq r-1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis an orthonormal system in $\\mathbb{C}^{|L / I|}$ a.e. Furthermore, the vector $\\left(\\beta^{0}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)\\right)_{p \\in L / I}$ is almost everywhere normalized in $\\mathbb{C}^{|L / I|}$ according to Lemma 3.11, and is orthogonal to $M$ according to Proposition 4.2. We conclude that $r \\leq|L / I|$ is a necessary condition by dimensionality. Moreover, if the $\\psi^{i}$ satisfy (4.1), then a short calculation gives\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}\\left(M_{\\lambda} D_{2} T^{(\\lambda)} \\psi^{i}\\right)(\\xi)=\\text { const. } \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta(\\xi) S_{\\lambda}(2 \\xi) \\beta^{i}(\\xi)}{\\pi(\\xi)} \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$\n\nSo indeed, $M_{\\lambda} D_{2} T^{(\\lambda)} \\psi^{i} \\in V_{0}$ for all $\\lambda \\in P_{+}$by Lemma 3.5. As $S_{\\lambda}(2 \\cdot)$ is $L$-periodic, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(S_{\\lambda}(2(\\xi+p)) \\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)\\right)_{p \\in L / I} \\in \\mathbb{C}\\left(\\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)\\right)_{p \\in L / I}\n$$\n\nand thus $M_{\\lambda} D_{2} T^{(\\lambda)} \\psi^{i} \\in W_{-1} \\subseteq V_{0}$ by Proposition 4.2. We conclude that $r=|L / I|$ is also a necessary condition.\n\nCorollary 4.4. Every radial $M R A\\left(V_{j}\\right)_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ with orthonormal scaling function $\\phi$ admits an orthonormal wavelet basis consisting of $r-1$ wavelets, where $r=|L / I|=2^{n}$, i.e. there are functions $\\psi^{1}, \\ldots, \\psi^{r-1} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{M_{\\lambda} D_{2^{-j}} T^{(\\lambda)} \\psi^{i}: 1 \\leq i \\leq r-1, \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis an orthonormal basis of the complementary space $W_{j}$.\n\nProof. Recall that $\\Delta(x)=\\alpha(x) A_{\\delta}\\left(e^{i x}\\right)$ with the phase factor $\\alpha(\\xi)=e^{-i \\frac{n-j}{2}(\\xi, \\underline{\\underline{1}})}$. Hence $\\alpha \\Delta$ is $I$-periodic. We now put $\\eta^{0}(\\xi)=\\alpha(-\\xi) G(\\xi)$ with the filter function $G$ associated to $\\phi$ according to formula (3.7). We next choose functions $\\eta^{i} \\in L^{2}\\left(D \\cap \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}\\right), 1 \\leq i \\leq r-1$, in such a way that the matrix\n\n$$\n(\\eta^{i}(\\xi+p))_{0 \\leq i \\leq r-1, p \\in L / I} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{r \\times r}\n$$\n\nis unitary for almost all $\\xi \\in D \\cap \\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}$; here again $D=[0,2 \\pi]^{\\mathrm{n}}$. This amounts to constructing a unitary matrix with a given first row in a measurable way. We then extend the $\\eta^{i}$ to all of $D$ via $\\eta^{i}(w x):=\\eta^{i}(x)$ for $w \\in \\mathcal{S}_{n}$ and then to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in an $I$-periodic fashion. We thus obtain functions $\\beta^{i}:=\\alpha \\delta^{-1} \\eta^{i} \\in X$ such that the matrix $A=\\left(A_{i p}\\right)_{0 \\leq i \\leq r-1, p \\in L / I}$ with entries\n\n$$\nA_{i p}=\\beta^{i}(\\xi+p) \\delta(\\xi+p)=\\alpha(\\xi) \\eta^{i}(\\xi+p)\n$$\n\nis almost everywhere unitary. In particular, $\\beta^{0} \\delta=G$. We then define $\\psi^{i} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$ via its Hankel transform by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2 \\xi):=\\beta^{i}(\\xi) \\delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. Construction of radial SCALing Functions \n\nIt remains to discuss how a radial MRA can be actually obtained, i.e. how candidates for radial scaling functions can be found. As our lattice is $I=2 \\pi \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, we can tile $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with copies of $D=[0,2 \\pi]^{\\mathrm{n}}$ along periods of $e^{i\\langle\\xi, \\cdot\\rangle}$, which allows us to interlock Proposition 3.3 with its classical analogue for the Euclidean Fourier transform $\\widehat{f}(\\xi)=(2 \\pi)^{-n / 2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} e^{-i\\langle\\xi, x\\rangle} d x$ on $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Suppose $\\phi_{\\mathfrak{a}} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ is a classical scaling function for a dyadic MRA in $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ which is $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant and such that its classical Fourier transform $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is continuous at 0 and satisfies $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathfrak{a}} \\in L^{2}\\left(\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}, \\omega\\right)$.

(5.1) is a classical scaling function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which is $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant.\n\nMoreover, $\\phi$ is an orthonormal scaling function if and only if $\\phi_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is an orthonormal classical scaling function.\n\nProof. Suppose $\\phi_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is a classical scaling function which is $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant and such that $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is continuous at 0 . Note that the $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariance implies that $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ is $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant as well, and thus definition\n\n(5.1) is meaningful. According to Propos. 5.7. in [Woj97] there are constants $0<A \\leq B<\\infty$ such that\n\n$$\n\\frac{A}{(2 \\pi)^{n}} \\leq \\sum_{l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}}\\left|\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}(\\xi+2 \\pi l)\\right|^{2} \\leq \\frac{B}{(2 \\pi)^{n}} \\quad \\text { a.e.. }\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is an orthonormal (classical) scaling function if and only if $A=B=1$. Since $I=2 \\pi \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, formula (5.2) can be written as\n\n$$\nA \\leq \\sum_{q \\in I}|\\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi+q)|^{2} \\leq B \\quad \\text { a.e.. }\n$$\n\nSo we can invoke Proposition 3.3 and Corollary 3.4 to see that $B_{\\phi}:=\\left\\{M_{\\lambda} T^{(\\lambda)} \\phi: \\lambda \\in P_{+}\\right\\}$ forms a Riesz basis of $V_{0}:=\\overline{\\operatorname{span} B_{\\phi}}$, and that this basis is orthonormal if and only if $\\phi_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is orthonormal. Further, by Lemma 5.8 in [Woj97] there exists a $2 \\pi \\mathbb{Z}^{n}$-periodic function $m$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $\\left.m\\right|_{D} \\in L^{2}(D)$ and such that $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}(2 \\xi)=m(\\xi) \\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}(\\xi)$. Since $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ was assumed to be $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant, $m$ has to be $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariant as well. We again introduce the phase factor $\\alpha(\\xi)=e^{-i \\frac{\\pi-1}{2}(\\xi \\cdot \\underline{1})}$ and define $\\gamma:=\\alpha \\delta^{-1} m \\in S$. We obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta(2 \\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi) & =\\Delta(2 \\xi) \\alpha(2 \\xi)(2 \\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}} m(\\xi) \\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\Delta(2 \\xi) \\alpha(2 \\xi) \\alpha(\\xi)^{-1} m(\\xi)}{\\Delta(\\xi)} \\Delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi) \\\\\n& =\\gamma(\\xi) \\Delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is just the two-scale relation from Proposition 3.8. As $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is continuous at 0 , we get $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}(0) \\neq 0$ and thus $\\mathcal{H} \\phi(0) \\neq 0$, see [Dau92], Remark 3 on p. 144. Indeed, we have seen this reasoning already in the proof of Theorem 3.9. Hence, the conditions of Theorem 3.9 are satisfied and we obtain that $\\phi$ is indeed a radial scaling function.\nConversely, suppose that $\\mathcal{H} \\phi \\in L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$. We proceed as before and note that\n\n$$\nm(\\xi)=\\gamma(\\xi) \\delta(\\xi) \\alpha(\\xi)^{-1}=\\alpha(-\\xi) G(\\xi)\n$$\n\nBy Lemma 3.11, this shows that $m \\in L^{2}(D)$.\nExample 5.2. Es an example, we consider the radial analogue of the Shannon wavelets. Again, we work with the phase factor $\\alpha(\\xi):=e^{-i \\frac{\\pi-1}{2}(\\xi \\cdot \\underline{1})}$. Consider $\\phi_{\\mathrm{a}}$ defined via its classical Fourier transform $\\widehat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{a}}=(2 n)^{-n / 2} \\chi_{[-\\pi, \\pi]^{n}}$. Then by [Woj97], Thm. 2.13, Prop. 5.7 and Lem. 5.8, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is a classical orthonormal scaling function which satisfies the conditions of our Theorem 5.1. Therefore $\\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi):=\\alpha(\\xi) \\chi_{[-\\pi, \\pi]^{n}}(\\xi)$ defines an orthonormal radial scaling function $\\phi$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\phi(2 \\xi)=\\alpha(\\xi) \\chi_{Q}(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)=\\alpha(2 \\xi) \\chi_{Q \\cap[-\\pi, \\pi]^{n}}(\\xi)\n$$\n\nwith the union of cubes\n\n$$\nQ:=Q^{0}:=\\bigcup_{l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n}}\\left(2 \\pi l+[-\\pi / 2, \\pi / 2]^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow define functions $\\beta^{i}=(\\alpha \\delta)^{-1} \\chi_{Q^{i}} \\in X$ with\n\n$$\nQ^{i}=q^{i}+Q\n$$\n\nwhere $q^{i}$ runs through the non-trivial representatives of $L / I$, i.e. through the set $\\{0, \\pi\\}^{n} \\backslash$ $\\{(0, \\ldots, 0)\\}$. Then in view of Theorem 4.3, one obtains an orthonormal radial wavelet basis $\\left(\\psi^{i}\\right)$ for $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ by defining\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} \\psi^{i}(2 \\xi):=\\beta^{i}(\\xi) \\delta(\\xi) \\mathcal{H} \\phi(\\xi)=\\chi_{Q^{i} \\cap[-\\pi, \\pi]^{n}}(\\xi)\n$$\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1.

{"section_id": 6, "text": "# 6. Appendix: Generalizations \n\nMany of the previous results can be generalized in terms of Lie theory. Instead of the action of $U(n)$ on $\\operatorname{Herm}(n)$ by conjugation we may consider an arbitrary compact connected Lie group $K$ which acts on $\\mathfrak{p}=i \\operatorname{Lie}(K) \\subseteq \\operatorname{Lie}(K)_{\\mathbb{C}}$ via the adjoint representation as a group of orthogonal transformations with respect to some $K$-invariant inner product on $\\mathfrak{p}$. First, we replace $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by a maximal abelian subspace $\\mathfrak{a}=i \\operatorname{Lie}(T) \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}$ coming from a maximal torus $T \\subseteq K$ and $\\mathbb{R}_{0}^{n}$ by $\\mathfrak{a}_{0}$, the span of the roots of $K$. The Weyl integration formula holds in this generality (cf. [GV88], Eq. (2.4.22)). Further, $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}}_{+}$is now the positive Weyl chamber associated with a set of simple positive roots $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{\\operatorname{dim}} \\mathfrak{a}_{0}$. As usual, we identify $\\mathfrak{a}$ with $\\mathfrak{a}^{*}$ using a $K$-invariant inner product on $\\mathfrak{p}$. The associated Weyl group $W$ replaces the symmetric group $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$ and $\\pi$ becomes the usual alternating polynomial $\\pi=\\prod_{i=1}^{q} \\alpha_{i}$ with respect to the positive roots $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{q}$. Again, we define a generalized translation by averaging the translation along adjoint orbits of $K$ in $\\mathfrak{p}$.\n\nThe Weyl character formula yields a natural choice for the trigonometric polynomials $S_{\\lambda}$, which are indexed by the set of dominant weights $P_{+}$of $K$ with respect to $T$. On the other hand the Harish-Chandra-Integral ([HC57]) allows us to express the spherical functions $J(\\cdot, i y)$ of $K \\ltimes \\mathfrak{p} / K$ in a similar fashion. Thus interlocking these two allows for nice properties of the $S_{\\lambda}$ with respect to the generalized translation. More precisely, we obtain\n\n$$\nS_{\\lambda}(x)=\\frac{1}{i^{q} \\sqrt{|W|} \\Delta(x)} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\operatorname{sgn}(w) e^{i(\\lambda+\\rho)(w x)}=M_{\\lambda} \\frac{\\pi(x)}{\\Delta(x)} J(x, i(\\lambda+\\rho))\n$$\n\nas a generalization of Eq. (2.6). Here, $s_{\\lambda}:=i^{q} \\sqrt{|W|} S_{\\lambda}$ is the trigonometric polynomial associated to the highest weight $\\lambda$ in the Weyl character formula ([Kna96], Thm. 5.113), $\\Delta$ denotes the Weyl denominator and $M_{\\lambda}=$ const. $\\pi(\\lambda+\\rho)$ is a suitable normalization constant determined by the Harish-Chandra-Integral (see for example [McS21], Eq. 3.3). Again, the Peter-Weyl theorem and the Schur orthogonality relations ensure that we obtain an orthonormal basis.\n\nUsing a structure theorem for compact connected Lie groups ([Pro07], Ch. 10, \u00a77.2, Thm. 4), we can decompose $K=(L \\times H) / C$ with $L$ compact, connected and semisimple, a torus $H$ and a finite subgroup $C$ of the center of $L \\times H$ intersecting $H$ trivially. This allows us to reduce to the semisimple case as in the proof of Proposition 2.3 and apply the results of [GS02] to find the density of the translation. Note that $\\mathfrak{a}_{0}$ is the orthogonal complement of $i \\operatorname{Lie}(H)$ in $\\mathfrak{a}$ as $L, L \\times H$ and $K$ all have the same roots. We now take $I=i \\operatorname{ker}(\\exp : \\operatorname{Lie}(T) \\rightarrow T)$ as the integral lattice of $T$ and replace $D$ by a fundamental domain of the torus $\\mathfrak{a} / I$. After adjusting these notations, the arguments up until Theorem 4.3 will still work. A small caveat is to see that the Weyl group acts on the integral lattice in order to see for example the $\\mathcal{S}_{n}$-invariance of $P_{\\phi}$ in Proposition 3.3. However, employing the analytic Weyl group $W \\cong N_{K}(T) / T$, we immediatly verify\n\n$$\n\\exp (\\operatorname{Ad}(k) x)=k \\exp (x) k^{-1}=e\n$$\n\nfor $w=\\operatorname{Ad}(k) \\in W$ and $x \\in \\operatorname{ker}(\\exp \\operatorname{Lie}(T) \\rightarrow T)$. After Section 4, however, the geometry will not be as compatible as in the case $K=U(n)$. For example, it is not clear how to obtain radial scaling functions as the lattice $I$ will generally not behave well with the periodicy of $e^{i\\left(\\xi_{,}\\right)}$, which was crucial in the proof of Theorem 5.1.\n\nIn the case where $K=S U(2)$ acts on $\\operatorname{SHerm}(2)$ by conjugation, this generalization reduces to the situation of [RR03], which can be seen as follows: We identify $\\mathfrak{a}=\\operatorname{SHerm}(2) \\cong \\mathbb{R}_{0}^{2} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$, so that $W=\\{ \\pm 1\\}, \\pi(t)=2 t, \\Delta(t)=e^{i t}-e^{-i t}$ and $\\overline{\\mathfrak{a}_{+}}=[0, \\infty[$. Using these identifications and the fact that $K$ is of rank 1 , the function $T$ is simply the indicator function $\\chi_{] 0, \\infty[ }$. Thus Proposition 2.3 reduces to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\delta_{r} * \\delta_{s}\\right)(f) & =\\frac{1}{2 r s} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) t \\sum_{i, j \\in\\{0,1\\}}(-1)^{i}(-1)^{j} T\\left((-1)^{i} r+(-1)^{j} s-t\\right) d t \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2 r s} \\int_{|r-s|}^{r+s} f(t) t d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich agrees with formula (4.1) of [RR03]. A direct calculation shows that $P_{+}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, so that $S_{\\lambda}(t)=\\sqrt{2} \\Delta(t)^{-1} \\sin ((k+1) t)$ for $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2} k \\in P_{+}$. This agrees, up to the factor $\\Delta(t)^{-1}$, with the definition in [RR03], \u00a74. In fact all our statements in this paper, such as for example the definition of the set $X$ (called $S$ in [RR03]), are modified by this factor. This is a technical modification to accomodate for the fact that for non-semisimple Lie groups the Weyl vector $\\rho$ is not necessarily contained in the weight lattice $P$. By re-introducing the factor $\\Delta^{-1}$ we compensate a possible loss of $I$-periodicity of the functions $\\Delta S_{\\lambda}$.\n\nIt is a specialty of this rank 1 situation that the weight lattice and the integral lattice align nicely, which made the explicit construction of orthonormal wavelets in [RR03] work.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[BSO05] S.
