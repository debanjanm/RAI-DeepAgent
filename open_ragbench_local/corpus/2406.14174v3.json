While these practices can improve economic efficiency and even increase total consumer surplus, questions remain about their distributional consequences. Price discrimination affects consumers differently, and evaluating its welfare effects solely through aggregate consumer surplus conceals these heterogeneous impacts. In particular, segmenting markets to maximize total consumer surplus can inadvertently favor wealthier consumers.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *The (T) symbol means that the authors' names are presented in a certified random order (Ray and Robson, 2018).

This outcome is achieved by exploiting pooling externalities (Galperti, Levkun, and Perego, 2023): consumers with a low willingness to pay exert a positive externality on consumers with a high willingness to pay who belong to the same segment by inducing the seller to charge prices below the uniform monopoly price. Adequately pooling consumers in the same segments therefore increases the total share of the surplus going to consumers, particularly those most willing to pay. However, a low willingness to pay is often indicative of adverse economic and social circumstances. ${ }^{1}$ Therefore, maximizing consumer surplus can unintentionally benefit wealthy buyers to the detriment of poorer ones.\n\nIn this paper, we characterize optimal segmentations for objectives that prioritize the welfare of consumers with low willingness to pay. Our two main economic insights are the following. First, unlike segmentations that maximize total consumer surplus, which assign consumers with a high willingness to pay to low-price segments, optimal redistributive segmentations are positive-assortative: they assign buyers with a high willingness to pay to high-price segments and buyers with low willingness to pay to low-price segments. As a result, they induce the monopolist to price progressively, meaning that wealthier consumers pay higher prices than poorer ones (Section 3.4). Second, this separation of wealthy and poor consumers in different segments sometimes allows the seller to price discriminate more effectively, and therefore increase its profit compared to uniform pricing. As a consequence, redistributive segmentations may inadvertently allocate part of the surplus created to the seller, thus not maximizing total consumer surplus (Section 3.5).\n\nOur model considers a continuous population of buyers, each having a unit demand for a good sold by a monopolistic seller. Each buyer is characterized by a type equal to their willingness to pay for the good. We refer to the initial distribution of types in the economy as the aggregate market. Without loss of generality, we assume that the seller's cost of production is zero, so gains from trade are always positive. A market designer can flexibly segment the aggregate market, anticipating that the seller will charge a profit-maximizing price in each segment. The designer's preferences are represented by a welfare function, which describes the social value of a given type of buyer consuming at a specific price. We restrict attention to welfare functions that align with consumer surplus: welfare is positive if and only if the buyer is willing to consume, and welfare is decreasing in price. Among these, we focus on redistributive welfare functions, under which giving a price discount to a low-type buyer increases aggregate welfare more than giving the same discount to a high-type buyer. Mathematically, this property corresponds to supermodularity. Two examples of redistributive welfare functions are the weighted utilitarian welfare function with decreasing Pareto weights, which has received particular attention in the recent\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ We refer to Dworczak, Kominers, and Akbarpour (2021) and Akbarpour, Dworczak, and Kominers (2024b) for further discussion.\n\nredistributive market design literature (Dworczak et al., 2021; Akbarpour et al., 2024b); and concave increasing transformations of consumer surplus, considered in the literature on optimal taxation (Mirrlees, 1971) and insurance (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976).\n\nOur main result, Theorem 1, characterizes the set of segmentations that are optimal for some redistributive welfare function as those that saturate a specific set of the seller's incentive constraints. These binding incentive constraints ensure that no marginal reallocations of buyers across segments can be beneficial for every redistributive welfare function. Theorem 1 relies on a key result of independent interest: the characterization of the redistributive order, which ranks a segmentation as more redistributive than another if it yields higher aggregate welfare for every redistributive welfare function (Proposition 1).\n\nWe leverage Theorem 1's characterization to draw key economic implications of optimal redistributive segmentations. We first show the optimality of progressive pricing by proving that any optimal segmentation must assign buyer types to prices in a positiveassortative manner. Specifically, Theorem 2.A establishes that any optimal segmentation satisfies a weak form of monotonicity, which requires that, if a buyer consumes at a given price, there must exist a buyer with a greater willingness to pay who consumes at a higher price. Optimal segmentations may also satisfy a stronger notion of monotonicity: if a buyer consumes at a given price, then all buyers with a greater willingness to pay consume at a higher price. We show in Theorem 2.B that optimal segmentations satisfy this strong form of monotonicity if and only if the welfare function satisfies a strengthening of supermodularity reflecting strong redistributive concerns. Furthermore, optimal strongly monotone segmentations are obtained by following a simple greedy algorithm that iteratively maximizes the welfare of every type starting from the lowest.\n\nSecond, while redistribution does not induce an equity-efficiency trade-off (Lemma 1 shows that optimal redistributive segmentations are efficient), we show that it may be in conflict with consumer surplus maximization. The monotonic structure of redistributive segmentations implies separation of buyers with low and high willingness to pay into different segments, possibly allowing the seller to price discriminate more effectively than under consumer surplus maximizing segmentations. As a result, the seller might obtain a strictly positive share of the surplus generated by segmenting the market. In such cases, we say that the seller enjoys a redistributive rent. Redistributive rents arise especially when optimal segmentations satisfy the strong form of monotonicity described in the previous paragraph. Theorem 3 characterizes the markets for which strong redistributive preferences necessarily induce a redistributive rent for the seller. When rents are not necessary, the optimal segmentation is very simple and only generates two segments: one where the lowest possible price is charged, pooling all types that would not have bought the good in the unsegmented market; and one complementary segment where the uniform monopoly price is charged.\n\nOur analysis considers the segmentation problem faced by a market designer with\n\nredistributive concerns. In practice, however, market segmentation is primarily conducted by private actors whose objectives are not necessarily aligned with welfare maximization. For example, online platforms can focus on maximizing the number of transactions (Romanyuk and Smolin, 2019), while data intermediaries aim to maximize profits (Yang, 2022). In the last section of the paper, we therefore investigate under what conditions redistributive segmentations can be implemented by a regulator who can only imperfectly observe the segmentation chosen by an agent, assumed here to be the seller. ${ }^{2}$ We introduce a notion of price-based implementation: a segmentation is implementable through pricebased regulation if there exists no alternative segmentation that strictly increases the seller's profit while inducing the same distribution of prices. ${ }^{3}$ This notion of implementation is motivated by the fact that although regulators are likely to possess less information than data intermediaries, they can plausibly observe the distribution of charged prices. ${ }^{4}$ In the context of regulating online platforms, for instance, it only involves monitoring transaction data and imposing penalties based on the divergence of the empirical price distribution from the desired target distribution. In Proposition 2, we show that any optimal redistributive segmentation is implementable through price-based regulation. ${ }^{5}$\n\nRelated literature. Our paper contributes to the analysis of the welfare effects of third-degree price discrimination, following Pigou (1920) and Robinson (1933). Much of this literature focuses on studying how given market segmentations affect efficiency, consumer surplus, total output, and prices (Schmalensee, 1981; Varian, 1985; Aguirre, Cowan, and Vickers, 2010; Cowan, 2016; Rhodes and Zhou, 2024). Le Grand (1975) is the first to study theoretically the use of third-degree price discrimination as a redistributive device for public firms.\n\nBergemann et al. (2015) pioneered an information-design-based approach to thirddegree price discrimination by characterizing the feasible welfare outcomes under any segmentation of a monopolistic market. ${ }^{6}$ They show that any combination of consumer surplus and producer profit such that the seller's profit is at least equal to that under uniform pricing, the consumer surplus is non-negative, and the total surplus does not exceed the efficient level, is achievable through some segmentation. Haghpanah and Siegel (2022) and Terstiege and Vigier (2023) perform the same exercise in a multi-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The result would still hold if the agent had a different objective function, provided it is aligned with efficiency. For example, a platform remunerated by a flat fee on transactions would seek to maximize participation, and thus segment efficiently.\n    ${ }^{3}$ This notion of implementation is equivalent to Lin and Liu's (2024) notion of credibility. We further discuss the connection to that contribution in Section 4, Footnote 29.\n    ${ }^{4}$ Many websites, such as Camelcamelcamel, Keepa, Price Before, and Honey, already specialize in tracking the evolution, frequency and extent of price fluctuations for products sold on Amazon.\n    ${ }^{5}$ In fact, Proposition 2 states a more general result of independent interest: any efficient segmentation can be implemented via price-based regulation.\n    ${ }^{6}$ We refer to Kamenica (2019) and Bergemann and Morris (2019) for comprehensive reviews of the Bayesian persuasion and information design literature.\n\nproduct environment, while Elliott, Galeotti, Koh, and Li (2024) and Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (2024) consider competitive markets. Kartik and Zhong (2023), extend the characterization of the welfare outcomes of Bergemann et al. to the case where the buyer and the seller have correlated values. ${ }^{7}$ We contribute to this literature by studying the impact of market segmentation on consumer welfare beyond the standard of consumer surplus. In particular, we study redistributive welfare functions and show that prioritizing low-type consumers does not hinder efficiency but may not maximize total consumer surplus.\n\nDoval and Smolin (2024) study the welfare effects of information provision on a heterogeneous population of agents. They introduce the Bayes welfare set, which consists of the set of welfare profiles that can be achieved under any information policy. They characterize this set geometrically and show that its Pareto frontier is generated by the set of solutions of a family of Bayesian persuasion problems, in which a weighted utilitarian social planner plays the role of the designer. As such, they characterize the welfare effects that any segmentation can have on consumers of different types, without assuming any particular shape for the welfare function. In our paper, we assume the welfare function satisfies particular conditions-specifically, supermodularity-, solve explicitly for the optimal segmentations, and show that their structure differs from Bergemann et al.'s consumer-surplus maximizing segmentations.\n\nDub\u00e9 and Misra (2023) conduct a randomized controlled field experiment to study the welfare implications of personalized pricing. Although they find a negative effect of personalized pricing on total consumer surplus, the effect on aggregate consumer welfare is positive under some inequality-averse welfare functions. This shows that buyers with low willingness to pay are the ones who benefit the most from the implemented price discrimination. Buchholz, Doval, Kastl, Mat\u011bjka, and Salz (2020) study the effect of price discrimination on a two-sided platform for cab rides. They also find that while aggregate consumer surplus decreases, more price-sensitive buyers benefit from personalized pricing.\n\nFollowing the seminal contribution of Weitzman (1977), a burgeoning literature has integrated redistributive concerns into mechanism design (see, e.g., Condorelli, 2013; Reuter and Groh, 2020; Dworczak et al., 2021; Pai and Strack, 2022; Akbarpour, Budish, Dworczak, and Kominers, 2024a; Akbarpour et al., 2024b; Kang, 2023; Kang and Watt, 2024). ${ }^{8}$ Our paper studies redistribution in an information design setting. ${ }^{9}$ Contrary to\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ A parallel literature following Roesler and Szentes (2017) assumes that buyers are imperfectly informed about their valuation and characterize the consumer-optimal information structures. Condorelli and Szentes (2020) characterize consumer-optimal information structures in the hold-up problem. Ravid, Roesler, and Szentes (2022) consider the case where the buyer has a cost of acquiring information. Deb and Roesler (2021) characterize consumer-optimal information structures in the multidimensional screening problem. Armstrong and Zhou (2022) characterize consumer-optimal information structures when the downstream market is a differentiated product duopoly.\n    ${ }^{8}$ Dworczak (2024) gives an overview of the recent contributions to inequality-aware mechanism design.\n    ${ }^{9}$ Arya and Malhotra (2022) studies redistribution through a different notion of market segmentation, namely, the non-tradability of essential and non-essential goods in a general equilibrium framework.\n\nthe optimal mechanisms in this literature, our redistributive segmentations are socially efficient and thus do not exhibit any equity-efficiency trade-off. Our trade-off is between maximizing total consumer surplus and optimizing redistribution.",

      "text": "# 2 Model \n\nA monopolistic seller (she) supplies a good to a unit mass of buyers. Buyers have a unit demand and differ in their willingness to pay for the good, $\\theta$, assumed to belong to the finite set $\\Theta=\\left\\{\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{K}\\right\\}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta_{1}<\\cdots<\\theta_{K}$. We refer to the willingness to pay as the buyer's type and use the two terms interchangeably. A buyer willing to pay $\\theta$ consumes at a price $p \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$if and only if $\\theta \\geq p$. We assume that the seller's marginal cost of production is zero, so the gains from trade are positive. ${ }^{10}$ The aggregate market (in short the market) $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ specifies the initial distribution of types.\n\nMarket segmentation. A market segmentation is a division of the population of buyers into different market segments indexed by $s \\in S$, where $S$ is a sufficiently large finite set. Formally, a segmentation corresponds to a probability distribution $\\sigma \\in \\Delta(\\Theta \\times S)$ describing the mass $\\sigma(\\theta, s)$ of type $\\theta$ buyers assigned to segment $s$, and satisfying the following market consistency constraint:\n\n$$\n\\forall \\theta \\in \\Theta, \\quad \\sum_{s \\in S} \\sigma(\\theta, s)=\\mu(\\theta)\n$$\n\nCondition $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}\\right)$ ensures that the mass of type $\\theta$ buyers assigned to all segments coincides with the mass of those types in the market. ${ }^{11}$\n\nSeller's pricing. When faced with a market segmentation, the seller sets prices to maximize her profit in each segment. That is, for any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, any $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$, and any $s \\in S$ such that $\\sigma(\\theta, s)>0$ for some $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, the seller solves\n\n$$\n\\max _{p \\in P} p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta, s)\n$$\n\nwhere the set of prices is given by $P=\\Theta$. Indeed, there is no loss of generality in assuming that the seller charges prices in $\\Theta$ since, for any $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$, charging a price falling\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ This assumption is without loss of generality. If the seller's marginal cost were equal to $c>0$, then one could redefine the buyer type as $\\tilde{\\theta}=\\max \\{0, \\theta-c\\}$ for all $\\theta \\in \\Theta$.\n    ${ }^{11}$ We can equivalently think of any pair $(\\sigma, S)$ as a Blackwell experiment which, for any prior distribution $\\mu$ over the state space $\\Theta$, describes the joint distribution of signals $s \\in S$ and states of the world $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, and satisfies the Bayes-plausibility constraint ( $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}$ ) (Aumann, Maschler, and Stearns, 1995; Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011). According to that interpretation, each $\\sigma$ represents a way of revealing information about the buyers' types to the seller.\n\nstrictly between two consecutive types $\\theta_{k}$ and $\\theta_{k+1}$ always yields a lower profit to the seller than charging either $p=\\theta_{k}$ or ${ }^{12} p=\\theta_{k+1}$.\n\nDirect and obedient segmentations. It is without loss of generality to focus on direct and obedient market segmentations. ${ }^{13}$ In such segmentations, $S=P$, so that the segments are indexed by a recommended price, and the seller finds it optimal to follow this recommendation. That is:\n\n$$\n\\forall p, q \\in P, \\quad p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta, p) \\geq q \\sum_{\\theta \\geq q} \\sigma(\\theta, p)\n$$\n\nFor any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we denote the set of direct and obedient segmentations of $\\mu$ as $\\Sigma(\\mu)$. We henceforth slightly abuse terminology by referring to any element of $\\Sigma(\\mu)$ as a segmentation of $\\mu$. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and any $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$, we let $\\sigma_{P} \\in \\Delta(P)$ be the price distribution induced by $\\sigma$, defined by:\n\n$$\n\\forall p \\in P, \\quad \\sigma_{P}(p)=\\sum_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} \\sigma(\\theta, p)\n$$\n\nFor any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we let $p_{\\mu}^{\\star} \\in P$ be the uniform optimal price, that is, the price the seller would optimally charge in the aggregate market: ${ }^{14}$\n\n$$\n\\forall p \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\mu), \\quad p_{\\mu}^{\\star} \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p_{\\mu}^{\\star}} \\mu(\\theta) \\geq p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\mu(\\theta)\n$$\n\nLet $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$. An example of direct segmentation of $\\mu$ is illustrated in Figure 1. The initial mass of consumers, located in the row $p_{\\mu}^{\\star}$ in the grid $\\Theta \\times P$, is divided between two segments $p^{\\prime}$ and $p^{\\prime \\prime}$ vertically, so $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}\\right)$ is satisfied. Furthermore, ( Ob$)$ requires that the mass moved at each point be such that $p^{\\prime}$ and $p^{\\prime \\prime}$ are, respectively, profit-maximizing prices in segments $p^{\\prime}$ and $p^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nRedistributive welfare functions. We consider a designer (he) who can segment the market flexibly. His preferences over market outcomes are represented by a welfare function $w: \\Theta \\times P \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. For any welfare function $w$ and segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$, the aggregate welfare is defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma}[w(\\theta, p)]=\\sum_{(\\theta, p) \\in \\Theta \\times P} w(\\theta, p) \\sigma(\\theta, p)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ Similarly, charging any price lower than $\\theta_{1}$ or greater than $\\theta_{K}$ is never optimal.\n    ${ }^{13}$ See Bergemann and Morris (2019).\n    ${ }^{14}$ Whenever there are several uniform optimal prices for some market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we let $p_{\\mu}^{\\star}$ be the lowest one. This tie-breaking rule is inconsequential for any of our results.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: A direct segmentation with two segments.\n\nThe value $w(\\theta, p)$ thus represents the individual contribution to the aggregate welfare when a buyer of type $\\theta$ is assigned to a segment where the seller charges the price $p$.\n\nWe restrict attention to welfare functions satisfying three conditions. First, the value from assigning a buyer to a segment where he does not consume is zero, and the value from assigning a buyer to a segment where he consumes is non-negative. That is, $w(\\theta, p)=0$ if $\\theta<p$, and $w(\\theta, p) \\geq 0$ if $\\theta \\geq p$. Second, assigning any buyer to a segment where the seller charges a lower price always improves welfare. That is, $p \\mapsto w\\left(\\theta_{k}, p\\right)$ is a non-increasing function on $\\left\\{\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{k}\\right\\}$ for all $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$. The two preceding conditions capture the fact that social welfare aligns with consumer surplus. ${ }^{15}$ The third condition captures the designer's redistributive concerns. We require that any welfare function be supermodular conditional on buyers consuming. That is, for any $(\\theta, p),\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\Theta \\times P$ such that $\\theta^{\\prime}>\\theta \\geq p^{\\prime}>p$,\n\n$$\nw(\\theta, p)-w\\left(\\theta, p^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq w\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nCondition (R) ensures that any price discount increases welfare more when it is granted to low-type buyers rather than high-types.\n\nWe say that a welfare function is redistributive if it satisfies the three conditions above, and denote by $\\mathcal{R}$ the class of those welfare functions. Furthermore, we say that $w$ is strictly redistributive if it satisfies the condition (R) strictly on all $\\Theta \\times P$, and is such that $p \\mapsto w\\left(\\theta_{k}, p\\right)$ is strictly decreasing on $\\left\\{\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{k}\\right\\}$ for all $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$. We denote the class of strictly redistributive welfare functions by $\\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ It is straightforward to verify that the buyer-utilitarian welfare function, given by $w(\\theta, p)=(\\theta-p) \\mathbb{1}_{\\theta \\geq p}$ for all $(\\theta, p) \\in \\Theta \\times P$, satisfies these two minimal conditions.\n\nIn Examples 1 and 2 below, we highlight that the class of redistributive welfare functions encompasses two common specifications.\n\nExample 1 (Decreasing Pareto weights). Let $\\lambda: \\Theta \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be such that $\\lambda(\\theta) \\geq 0$ for any $\\theta \\in \\Theta$. The welfare function defined by\n\n$$\n\\forall(\\theta, p) \\in \\Theta \\times P, \\quad w(\\theta, p)=\\lambda(\\theta)(\\theta-p) \\mathbb{1}_{\\theta \\geq p}\n$$\n\nbelongs to $\\mathcal{R}$ whenever $\\theta \\mapsto \\lambda(\\theta)$ is non-increasing, and belongs to $\\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$ whenever $\\theta \\mapsto \\lambda(\\theta)$ is strictly decreasing. The class of welfare functions given by Equation (1) for some decreasing function $\\lambda$ corresponds to the family of weighted buyer-utilitarian welfare functions with decreasing Pareto weights. Under such welfare functions, the value to the designer of an additional unit of surplus is lower for high-types than for low-types. Decreasing Pareto weights can endogenously arise under a utilitarian objective if buyers with a low willingness to pay have a higher marginal utility of money than those with a high willingness to pay (Condorelli, 2013; Dworczak et al., 2021), or if buyers are identified by unobserved welfare weights that negatively correlate with their willingness to pay (Akbarpour et al., 2024b).\n\nExample 2 (Increasing concave transformation). Let $u: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be an increasing function such that $u(0)=0$. The welfare function defined by\n\n$$\n\\forall(\\theta, p) \\in \\Theta \\times P, \\quad w(\\theta, p)=u\\left((\\theta-p) \\mathbb{1}_{\\theta \\geq p}\\right)\n$$\n\nbelongs to $\\mathcal{R}$ if $u$ is concave, and belongs to $\\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$ if $u$ is strictly concave. Increasing concave transformations of surplus correspond to the class of welfare functions usually considered in optimal taxation (Mirrlees, 1971) and insurance (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976). ${ }^{16}$ Concavity reflects equity concerns, as it implies diminishing marginal returns to welfare from additional units of surplus. Any designer whose welfare function is given by Equation (2) for some increasing concave $u$ therefore prefers that high prices be charged to high types than to low types.\n\nNote also that any welfare function which is a combination of Examples 1 and 2, given by\n\n$$\n\\forall(\\theta, p) \\in \\Theta \\times P, \\quad w(\\theta, p)=\\lambda(\\theta) u\\left((\\theta-p) \\mathbb{1}_{\\theta \\geq p}\\right)\n$$\n\nbelongs to $\\mathcal{R}$ whenever $\\theta \\mapsto \\lambda(\\theta)$ is sufficiently decreasing, or $u$ is sufficiently concave, or both.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ Garcia and Tsur (2021) characterize optimal segmentations of a competitive insurance market. Thus, such increasing concave transformations of surplus arise endogenously under a utilitarian objective in their model.\n\nSegmentation design. For any given welfare function $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and an aggregate market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, the designer's optimization program consists of choosing a segmentation of $\\mu$ to maximize aggregate welfare:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)} \\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma}[w(\\theta, p)]\n$$",

We then characterize the optimal redistributive segmentations. Finally, we discuss the economic implications of our characterization. First, we show that optimal redistributive segmentations must exhibit a monotonic structure that induces the seller to price progressively. Second, we show that when the redistributive concerns are strong, optimal redistributive segmentations can lead the seller to obtain a strictly positive share of the surplus.",

      "text": "### 3.1 Efficiency\n\nA segmentation is efficient if it leads the seller to serve all the buyers. Let $\\Omega=\\{(\\theta, p) \\in$ $\\Theta \\times P \\mid \\theta \\geq p\\}$. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, the set of efficient segmentations of $\\mu$ is defined by\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)=\\{\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu) \\mid \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma) \\subseteq \\Omega\\}\n$$\n\nLemma 1 (Efficiency). For any $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, there exists an optimal segmentation for the problem $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}\\right)$ that belongs to $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$.\n\nProof. Let $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and consider $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$ with $\\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma) \\not \\subset \\Omega$. Therefore, there must exist $(\\theta, p) \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma)$ such that $\\theta<p$. Consider reallocating the entire mass of buyers $\\sigma(\\theta, p)$ to $(\\theta, \\theta)$. This reallocation violates neither $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}\\right)$ nor $(\\mathrm{Ob})$. The total mass of buyers of type $\\theta$ is still equal to $\\mu(\\theta)$ so $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}\\right)$ is preserved. Furthermore, this reallocation relaxes $(\\mathrm{Ob})$ in both segments $\\theta$ and $p$. Finally, since $w(\\theta, p)=0 \\leq w(\\theta, \\theta)$, the aggregate welfare must increase. In fact, aggregate welfare weakly increases without hurting the seller or the buyers - a (weak) Pareto improvement.\n\nLemma 1 establishes that segmenting a market in a redistributive way never hinders efficiency. The intuition behind that result is similar to Haghpanah and Siegel's (2023) main result: any inefficient segmentation is Pareto-dominated (with respect to the seller's profit and consumer surplus) by some efficient one. For our class of welfare functions, such Pareto improvements always increase aggregate welfare, since $w(\\theta, \\cdot)$ is a decreasing function for each $\\theta \\in \\Theta$.\n\nOperationally, Lemma 1 implies that we can restate the segmentation design problem $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}\\right)$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)} \\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma}[w(\\theta, p)]\n$$\n\nFor any $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we say that $\\sigma$ is $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal if it solves the optimization program $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$. We call optimal redistributive segmentations all segmentations that are $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal for some $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$.",

      "text": "# 3.2 Characterization of optimal segmentations \n\nThe characterization of $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal segmentations, stated below as Theorem 1, is given in terms of the conditions described in Definition 1.\n\nDefinition 1 (Redistributive Saturation). For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, a segmentation $\\sigma \\in$ $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is redistributively saturated (saturated for short) if the following conditions hold:\n(a) In any segment $p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $p<\\max \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$, the seller is indifferent between charging $p$ and some other price $q>p$;\n(b) Let $p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ and $\\theta \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma(\\cdot \\mid p))$. Then in every segment $p^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $p<p^{\\prime} \\leq \\theta$ the seller is indifferent between charging $p^{\\prime}$ and $\\theta$.\n\nAn efficient segmentation is saturated if (a) in every segment, except maybe for the one with the highest price, the seller faces more than one optimal price, and (b) if some consumers of type $\\theta$ belong to a segment with price $p$, then consumers of type $\\theta$ must be sufficiently represented in higher segments so that $\\theta$ is an optimal price in those segments.\n\nTheorem 1 (Optimal redistributive segmentations). For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, the two following claims are true:\n(i) If $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$, then there exists a $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal segmentation which is saturated. Furthermore, if $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$, then every $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal segmentation is saturated.\n(ii) Conversely, if $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is saturated, then there exists $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ such that $\\sigma$ is $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{\\star}\\right)$-optimal.\n\nThe above result establishes that the set of saturated segmentations and optimally redistributive ones are (almost) equal. Claim (i) states that an optimal segmentation must be saturated if the welfare function is strictly redistributive $(w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}})$. If $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ is not strictly redistributive, then there may be indifferences that make some non-saturated segmentations also optimal, but a saturated optimal one always exists. Claim (ii) states that, conversely, any saturated segmentation is optimal for some redistributive objective. As a result, any property that is satisfied by saturated segmentations is also satisfied by optimal redistributive segmentations. We leverage this result to draw economic\n\nimplications of optimal redistributive segmentations in Sections 3.4 and 3.5; Section 3.3 outlines its proof. ${ }^{17}$\n\nTheorem 1 is best understood in light of what saturated segmentations achieve. Saturated segmentations are those for which no reallocation of buyers between segments could increase the expectation of every redistributive welfare function without leading to a violation of the seller's obedience constraints. At this stage, two questions are in order: (1) Which type of reallocation increases the expectation of every redistributive welfare function? (2) When is it not possible to perform such reallocations without violating the seller's obedience constraints?\n\nProposition 1, formally stated in Section 3.3, answers question (1) by identifying the two marginal reallocations of buyers that increase any redistributive welfare function. First, downward buyer transfers (Definition 3) move buyers to segments with lower prices. Second, redistributive buyer transfers (Definition 4) swap a given mass of low-type buyers in a high-price segment for an equal mass of higher-type buyers in a lower-price segment. Figure 2 illustrates both transfers on an efficient segmentation.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The shaded region represents the set $\\Omega$. A downward transfer involving a mass $\\delta$ of buyers (in blue) and a redistributive transfer involving a mass $\\varepsilon$ of buyers (in orange).\n\nDownward transfers are desirable under redistributive welfare functions as they decrease the price charged to some buyers. Redistributive transfers are also desirable under redistributive welfare functions due to condition (R). The main contribution of Proposition 1 is to establish the converse: any buyer reallocation that increases the expected value of all redistributive welfare functions must necessarily consist of some (finite) combination of downward and redistributive buyer transfers. This result provides\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ From now on, with slight abuse of terminology, we use the terms optimally redistributive segmentation and saturated segmentation interchangeably.\n\na complete characterization of welfare-improving buyer reallocations under redistributive objectives.\n\nWhile downward and redistributive buyer transfers are the key to making segmentations more redistributive, these transfers interfere with the seller's obedience constraints. Reallocating buyers through downward or redistributive transfers can lead the seller to deviate to a higher price in one or more segments. Lemmas 2 and 3, also formally stated in Section 3.3, answer question (2). They show that saturation is precisely the condition that ensures that no downward or redistributive transfer (or a combination thereof) can be performed without causing the seller to deviate from the recommended prices.\n\nTo get a sense of why, let us first investigate the conditions under which a particular downward transfer is unfeasible for some segmentation. Consider transferring some mass of buyers of type $\\tilde{\\theta}$ from a higher-price segment $p^{\\prime \\prime}$ to a lower-price segment $p^{\\prime}$, as illustrated in Figure 3a. This transfer affects the seller's obedience constraints in both segments. In\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n(a) Downward transfer.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n(b) Redistributive transfer.\n\nFigure 3: Points within the orange boxes represent $(\\theta, p)$ for which $(\\mathrm{Ob})$ tightens after a transfer.\nthe lower segment $p^{\\prime}$, adding these buyers increases demand at prices between $p^{\\prime}$ and $\\tilde{\\theta}$, tightening constraints for these prices (shown in the orange box in the lower segment). Simultaneously, in the higher segment $p^{\\prime \\prime}$, removing buyers decreases demand at prices between $p^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $\\tilde{\\theta}$, tightening constraints for prices above $\\tilde{\\theta}$ (represented in the orange box in the upper segment). If at least one of the obedience constraints is already binding at those prices in either segment, even a small transfer will violate the seller's obedience constraints, making the downward transfer unfeasible.\n\nThe reasoning is similar for redistributive transfers. Consider swapping some mass of buyers between segments as shown in Figure 3b: buyers of type $\\theta^{\\prime}$ move from segment $p^{\\prime \\prime}$ to $p^{\\prime}$, while buyers of type $\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}$ move from $p^{\\prime}$ to $p^{\\prime \\prime}$. This transfer does not tighten any of the obedience constraints in segment $p^{\\prime}$. Indeed, it decreases the demand at all prices\n\nbetween $\\theta^{\\prime}$ and $\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}$, and does not affect the demand at any other price. However, in the higher segment $p^{\\prime \\prime}$, it increases demand at all these intermediate prices (highlighted by the orange box in Figure 3b), potentially violating obedience constraints in that segment.\n\nSaturated segmentations are precisely those for which no downward or redistributive transfers remain feasible. Condition (ii) ensures that no buyer of type $\\theta$ belonging to segment $p$ can be moved upwards, as the obedience constraint for price $\\theta$ binds in every upper segment they could be moved to. ${ }^{18}$ This blocks all redistributive transfers, which necessarily involve moving some buyers upward. Condition (ii) also blocks some downward transfers: one cannot transfer some type $\\theta$ downwards to a segment that includes any higher type $\\theta^{\\prime}>\\theta$, since this would lead to a violation of obedience in the origin segment. Transferring $\\theta$ downwards to a segment without any higher types, however, could in principle be possible. Condition (i) blocks those remaining downward transfers by ensuring that even if such transfer does not lead to a violation of obedience in the origin segment, it does in the destination one.",

      "text": "# 3.3 Proof of Theorem 1 \n\nOutline. The proof of Theorem 1 is based on a key result of independent interest. We articulate a sense in which one segmentation is more redistributive than another by introducing a partial order on the space of efficient segmentations (Definition 2). Under this order, a segmentation is more redistributive than another if the former generates higher aggregate welfare than the latter for every redistributive welfare function. Proposition 1 establishes that this occurs precisely when the more redistributive segmentation can be obtained through a sequence of downward and redistributive buyer transfers applied to the less redistributive one. ${ }^{19}$ We then demonstrate that optimal redistributive segmentations are exactly those for which no segmentation is more redistributive exists (Lemma 2) and that this condition is equivalent to being saturated (Lemma 3).\n\nProof of Theorem 1. We first define the redistributive order on the space of efficient segmentations. ${ }^{20}$\n\nDefinition 2 (Redistributive order). Let $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and $\\sigma, \\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. We say that $\\sigma$ is more redistributive than $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, denoted $\\sigma \\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}} \\sigma^{\\prime}$, if\n\n$$\n\\forall w \\in \\mathcal{R}, \\quad \\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma}[w(\\theta, p)] \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{\\sigma^{\\prime}}[w(\\theta, p)]\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ Since we are restricting attention to efficient segmentations, this corresponds to segments $p^{\\prime}$ such that $p<p^{\\prime} \\leq \\theta$.\n    ${ }^{19}$ This provides an answer to a practical question: Say one observes some market segmentation. How can it be modified to make it more redistributive?\n    ${ }^{20}$ See Section 3.6.2 for the detailed connection between our redistributive order and existing stochastic orders, in particular, the supermodular one (Shaked and Shanthikumar, 2007; M\u00fcller, 2013; Meyer and Strulovici, 2015).\n\nFor any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we call the binary relation $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$ over $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ the redistributive order and denote as $\\succ_{\\mathcal{R}}$ its asymmetric part. ${ }^{21}$ We say that a segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal if there exists no other segmentation $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ such that $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\succ_{\\mathcal{R}} \\sigma$.\n\nNote that $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$ is not a complete order. A given segmentation may yield higher aggregate welfare than another for certain redistributive welfare functions, while the latter may yield higher aggregate welfare than the former for different redistributive welfare functions. Therefore, there might exist multiple $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentations of a given market.\n\nWe call a buyer mass transfer (in short, a transfer) any $t: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $\\sum_{p \\leq \\theta} t(\\theta, p)=0$ for any $\\theta \\in \\Theta$. Intuitively, transfers perturb a segmentation $\\sigma$ by moving buyers between segments, with $t(\\theta, p)$ denoting the mass of buyers of type $\\theta$ that is added to or removed from a segment with price $p$. We now define two particular classes of transfers.\n\nDefinition 3 (Downward transfers). A transfer $t$ is downward if there exist $\\delta \\geq 0$ and $\\tilde{\\theta}, p^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime \\prime} \\in \\Theta$ such that $p^{\\prime}<p^{\\prime \\prime}$, and\n\n$$\nt(\\theta, p)= \\begin{cases}\\delta & \\text { if }(\\theta, p)=\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}, p^{\\prime}\\right) \\\\ -\\delta & \\text { if }(\\theta, p)=\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}, p^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nDefinition 4 (Redistributive transfers). A transfer $t$ is redistributive if there exists $\\varepsilon \\geq 0$ and $\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime \\prime}\\right),\\left(\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\Omega$ such that $\\theta^{\\prime}<\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}, p^{\\prime}<p^{\\prime \\prime}$, and\n\n$$\nt(\\theta, p)= \\begin{cases}\\varepsilon & \\text { if }(\\theta, p) \\in\\left\\{\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right),\\left(\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}, p^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\ -\\varepsilon & \\text { if }(\\theta, p) \\in\\left\\{\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p^{\\prime \\prime}\\right),\\left(\\theta^{\\prime \\prime}, p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nProposition 1 shows that performing a sequence of such transfers is not only sufficient to make a segmentation more redistributive (according to Definition 2) but also necessary. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of all downward and redistributive transfers.\n\nProposition 1. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and $\\sigma, \\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, the two following claims are equivalent:\n(i) $\\sigma \\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}} \\sigma^{\\prime}$.\n(ii) There exists $n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n>0$, and $\\left(t_{i}\\right)_{i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}} \\in \\mathcal{T}^{n}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sigma=\\sigma^{\\prime}+\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_{i}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ One can show that $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$ is a partial order, that is, a transitive, reflexive and antisymmetric binary relation. The first two conditions are easy to verify from the definition, the fact that it is antisymmetric follows from Proposition 1.\n\nThe proof of Proposition 1, which can be found in Appendix A, relies on duality arguments akin to those employed by M\u00fcller (2013) and Meyer and Strulovici (2015).\n\nThe definition of the redistributive order implies that, given a market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and a redistributive welfare function $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$, the set of $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentations must include some $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentation.\n\nLemma 2, the proof of which is in Appendix B, establishes the converse: for any aggregate market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, any $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentation of $\\mu$ can be rationalized as optimal for some redistributive welfare function. Its proof relies on the separating hyperplane theorem.\n\nLemma 2. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, the following two claims are true:\n(i) For any $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$, there exists a $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation of $\\mu$ that is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal. Furthermore, if $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$, then any $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation of $\\mu$ is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal.\n(ii) Conversely, if $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal, then there exists $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$ such that $\\sigma$ is $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal.\n\nLemma 2 establishes the (almost) equality between $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentations and optimal redistributive ones. Consequently, any property satisfied by the former must also be satisfied by the latter. Lemma 3, the proof of which is in Appendix C, concludes the proof of Theorem 1 by showing that saturation is necessary and sufficient for $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}^{-}}$ maximality.\n\nLemma 3. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta), \\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal if and only if it is saturated.",

      "text": "# 3.4 Monotonicity and progressive pricing \n\nIn this subsection, we show an important economic implication of Theorem 1. Optimal redistributive segmentations exhibit a positive assortative structure. They assign low-type buyers to low-price segments and high-type buyers to high-price segments. We introduce two notions of positive assortativity for segmentations.\n\nDefinition 5 (Weakly monotone segmentations). For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, a segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is weakly monotone if for any $p, p^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $p<p^{\\prime}$,\n\n$$\n\\max \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma(\\cdot \\mid p)) \\leq \\max \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\cdot \\mid p^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nDefinition 6 (Strongly monotone segmentations). For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, a segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is strongly monotone if for any $p, p^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $p<p^{\\prime}$,\n\n$$\n\\max \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma(\\cdot \\mid p)) \\leq p^{\\prime}\n$$\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Monotone segmentations.\n\nFigures 4 a and 4 b respectively illustrate weakly and strongly monotone segmentations. A segmentation is weakly monotone if, for any pair of segments, the highest type assigned to the lower-price segment is not strictly greater than the highest type assigned to the higher-price segment. Whereas a segmentation is strongly monotone if, for any pair of segments, all buyers in the lower-price segment have (weakly) lower types than all buyers in the higher-price segment. ${ }^{22}$\n\nBoth concepts of monotonicity relate to some form of progressive pricing where hightypes are charged higher prices than low-types. In weakly monotone segmentations, for every buyer of a given type, there exists a buyer of a higher type that is charged a (weakly) higher price. This notion of progressivity is mild, since some buyers of a lower type might pay higher prices than some buyers of higher type. This outcome arises in regions where the support of different segments overlap, as buyer types belonging to such overlap are randomly assigned to different segments. On the other hand, strongly monotone segmentations are purely progressive. If a type consumes at a given price, then every higher type must be assigned to a (weakly) higher segment. Indeed, strongly monotone segmentations assign buyers to segments deterministically, except perhaps for types located at the intersection of two consecutive segments.\n\nA direct implication of condition (b) in Definition 1 is that saturated segmentations are weakly monotone; hence, so are optimal redistributive segmentations (by Theorem 1). Indeed, for any saturated segmentation, if a type $\\theta$ is in a segment $p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$, then\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{22}$ Note that our definition of weak monotonicity implies that the segment supports are weak-set-ordered (Che, Kim, and Kojima, 2021). Strong monotonicity, on the other hand, implies an ordering of segments supports that is stronger than the strong set order (Topkis, 1998). Note also that since the intersection of any pair of segment supports contains at most one element, strongly monotone segmentations correspond to a slightly weaker version of monotone partitional information structures (Ivanov, 2021; Mensch, 2021; Onuchic and Ray, 2023; Kolotilin, Li, and Zapechelnyuk, 2024), which partition the state space into convex sets\n\nit must belong to any other segment $p^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $p<p^{\\prime} \\leq \\theta$, which implies weak monotonicity. ${ }^{23}$\n\nTheorem 2.A. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$, every $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation is weakly monotone.\n\nStrongly monotone segmentations, which represent pure progressive pricing, imply that all possible redistributive transfers have been exhausted. This raises the question: under what conditions on redistributive welfare functions do we wish to exhaust all opportunities for implementing such transfers? Suppose we aim to perform a redistributive transfer on a segmentation that is not strongly monotone. While these transfers are always desirable from a welfare perspective, they may not be feasible because they could violate obedience constraints in the upper segment (cf. Figure 3b). Nevertheless, it is possible to preserve obedience in the upper segment by transferring a certain mass of the highest type in this segment to a higher-price segment. This series of transfers improves aggregate welfare only if the net welfare gain from the redistributive transfer exceeds the welfare loss due to this upward transfer. The following concept of strongly redistributive welfare functions precisely captures the necessary and sufficient condition for this series of transfers to always be beneficial.\n\nDefinition 7 (Strongly redistributive welfare functions). A welfare function $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$ is strongly redistributive if for any $p, \\theta_{k}, \\theta_{\\ell} \\in \\Theta$ such that $p<\\theta_{k}<\\theta_{\\ell}$,\n\nNet welfare gain from a redistributive transfer between\ntypes $\\theta_{k}$ and $\\theta_{k+1}$ in segments $p$ and $\\theta_{k}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& {\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{k}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)\\right]-\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{k+1}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{k+1}, \\theta_{k}\\right)\\right]} \\\\\n& \\geq \\frac{\\theta_{k+1}}{\\theta_{k+1}-\\theta_{k}} \\underbrace{\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{\\ell}, \\theta_{k}\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{\\ell}, \\theta_{\\ell}\\right)\\right]}_{\\text {Welfare loss from increasing the }} \\text { (SR) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA welfare function is strongly redistributive if the net welfare gain from a redistributive transfer involving the two lowest types that could be included in the segment $\\theta_{k}$ \u2014given by the expression on the left-hand side of condition (SR)\u2014exceeds by a factor $\\theta_{k+1} /\\left(\\theta_{k+1}-\\theta_{k}\\right)$ the maximal welfare loss induced by the upward transfer of any higher type $\\theta_{\\ell}$ \u2014given by the second term on the right-hand side. Figure 5 illustrates the two transfers involved in (SR).\n\nAs the next result shows, strongly redistributive welfare functions are the only ones for which every optimal segmentation is strongly monotone.\n\nTheorem 2.B. A welfare function $w$ is strongly redistributive if and only if for any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, every $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation is strongly monotone.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{23}$ We state the result for strictly redistributive welfare functions to clarify the exposition. If $w \\in \\mathcal{R}$, then for any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, there exists a $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal and weakly monotone segmentation of $\\mu$.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: The combination of a redistributive transfer (in orange) and an upward transfer of high-types in the upper segment (in blue).\n\nThe proof of Theorem 2.B appears in Appendix D. In condition (SR), $\\theta_{k}$ is both the type that benefits from the redistributive transfer and the price charged in the upper segment involved in this transfer. Focusing on such transfers is sufficient because any implementable redistributive transfer can be designed to benefit the type equal to the price in the upper segment. Conversely, to exhaust all possible redistributive transfers, it is necessary to perform those that benefit the type corresponding to the price of the upper segment.\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side of (SR) corresponds to the maximum welfare loss the type $\\theta_{\\ell}$ can incur by being transferred upward from the segment $\\theta_{k}$. In fact, the segment $\\theta_{\\ell}$ is the highest in which the type $\\theta_{\\ell}$ can be transferred while preserving efficiency. This welfare loss is scaled by the ratio $\\theta_{k+1} /\\left(\\theta_{k+1}-\\theta_{k}\\right)>1$. The reason is the following. If we implement a redistributive transfer of a mass $\\varepsilon$ of types $\\theta_{k}$ and $\\theta_{j}>\\theta_{k}$, and this transfer breaks $(\\mathrm{Ob})$, then the seller will deviate from charging a price $\\theta_{k}<p \\leq \\theta_{j}$ in the upper segment (cf. Figure 3b). To preserve obedience, an even larger mass of higher types $\\theta_{\\ell} \\geq \\theta_{j}$ must be transferred upward from the upper segment. Specifically, a mass $\\varepsilon \\times p /\\left(p-\\theta_{k}\\right)$ of types $\\theta_{\\ell}$ must be transferred. The ratio $p /\\left(p-\\theta_{k}\\right)$ decreases with $p$ and is thus maximal for $p=\\theta_{k+1}$.\n\nThe term on the left-hand side of (SR) corresponds to the net welfare gain from a redistributive transfer between two consecutive types. By supermodularity of $w$, the net welfare gain of a redistributive transfer between $\\theta_{k}$ and $\\theta_{k+1}$ is less than the net gain of a redistributive transfer between $\\theta_{k}$ and any $\\theta_{j}$, with $j>k+1$. As such, a redistributive\n\ntransfer between these two consecutive types yields the minimal net welfare gain of a redistributive transfer benefiting type $\\theta_{k}$.\n\nIn summary, satisfying the inequality (SR) implies that the minimal net welfare gain of performing a redistributive transfer that benefits the type $\\theta_{k}$ always outweighs the maximal welfare loss of performing an upward transfer that involves the maximal mass of types $\\theta_{\\ell}$. Therefore, it is necessary and sufficient to make any redistributive transfer desirable.\n\nWe illustrate strongly redistributive welfare functions with Examples 1 and 2. This shows incidentally that the set of these functions is non-empty.\n\nExample 1 (Decreasing Pareto weights, cont'd). Let $\\lambda: \\Theta \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a strictly decreasing function such that $\\lambda(\\theta)>0$ for all $\\theta \\in \\Theta$. Define $w$ such that, for any $(\\theta, p) \\in \\Omega, w(\\theta, p)=\\lambda(\\theta)(\\theta-p)$. By rearranging terms in the inequality (SR), we can see that $w$ is strongly redistributive if and only if for any $\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{\\ell} \\in \\Theta$ such that $\\theta_{k}<\\theta_{\\ell}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda\\left(\\theta_{k}\\right)-\\lambda\\left(\\theta_{k+1}\\right)}{\\lambda\\left(\\theta_{\\ell}\\right)} \\geq \\frac{\\theta_{k+1}}{\\theta_{k+1}-\\theta_{k}} \\frac{\\theta_{\\ell}-\\theta_{k}}{\\theta_{k}-\\theta_{k-1}}\n$$\n\nInequality (3) imposes a condition on the rate of decrease of $\\theta \\mapsto \\lambda(\\theta)$. In this case, we can reinterpret Theorem 2.B as follows: every optimal segmentation is strongly monotone if and only if Pareto weights decrease at a sufficiently fast rate. For instance, weights of the form $\\lambda(\\theta)=\\theta^{-\\gamma}$ or $\\lambda(\\theta)=\\exp (-\\gamma \\theta)$ are strongly redistributive if $\\gamma$ exceeds some threshold.\n\nExample 2 (Increasing concave transformations, cont'd). Let $u: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be strictly increasing and strictly concave. Define $w$ such that, for any $(\\theta, p) \\in \\Omega, w(\\theta, p)=u(\\theta-p)$. In this case, one can show that condition (SR) can never be satisfied. In contrast to Example 1, when the redistributive concerns stem from a concave transformation of buyers' surplus, the welfare gain associated with redistributive transfers can never outweigh the welfare loss associated with burning the surplus of some high type. In this case, Theorem 2.B implies that there always exists a market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ such that no optimal segmentation is strongly monotone.\n\nTheorem 2.B establishes that a welfare function is strongly redistributive if and only if any optimal segmentation is strongly monotone. Furthermore, as we show in the following lemma (which proof can be found in Appendix E), for any given aggregate market, there is only one strongly monotone segmentation of that market that is saturated. This particular segmentation therefore represents the uniquely optimal market segmentation for any strongly redistributive welfare function.\n\nLemma 4. For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, there exists a unique strongly monotone segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ that is saturated.\n\nThe greedy redistributive algorithm. The simple structure of strongly monotone segmentations and their uniqueness pave the way for a constructive approach. We describe a procedure, called the greedy redistributive algorithm, that outputs, for any market $\\mu$, the unique strongly monotone segmentation of $\\mu$ that is saturated. We explain in words the functioning of the algorithm and Appendix F contains its pseudo-code.\n\nStrongly monotone segmentations can be seen as the result of lexicographic optimization: it benefits each type sequentially as much as possible, from the smallest to the largest. The greedy redistributive algorithm follows this logic and sequentially assigns types into segments. It starts by creating a lower segment with all buyers of type $\\theta_{1}$ and then proceeds to include types $\\theta_{2}$ in that segment. If all buyers $\\theta_{2}$ can be included while keeping the price in the segment at $\\theta_{1}$, the algorithm does so and proceeds to include types $\\theta_{3}$. At some point in this process, the algorithm reaches a point such that including all buyers of a given type $\\theta_{k}$ would violate $(\\mathrm{Ob})$ in that segment. When the algorithm reaches this point, it fits as many types $\\theta_{k}$ as possible in the segment so that $(\\mathrm{Ob})$ becomes binding for some price and moves on to creating a new segment with the remaining mass of types $\\theta_{k}$. This inclusion process is then repeated in the newly created segment starting at type $\\theta_{k+1}$, and then proceeds sequentially as previously explained. The algorithm ends when every buyer has been assigned to some segment.",

      "text": "# 3.5 Redistributive rents \n\nWe now study how redistributive segmentations distribute surplus between the seller and the buyers. We show that if the welfare function is strongly redistributive, then optimal segmentation might allocate some of the created surplus to the seller. Hence, although the welfare function does not take into consideration the seller's profit, redistributive segmentations may not maximize total consumer surplus.\n\nFor any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we say that a segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ gives a rent to the seller if the profit under $\\sigma$ is strictly higher than the profit under uniform pricing: that is, if\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p \\in P} p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta, p)>p_{\\rho}^{\\sigma} \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p_{\\mu}^{\\sigma}} \\mu(\\theta)\n$$\n\nThe following joint probability distribution over types and prices will prove to be of\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6: The segmentation $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ for a uniform price $p_{\\mu}^{*}$.\nparticular interest. For any market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, we define $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*} \\in \\Delta(\\Theta \\times P)$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}(\\theta, p)= \\begin{cases}\\mu(\\theta) & \\text { if } \\theta<p_{\\mu}^{*} \\text { and } p=\\theta_{1} \\\\ \\min \\left\\{\\mu\\left(p_{\\mu}^{*}\\right), \\frac{\\theta_{1}}{p_{\\mu}^{*}-\\theta_{1}} \\sum_{\\theta<p_{\\mu}^{*}} \\mu(\\theta)\\right\\} & \\text { if }(\\theta, p)=\\left(p_{\\mu}^{*}, \\theta_{1}\\right) \\\\ \\mu\\left(p_{\\mu}^{*}\\right)-\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}\\left(p_{\\mu}^{*}, \\theta_{1}\\right) & \\text { if }(\\theta, p)=\\left(p_{\\mu}^{*}, p_{\\mu}^{*}\\right) \\\\ \\mu(\\theta) & \\text { if } \\theta>p_{\\mu}^{*} \\text { and } p=p_{\\mu}^{*} \\\\ 0 & \\text { otherwise. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBy construction, $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ satisfies $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mu}\\right)$ and $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}\\right) \\subset \\Omega$. Therefore, if $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ satisfies ( Ob$)$ then it is a segmentation belonging to $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. In this case, we refer to $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ as being feasible. Note that, if $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is feasible, then it is the unique saturated and strongly monotone segmentation of ${ }^{24} \\mu$. Furthermore, $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ has a very simple structure. It assigns all types lower than $p_{\\mu}^{*}$ to a \"discount\" segment where the lowest possible price $\\theta_{1}$ is charged, and all the remaining types to a residual segment where the uniform price $p_{\\mu}^{*}$ is charged. Figure 6 illustrates $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$.\n\nTheorem 3 (Redistributive Rents). For any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and any strongly redistributive welfare function $w$, the two following statements are true:\n(i) If $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is feasible, then it is the unique $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation and it does not\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ Note that $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is constructed such that, if it is feasible, the seller is indifferent between charging $\\theta_{1}$ and $p_{\\mu}^{*}$ in segment $\\theta_{1}$. As such, $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ satisfies conditions (a) and (b) of Definition 1 if it is feasible, implying that it is saturated.\n\ngive any rent to the seller.\n(ii) If $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is not feasible, then the unique $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation gives a rent to the seller.\n\nProof. A segmentation does not give any rent to the seller if and only if $p_{\\mu}^{*}$ is an optimal price in every market segment. ${ }^{25}$ Therefore, a strongly monotone segmentation does not give a rent to the seller only if it satisfies two conditions. First, it must generate only two market segments. One containing every type weakly lower than $p_{\\mu}^{*}$, and one containing every type weakly greater than $p_{\\mu}^{*}$. Second, ( Ob$)$ must bind at $p_{\\mu}^{*}$ in the segment $\\theta_{1}$. It can easily be seen that $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is the only strongly monotone segmentation that satisfies those two requirements. Furthermore, following Theorem 2.B, for any strongly redistributive $w$, the $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation is the unique strongly monotone one that is saturated. Therefore, if $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is feasible, then it is uniquely $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal and does not give a rent to the seller. On the contrary, if $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is not feasible, then the $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$-optimal segmentation must give a rent to the seller.\n\nTheorem 3 highlights the key tradeoff generated by redistributive concerns. Benefiting poor consumers may require imposing a sacrifice on richer consumers' surplus. Strongly redistributive welfare functions precisely characterize when the welfare gains from redistribution more than compensate for the surplus loss of higher types. Given that redistributive segmentations are efficient (Lemma 1), as a byproduct of this loss, the seller benefits from a redistributive rent. This result is easily explainable in light of the structure of strongly redistributive segmentations (Theorem 2.B). Such segmentations pool as many low-types as possible in low-price segments, allowing them to benefit from lower prices. Consequently, high types are separated from low types, enabling the seller to better price discriminate. This increases the seller's profit, except in the special case where $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{*}$ is feasible.",

      "text": "# 3.6 Discussion\n### 3.6.1 Redistribution and consumer-surplus maximization\n\nThe results in this paper highlight a variety of ways in which redistributive segmentations can differ from consumer surplus-maximizing segmentations (Bergemann et al., 2015). Notably, redistributive segmentations might differ from consumer surplus-maximizing (henceforth CS-maximizing) ones in how they assign consumers to segments, in the prices they generate, and in the way they distribute surplus across the buyers and the seller.\n\nRedistributive segmentations exhibit a positive-assortative structure, assigning consumers with a lower willingness to pay to segments with low prices and consumers with\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ This follows easily from the fact that the seller's total profit is the sum of its profits on each segment.\n\na higher willingness to pay to segments with higher prices. As seen in Section 3.4, all redistributive segmentation satisfies weak monotonicity: if a buyer of type $\\theta$ consumes at price $p$, there must exist a buyer of higher type who consumes at a higher price. When the redistributive motive is sufficiently strong, the optimal redistributive segmentations also satisfy strong monotonicity: if a buyer of type $\\theta$ consumes at price $p$, every buyer of higher type must be consuming at a higher price. CS-maximizing segmentations need not satisfy even this weak notion of monotonicity. Indeed, since in CS-maximizing segmentations the seller is indifferent to charging the uniform price in all segments, every segment (including the ones with lower prices) must include sufficiently many buyers with type higher than or equal to the uniform price.\n\nThe monotonic structure of redistributive segmentations qualifies a sense in which redistributive segmentations are \"more separating\" than CS-maximizing ones. This greater separation is echoed in the distributions of prices induced by such segmentations: while CS-maximizing segmentations only induce segments with discounts relative to the uniform price, redistributive segmentations might also induce segments with prices higher than the uniform. As such, prices might be more dispersed under redistributive segmentations. Another symptom of this greater separation is the distribution of surplus across sides of the market. As treated in Section 3.5, while CS-maximizing segmentations allocate all of the surplus generated by the segmentation to buyers, redistributive segmentations might, as a byproduct of prioritizing the welfare of poorer consumers, grant extra surplus to the seller.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the set of redistributive segmentations intersects with the set of CS-maximizing ones. Indeed, as a welfare function, total consumer surplus is included in the class of welfare functions we study, despite not being our focus since condition (R), which captures our notion of redistributive concerns, is satisfied everywhere with equality. Regardless, from Theorem 1 it follows that in the set of CS-maximizing segmentations one can always find saturated ones.\n\nThe redistributive order characterized in Proposition 1 is also helpful if one wants to use redistribution as a criterion to select among CS-maximizing segmentations. CS-maximizing segmentations cannot be improved in the redistributive order through downward transfers, but might be improvable through redistributive transfers. Departing from some CSmaximizing segmentation, sequentially performing feasible redistributive transfers will eventually result in a saturated segmentation that is also CS-maximizing.",

      "text": "# 3.6.2 Link to stochastic orders and optimal transport \n\nOur characterization of the redistributive order, as presented in Proposition 1, conceptually parallels the characterization of the supermodular stochastic order developed independently by M\u00fcller (2013) and Meyer and Strulovici (2015). The critical distinction lies in their\n\nrespective objects of comparison: the supermodular stochastic order compares couplingsbivariate joint distributions with two prescribed marginals-whereas the redistributive order compares segmentations, which consist of joint distributions where only the first marginal (the aggregate market $\\mu$ ) is prescribed, while the second marginal (the price distribution $\\sigma_{P}$ ) emerges endogenously from the seller's incentive constraints. ${ }^{26}$\n\nTherefore, the characterization of the supermodular order over couplings differs from that of the redistributive order over segmentations in a substantive way. The supermodular order is characterized only in terms of supermodular transfers (akin to redistributive transfers in our terminology), whereas the redistributive order is characterized in terms of both supermodular transfers, which preserve both marginals, and downward transfers, which can modify the marginal distribution of prices. This distinction arises directly from the endogenous nature of segmentations' second marginal. Since downward transfers inevitably alter the price distribution, they cannot be applied to couplings, where both marginals are prescribed. ${ }^{27}$\n\nObserve also that the optimization problem $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{w, \\mu}^{*}\\right)$ bears similarity to the discrete optimal assignment problem (see Galichon, 2018, Chapter 3). Again, the key difference is that rather than maximizing the expectation of a function on the set of couplings, we maximize it on the set of (efficient) segmentations.\n\nIn statistics and optimal transport theory it is known that comonotone joint distributions maximize the expectation of supermodular functions on the set of couplings (see, e.g., Theorem 2.1 in Puccetti and Wang, 2015, and Theorem 4.3 in Galichon, 2018). We show that, similarly as for couplings, the supermodularity of redistributive welfare functions induces a positive-assortative matching of willingness to pay and prices. Furthermore, we show in Lemma 2 that saturated segmentations correspond to the maximal elements of the redistributive order, which provides a parallel to how comonotone distributions correspond to the maximal elements of the supermodular stochastic order (see claim (c) of Theorem 2.1 in Puccetti and Wang, 2015).\n\nCollectively, Theorem 1, Theorems 2.A and 2.B thus provide a natural analog for segmentations to the characterizations of (discrete) optimal assignments in optimal transport theory. However, since segmentations are constrained by the seller's incentives, supermodularity alone no longer guarantees comonotonicity. As discussed earlier, our concept of strongly redistributive welfare functions (Definition 7), which can be understood\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ This observation is generally valid for any persuasion problem, where the prior distribution of the state is prescribed while the distribution over the receiver's action is determined by the obedience constraints (see Bergemann and Morris, 2019). As such, our characterization could be fruitfully extended to answer more generally a recurring question in the literature, namely when optimal information structures are monotone.\n    ${ }^{27}$ It is worth noting that redistributive transfers (Definition 4) correspond to the mass transfers used in optimal transport to show that the comonotone distributions are the extreme points of the transport polytope (see Carlier, 2022, Theorem 6.14). It could be worthwhile for future research to use similar tools to characterize the extreme points of the \"persuasion polytope,\" which constitutes the set of candidates for optimality in the (finite) information design problem.\n\nas a form of \"strong-supermodularity,\" becomes both necessary and sufficient to achieve (nearly) comonotone optimal solutions.",

      "text": "# 4 Implementation through price regulation \n\nThus far, we have analyzed the segmentation design problem from the perspective of a central planner with redistributive preferences. In practice, however, market segmentation is primarily conducted by private actors with access to consumers' data, such as platforms. This leads to the problem of implementation: How can a regulator (she) induce the seller (he) to implement a redistributive segmentation?\n\nIf the regulator can verify the segmentation chosen by the seller, this implementation problem is trivial. The regulator can simply commit to punishing the seller if his chosen segmentation differs from her preferred one. However, it is unlikely that the regulator can perfectly observe the segmentation set by the seller. We show that observing the price distribution induced by segmentations is sufficient for the regulator to implement her preferred segmentation.\n\nAssume that both the regulator and the seller know the aggregate market $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$. The regulator communicates to the seller the segmentation $\\sigma$ she wishes to implement, after which the seller chooses a market segmentation $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$, which may or may not coincide with the regulator's. The regulator cannot observe $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ directly but can verify and enforce punishments based on the induced price distribution ${ }^{28} \\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}$. Consequently, for any $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$, the set of undetectable deviations from $\\sigma$ is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}(\\sigma):=\\left\\{\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma(\\mu) \\mid \\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}=\\sigma_{P}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince the regulator can detect any deviation that does not belong to $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}(\\sigma)$, she can impose appropriate penalties and deter the seller from deviating to $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\notin \\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}(\\sigma)$. Hence we adopt the following notion of implementability.\n\nDefinition 8 (Price-based implementability). Let $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$. A segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$ is implementable through price-based regulation if there exists no $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}(\\sigma)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}\\right)} p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma^{\\prime}(\\theta, p)>\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)} p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta, p)\n$$\n\nA segmentation can be implemented through price-based regulation if there exists no strictly profitable deviation for the seller that is undetectable by the regulator. The next proposition shows that efficiency is, in fact, sufficient for implementability. ${ }^{29}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{28}$ As discussed in the introduction, observing the distribution of prices is realistic; see Footnote 4.\n    ${ }^{29}$ Our notion of implementability is equivalent to the notion of credibility defined by Lin and Liu (2024) in the context of Bayesian persuasion. Specifically, the authors define an information structure as\n\nProposition 2. Let $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$. If $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, then $\\sigma$ is implementable through price-based regulation.\n\nProof. Let $\\mu \\in \\Delta(\\Theta)$ and $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. Recall that, for any $(\\theta, p) \\in \\Omega$ we must have that $\\sigma(\\theta, p)=\\sigma(\\theta \\mid p) \\sigma_{P}(p)$. We thus obtain the following decomposition of the platform's profit under $\\sigma$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)} p \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta, p) & =\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)} p \\sigma_{P}(p) \\overbrace{\\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma(\\theta \\mid p)}^{=1 \\text { since } \\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)} p \\sigma_{P}(p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy definition, $\\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma^{\\prime}(\\theta \\mid p) \\leq \\sum_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} \\sigma^{\\prime}(\\theta \\mid p)=1$ for any $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\Sigma(\\mu)$. Therefore, for any $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\mu}(\\sigma)$, we must have in particular that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}\\right)} p \\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}(p) \\sum_{\\theta \\geq p} \\sigma^{\\prime}(\\theta \\mid p) & \\leq \\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}\\right)} p \\sigma_{P}^{\\prime}(p) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)} p \\sigma_{P}(p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis implies that $\\sigma$ is implementable through price-based regulation.\nTherefore, any efficient segmentation and, following Lemma 1, any redistributive segmentation, can be implemented through price-based regulation. The proof follows from a simple observation: the difference in the seller's profit between two segmentations that induce the same price distribution only depends on the mass of consumers that buy the good at each price. For efficient segmentations, this mass is maximal because every buyer consumes. Therefore, there cannot be any strictly beneficial deviation.",

      "text": "# 5 Concluding remarks \n\nPrice discrimination has long been used as an instrument for redistribution. Many goods and services are provided at reduced prices for disadvantaged groups. For instance, students from low-income backgrounds often pay reduced tuition fees at universities, and it is common for the unemployed or the elderly to receive discounted prices at museums. The prevalence of such redistributive price discrimination indicates that personalized pricing is deemed socially acceptable as long as it is perceived to benefit those in need.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    credible if there exists no alternative information structure that would strictly increase the sender's payoff while unaffecting the marginal distribution of signal realizations. As such, Proposition 2 shows that any efficient segmentation is also seller-credible. Our notion of implementation is also equivalent to the notion of price-regulation defined by Schlom (2024) in the context of second-degree price discrimination.\n\nThis view is supported by experimental data on people's attitudes to price discrimination (Wu, Liu, Chen, and Wang, 2012) and is expressed in policy reports (White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2015; Bourreau and De Streel, 2018). Our redistributive segmentations satisfy this social demand by ensuring that price discrimination satisfies a certain degree of price progressivity. Hence, our results inform the current policy debate over the regulation of online personalized pricing. They give qualitative guidelines regarding market segmentations that prioritize consumers with low willingness to pay.\n\nRedistributive price discrimination is usually implemented by public and non-profit organizations (Le Grand, 1975). A concern is that imposing redistributive price discrimination on the private sector could be inefficient. Indeed, conditioning prices on group characteristics could harm profits and deter firms from entering the market (Woodcock, 2022). This paper studies how a private market with a profit-maximizing monopoly can be optimally segmented to achieve a redistributive goal. Redistributive segmentations have the twofold benefit of achieving economic efficiency (Lemma 1) and never harming the seller-Theorem 3 shows that redistributive segmentations can even improve the seller's profit.\n\nOne might suggest that conditioning market segmentation on additional buyer information (e.g., income or group characteristics), rather than only the willingness to pay, would better target redistribution. Nevertheless, as highlighted in Section 4, consumer data is usually collected and processed by private actors for which consumers' willingness to pay is the payoff-relevant variable. It might also be impossible or illegal for regulators like competition authorities to directly access income data or protected characteristics. Hence, our optimal segmentations constitute a normative benchmark against which to evaluate welfare outcomes that could be achieved by regulating data intermediaries.\n\nAnother concern among policymakers is consumers' privacy (Acquisti, Taylor, and Wagman, 2016; Goldfarb and Que, 2023). The current approach mainly focuses on studying the incentives for consumers to reveal their preferences voluntarily (see Ichihashi, 2020; Hidir and Vellodi, 2020; Ali, Lewis, and Vasserman, 2023). Our redistributive segmentations are monotone Theorem 2.A, and thus separate rich and poor consumers in different market segments, sometimes strictly (Theorem 2.B). This separation might conflict with consumer privacy concerns, as it allows the seller to discern buyers' types better. Studying market segmentations that prioritize poorer consumers' welfare while satisfying privacy constraints (Strack and Yang, 2024) is a fruitful avenue for future research.",

Necessity is straightforward. Let now $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ be such that for any $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $t \\neq 0, \\sigma+t \\notin \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. First, this means that $\\sigma$ is on the relative border of $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, as\n\notherwise, for any neighborhood around $\\sigma$ included in $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, there would exist sufficiently small transfers $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $\\sigma+t$ is in this neighborhood. Second, this also implies that $\\sigma \\neq \\sigma^{F}$, where $\\sigma^{F}$ is the first-degree price discrimination segmentation. That is, the segmentation supported on the line $p=\\theta$. This is because downward transfers could be performed on $\\sigma^{F}$ without violating the obedience constraints.\n\nWe now proceed by contradiction, by assuming that there exists $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T}), \\tau \\neq 0$, such that $\\sigma^{\\prime}:=\\sigma+\\tau \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, that is, $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\succ_{\\mathcal{R}} \\sigma$.

We first prove that $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu) \\subset(\\{\\sigma\\}+\\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T}))$, which is equivalent to $\\left(\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)-\\{\\sigma\\}\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$. Given that $\\sigma^{\\prime}=\\sigma+\\tau \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, for some $\\tau \\neq 0$ and $\\tau \\notin \\mathcal{T}$ this means that $\\left(\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)-\\{\\sigma\\}\\right) \\cap \\operatorname{int}(\\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})) \\neq \\varnothing$. Now suppose by contradiction that $\\left(\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)-\\{\\sigma\\}\\right) \\not \\subset \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$. As $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ and $\\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$ are closed and convex sets, there exists $x \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ that is on relative border of $\\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$. This means that there exists $\\tilde{\\sigma} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ such that $\\tilde{\\sigma}=\\sigma+t$ for some $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ (as the borders of $\\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$ are elements of $\\mathcal{T}$ ), which contradicts our premise. Hence we proved that $\\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)-\\{\\sigma\\} \\subset \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$; which implies that for any $\\tilde{\\sigma} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$, there exists $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$ such that $\\tilde{\\sigma}=\\sigma+\\tau$. To see that this is a contradiction, consider $\\sigma^{F}$. We know that $\\sigma^{F} \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ and $\\sigma^{F} \\neq \\sigma$, but $\\sigma^{F}$ cannot be reached from $\\sigma$ by a finite sequence of transfers in $\\mathcal{T}$; that is, there exists no $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{cone}(\\mathcal{T})$ such that $\\sigma^{F}=\\sigma+\\tau$.\n\nEquipped with Lemma 8, we can now proceed to the proof of Lemma 3 by proving it is equivalent that a segmentation $\\sigma \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is saturated and that there exists no $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $t \\neq 0$ and $\\sigma+t \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$.

Note first that downward and redistributive buyer transfers do not change the marginal distribution over types. Hence, for any $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ obtained from $\\sigma$ by such transfers, we can restrict our attention to the case where $\\sigma^{\\prime} \\notin \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$ is caused by $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ violating ( Ob ). We first prove that part (a) in Definition 1 is satisfied.

Thus, there exist at least two segments $p, \\theta_{i} \\in \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma_{P}\\right)$ such that $\\max \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma(\\cdot \\mid p))>$ $\\theta_{i}>p$. We denote as $\\theta^{\\prime}$ the lowest type in the segment $p$ that is strictly above $\\theta_{i}$, and as $\\theta_{k}$ the maximal type in the segment $\\theta_{i}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\theta^{\\prime}=\\min \\left\\{x \\in \\operatorname{supp}(\\sigma(\\cdot \\mid p)) \\mid x>\\theta_{i}\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\theta_{k}=\\max \\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\cdot \\mid \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet $\\varepsilon>0$ be sufficiently small and $r$ be the redistributive buyer transfer such that\n\n$$\nr\\left(\\theta_{i}, p\\right)=r\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=-r\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=-r\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p\\right)=\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nand $r=0$ otherwise. Neglecting for the moment the negative indirect impacts of $r$ by triggering a violation of the obedient constraint in the segment $\\theta_{i}$, the direct impact on the welfare of types $\\theta_{i}$ and $\\theta^{\\prime}$ involved in the transfer $r$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon\\left[\\left(w\\left(\\theta_{i}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right)-\\left(w\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta^{\\prime}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n>\\varepsilon & \\left.\\varepsilon\\left[\\left(w\\left(\\theta_{i}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right)-\\left(w\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right)\\right]>0\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere both strict inequalities come from $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$. In addition, given that $\\sigma$ is $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal, $\\sigma+r$ does not satisfy ( Ob ). In particular, there exists $\\hat{\\theta}$, with $\\theta_{i}<\\hat{\\theta} \\leq \\theta^{\\prime}$, such that $\\hat{\\theta} \\in \\mathcal{I}^{\\sigma}\\left(\\theta_{i}\\right)$ (see Appendix C for the definition of $\\left.\\mathcal{I}^{\\sigma}(\\theta)\\right)$, and thus:\n\n$$\n\\theta \\sum_{x \\geq \\theta} \\sigma(x, \\theta)<\\hat{\\theta}\\left(\\sum_{x \\geq \\hat{\\theta}} \\sigma(x, \\theta)+\\varepsilon\\right)\n$$\n\nTo recover the obedience of the price recommendation $\\theta_{i}$, we implement the transfer $t: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, which transfers a mass $\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon$ of buyers from $\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{i}\\right)$ to $\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)$ : that is,\n\n$$\nt\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)=-t\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nand $t=0$ otherwise. First, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon, \\sigma+t \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)$. Second, implementing $t$ cannot break any obedience constraints, and it corrects from any violation of obedience constraints induced by the transfer $r$. To see this, look at the difference between the profit made by setting the price $\\theta_{i}$ and setting the price $q \\geq \\theta_{i+1}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\theta_{i}\\left(\\sum_{x \\geq \\theta_{i}} \\sigma\\left(x, \\theta_{i}\\right)-\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\\right)-q\\left(\\sum_{x \\geq q} \\sigma\\left(x, \\theta_{i}\\right)+\\varepsilon-\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\\right) \\\\\n\\geq & \\varepsilon\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}}\\left(q-\\theta_{i}\\right)-q\\right)=\\varepsilon \\frac{\\theta_{i}\\left(q-\\theta_{i+1}\\right)}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality follows from $\\theta_{i}$ being an optimal price in segment $\\theta_{i}$ according to $\\sigma$, and the second inequality follows from $q \\geq \\theta_{i+1}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sigma+r+t \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. The loss from the transfer $t$ is\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta} \\varepsilon\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{i}\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nTherefore, implementing the transfers $r$ and $t$ is beneficial if and only if $(5) \\geq(7)$. If\n\n$w$ is strongly redistributive, we have that $(6) \\geq(7)$. Given that $(5) \\geq(6)$, this ends the proof.\n$\\Rightarrow$ We prove the contrapositive. Suppose that $w \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{R}}$ is not strongly redistributive. So there exist $p<\\theta_{i}<\\theta_{i+1} \\leq \\theta_{k}$, such that\n\n$$\n\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{i}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right]-\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, p\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, \\theta_{i}\\right)\\right]<\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}}\\left[w\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{i}\\right)-w\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nLet $\\mu \\in \\Delta\\left(\\left\\{p, \\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i+1}, \\theta_{k}\\right\\}\\right)$ such that the unique strongly monotone and $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentation, denoted $\\sigma$, has three segments:\n\n- one segment $p$ including all types $p$ and some type $\\theta_{i}$;\n- one segment $\\theta_{i}$ including the remaining types $\\theta_{i}$ and all types $\\theta_{i+1}$;\n- and one segment $\\theta_{k}$ including all types $\\theta_{k}$.\n\nIt is easy to show that such a $\\mu$ exists. ${ }^{31}$ Let $\\varepsilon>0$ be sufficiently small. We will now perform two transfers. The first one is a downward transfer $d$ defined by:\n\n$$\nd\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=-d\\left(\\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\right)=\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\n$$\n\n$d=0$ otherwise. The second transfer, $s$, is the reverse of a redistributive one. It is defined by:\n\n$$\ns\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=s\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, p\\right)=-s\\left(\\theta_{i+1}, \\theta_{i}\\right)=-s\\left(\\theta_{i}, p\\right)-\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nand $s=0$ otherwise. We check that $\\sigma+d+s$ satisfies ( Ob$)$. First, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, this does not change the optimality of price $p$ in segment $p$. Second, in segment $\\theta_{i}$, the transfers do not change the obedience constraint between for $\\theta_{i+1}$ as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta_{i}\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i}\\right)+\\sigma\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i+1}\\right)+\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\\right) & -\\theta_{i+1}\\left(\\sigma\\left(\\theta_{i}, \\theta_{i+1}\\right)-\\varepsilon+\\frac{\\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}} \\varepsilon\\right) \\\\\n& =\\varepsilon\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i} \\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{1}}-\\frac{\\theta_{i} \\theta_{i+1}}{\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{1}}\\right) \\\\\n& =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first equality follows from $\\theta_{i+1}$ being an optimal price in segment $\\theta_{i}$ for segmentation $\\sigma$. Similarly, one can show that charging $\\theta_{i}$ always gives a greater profit than charging $\\theta_{k}$ if the segmentation is $\\sigma+d+s$. Therefore $\\sigma+d+s \\in \\Sigma_{\\Omega}(\\mu)$. Furthermore, it directly follows from Equation (8) that $\\langle w, \\sigma+d+s\\rangle\\rangle\\langle w, \\sigma\\rangle$. Therefore, $\\sigma$, which is the unique strongly monotone and $\\succsim_{\\mathcal{R}}$-maximal segmentation of $\\mu$ (Lemma 4) is not optimal for $w$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ It can be provided upon requests.",

  "abstract": "We study how to optimally segment monopolistic markets with a redistributive\nobjective. We characterize optimal redistributive segmentations and show that\nthey (i) induce the seller to price progressively, i.e., richer consumers pay\nhigher prices than poorer ones, and (ii) may not maximize consumer surplus,\ninstead granting extra profits to the monopolist. We further show that optimal\nredistributive segmentations are implementable via price-based regulation.",
