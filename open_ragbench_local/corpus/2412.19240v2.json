INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Hubble constant $H_{0}$, defined as the Hubble parameter $H(z=0)$, is one of the most important cosmological parameters in the current concordance $\\Lambda$ CDM model [1]. Considerable efforts have been made to determine its value since Hubble [2] proposed his famous velocity-distance relation [3-5]. After more than half a century of efforts, measurements of the Hubble constant converged to $(72 \\pm 8) \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project [6].\n\nWith the advent of precision cosmology, the Hubble constant value came under intense scrutiny. The Planck collaboration obtained $H_{0}=67.36 \\pm 0.54 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ inferred from CMB measurements in the framework of the spatially-flat standard $\\Lambda$ CDM model [7]. On the other hand, the value of $H_{0}$ determined from the Supernovae and $H_{0}$ for the Equation of State of dark energy (SH0ES) project, which uses Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia data is $73.04 \\pm 1.04 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ [8]. This difference between the high redshift and low redshift $H_{0}$ values is known as the Hubble tension [9-11]. Various solutions to this tension have been proposed [12] such as early dark energy [13-19] and dark energy-dark matter interactions [20] for early universe modifications, while late-time modifications are also viable solutions [21, 22]. It has also been argued that the breakdown in $\\Lambda$ CDM model implied by the Hubble tension is a signature of redshift-dependent cosmological parameters [23-26] (and references therein). The relation between Hubble tension and other tensions and anomalies in the current concordance model of cosmology can be found in recent reviews [27-30].\n\nOne of the proposed solutions to fix the Hubble tension conundrum is to modify the value of the sound horizon at the drag epoch $r_{d}$ [31], which can increase the Hubble expansion rate. The sound horizon is the scale at which the baryons decoupled from the photons during the drag epoch [32, 33]. This serves as a standard ruler in Cosmology known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) [34, 35]. By studying the clustering of galaxies and other cosmic structures, efforts have been made to measure this scale. However, the value of $r_{d}$ measured from CMB observations is model dependent and is equal to $147 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ [7]. In the determination of $H_{0}$, the calibration of $r_{d}$ becomes important since BAO observations give rise to a strong degeneracy between $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ in the form of the factor $\\frac{c}{r_{d} H_{0}}$. Hence, it is evident that model-dependent calibrations can bias the value of $H_{0}$.\n\nThe discovery of late-time cosmic acceleration was based on Type Ia supernovae observations [36-39]. The peak absolute magnitude $M$ of SNe Ia plays an important role in constraining cosmological parameters. It appears in the expression for the cosmic luminosity distance and has a degenerate relation with the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. To determine the value of $H_{0}$ from SNe Ia observations, calibration of $M$ becomes important. This is exactly what the SH0ES team did, where using SNe Ia Cepheid hosts they found a value of $M=$ $-19.253 \\pm 0.027$ [8]. There have been some arguments in the literature that instead of the Hubble tension, one should pay attention to the value of $M$ as it is more fundamental when we think of the distance ladder approach to determine the $H_{0}$ value [40, 41]. This now raises the question of the constancy of $M$ (see, [42-48]).

COSMOLOGICAL RELATIONS \n\nIn this work, we consider the spatially-flat $\\Lambda$ CDM model of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe defined by the FLRW metric [50]: $d s^{2}=-d t^{2}+a(t)^{2} d R^{2}$. In this model, the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is given by:\n\n$$\nH(z)=H_{0} \\sqrt{\\Omega_{m}(1+z)^{3}+\\left(1-\\Omega_{m}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant and $\\Omega_{m}$ is the dimensionless matter density parameter. For our assumptions, the luminosity distance $\\left(D_{L}\\right)$ is given by\n\n$$\nD_{L}(z)=c(1+z) \\int_{0}^{z} \\frac{d z^{\\prime}}{H\\left(z^{\\prime}\\right)}\n$$\n\nFor Type Ia supernovae, the relation between its luminosity distance, the apparent magnitude and the peak absolute magnitude is given by [38]\n\n$$\nm(z)=5 \\log _{10}\\left[\\frac{d_{L}(z)}{\\mathrm{Mpc}}\\right]+25+M\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ is the peak absolute magnitude and $m(z)$ is the apparent magnitude.\nThe DESI DR1 lists the values of $D_{M} / r_{d}, D_{H} / r_{d}$, and $D_{V} / r_{d}$ [49]. By measuring the redshift interval $\\Delta z$ along the line-of-sight, we can get an estimate of the Hubble distance at redshift $z$ by\n\n$$\nD_{H}(z)=\\frac{c}{H(z)}\n$$\n\nThe comoving angular diameter distance [51] can be found by measuring the angle $\\Delta \\theta$ subtended by the BAO feature at a redshift $z$, along the transverse direction and given by:\n\n$$\nD_{M}(z)=(1+z) D_{A}(z)\n$$\n\nwhere, $D_{A}(z)$ is the angular diameter distance [52] and is related to $D_{L}$ using the cosmic distance-duality relation [53] as follows:\n\n$$\nD_{A}(z)=\\frac{D_{L}(z)}{(1+z)^{2}}\n$$\n\nFinally, the BAO measurements also provide an estimation of the spherically averaged distance $\\left(D_{V}\\right)$ given by [54]:\n\n$$\nD_{V}(z)=\\left[z D_{M}(z)^{2} D_{H}(z)\\right]^{1 / 3}\n$$\n\nTo make our analysis model independent, we have also done a cosmography analysis using Pad\u00e9 approximants [55-60]. Cosmography [61-63] is a model-independent approach to studying the expansion history of the universe in terms of kinematics of the universe. It makes minimal assumptions (large-scale homogeneity and isotropy) while circumventing the need for an expansion model. However, cosmography suffers from the challenge of series expansion convergence [59, 64-66]. Several cosmography techniques are based on Taylor series expansions which show convergence problems for high redshifts. To overcome these limitations, an alternative approach based on Pad\u00e9 rational approximant [56, 58, 67-73] has been developed. Using this method, we can study the evolution of the universe at redshifts greater than 1 [74]. We use the (3,1) Pad\u00e9 approximants and the analytic expressions are stated below (Eqns. 8 and 9). We use these expressions in equations 4, 5, 6 and 8 to get the other relevant quantities.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH^{(3,1)}(z)= & -H_{0}\\left\\{\\left[6(1+z)^{2}\\left(4\\left(1+j_{0}-q_{0}\\left(1+3 q_{0}\\right)\\right)+\\left(2+5 j_{0}\\left(1+2 q_{0}\\right)-q_{0}\\left(2+3 q_{0}\\right)\\left(1+5 q_{0}\\right)+s_{0}\\right) z\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\left\\{\\left[96\\left(1+j_{0}-q_{0}\\left(1+3 q_{0}\\right)\\right)^{2}+48\\left(1+j_{0}-q_{0}\\left(1+3 q_{0}\\right)\\right)\\left(4+j_{0}\\left(7+8 q_{0}\\right)-q_{0}\\left(6+q_{0}\\left(17+9 q_{0}\\right)\\right)+s_{0}\\right) z\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-6\\left(8 j_{0}^{3}-j_{0}^{2}\\left(49+4 q_{0}\\left(39+23 q_{0}\\right)\\right)-q_{0}\\left(-56+q_{0}\\left(-128+q_{0}\\left(112+q_{0}\\left(509+462 q_{0}+81 q_{0}^{2}\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\left.+2 j_{0}\\left(-34+q_{0}\\left(-2+q_{0}\\left(205+q_{0}\\left(281+78 q_{0}\\right)\\right)-6 s_{0}\\right)-9 s_{0}\\right)+2 q_{0}\\left(10+3 q_{0}\\left(7+q_{0}\\right)\\right) s_{0}-s_{0}^{2}-4\\left(5+3 s_{0}\\right)\\right) z^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& +2\\left(6+j_{0}\\left(9+10 q_{0}\\right)-q_{0}\\left(4+q_{0}\\left(13+30 q_{0}-9 q_{0}^{2}\\right)+3 s_{0}\\right)\\right) z^{3} \\\\\n& +\\left(2+5 j_{0}\\left(1+2 q_{0}\\right)-q_{0}\\left(2+3 q_{0}\\right)\\left(1+5 q_{0}\\right)+s_{0}\\right)\\left(-2+4 j_{0}^{2}+j_{0}\\left(-7+q_{0}\\left(-23+6 q_{0}\\right)\\right)-3 s_{0}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\left.+q_{0}\\left(4+q_{0}\\left(13+30 q_{0}-9 q_{0}^{2}\\right)+3 s_{0}\\right)\\right) z^{4}\\right]^{-1}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD_{L}^{(3,1)}(z)= & c H_{0}^{-1}\\left\\{z\\left[z^{2}\\left(-4 j_{0}^{2}+j_{0}\\left(q_{0}\\left(23-6 q_{0}\\right)+7\\right)+q_{0}\\left(q_{0}\\left(9 q_{0}^{2}-30 q_{0}-13\\right)-3 s_{0}-4\\right)+3 s_{0}+2\\right)\\right.\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.\\left.+6 z\\left(j_{0}\\left(8 q_{0}+7\\right)-q_{0}\\left(q_{0}\\left(9 q_{0}+17\\right)+6\\right)+s_{0}+4\\right)+24\\left(j_{0}-q_{0}\\left(3 q_{0}+1\\right)+1\\right)\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\left\\{\\left[6\\left(z\\left(5 j_{0}\\left(2 q_{0}+1\\right)-q_{0}\\left(3 q_{0}+2\\right)\\left(5 q_{0}+1\\right)+s_{0}+2\\right)+4\\left(j_{0}-q_{0}\\left(3 q_{0}+1\\right)+1\\right)\\right)\\right]^{-1}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# III. DESCRIPTION OF DATA \n\nWe describe the datasets used for our analysis as follows:\n\n- For Type Ia supernovae, we use 1590 distinct samples from the Pantheon+ compilation [75] in the redshift range 0.001 to $2.26^{1}$. All the uncertainties have been incorporated in the covariance matrix provided along with the dataset.\n- The cosmic chronometer [76] dataset has been obtained from [77-84] in the redshift range $0.07 \\leq z \\leq 1.965$. We use the covariance matrix for computations as described in [85]. We tabulate the $H(z)$ values used for the analysis in Table I, which can also be found in Table (1.1) of [86] The last $15 H(z)$ measurements of Table I are correlated ${ }^{2}$.\n- DESI DR1 listed in Table 1 of [49]. We consider both isotropic and anisotropic BAO data that include the observables-BGS, LRG, ELG and QSOs. We also incorporated the correlation coefficients $(r)$ listed in the table. The redshift range of this sample is between 0.1 and 4.16 .\n\nTo fix the absolute value of the peak magnitude and the sound horizon, we use four data-motivated priors obtained from literature as follows:\n\n- $M=-19.253 \\pm 0.027$ obtained by the Cepheid calibration of Type Ia SNe based on SH0ES observations [8].\n- $M=-19.362_{-0.067}^{+0.078}$ considering a model-independent method [87] using Type Ia SNe Ia observations along with BAO and CC data.\n- $M=-19.396 \\pm 0.015$. This value has been obtained using Gaussian Process Regression [88] for a modelindependent and non-parametric approach, similar to the analysis in [89].\n- $M=-19.401 \\pm 0.027$ obtained by using a model-independent binning technique, which combined type Ia SNe observations with anisotropic BAO observations [90].\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The data release can be found at https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease\n    ${ }^{2}$ https://gitlab.com/mmoresco/CCcovariance\n\n- $M=-19.420 \\pm 0.014$ where $\\Lambda$ CDM model was used to calibrate the Type Ia SNe with Planck CMB data [91].\n\nFor the sound horizon values we used the following priors from the literature:\n\n- $r_{d}=137 \\pm 4.5 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ using the angular diameter distances to three time-delay lenses from the H0LiCOW collaboration in a model-independent approach [92].\n- $r_{d}=139.7_{-4.5}^{+5.2} \\mathrm{Mpc}$ obtained by using BAO observations and gravitationally time-delay lensed quasars from H0LiCOW observations using a model-independent approach [93].\n- $r_{d}=147.05 \\pm 0.3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ which is the value obtained by the Planck collaboration [7] (TT+TE+EE+low E).\n- $r_{d}=148 \\pm 3.6 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ using the model-independent polynomial expansions approach [94].\n\nFor our analysis, when we use all of the above datasets together, we only consider data points which span the same range of redshifts. Therefore, we work with the redshift range from $0.1-1.965$, the lower limit coming from the redshift range in the DESI data, while the upper limit corresponds to the highest value in the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) dataset. The CC data is utilized in this work to tighten the constraints on $H_{0}$ compared to using only BAO and SNe Ia data, when applying uniform priors on $M$ and $r_{d}$.\n\nTABLE I: $32 H(z)$ data\n\n![table_0](table_0)", "tables": {"table_0": "| $\\boldsymbol{z}$ | $\\boldsymbol{H}_{0}(\\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc})$ | Reference |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 0.07 | $69.0 \\pm 19.6$ | $[84]$ |\n| 0.09 | $69.0 \\pm 12.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 0.12 | $68.6 \\pm 26.2$ | $[84]$ |\n| 0.17 | $83.0 \\pm 8.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 0.2 | $72.9 \\pm 29.6$ | $[84]$ |\n| 0.27 | $77.0 \\pm 14.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 0.28 | $88.8 \\pm 36.6$ | $[84]$ |\n| 0.4 | $95.0 \\pm 17.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 0.47 | $89.0 \\pm 50.0$ | $[80]$ |\n| 0.48 | $97.0 \\pm 62.0$ | $[81]$ |\n| 0.75 | $98.8 \\pm 33.6$ | $[82]$ |\n| 0.88 | $90.0 \\pm 40.0$ | $[81]$ |\n| 0.9 | $117.0 \\pm 23.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 1.3 | $168.0 \\pm 17.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 1.43 | $177.0 \\pm 18.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 1.53 | $140.0 \\pm 14.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 1.75 | $202.0 \\pm 40.0$ | $[83]$ |\n| 0.1791 | 74.91 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.1993 | 74.96 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.3519 | 82.78 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.3802 | 83.0 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.4004 | 76.97 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.4247 | 87.08 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.4497 | 92.78 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.4783 | 80.91 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.5929 | 103.8 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.6797 | 91.6 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.7812 | 104.5 | $[85]$ |\n| 0.8754 | 125.1 | $[85]$ |\n| 1.037 | 153.7 | $[85]$ |\n| 1.363 | 160.0 | $[85]$ |\n| 1.965 | 186.5 | $[85]$ |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# IV. METHODOLOGY \n\nThe parameters $\\left\\{H_{0}, \\Omega_{m}, r_{d}, M\\right\\}$ are constrained using Bayesian inference. For this purpose, the posteriors are sampled using NAUTILUS [95], while the marginalized posteriors were generated using getdist[96].\n\nFirst, using Pantheon+, DESI BAO, and CC unbinned data points in the common redshift range 0.1 - 1.965, we constrain $H_{0}, \\Omega_{m}, M$, and $r_{d}$ values using uniform priors for the parameters. Subsequently, we apply a\n\nGaussian prior on either $M$ or $r_{d}$ using one of the values described in Section III and assign a uniform prior on the other. Finally, we apply Gaussian priors on both $M$ and $r_{d}$. As noted in [97], one DESI LRG datum at $z_{\\text {eff }}=0.51$ has been identified as a potential outlier. To account for this anomalous data point, we conducted our analysis, both including and excluding this data point. However, we find no significant differences between the two results. Therefore, all the results shown in this work include this data point. Finally, we compare the $H_{0}$ values obtained from our analyses to the Planck cosmological analyses (obtained from TT,TE,EE+low E+lensing), which has the value $67.36 \\pm 0.54 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ [7] and quantify the significance of the discrepancy. It has been known for a while that cosmological parameters inferred through Bayesian analysis could be prior dependent [98]. Additionally, as has been pointed out in [99], the choice of priors on the peak absolute magnitude plays a pivotal role in the analysis of the Pantheon+ dataset. Therefore, we further sub-divide our analysis into two parts, wherein we use both Gaussian and uniform priors on $r_{d}$ and $M$. For Gaussian priors, we use the values mentioned in Section III, while for uniform priors, we use $r_{d} \\in \\mathcal{U}(0,200)$ and $M \\in \\mathcal{U}(-21,-18)$. Additionally, uniform priors have been used for $H_{0}$ and $\\Omega_{m}$ as given by:\n\n$$\nH_{0} \\in \\mathcal{U}(10,200) \\text { and } \\Omega_{m} \\in \\mathcal{U}(0,1)\n$$\n\nFor this analysis, the total likelihood is given by:\n\n$$\nL(\\theta) \\propto e^{-\\chi^{2} / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ represents the parameter vector (or subset depending on which parameters are fixed) $\\left\\{H_{0}, \\Omega_{m}, r_{d}, M\\right\\}$ and\n\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{2}=\\chi_{\\mathrm{SNe}}^{2}+\\chi_{\\mathrm{BAO}}^{2}+\\chi_{\\mathrm{CC}}^{2}\n$$\n\nThe likelihood construction for the SNe Ia datset can be found in [100] and for the CC dataset can be found in [101]. For the BAO data, we construct a covariance matrix utilizing the correlation factors and the standard deviations and consider a Gaussian likelihood [49, 102]. We have also conducted the same analysis without including CC data, as presented in Appendix A, to demonstrate that the inclusion of CC data leads to more stringent constraints on $H_{0}$ when uniform priors are applied to $M$ and $r_{d}$. We also do a cosmography based analysis. The analytic expressions for the luminosity distance and the Hubble constant for the same can be found in Eqns. 8 and 9. We use Bayesian model comparison and calculate the Bayes factor [103, 104] in order to determine the preferred prior combination on $M$ and $r_{d}$. In this case, we have the same underlying theoretical model, namely $\\Lambda$ CDM and the same data. Therefore, the Bayes factor provides a measure of the relative efficacy of the priors for the given dataset and $\\Lambda$ CDM model. The null hypothesis in this case is the scenario in which we apply SH0ES prior ( $M \\in \\mathcal{N}(-19.253,0.027)$ to $M$ and the CMB inferred value of $\\left(r_{d} \\in \\mathcal{N}(147.05,0.3)\\right.$ Mpc ) of $r_{d}$ in the spatially flat $\\Lambda$ CDM model (Table VIII). Henceforth, we will refer to this prior combination as the standard prior combination. To determine the significance from the Bayes factors, we use the Jeffreys scale [103].

There is a similar trend for other $M$ priors as well.\n- Similar trends as in the standard $\\Lambda$ CDM case can be observed in the cosmography approach as well. However, the discrepancy with the Planck $H_{0}$ value is way lower than in the $\\Lambda$ CDM case.\n\n5. Comparison of priors based on Bayes Factors:\n\n- Tables VIII and IX demonstrates that all other prior combinations are decisively favored compared to the standard prior combination for the spatially-flat $\\Lambda$ CDM model.\n\nThe $H_{0}$ values which we get for all priors on $M$ except $-19.253 \\pm 0.027$, are consistent with the $H_{0}$ value of $69.03 \\pm 1.75 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, obtained using TRGB and JAGB methods with JWST data [106] to within $\\sim 1 \\sigma$ maximum. It is interesting to note that this consistency occurs when we consider low values of $M$. Further, our $H_{0}$ values determined for $M$ other than the SH0ES prior are very much in agreement with [107], which circumvented calibrations related to the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch or $M$ of Type Ia SNe and so is a purely data-driven method. We note that in all cases, the cosmography approach gives us a smaller discrepancy with the Planck value when compared to the $\\Lambda$ CDM case. This is due to a combination of lower central $H_{0}$ values (in comparison with the $\\Lambda$ CDM model inferred values) and large error bars.\n\nTABLE III: Cosmographic Parameters for a uniform prior on $M$ and a uniform prior on $r_{d} \\in(0,200)$.

Our aim is not to address the Hubble tension but to show that degeneracies play a significant role in some of the low-redshift measurements of $H_{0}$, and the usage of data-driven priors are essential.\n\nWe emphasize that this work is heavily motivated by Chen et al. [99]. However, the aim of this work is to study the effect of degeneracy between $M$ and $r_{d}$ on the Hubble constant values by applying data motivated Gaussian and uniform priors on the two parameters. In addition, [99] considered the Pantheon+ dataset only and $M$ is the only additional parameter other than $H_{0}$ and $\\Omega_{m}$. In our analyses, we considered both $M, r_{d}$, as well as the DESI BAO and CC datasets. We do wish to point out that the value of $\\Omega_{m}$ had a very high value\n\nTABLE IX: Cosmographic parameters for a Gaussian prior on $r_{d}$ and $M$. For the standard prior combination (cf. Table II), the Bayes' Factor is 1 , which is the null hypothesis.\n\n![table_8](table_8)\n\nin [99], while we get considerably lower values in comparison. Further, note that our $\\Omega_{m}$ values are similar for all our different prior choices within $1 \\sigma$, irrespective of the values of $M$ or $r_{d}$. This was also noted in [99], and occurs in our work because we consider only a particular redshift range ( $0.1-1.965$ ).\n\nA summary of our key results can be found in Tables II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX. We find that increasing the value of the sound horizon at the drag epoch does seem to reduce the discrepancy between the two values to somewhere around $1.2 \\sigma$ ( $\\Lambda$ CDM case), but the value of $M$ also decreases to about -19.4 . This is also evident when we compare the Bayes' factors of other prior combinations with the prior combination consisting of SH0ES prior on $M$ and the CMB inferred prior on $r_{d}$, applied to a spatially-flat $\\Lambda$ CDM model. This reaffirms the fact that there is some degeneracy between $M$ and $r_{d}$, which needs to be further studied. Furthermore, we note that when applying uniform priors on either $r_{d}$ or $M$, the Hubble constant decreases for smaller values of $M$ and larger values of $r_{d}$. This is similar to the fact that Gaussian priors on both $r_{d}$ or $M$ decrease the value of $M$ and increase $r_{d}$. But note that $M$ plays a crucial role in decreasing $H_{0}$, as a higher $M$ and larger $r_{d}$ results in a tension of about $5 \\sigma$, while smaller $M$ and smaller $r_{d}$ give a discrepancy of around $1.5 \\sigma$ (cf. Table VIII). The cosmography approach also give similar results as the $\\Lambda$ CDM case. However, the values of $H_{0}$ are slightly lower than the corresponding cases in the $\\Lambda$ CDM model approach and coupled with the large error bars drive the discrepancy to as low as $0.2 \\sigma$ (cf. Table IX)\n\nTherefore, to summarize, we have reaffirmed the degeneracy present in the $M-r_{d}$ plane in light of the latest DESI results, and is in accord with some prior related works in literature

As will be noticed, in the case of applying uniform priors on both $M$ and $r_{d}$, the estimated values of $H_{0}$ have larger errors without CC. Due to this, we included CC data in the main analysis. However, the results are similar to the ones obtained using the dataset combination CC+Pantheon Plus+BAO.\n\nTABLE X: Discrepancy in $H_{0}$ estimate compared to that from Planck Cosmology [7] for a uniform prior on $M$ and a uniform prior on $r_{d} \\in(0,200)$.

($r_d$), to study how\nthe $M-r_d$ degeneracy affects low redshift measurements of the Hubble\nconstant, and then compare these estimates to the Planck estimated value of the\nHubble constant. We use the data from Pantheon$+$, Cosmic Chronometers, and the\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAO) results for this purpose. We reaffirm the fact that there is\na degeneracy between $M$ and $r_d$, and modifying the $r_d$ values to reconcile\nthe discrepancy in Hubble constant values also requires a change in the peak\nabsolute magnitude $M$. For certain $M$ and $r_d$ priors, the discrepancy is\nfound to reduce to be as low as (1.2-2) $\\sigma$ when considering the spatially\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also notice that for our datasets considered, the\nGaussian prior combination of $M \\in \\mathcal{N} (-19.253,0.027)$ (obtained\nfrom SH0ES) and $r_d \\in \\mathcal{N} (147.05,0.3)$ Mpc (determined from Planck\nCMB measurements) is least favored as compared to other prior combinations for\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model.", "updated": "2025-04-23T01:47:03Z", "published": "2024-12-26T14:51:09Z"}
