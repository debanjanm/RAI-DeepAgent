From this structure emerges a revealing question: if a large increment can be given to one individual in a society, what is the maximal sacrifice that another individual can be asked to bear for its sake? We show that the answer uncovers the evaluator's degree of inequality aversion. In particular, all translationinvariant evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual if their income were low enough and a constant amount of their income otherwise. Scale-invariant evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual at all income levels if their inequality aversion was no greater than one, and a constant fraction of their income otherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of social preferences that, starting from a minimum-income level of protection, ensure a higher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income is protected the lower their income.\n\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *The authors warmly thank audiences at workshops and seminars at CERE-Ume\u00e0, ISER-Osaka, MDOD-Sorbonne, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for very helpful discussions.

      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nSince Atkinson's (1970) and Kolm's (1976) seminal works on inequality measurement, the notion of inequality aversion has been well understood, and applied to many different contexts. The concept of inequality aversion has been closely associated to the Pigou-Dalton transfer principle, according to which social welfare does not decrease (or inequality does not increase) when a given amount is taken from someone and given to someone else who is less well-off, without reversing the ranking between these two individuals. ${ }^{1}$\n\nThe empirical-experimental literature on people's social preferences ${ }^{2}$ has elicited the value of their inequality aversion about income by making respondents choose between distributions involving different levels of inequality and different levels of average income. For instance, Venmans and Groom (2021) find an average coefficient of inequality aversion of 2.9 in an empirical survey on a sample of students, while Hurley et al. (2020) find an average coefficient of 3.27 in a representative sample of the Ontario province of Canada. The underlying mechanism for such ethical preference elicitation is the leaky-bucket experiment: a distribution is less unequal than another, but has a lower average income, reflecting the classical equality-efficiency trade-off highlighted in Okun (1975). The meaning of the coefficient of inequality aversion is usually presented in this way: a coefficient of 3 means that it is worth giving a dollar to someone even if this requires taking $8\\left(=2^{3}\\right)$ dollars from a person who is twice as rich-thus losing 7 dollars, i.e., $87.5 \\%$ of the amount levied from the donor.\n\nA small literature (Fleurbaey and Michel 2001, Aboudi and Thon 2003, Thon and Wallace 2004, Dubois 2016) has explored the relationship between principles of transfer that allow for leakage and the value of the coefficient of inequality aversion in a social welfare criterion that endorses such leaky trans-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Aboudi and Thon (2006) also study what they call the Muirhead-Dalton principle, in which transfers are allowed to reverse the ranking between the two individuals, but still leave the difference between them smaller than in the initial distribution. For authoritative reviews of this field, see Chakravarty (2009), Dutta (2002) and Cowell (2000).\n    ${ }^{2}$ For a review, see Gaertner and Schokkaert (2012).\n\nfers. ${ }^{3}$ For instance, Fleurbaey and Michel (2001) show that if the transfers are proportional to the initial level of the donor and recipient, the coefficient must be at least 2 , whereas if the transfers are proportional to the final levels, the coefficient must be at least 1 .\n\nA coefficient of 2 , according to the common presentation (referring to a gift of 1 dollar costing $2^{2}=4$ ) means that wasting $75 \\%$ of the transfer when the recipient has only half the level of the donor is acceptable, and this seems a lot. The principle of proportional transfers (on initial levels), however, suggests something less extreme, since when the recipient gets X , a donor who is initially twice as rich would only lose 2 X , which means that only half of the gift is lost in the transfer. This apparent contradiction is resolved by noting that the reasoning in terms of one dollar gifts is only true for infinitesimal gifts, whereas the principe of proportional transfers applies to transfers of any size (under the proviso that they do not reverse the order between the donor and the recipient).\n\nThis shows that the way in which the implications of the coefficient of inequality aversion are presented may influence the ethical choice of the coefficient. One may find that the principle of proportional transfers appears reasonable, since it is very common for people to think in terms of variations in percentage, while hesitating to condone the maxim that \"a marginal transfer from a donor to someone who is half below can waste $75 \\%$ and still improve social welfare\"-and yet the two refer to the same coefficient of inequality aversion of 2 .\n\nIn this paper we discover a fundamental and previously unrecognized structure within the class of additively separable social welfare functions that makes it straightforward to fully characterize the social preferences of an inequality-averse evaluator. This characterization leads directly to the following elicitation procedure: Start from a perfectly equal distribution, and then imagine that an increment can be given to one individual. What is the maximal sacrifice that can be imposed on another individual for the sake of this increment? In other words, if one individual's level of income can become infinitely high, how much could justifiably be taken from another one in order to make this possible? It seems to us that this framing pushes people's intuition further toward high values of inequality aversion. In particular, a coefficient that is below 1 would justify depriving the sacrificed individual\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ See also Bosmans (2014) for a similar analysis applied to rank-dependent poverty measures, involving transfers across the poverty threshold.\n\nfrom everything. For a Kolm-Atkinson (scale-invariant) social welfare function, a coefficient of 2 or more means that it is never acceptable to bring the sacrificed individual below half of her initial level, which seems a rather generous (i.e., generously low) bound-the bound is $70 \\%$ of the initial level when the coefficient is 3 . In addition to relating levels of protection of the sacrificed individual's income to coefficients of inequality, we actually characterize the classes of additively separable social welfare functions that guarantee specific (absolute or relative) levels of protection.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we define the framework and the main notions. Section 3 determines the general conditions under which an additively separable social welfare function provides a strictly positive protected level to the sacrificed individual. In section 4, we characterize the class of social welfare functions which protect a fixed fraction of the initial level, against increments given to either one other individual, or two other individuals. Section 5 instead examines the case in which the protected level is always at a fixed absolute difference from the initial level. Section 6 explores how to obtain a protection that is, in proportion to the initial level, greater when the initial level is lower, reflecting the intuitively appealing thought that poor people deserve a relatively greater protection than rich people. We examine in section 7 the case in which the starting point is not perfect equality and generalize the results to this broader class of contexts. Section 8 concludes. We also created a companion website to the paper, available at https://osf.io/tnu2q/, which contains interactive visuals, apps and narratives that explain and motivate our results in simple and intuitive terms.",

      "text": "# 2 Setting and main definitions \n\nConsider a population of $n$ individuals, each individual $i$ enjoying income $y_{i} \\geq 0$, and an additively separable social welfare function\n\n$$\nW\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(y_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $f$ is an increasing function with values taking an interval in $\\mathbb{R} \\cup$ $\\{-\\infty,+\\infty\\}$. Throughout this paper we restrict attention to this class of social welfare functions.\n\nIncome is used as the index of individual advantage in this paper, but obviously the analysis is relevant to any setting in which individual advantage is measured by a cardinally measurable and interpersonally comparable index. In particular, it is possible to adjust income for non-market aspects of quality of life that individuals enjoy or endure, and use this ajusted income (usually called \"equivalent income\") as the relevant index instead of ordinary income.\n\nThe social welfare function is symmetric, which reflects impartiality among individuals. Therefore, we can focus on individual 1 (called Ana, to fix ideas) in trade-offs with any number of fellow individuals.\n\nConsider a starting point in which Ana and individual 2 (called Ben) have the same income $y$. Then one can consider unequal allocations that keep social welfare constant, i.e., spans allocations $\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\nf\\left(y_{1}\\right)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)=2 f(y)\n$$\n\nIn particular, focus on how Ana's income decreases when Ben's in raised. One can define the function $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ implicitly by the equation\n\n$$\nf\\left(y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)\\right)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)=2 f(y)\n$$\n\nyielding the explicit form\n\n$$\ny_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)=f^{-1}\\left(2 f(y)-f\\left(y_{2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe function $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ is increasing in $y$ and decreasing in $y_{2}$, because $f$ is increasing and so is $f^{-1}$.\n\nThe domain of definition of $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ depends on $f$. For instance, if $f(y)=y$, then $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ is defined only for $\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ such that $y_{2} \\leq 2 y$. Let $D_{12}$ denote the domain of definition of $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)$ :\n\n$$\nD_{12}=\\left\\{\\left(y_{2}, y\\right) \\mid 2 f(y)-f\\left(y_{2}\\right) \\geq f(0)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe can now introduce the notion of protected income, which is the level of income below which $y_{1}$ will never fall when $y_{2}$ increases. No matter what opportunities for high income are offered to Ben, Ana's income will never fall below this level if social welfare is preserved.\n\nProtected income: For a given $y>0$, the level of protected income is defined as\n\n$$\n\\hat{Y}(y)=\\inf \\left\\{y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, \\hat{y}\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{2}, \\hat{y}\\right) \\in D_{12}, \\hat{y}=y\\right\\}\n$$\n\nRelatedly, we define collateral damage as the sacrifice that can be imposed on Ana for the sake of raising Ben's income.\n\nCollateral damage: For a given $y>0$, the level of collateral damage is defined as\n\n$$\n\\ddot{L}(y)=y-\\ddot{Y}(y)\n$$\n\nThe relative collateral damage is\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\ddot{L}(y)}{y}=1-\\frac{\\ddot{Y}(y)}{y}\n$$",

      "text": "# 3 Existence of a positive protected income \n\nNot all social welfare functions guarantee Ana against complete sacrifice for the sake of Ben's stratospheric income. Actually, many of the most commonly used social welfare functions do not protect against complete sacrifice.\n\nProposition 1. For all $y>0$, one has $\\ddot{Y}(y)>0$ if and only if $f$ has an upper bound strictly below $2 f(y)-f(0)$.\n\nProof. Let $y$ be given. If $f$ has an upper bound strictly below $2 f(y)-f(0)$, then there is $\\varepsilon$ such that for all $y_{2} \\geq 0$,\n\n$$\nf\\left(y_{2}\\right)<2 f(y)-f(0)-\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nimplying that if $f\\left(y_{1}\\right)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)=2 f(y)>f(0)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)+\\varepsilon$, then necessarily $f\\left(y_{1}\\right)>f(0)+\\varepsilon$, so that $y_{1}$ is bounded away from zero. In this case, $\\ddot{Y}(y)>0$.\n\nIf $f$ does not have an upper bound strictly below $2 f(y)-f(0)$, then for all $\\varepsilon$, there is $y_{2}$ such that\n\n$$\nf\\left(y_{2}\\right)>2 f(y)-f(0)-\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nimplying that if $f\\left(y_{1}\\right)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)=2 f(y)<f(0)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)+\\varepsilon$, then necessarily $f\\left(y_{1}\\right)<f(0)+\\varepsilon$, so that $y_{1}$ is not bounded away from zero. In this case, $\\ddot{Y}(y)=0$.\n\nTo illustrate this result, consider the class of Kolm-Atkinson social welfare functions, for which\n\n$$\nf(y)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{y^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta} & \\text { for } \\quad \\eta \\neq 1, \\eta \\geq 0 \\\\ \\ln y & \\text { for } \\quad \\eta=1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta \\geq 0$ is the coefficient of inequality aversion.\nWhen $\\eta \\leq 1, f$ has no upper bound and thus $\\tilde{Y}(y)=0$ for all $y>0$. When $\\eta>1$, one has $f(0)=-\\infty$, so that $2 f(y)-f(0)=+\\infty$, whereas $f$ is always negative. Thus, $\\tilde{Y}(y)>0$ for all $y>0$. More precisely, one has\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=f^{-1}(2 f(y))=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}} y\n$$\n\nThis is a quite significant result because values of $\\eta=0.5$ and 1 are frequent in the applied literature on inequalities. With such values, the ultimate sacrifice of giving all of one's income for the sake of a billionaire is considered acceptable, and this appears hard to defend. If one would like to avoid such a repugnant conclusion, it is imperative to pick $\\eta>1$.\n\nAnother important class is formed by the Kolm-Pollak social welfare functions, for which\n\n$$\nf(y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n-e^{-\\alpha y} & \\text { for } \\alpha>0 \\\\\ny & \\text { for } \\alpha=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha \\geq 0$ is the coefficient of inequality aversion. When $\\alpha=0$, one obviously has $\\tilde{Y}(y)=0$ for all $y>0$. When $\\alpha>0, f$ is negative with upper bound zero, whereas $2 f(y)-f(0)$ is non-positive when $y \\leq \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\alpha}$, and thus $\\tilde{Y}(y)=0$ for all $y \\leq \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\alpha}$. When $y>\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\alpha}$, one has\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=f^{-1}(2 f(y))=y-\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nUnlike the Kolm-Atkinson class, members of the Kolm-Pollak class never guarantee a positive protected level of income for all values of $y$, no matter how high the coefficient of inequality aversion is. This can be seen as a serious disadvantage for this class, although the level of $y$ below which the protected income falls to zero becomes vanishingly small when $\\alpha$ is high.\n\nA graphical representation of $\\tilde{Y}(y)$ is easy to build upon the graph of $f$. Given that $f$ must have an upper bound, there is no loss of generality to let $f(+\\infty)=0$. One then has $\\tilde{Y}(y)=f^{-1}(2 f(y))$. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 .\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Representation of $\\ddot{Y}(y)$",

Since\n\n$$\n\\ddot{Y}(y)=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}} y\n$$\n\nthe protected income is always a fixed fraction of the initial (equal) income. The fraction $2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ tends to zero when $\\eta$ is close to 1 , and tends to one when $\\eta$ is very high. So, this fraction spans the whole range, which connects the coefficient of inequality aversion to the protected income in a convenient way.\n\nThe next proposition characterizes the class of social welfare functions protecting a fixed fraction of income.\nProposition 2. The subclass of social welfare functions satisfying, for all $y>0$ and a fixed $\\lambda \\in(0,1)$, the property $\\ddot{Y}(y)=\\lambda y$ is generated by the function\n\n$$\nf(y)=-e^{g(\\ln y)}\n$$\n\nwhere $g$ is defined as follows. It is an arbitrary continuous decreasing function over the interval $[0,-\\ln \\lambda]$ such that $g(\\ln \\lambda)-g(0)=\\ln 2$, and over the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ it is defined in a periodic way, i.e., $g((k+1) \\ln \\lambda+a)-g(k \\ln \\lambda+a)=\\ln 2$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, a \\in[0,-\\ln \\lambda]$.\nProof. From Prop. 1, $f$ must have an upper bound. There is no loss of generality in positing $f(+\\infty)=0$. (Note that $f$ is thus negative.) One then has $\\ddot{Y}(y)=f^{-1}(2 f(y))$.\n\nWe are looking for the class of $f$ satisfying, for all $y>0$ :\n\n$$\nf^{-1}(2 f(y))=\\lambda y\n$$\n\nfor a fixed $\\lambda$. This can be written as\n\n$$\n2 f(y)=f(\\lambda y)\n$$\n\nLetting $g=\\ln (-f \\circ e)$, a change of variables $x=\\ln y$ (note that $g$ is decreasing and is defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ ) yields\n\n$$\n\\ln 2+g(x)=g(\\ln \\lambda+x)\n$$\n\nThis property is satisfied by any function $g$ such that for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$,\n\n$$\ng(k \\ln \\lambda)=g(0)+k \\ln 2\n$$\n\n(this defines a line of points of intercept $g(0)$ and negative slope $\\ln 2 / \\ln \\lambda$ ) and $g$ is, suitably detrended, periodic across intervals $[(k+1) \\ln \\lambda, k \\ln \\lambda]$, i.e., for $a \\in[0,-\\ln \\lambda]$,\n\n$$\ng(k \\ln \\lambda+a)+\\ln 2=g((k+1) \\ln \\lambda+a)\n$$\n\nOnce such a function has been picked, one then retrieves\n\n$$\nf(y)=-e^{g(\\ln y)}\n$$\n\nSince the graph of $g$ contains a line of points, the case of a linear $g$ is obviously salient. One then has $g(x)=x \\ln 2 / \\ln \\lambda$, and\n\n$$\nf(y)=-y^{\\ln 2 / \\ln \\lambda}\n$$\n\nwhich brings us back to the Kolm-Atkinson class, for $\\eta=1-\\ln 2 / \\ln \\lambda$, and this implies that the fraction of protected income is indeed $2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$.\n\nLet us now extend the notion of protected income to the case in which individuals 2 and 3 see their incomes rise without limit. Let the function $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, y\\right)$ be defined implicitly by the equation\n\n$$\nf\\left(y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y\\right)\\right)+f\\left(y_{2}\\right)+f\\left(y_{3}\\right)=3 f(y)\n$$\n\nand explicitly as\n\n$$\ny_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, y\\right)=f^{-1}\\left(3 f(y)-f\\left(y_{2}\\right)-f\\left(y_{3}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is increasing in $y$ and decreasing in both $y_{2}, y_{3}$.\nThe domain of definition of $y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, y\\right)$, denoted $D_{123}$ is defined as follows\n\n$$\nD_{12}=\\left\\{\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, y\\right) \\mid 3 f(y)-f\\left(y_{2}\\right)-f\\left(y_{3}\\right) \\geq f(0)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProtected income against two: For a given $y>0$, the level of protected income against two other individuals is defined as\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=\\inf \\left\\{y_{1}\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, \\hat{y}\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{2}, y_{3}, \\hat{y}\\right) \\in D_{123}, \\hat{y}=y\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn the case of the Kolm-Atkinson class, one obtains\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}} y\n$$\n\nso that once again, a fixed fraction of $y$ is guaranteed to Ana. If one combines the requirement to protect a fixed (different) fraction of income against one and two other individuals, one obtains a characterization of this class (up to an affine transform).\n\nProposition 3. The Kolm-Atkinson subclass of social welfare functions is (up to an affine transform) characterized by the requirement that there exist $\\lambda, \\mu \\in(0,1)$ such that for all $y>0, \\tilde{Y}(y)=\\lambda y$ and $\\tilde{Y}(y)=\\mu y$. One must then have $\\lambda=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ and $\\mu=3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ for some $\\eta>1$.\n\nProof. From Prop. 2 we know that $f(y)=-e^{g(\\ln y)}$ for a function $g$ such that\n\n$$\ng((k+1) \\ln \\lambda+a)-g(k \\ln \\lambda+a)=\\ln 2\n$$\n\nfor all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, a \\in[0,-\\ln \\lambda]$. By a similar reasoning, the function $g$ must also satisfy\n\n$$\ng((k+1) \\ln \\mu+a)-g(k \\ln \\mu+a)=\\ln 3\n$$\n\nfor all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, a \\in[0,-\\ln \\mu]$. In particular, for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& g(k \\ln \\lambda)-g(0)=k \\ln 2 \\\\\n& g(k \\ln \\mu)-g(0)=k \\ln 3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nGiven the quasi-periodic behavior of $g$, there exist $b<0<c$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& b<g(x)-g(0)-x \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln \\lambda}<c \\\\\n& b<g(x)-g(0)-x \\frac{\\ln 3}{\\ln \\mu}<c\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is possible only if\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln \\lambda}=\\frac{\\ln 3}{\\ln \\mu}\n$$\n\nLet $1-\\eta$ be this common (negative) ratio. This proves that $\\lambda=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ and $\\mu=3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}}$ for some $\\eta>1$.\n\nWithout loss of generality (i.e., up to an affine transform of $W$ ), we can let $f(+\\infty)=0$ and $f(1)=\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nf\\left(2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}} y\\right)=2 f(y) \\\\\nf\\left(3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\eta}} y\\right)=3 f(y)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThe rest of the argument follows the proof of the first half of Theorem A in Tossavainen and Haukkanen (2007). Let $S=\\left\\{2^{\\frac{m}{1-n}} 3^{\\frac{n}{1-\\eta}} \\mid m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$ and pick $y \\in S$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f(y)=f\\left(2^{\\frac{m}{1-\\eta}} 3^{\\frac{n}{1-\\eta}}\\right)=2^{m} f\\left(3^{\\frac{n}{1-\\eta}}\\right)=2^{m} 3^{n} f(1) \\\\\n& \\quad=\\left(2^{\\frac{m}{1-\\eta}} 3^{\\frac{n}{1-\\eta}}\\right)^{1-\\eta} f(1)=f(1) y^{1-\\eta}=\\frac{y^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe have established that $f(y)=\\frac{y^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for $y \\in S$. In order to extend the result to all $y$ in the interval $(0,+\\infty)$ we need to show that $S$ is dense in $(0,+\\infty)$. Pick $y$ in $(0,+\\infty)$ and let $T=\\left\\{m+n \\log _{2} 3 \\mid m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}$. Since $\\log _{2} 3$ is irrational this means that $T$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$.

The next step is to show that $\\left\\{2^{\\frac{t_{j}}{1-\\eta}}\\right\\} \\subset S$.

It follows that $S$ is dense in $(0,+\\infty)$ and therefore that $f(y)=$ $\\frac{y^{1-\\eta}}{1-\\eta}$ for all $y \\in(0,+\\infty)$, which is what we wanted to show.",

      "text": "# 5 Constant Collateral Damage \n\nWe have criticized the Kolm-Pollak social welfare functions for not guaranteeing a positive income when the initial income is low. But it is worth revisiting the property of a constant collateral damage, i.e., a protected income that is always at the same distance from the initial income, provided the latter is greater than this constant collateral damage.\n\nHere again, we assume that $f$ has an upper bound and that $f(+\\infty)=$ 0 . The next proposition characterizes the class of social welfare functions exhibiting constant collateral damage.\n\nProposition 4. The subclass of social welfare functions satisfying, for a fixed $\\Delta \\in(0,+\\infty)$ and all $y>\\Delta$, the property $\\bar{Y}(y)=y-\\Delta$ is generated by the function\n\n$$\nf(y)=-e^{y(y)}\n$$\n\nwhere $g$ is defined as follows.

      "text": "# 6 Progressive Protection \n\nThe proportional protected income, with $\\eta>1$, is an improvement over the constant collateral damage in the sense that in the latter case, collateral damage, in proportion to income, is greater at lower levels of income. However, the fact that relative collateral damage is indeed constant with the KolmAtkinson approach, no matter what level of income one is considering, may be viewed as problematic, too. One might want to consider orderings that protect a higher fraction of Ana's income (and therefore allow lower relative collateral damage) the lower her income is. We turn our attention now to a novel class of orderings where this would be so.\n\nFix a parameter $c>0$. Let $f$ be defined, for $y \\geq c$, by:\n\n$$\nf(y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{\\left(\\ln \\frac{y}{c}\\right)^{1-\\gamma}}{\\frac{1-\\gamma}{c}} & \\text { for } \\gamma \\neq 1, \\gamma \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\ln \\ln \\frac{y}{c} & \\text { for } \\gamma=1\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe first note that, once again, $\\gamma \\leq 1$ does not embed enough inequality aversion in that, for those social welfare functions, there is no substantial protection. This follows directly from the fact that $f$ has no upper bound in this case, so that $2 f(y)-f\\left(y_{1}\\right)$ can be passed by $f\\left(y_{2}\\right)$ for $y_{2}$ great enough, no matter how low $y_{1}>c$ is.\n\nOn the other hand, for $\\gamma>1$, these social welfare functions exhibit the feature that a higher fraction of income is protected the lower Ana's income is and therefore the orderings have increasing relative collateral damage.\n\nProposition 6. Consider the subclass of social welfare functions generated by $f$ as defined above. Then, for all $y>c, \\tilde{Y}(y)=y^{\\bar{\\beta}} c^{1-\\bar{\\beta}}$, where $\\bar{\\beta}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$.\n\nProof. We compute that\n\n$$\ny_{1}\\left(y_{2} ; y\\right)=c \\cdot e^{\\left[2\\left(\\ln \\frac{y}{c}\\right)^{1-\\gamma}-\\left(\\ln \\frac{y_{2}}{c}\\right)^{1-\\gamma}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}}\n$$\n\nNotice that $\\lim _{y_{2} \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left[2\\left(\\ln \\frac{y}{c}\\right)^{1-\\gamma}-\\left(\\ln \\frac{y_{2}}{c}\\right)^{1-\\gamma}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}} \\ln \\frac{y}{c}$, so that\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=c \\cdot e^{\\ln \\frac{y}{c} \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}}=c \\cdot\\left(\\frac{y}{c}\\right)^{2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}}=y^{\\tilde{\\beta}} c^{1-\\tilde{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nThe coefficient $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is the income elasticity of protected income. For $\\gamma>1$ the elasticity $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is thus between zero and one. This implies that $\\frac{\\tilde{Y}(y)}{y}=\\left(\\frac{c}{y}\\right)^{1-\\tilde{\\beta}}$ is a decreasing function of equivalent income, and consequently the relative collateral damage $1-\\left(\\frac{c}{y}\\right)^{1-\\tilde{\\beta}}$ is an increasing function of equivalent income, as desired.\n\nNote that $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is increasing in $\\gamma$, that $\\lim _{\\gamma \\rightarrow \\infty} 2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}=1$, and that $\\lim _{\\gamma \\downarrow 1} 2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}=$ 0 . In words: a large $\\gamma$ corresponds to the situation where most of Ana's equivalent income is protected as Ben's income grows without bound whereas a small $\\gamma$ corresponds to a situation where only a baseline level $c$ of Ana's income is protected as Ben's income grows without bound.\n\nFor these orderings, protected income is therefore a weighted geometric average of a normatively determined baseline income level, $c$, and the original income level, $y$, and where the weight on income is precisely the income elasticity $\\tilde{\\beta}$. Because this income elasticity is the same for high or low income levels, we can identify these orderings as those having constant protected income elasticities and, when staying within this class, knowing the level $c>0$ and the magnitude of the elasticity $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is sufficient to pin down the entire ordering, as one can recover the parameter $\\gamma$ through the expression $\\tilde{\\beta}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$.\n\nWe show that constant protected income elasticities and a baseline protected income level indeed characterize this class of social welfare functions.\n\nProposition 7. The subclass of social welfare functions generated by $f$ (as defined in this section) is, up to an affine transform, characterized by the following property: There exist $\\tilde{\\beta}, \\tilde{\\beta} \\in(0,1), c>0$ such that, for all $y \\in$ $(c, \\infty)$,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{Y}(y)=y^{\\tilde{\\beta}} c^{1-\\tilde{\\beta}} \\text { and } \\tilde{Y}(y)=y^{\\tilde{\\beta}^{\\prime}} c^{1-\\tilde{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, necessarily there is $\\gamma>1$ such that $\\ddot{\\beta}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}, \\dddot{\\beta}=3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$.\nProof.

How much of Ana's income is protected against a rise in Ben's income? This can be derived in straightforward manner from the previous notions.

      "text": "# 8 Conclusions \n\nThis paper reveals a fundamental structure within additively separable social welfare functions that has gone unrecognized until now. Through this discovery, we provide novel characterizations of well-known social preferences using intuitively interpretable parameters. The practical significance of these parametric representations lies in their straightforward elicitation and validation, making them particularly valuable for empirical applications. To wit: the Kolm-Pollak social preferences can be described by noting that they exhibit\n\nconstant difference protected income (CDPI), and we write $f(y)=-2^{-\\frac{y}{b}}$ where $L>0$ identifies the largest collateral damage that is acceptable to the evaluator in a two-person evaluation for all income levels, and therefore $\\tilde{Y}(y)=y-L$ for all $y>0$. In turn, the Kolm-Atkinson social preferences that display positive protection can be described by noting that they exhibit constant relative protected income (CRPI), and we write $f(y)=-y^{\\frac{1}{\\log _{2} \\lambda}}$ where $\\lambda \\in(0,1)$ identifies the smallest fraction of income that will be protected by the evaluator in a two-person evaluation for all income levels, and therefore $\\tilde{Y}(y)=\\lambda y$ for all $y>0$. Last, we can say that the sub-class of social preferences we proposed in Section 6 that displays positive protection exhibits constant protected income elasticities (CPIE), and we write $f(y)=-\\left(\\ln \\frac{y}{c}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\log _{2} \\beta}}$ for $y>c$, where $\\beta \\in(0,1)$ is the income elasticity of protected income for all income levels in a two-person evaluation, $c$ is a normatively determined lower bound on protected income for all $\\beta \\in(0,1)$, and $\\tilde{Y}(y)=y^{\\beta} c^{1-\\beta}$ for all $y>c$.\n\nWith the contribution of this paper, the menu of choices for how to elicit ethical preferences about inequality aversion is enriched with a framing that is quite different from the leaky-bucket experiment usually employed, explicitly or implicitly, in surveys and experiments. Giving sacrificed individuals a protection against the collateral damage of pursuing the improvement in the lot of other people seems an attractive principle, and it can serve to calibrate the coefficient of inequality aversion.\n\nMoreover, we conjecture that this thought experiment tends to justify higher values of inequality aversion than the leaky-bucket experiment. Two cognitive mechanisms may induce this phenomenon. First, the leaky-bucket thought experiment involves a loss to society, as part of the transfer is wasted, and loss aversion is likely to kick in and generate a jaundiced view of the transfer. Second, the usual application involving a discrepancy between finite transfers and a numerical calibration of the coefficient that is only justified for infinitesimal transfers biases the analysis in the direction of a smaller coefficient (e.g., the proportional transfer principle requires a coefficient of 2 but only a coefficient of 1 for infinitesimal transfers, and it is wrong to infer from the respondents' acceptance of proportional transfers that their coefficient is 1 ).\n\nIn the thought experiment proposed here, loss aversion pushes in the direction of greater inequality aversion, since the loss that is imposed on the sacrificed individual looms large in the ethical evaluation. We therefore\n\npropose that empirical estimations of inequality aversion in the population should no longer be confined to leaky-bucket types of experiments (and certainly not confuse infinitesimal and large transfers) and should instead, or at least additionally, involve a \"protected level\" type of experiment in order to obtain another relevant estimate.\n\nHaving representations of social preferences that are easy to motivate and interpret, as we have aimed to provide in this paper and its companion website, https://osf.io/tnu2q/, can lower the barriers to adoption of these social welfare tools by applied economists. This would be a welcome development to anyone interested in fostering the inequality sensitive evaluation of economic and social policies.",

      "text": "# 10.2 Proof of Proposition 7 \n\nProof. The proof mimics previous proofs. First, one shows that $\\ddot{\\beta}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}, \\dddot{\\beta}=$ $3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$. To do this, we note that, by definition, $\\frac{1}{2} f(\\bar{Y}(y))+\\frac{1}{2} f(\\infty)=f(y)$. Notice that $\\bar{Y}(y) \\in(0, y)$ and since $f$ is monotone increasing this implies that $f$ is bounded from above. Without loss of generality, we can let $f(+\\infty)=0$ and $f(c \\cdot e)=\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$. Then $f\\left(y^{\\ddot{\\beta}} c^{1-\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)=2 f(y)$. Similarly, we know that $\\frac{1}{3} f(\\bar{Y}(y))+\\frac{1}{3} f(\\infty)+\\frac{1}{3} f(\\infty)=f(y)$ and so $f\\left(y^{\\ddot{\\beta}} c^{1-\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)=3 f(y)$. Let $z=\\ln y-\\ln c$ and $h(z)=f\\left(c \\cdot e^{z}\\right)$. Then the equations $f\\left(y^{\\ddot{\\beta}} c^{1-\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)=2 f(y)$ and $f\\left(y^{\\ddot{\\beta}} c^{1-\\bar{\\beta}}\\right)=3 f(y)$ respectively become\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nh(\\ddot{\\beta} z)=2 g(z) \\\\\nh(\\ddot{\\beta} z)=3 g(z)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nNow let $g=\\ln (-h \\circ e)$. A second change of variables $x=\\ln z$ yields\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\ln 2+g(x)=g(\\ln \\ddot{\\beta}+x) \\\\\n\\ln 3+g(x)=g(\\ln \\ddot{\\beta}+x)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe obtain that, for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& g(k \\ln \\bar{\\beta})-g(0)=k \\ln 2 \\\\\n& g(k \\ln \\bar{\\beta})-g(0)=k \\ln 3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich, as in the proof of Prop. 3, is only possible if\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln \\bar{\\beta}}=\\frac{\\ln 3}{\\ln \\bar{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nWe now let $1-\\gamma$ be this common (negative) ratio. This proves that $\\bar{\\beta}=2^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$ and $\\bar{\\beta}=3^{\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}}$ for some $\\gamma>1$.\n\nThe rest of the argument is as in the second half of the proof of Prop. 3 , from where it follows that $h(z)=h(1) z^{1-\\gamma}$ for all $z \\in(0, \\infty)$.

  "abstract": "We discover a fundamental and previously unrecognized structure within the\nclass of additively separable social welfare functions that makes it\nstraightforward to fully characterize and elicit the social preferences of an\ninequality-averse evaluator. From this structure emerges a revealing question:\nif a large increment can be given to one individual in a society, what is the\nmaximal sacrifice that another individual can be asked to bear for its sake? We\nshow that the answer uncovers the evaluator's degree of inequality aversion. In\nparticular, all translation-invariant evaluators would sacrifice the full\nincome of the sacrificed individual if their income were low enough and a\nconstant amount of their income otherwise. Scale-invariant evaluators would\nsacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual at all income levels if\ntheir inequality aversion was no greater than one, and a constant fraction of\ntheir income otherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of\nsocial preferences that, starting from a minimum-income level of protection,\nensure a higher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income is protected the\nlower their income.",
