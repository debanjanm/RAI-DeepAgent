      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nIn many situations of collective decision-making, a certain action can be taken if all parties consent to it, but it is unclear ex-ante which parties will benefit from the action and which will suffer from it. ${ }^{1}$ To break the deadlock, one party can acquire some information about the action and communicate it to the other parties. However, given the inherent conflicts of interest between the parties, such communication is usually subject to credibility issues.\n\nConsider, as an example, a manager (\"she\") facing a task of unknown difficulty. The manager can either complete the task herself or propose a plan to let a worker (\"he\") undertake it. If she proposes the plan, the worker can either accept it or reject it. The plan benefits the worker only if the task is sufficiently easy and benefits the manager only if the task is sufficiently hard. Before deciding whether to propose the plan, the manager can conduct a test to learn something about the difficulty of the task, and can then communicate the result of the test to the worker. ${ }^{2}$ However, the manager may misreport the test result to deceive the worker into accepting a hard task (see, e.g., Kadefors, 2004; Mayer et al., 1995).\n\nSimilar credibility issues arise in many other contexts. For instance, a political party may use a think tank report to convince the opposing party to support a policy whose effects are ex-ante unknown. A company's CEO may use a feasibility study to convince the board to approve a business plan with uncertain profitability. A researcher may present a proposal to persuade potential collaborators to embark on a project with limited knowledge about its prospect for success. Unfortunately, in all of these examples, it is not guaranteed that the parties acquiring information will not\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ On a related note, there are situations where the parties are uncertain about how they will benefit or suffer from a collective action that can be taken under alternative decision rules, such as majority rule. See, e.g., Ali et al. (2025).\n    ${ }^{2}$ Throughout the paper, for ease of exposition, we refer to an information structure used to acquire information as a test. Within the manager-worker framework, one common example of a test in real practice is a company's standard for classifying tasks in terms of their difficulty or complexity (see, e.g., Steward, 1981).\n\nmanipulate or influence the information that is presented.\nGiven such credibility issues, how can a party convincingly acquire and communicate information to reach unanimous consent with other parties? In this paper, we study this problem using a model based on the manager-worker example. In our model, if the worker accepts the plan, he incurs a certain effort cost to complete the task, while the manager, having saved her effort cost, makes a fixed payment to the worker. ${ }^{3}$ The worker's effort cost depends positively on the difficulty of the task and negatively on his capability; similarly, the manager's saved effort cost increases with the difficulty of the task. The game begins with the manager offering a menu of tests for the worker to choose from. The result of the chosen test is privately revealed to the manager, who then announces a test result that need not be truthful. After making the announcement, the manager decides whether to propose the plan or forgo it. If she proposes the plan, the worker decides whether to accept it or reject it.\n\nThe paper presents two main results. First, it is optimal for the manager to offer a threshold test, which indicates whether the task's difficulty exceeds a certain threshold, and to propose the plan only if it does. Second, if the worker privately knows his capability, the manager can benefit from screening the worker by offering one or two interval tests (in addition to the threshold test), which reveal whether the task is of medium difficulty.\n\nTo begin with, Section 3 studies a simple case in which the worker's capability is publicly known. In Theorem 1, we find that the manager can persuade the worker to undertake some tasks if and only if the worker is ex-ante optimistic (i.e., he is willing to undertake the task based solely on his prior belief about its difficulty). In particular, if the worker is ex-ante optimistic, then it is optimal for the manager to offer a threshold test and to propose the plan only if the task's difficulty exceeds the threshold. If the worker is ex-ante pessimistic, then the plan is never launched under any test because the inherent conflict of interest between the worker and the manager\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ In Section 5.1, we relax the assumption of fixed payment and study an extension in which the payment is chosen by the manager and can depend on the reported test result.\n\nmeans that a proposal from the manager would only intensify the worker's pessimism.\n\nSection 4 examines the more general case in which the worker privately knows his capability. In Theorem 2, which generalizes Theorem 1, we establish that if the manager is limited to offering a single test, her optimal choice is again a threshold test. In Theorem 3, we allow the manager to screen the worker by offering a menu of tests. Here, we find that screening strictly benefits the manager, and the optimal test menu consists of one threshold test plus up to two interval tests. We note that the optimal test menu in our setting is much simpler than that of Candogan and Strack (2023) (whose paper, like ours, highlights the value of screening in information design problems where the receiver has a private type). The simplicity of our result is driven by the fact that the manager can misreport the test result-because she needs to offer tests that are trustworthy, she cannot implement outcomes beyond using simple binary tests.\n\nSection 5 contains two extensions of our model. First, we investigate a setting in which the payment to the worker is chosen by the manager. We find that the optimal payment is socially efficient in the sense that, given this payment, the manager always proposes the plan. Second, we consider a multi-worker setting in which the manager needs to reach unanimous consent with all the workers. To analyze this setting, we transform the multi-worker problem into a single-worker problem in which the manager needs to persuade only the pivotal worker-the one who is least likely to accept the proposal. We find that all the results established for the baseline model continue to hold here.",

      "text": "# 1.1 Related Literature \n\nFirst, this paper contributes to the study of how information design may facilitate collective decision-making that requires unanimous consent. This question has been studied in contexts such as voting (Bardhi and Guo, 2018) and two-sided matching (Xu, 2023). In these two papers, the information designer merely controls the infor-\n\nmation environment. By contrast, in our paper, the information designer (i.e., the manager) is also a party involved in the collective decision. ${ }^{4}$ In other words, our paper speaks to situations where a party in the collective decision has the advantage of controlling the information environment, which is a prevalent feature in the applications we are interested in.\n\nSecond, this paper relates to the literature on information design with manipulable signals-in particular, a strand of the literature where the information designer is the potential manipulator. ${ }^{5}$ In these papers, the designer can commit to the information structure but not to the truthful reporting of the realized signal. For instance, in Guo and Shmaya (2021) and Nguyen and Tan (2021), the designer can manipulate the signal at a cost that depends on the distance between the reported signal and the actual one. In Lin and Liu (2024), the designer can manipulate the signal as long as the distribution of the reported signals remains identical to that of the actual ones. Unlike those papers, the designer (i.e., the manager) in our model can manipulate the realized signal at no cost and subject to no restrictions. This feature is also seen in Lipnowski et al. (2022) ${ }^{6}$ and in some papers on overt information acquisition before a cheap-talk game (Lyu and Suen, 2024; Kreutzkamp and Lou, 2024). ${ }^{7}$ The major distinction between these papers and ours is that the designer in our model does not merely provide information - she has a state-dependent preference and is involved in the post-communication game, as she can forgo the plan. ${ }^{8}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Another distinction is that both Bardhi and Guo (2018) and Xu (2023) feature multiple agents, while our baseline model has only one agent (i.e., the worker). To better demonstrate the difference, Section 5.2 extends our model to multiple agents.\n    ${ }^{5}$ In another strand of the literature, the non-designer is the potential manipulator. For example, Perez-Richet and Skreta $(2022,2023)$ study the test design problem where test-takers can manipulate the input of the test. Other examples include Ivanov (2010), Ball (2024), Li and Qiu (2024), etc.\n    ${ }^{6}$ In Lipnowski et al. (2022), the designer can manipulate the signal with some exogenous probability. This encompasses the special case where the probability of manipulation is one.\n    ${ }^{7}$ As will be demonstrated in Section 2, models of overt information acquisition before a cheap-talk game can be re-framed as information design models where the sender can manipulate the realized signal. See also papers that study information acquisition before contracting where the principal cannot commit to how to use the acquired information (e.g., Clark and Li, 2024).\n    ${ }^{8}$ Another distinction is that our model allows the information receiver to be privately informed.",

      "text": "# 2 Model \n\nA manager (\"she\") faces a task of unknown difficulty. She can either undertake the task herself, or propose a plan to let a worker (\"he\") do so. If she proposes the plan, the worker can either accept it or reject it. The joint decision of the manager and the worker is represented as $a=1$ if the plan is launched (i.e., proposed and accepted) and $a=0$ otherwise. The difficulty of the task, serving as the state of the world in this paper, is denoted by $\\theta \\sim G(\\Theta)$, where $\\Theta:=[0,1]$. The distribution $G(\\cdot)$ is continuous, with probability density function $g(\\cdot) .{ }^{9}$\n\nIf the plan is launched, then the worker's payoff is $w(\\theta)=b-\\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda}$ and the manager's payoff is $m(\\theta)=-b+\\theta$. We interpret these payoffs as follows. The parameter $\\lambda>0$ represents the worker's capability. The worker receives a fixed payment $b \\in(0,1)$ from the manager and incurs an effort cost of $\\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda}$ to complete the task-the effort cost is lower if the task is easier or the worker is more capable. On the other side, the manager pays the worker $b$ and receives a benefit normalized to $\\theta$-the benefit increases with the difficulty of the task, because had the plan not been launched, the manager would have had to complete the task herself, incurring a cost proportional to its difficulty. ${ }^{10}$\n\nIf the plan is not launched, both players' payoffs are normalized to zero.\nThe worker's capability $\\lambda$ follows a distribution $F(\\Lambda)$, where $\\Lambda:=\\left[1, \\frac{1}{b}\\right]$; we let $f(\\cdot)$ denote the probability density function of $F$ (if it exists). As implied by the definition of $\\Lambda$, we assume $\\lambda \\geq 1$ to capture the idea that the worker is (weakly) more capable than the manager of accomplishing the task, so that the plan is potentially beneficial for both parties; we also assume $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{1}{b}$, which implies that undertaking the most difficult task (i.e., the task with $\\theta=1$ ) is undesirable even for the most capable worker, so that our analysis is non-trivial. Based on these restrictions on the value of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ We assume that $G(\\cdot)$ is continuous to simplify the exposition. The main insights of this paper remain intact if $G(\\cdot)$ has atoms.\n    ${ }^{10}$ One could also interpret the manager's benefit as the profit generated by the task, which might reasonably be assumed to be positively correlated with the task's difficulty.\n\n$\\lambda$, we can classify tasks into three categories. A task with $\\theta \\in[0, b)$ yields a negative payoff for the manager and a positive payoff for the worker if the plan is launched. A task with $\\theta \\in(\\lambda b, 1]$ yields a positive payoff for the manager and a negative payoff for the worker. A task with $\\theta \\in[b, \\lambda b]$ yields non-negative payoffs for both players. See Figure 1 for an illustration.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Players' payoffs upon launching the plan as functions of the task's difficulty $\\theta$.\n\nWe assume that $\\lambda$ is the worker's private information. Note, however, that this assumption encompasses the special case in which the manager also knows $\\lambda$; this occurs if we take $F(\\cdot)$ to be a degenerate distribution whose support consists of only the actual value of $\\lambda$.\n\nNeither player observes $\\theta$ directly. However, the manager can conduct a test to acquire some information about $\\theta$ at no cost. A test $t=(S, \\sigma)$ consists of (1) a compact signal space $S$ and (2) a mapping $\\sigma: \\Theta \\rightarrow \\Delta(S)$ from the state space to the set of distributions on the signal space. Slightly abusing the notation, we let $\\sigma_{s}(\\theta)$ denote the probability of signal $s$ given state $\\theta$ under the mapping $\\sigma$. We let $\\mathcal{T}$ denote the collection of all possible tests. As is standard in the literature, we can also formulate a test as the posterior distribution it induces; that is, we can view a test as an element of $\\Delta(\\Delta(\\Theta))$. In our analysis, we will use the two formulations interchangeably.\n\nThe game proceeds as follows:\n\n- (Tests offering stage) The manager offers a menu of tests $T \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$.\n\n- The state of the world $\\theta$ and the worker's type $\\lambda$ are realized.\n- (Test selection stage) Knowing his type $\\lambda$, the worker selects one test $t \\in T$.\n- The test result $s \\in S$ is generated by $\\sigma$ and privately revealed to the manager.\n- (Communication stage) The manager sends a cheap-talk message $m \\in M$ to the worker, where $M$ is any measurable set that includes $S$ as a subset.\n- (M-decision stage) The manager chooses whether to propose or forgo the plan. If she forgoes it, the plan is not launched, and the game ends.\n- (W-decision stage) If the manager has proposed the plan, the worker chooses whether to accept or reject it. The plan is launched if and only if it is accepted. ${ }^{11}$\n\nAs is standard in cheap-talk models, it is without loss of generality to consider a specific message space $M=S$ in the communication stage. In other words, the communication stage can be reformulated as the manager's announcement of a test result $\\tilde{s} \\in S$. Note that the announced test result $\\tilde{s}$ may differ from the actual test result $s$. This reflects our main departure from the literature on information design: the manager, who plays the role of the sender in a standard information design model, still commits to an information structure but no longer commits to truthful reporting of the realized information.",

For the test offering stage, the manager's strategy is given by her choice of $T \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$. For the test selection stage, the worker's strategy is given by\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ In the last two stages, we let the players decide sequentially whether to launch the plan, rather than having them decide simultaneously. We thus rule out the Pareto-dominated equilibrium in which both players, if deciding simultaneously, always reject the plan. Our results continue to hold in the alternative setting in which the players decide simultaneously, as long as we use Pareto optimality as an equilibrium selection criterion.\n\n$\\rho_{s}: \\Lambda \\times 2^{\\mathcal{T}} \\rightarrow \\Delta(\\mathcal{T})$, where $\\rho_{s}(\\lambda, T)$ is the distribution according to which the worker chooses a test when his type is $\\lambda$ and the menu of tests is $T$. We require that $\\operatorname{supp}\\left(\\rho_{s}(\\lambda, T)\\right) \\subseteq T$.\n\nFor the manager, the communication stage and the M-decision stage essentially happen at the same time. Let $\\mathcal{H}_{m}$ represent the collection of histories available to the manager up to the beginning of these two stages. Then, for these stages, the manager's strategy is given by a mapping $\\rho_{m}: \\mathcal{H}_{m} \\rightarrow \\Delta(S \\times\\{0,1\\})$, where $\\rho_{m}\\left(h_{m}\\right)$ is the joint distribution of the announced test result and whether a proposal is made. Notice that in these two stages, the manager forms a belief about the state $\\theta$ from the test result, as well as a belief about the worker's type $\\lambda$ from the test he has chosen. We let $\\psi_{p} \\in \\Psi_{p}=\\Delta(\\Theta)$ denote her belief about $\\theta$ and $\\psi_{q} \\in \\Psi_{q}=\\Delta(\\Lambda)$ her belief about $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, for the W-decision stage, the worker's strategy is given by $\\rho_{w}: \\mathcal{H}_{w} \\rightarrow$ $[0,1]$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{w}$ represents the collection of histories available to the worker up to the beginning of this stage and $\\rho_{w}\\left(h_{w}\\right)$ is the probability that the worker accepts a proposed plan. In this stage, the worker has a belief about $\\theta$, which we denote by $\\psi_{a} \\in \\Psi_{a}=\\Delta(\\Theta)$.\n\nThe solution concept used in this paper is weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium (WPBE). We require (1) that the beliefs $\\left(\\psi_{p}, \\psi_{q}, \\psi_{a}\\right)$ are formed by Bayes' rule on the equilibrium path, and (2) that each player's strategy is sequentially rational given their own belief and the other player's strategy. As is common in the information design literature, beliefs off the equilibrium path do not play a critical role in the analysis, so we do not explicitly discuss them unless necessary.",

      "text": "# 3 Optimal Test with Public Type \n\nWe begin by analyzing a simple case in which the worker's capability type $\\lambda$ is publicly known-that is, the distribution $F(\\cdot)$ is degenerate. In this case, the manager does\n\nnot need to screen the worker to detect his type, so it is without loss of generality that she offers him only one test.\n\nDefinition 1. The worker is ex-ante optimistic if $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta] \\leq \\lambda b$ and ex-ante pessimistic if $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]>\\lambda b$.\n\nDefinition 1 specifies two scenarios that are distinguished by whether the worker is willing to undertake the task based solely on his prior belief about the task's difficulty. As we will show below, the optimal test depends on which of these scenarios holds.\n\nDefinition 2. A test $t=(S, \\sigma)$ is a threshold test if $S=\\{0,1\\}$ and there is some $\\hat{\\theta}$, called the partition threshold, such that\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{1}(\\theta)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } \\theta>\\hat{\\theta} \\\\ 0 & \\text { if } \\theta<\\hat{\\theta}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nBy definition, a threshold test indicates whether $\\theta$ is above or below a certain threshold.\n\nTheorem 1. (1) If the worker is ex-ante optimistic, then it is optimal for the manager to offer a threshold test, which we denote by $t^{*}$, whose partition threshold is\n\n$$\n\\theta^{*}:= \\begin{cases}b & \\text { if } \\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq b] \\leq \\lambda b \\\\ \\tilde{\\theta} \\quad \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta>\\tilde{\\theta}]=\\lambda b & \\text { if } \\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq b]>\\lambda b\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nMoreover, the plan is launched if and only if $\\theta \\geq \\theta^{*}$.\n(2) If the worker is ex-ante pessimistic, the plan is never launched for any test offered.\n\nProof.

      "text": "# 3.1 Intuition for Theorem 1 \n\nTo explain Theorem 1, we introduce the auxiliary problem defined below. For clarity, we refer to the original problem as Problem (O).\n\nDefinition 3. Problem (A) is the same as Problem (O) except that the manager is required to report the test result truthfully, i.e., $\\tilde{s}=s$.\n\nThe crucial difference between Problem (A) and Problem (O) is that in the former, the manager can commit to truthfully revealing the test result. This commitment power makes the manager weakly better off in Problem (A) than in Problem (O). We use this fact to analyze the two scenarios presented in Theorem 1.\n\nScenario 1: Ex-ante optimistic worker. In this scenario, the optimality of $t^{*}$ for Problem (O) hinges on two facts.\n\nFirst, $t^{*}$ is optimal for Problem (A). To see this, notice that Problem (A) is a standard information design problem with a continuous state. The manager (i.e., the information designer) faces the following ex-post payoff $u(\\theta)$ when the induced posterior mean is $\\theta$ :\n\n$$\nu(\\theta)= \\begin{cases}m(\\theta) & \\text { if } \\theta \\in[b, \\lambda b] \\\\ 0 & \\text { if } \\theta \\in[0, b) \\cup(\\lambda b, 1]\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThat is, the manager gets the payoff $m(\\theta)$ if and only if the posterior mean is such that both players agree to launch the plan. Hence, Problem (A) can be formalized as\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\tilde{G}} \\quad \\int_{0}^{1} u(\\theta) \\tilde{G}(\\theta)\n$$\n\ns.t. $\\quad G$ is a mean-preserving spread of $\\tilde{G}$.\n\nNow, using the technique of Dworczak and Martini (2019), we can construct a \"price function\" $p(\\theta)$, as depicted in Figure 2, that will help us verify the optimality of $t^{*}$ for Problem (A). We relegate the details of the verification to Appendix A.1.\n\nSecond, in the context of Problem (O), $t^{*}$ is trustworthy, in the sense that the manager will not benefit from misreporting the test result even if she is allowed to do so. We formalize this concept as follows. Given a test $t=(S, \\sigma)$, let $\\mu(s)$ denote the\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: Optimal test for Problem (A) when the worker is ex-ante optimistic. In each panel, the brown curve represents the manager's ex-post payoff function $u(\\theta)$, and the blue curve represents the \"price function\" $p(\\theta)$ used to verify the optimality of the characterized test. The optimal test returns a signal $s=0$ if $\\theta \\in\\left[0, \\theta^{*}\\right)$ and $s=1$ if $\\theta \\in\\left[\\theta^{*}, 1\\right]$. The red and the green dots represent the induced posterior mean and the corresponding ex-post payoff of the manager under the two signals.\nmean of the posterior belief induced by the realized signal $s$. Suppose the manager proposes the plan if and only if $\\mu(s) \\geq b$, while the worker accepts the proposal if and only if $\\mu(s) \\leq \\lambda b$. Based on such responses to a realized signal, we define the manager's expected payoff from reporting $\\tilde{s}$ as $U(\\tilde{s}, s):=\\operatorname{Pr}[b \\leq \\mu(\\tilde{s}) \\leq \\lambda b] \\cdot \\mu(s)$.\n\nDefinition 4. A test $t=(S, \\sigma)$ is trustworthy if $U(s, s) \\geq U(\\tilde{s}, s)$ for any $\\tilde{s}, s \\in S .{ }^{12}$\nTo see why $t^{*}$ is trustworthy, notice that on the equilibrium path, the manager will forgo the plan if the test result is $s=0$ and propose it if $s=1$. If $s=0$, the manager prefers not to launch the plan, so she would not benefit from misreporting the test result as $\\tilde{s}=1$. If $s=1$, the manager would not benefit from reporting $\\tilde{s}=0$, because then the worker would reject the proposal.\n\nThe two facts established above imply that, by offering $t^{*}$, the manager can obtain in Problem (O) her optimal expected payoff in Problem (A). As we explained at the beginning of this section, the manager cannot do better in Problem (O) than in Problem (A). Therefore, $t^{*}$ is optimal for Problem (O) when the worker is ex-ante optimistic.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ This definition also applies in the general case where the worker privately knows $\\lambda$ (Section 4).\n\nScenario 2: Ex-ante pessimistic worker. As we did for Scenario 1, we begin by deriving the optimal test for Problem (A). Here, the optimal test is a threshold test with the threshold $\\theta^{*}$ satisfying $\\mathbf{E}\\left[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\leq \\theta^{*}\\right]=\\lambda b$ (see Figure 3). On the equilibrium path, if the test result is $s=0$, the worker will reject any proposal; if $s=1$, the plan will be launched.\n\nHowever, unlike in Scenario 1, this test is not trustworthy. Specifically, if $s=0$, then in the context of Problem (O), the manager will benefit from reporting $\\tilde{s}=1$ instead (and thus deceiving the worker into accepting her proposal).\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Optimal test for Problem (A) when the worker is ex-ante pessimistic. The brown curve represents the manager's ex-post payoff function $u(\\theta)$. The blue curve represents the \"price function\" $p(\\theta)$ used to verify the optimality of the characterized test. The optimal test returns a signal $s=0$ if $\\theta \\in\\left(\\theta^{*}, 1\\right]$ and $s=1$ if $\\theta \\in\\left[0, \\theta^{*}\\right]$. The red and the green dots represent the induced posterior mean and the corresponding ex-post payoff of the manager under the two signals.\n\nDoes there exist another test, not necessarily optimal for Problem (A), that is trustworthy and enables the plan to be launched with positive probability? As stated in Theorem 1, the answer is no. Intuitively, given the inherent conflict of interest between the players, a proposal from the manager can only intensify the worker's pessimism. Hence, if the worker is already ex-ante pessimistic, he will become even more pessimistic upon any proposal he receives and thus reject it.",

      "text": "# Comparative statics w.r.t. the worker's capability $\\lambda$. \n\nWe analyze how the worker's capability affects the optimal test and the players' welfare. We focus on the situation with $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]>b .{ }^{13}$ Let $\\lambda^{*}:=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]}{b}$ and $\\lambda^{\\Delta}:=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq b]}{b}$. Notice that $1<\\lambda^{*}<\\lambda^{\\Delta}<\\frac{1}{b}$. As $\\lambda$ increases, the equilibrium path under the optimal test passes through the following three phases.\n\nPhase 1: $\\lambda \\in\\left[1, \\lambda^{*}\\right)$. In this phase, the worker is ex-ante pessimistic, so the plan is never launched. To keep the notation consistent, we arbitrarily set $\\theta^{*}=1$ for this phase (recall that $\\theta^{*}$ is the threshold of task difficulty at which the plan is launched).\n\nPhase 2: $\\lambda \\in\\left[\\lambda^{*}, \\lambda^{\\Delta}\\right)$. In this phase, the worker is ex-ante optimistic, so the plan is launched whenever $\\theta \\geq \\theta^{*}$. As $\\lambda$ increases within this interval, the threshold $\\theta^{*}$ continuously increases from 0 to $b$. In other words, as the worker becomes more capable, the manager can propose fewer undesirable tasks (i.e., tasks with $\\theta<b$ )-these tasks are used by the manager only to convince the worker to accept the proposal.\n\nPhase 3: $\\lambda \\in\\left[\\lambda^{\\Delta}, \\frac{1}{b}\\right]$. In this phase, the worker is ex-ante optimistic, and the plan is launched whenever $\\theta \\geq b$. Unlike in Phase 2, the threshold $\\theta^{*}$ now remains constant (and equal to $b$ ) as $\\lambda$ increases.\n\nLet $\\pi_{m}$ and $\\pi_{w}$ denote the expected payoff of the manager and the worker, respectively.\n\nCorollary 1. (a) The threshold of task difficulty at which the plan is launched, $\\theta^{*}$, is non-monotonic in $\\lambda$.\n(b) The worker's expected payoff remains zero for $\\lambda<\\lambda^{\\Delta}$ and strictly increases with $\\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{\\Delta}$. The manager's expected payoff remains zero for $\\lambda<\\lambda^{*}$, strictly increases in $\\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\in\\left[\\lambda^{*}, \\lambda^{\\Delta}\\right]$, and remains constant for $\\lambda>\\lambda^{\\Delta}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ Our analysis also applies to the situation with $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta] \\leq b$, except that in that case, Phase 1 (introduced below) no longer occurs.\n\nProof. Part (a): The plan is never launched when $\\lambda<\\lambda^{*}$, yet as soon as $\\lambda$ hits the threshold $\\lambda^{*}$, the plan is always launched, and as $\\lambda$ increases further, the manager's proposal includes fewer and fewer easy tasks.\n\nPart (b): In Phase 1, both players' expected payoffs are zero because the plan is never launched. In the latter two phases, we have $\\pi_{m}=\\int_{\\theta^{*}}^{1}(\\theta-b) d G(\\theta)$ and $\\pi_{w}:=$ $\\int_{\\theta^{*}}^{1}\\left(b-\\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right) d G(\\theta)$. In Phase 2, $\\pi_{w}$ remains zero because his participation constraint upon receiving a proposal is binding under $t^{*}$, while $\\pi_{m}$ strictly increases with $\\lambda$ because $\\theta^{*}$ increases with $\\lambda$. In Phase 3, $\\pi_{m}$ remains constant because $\\theta^{*}$ no longer changes with $\\lambda$, while it is not difficult to verify that $\\pi_{w}$ strictly increases with $\\lambda$.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n(a) Threshold difficulty $\\theta^{*}$\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n(b) Players' payoffs\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of Corollary 1. Panel (a) shows the threshold of task difficulty at which the plan is launched, as a function of $\\lambda$. Panel (b) shows the manager's payoff (red curve) and the worker's payoff (green curve). The figure is generated under $G(\\theta)=\\theta$ and $b=0.4$.\n\nWe highlight two messages from Corollary 1. First, there is a certain order in which the players capture the incremental benefits from increases in the worker's capability. When $\\lambda<\\lambda^{\\Delta}$, all benefits from an increase in $\\lambda$ accrue to the manager (i.e., her expected payoff increases while the worker's remains constant); when $\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{\\Delta}$, all benefits accrue to the worker.\n\nSecond, when $\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}$, a more capable worker ends up undertaking (weakly) fewer tasks, which is socially inefficient because the worker is always more capable than\n\nthe manager. This inefficiency is due to the fact that the payment to the worker is fixed. In Section 5.1, we will show that such inefficiency disappears if the manager can choose the payment.",

      "text": "# Comparative statics w.r.t. the task's difficulty propensity. \n\nIn this comparative statics analysis, we assume that the distribution of the task's difficulty takes the functional form of $G(\\theta)=\\theta^{\\eta}$. The parameter $\\eta \\in(0, \\infty)$ can be interpreted as the difficulty propensity of the task-a larger $\\eta$ indicates that the task is more likely to be a hard one. We focus on the situation with $\\lambda>\\frac{1-b}{-b \\ln b} .^{14}$\n\nWe define $\\eta^{*}:=\\frac{\\lambda b}{1-\\lambda b}$ so that $\\left.\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]\\right|_{\\eta=\\eta^{*}}=\\lambda b$; we also let $\\eta^{\\Delta}$ satisfy $\\frac{\\eta^{\\Delta}}{\\eta^{\\Delta}+1} \\cdot \\frac{1-b^{\\eta^{\\Delta}}+1}{1-b^{\\eta^{\\Delta}}}=$ $\\lambda b$ so that $\\left.\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq b]\\right|_{\\eta=\\eta^{\\Delta}}=\\lambda b$. It can be verified that $0<\\eta^{\\Delta}<\\eta^{*}<\\infty$. As $\\eta$ increases, the equilibrium path under the optimal test passes through three phases.\n\nPhase 1: $\\eta \\in\\left(0, \\eta^{\\Delta}\\right]$. In this phase, the task has a low propensity to be difficult, so the worker is willing to accept the proposal even if the manager chooses her firstbest threshold test with threshold $b$.\n\nPhase 2: $\\eta \\in\\left(\\eta^{\\Delta}, \\eta^{*}\\right]$. In this phase, the task has a medium propensity to be difficult, while the worker is still ex-ante optimistic as in Phase 1. The manager uses the threshold test with threshold $\\theta^{*}<b$, which decreases as the task's difficulty propensity increases.\n\nPhase 3: $\\eta \\in\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\infty\\right)$. In this phase, the task has a high propensity to be difficult, making the worker ex-ante pessimistic, so the plan is never launched. To keep the notation consistent, we arbitrarily set $\\theta^{*}=1$ for this phase.\n\nCorollary 2. (a) The threshold of task difficulty at which the plan is launched, $\\theta^{*}$, is non-monotonic in $\\eta$.\n(b) The manager's expected payoff strictly increases with $\\eta$ for $\\eta \\leq \\eta^{*}$ and remains zero for $\\eta>\\eta^{*}$. The worker's expected payoff is positive and single-peaked at some $\\tilde{\\eta} \\in\\left(0, \\eta^{\\Delta}\\right)$ for $\\eta<\\eta^{\\Delta}$ and remains zero for $\\eta \\geq \\eta^{\\Delta}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ Our analysis still applies to the situation with $\\lambda \\leq \\frac{1-b}{-b \\ln b}$, except that in that case, Phase 1 (introduced below) no longer occurs.\n\nProof. See Appendix A.2.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: Illustration of Corollary 2. Panel (a) shows the threshold of task difficulty at which the plan is launched, as a function of $\\eta$. Panel (b) shows the manager's payoff (red curve) and the worker's payoff (green curve). The figure is generated under the parameters $\\lambda=1.8$ and $b=0.4$.\n\nWe highlight the following messages from Corollary 2. First, the manager strictly benefits from a high task difficulty propensity as long as that does not render the worker ex-ante pessimistic. This is driven by the fact that launching the plan generates higher social welfare if the task is more difficult. The worker's expected payoff is maximized at some $\\tilde{\\eta}<\\eta^{\\Delta}$. Intuitively, although the worker prefers to undertake an easier task, the harder tasks generate more social welfare for the worker to extract.\n\nSecond, there is more inefficiency when the task's difficulty propensity is extreme. As indicated by Corollary 2(a), the worker undertakes relatively fewer tasks when $\\eta$ is very large or very small. This is because a task of medium difficulty propensity is more likely to gain the mutual consent of both the manager and the worker.",

      "text": "# 4 Optimal Test with Private Type\n### 4.1 Optimal Single Test\n\nWe begin by studying the case in which the manager can offer only a single test to the worker. Our findings in this case are similar to those of Section 3 (where the manager offers only one test because she does not need to screen the worker).\n\nTheorem 2. Recall that $\\lambda^{*}:=\\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]}{b}$ is the cutoff type that determines whether the worker is ex-ante optimistic or ex-ante pessimistic.\n(1) If $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]>0$, then it is optimal for the manager to offer a threshold test with partition threshold\n\n$$\n\\theta^{*}:=\\arg \\max _{\\tilde{\\theta} \\in[0,1]}\\left\\{\\left(\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]-b\\right) \\cdot\\left(1-F\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]}{b}\\right)\\right) \\cdot(1-G(\\tilde{\\theta}))\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand to propose the plan if and only if $\\theta>\\theta^{*}$.\n(2) If $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]=0$, then the plan is never launched for any test offered.\n\nProof. See Appendix A.3.\n\nThis theorem generalizes Theorem 1: Since $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]$ is the measure of the set of worker types that are ex-ante optimistic, the theorem says that the plan may be launched as long as the worker is not ex-ante pessimistic with probability one. As with Theorem 1, the intuition is that because the manager can misreport, she can induce the worker to undertake the task by convincing him that it is hard, but not by convincing him that it is easy.\n\nAs will be shown in the proof, because the manager needs to remain trustworthy, her best option is to offer a threshold test. Hence, the problem of finding the optimal test boils down to that of finding the optimal threshold. Since the manager's expected payoff from the threshold $\\tilde{\\theta}$ is $\\left(\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]-b\\right) \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]}{b}\\right] \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}[\\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]$, the optimal threshold is the one indicated in the theorem.",

      "text": "# 4.1.1 Proof Sketch of Theorem 2 \n\nTheorem 2 is proved in two steps, corresponding to the two lemmas below. The formal proofs of both lemmas appear in Appendix A.3.\n\nLemma 1. If the plan is launched with positive probability, it is without loss of generality that the manager offers a binary test (i.e., a test with exactly two realizable signals) and proposes the plan only if the signal is the one that induces a higher posterior mean for $\\theta$.\n\nThe intuition behind Lemma 1 is as follows. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the test has at least two possible signals, say $s^{\\prime}, s^{\\prime \\prime} \\in S$, under which the manager will propose the plan with positive probability. Then the manager will benefit from either misreporting $s^{\\prime}$ as $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ or vice versa - she will always report the signal that induces more worker types to accept the proposal. Hence, such a test is not trustworthy. On the other hand, if there are two possible signals under which the manager will forgo the plan, without loss of generality, they can be combined into a single signal.\n\nHereafter, if the plan is launched with positive probability, then we refer to the signal under which the manager proposes the plan with positive probability as the \"proposal signal\" and to the other one as the \"null signal.\" Lemma 1 also establishes that the proposal signal must induce a higher posterior mean than the null signalotherwise, the manager will misreport the null signal as the proposal signal, rendering the test untrustworthy.\n\nLemma 1 drastically simplifies our analysis. Suppose the worker is ex-ante pessimistic with probability one, i.e., $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]=0$. Then Lemma 1 implies that after the worker receives a proposal, the mean of his belief about $\\theta$ must be higher than the prior mean $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]$, which is already higher than $\\lambda b$ since the worker is ex-ante pessimistic. Therefore, the worker will never accept a proposal-which is Part (2) of the theorem.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the worker is ex-ante optimistic with positive proba-\n\nbility, i.e., $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]>0$. In this case, the manager is able to launch the plan with positive probability, so her expected payoff is positive; thus, by Lemma 1, we can restrict our attention to binary tests. Since both players' payoff functions are linear in $\\theta$, the relevant features of a binary test are (1) the probability of realization of the proposal signal, which we denote by $p$, and (2) the posterior mean induced by the proposal signal, which we denote by $\\mu$. In other words, two binary tests with the same $(p, \\mu)$ will result in the same equilibrium payoffs for the players. Therefore, from now on, we specify a binary test simply by the associated pair $(p, \\mu)$.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose the manager offers a trustworthy binary test that does not admit a threshold form. Then, there is a trustworthy threshold test that strictly improves her expected payoff.\n\nThe idea of Lemma 2 is as follows. Given any trustworthy binary non-threshold test $(p, \\mu)$, we construct a threshold test with partition threshold $\\theta_{\\mu}$ that satisfies $\\mathbf{E}\\left[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\theta_{\\mu}\\right]=\\mu$. We specify this threshold test as $(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{\\mu})$. By construction, it must satisfy $\\tilde{p}>p$ and $\\tilde{\\mu}=\\mu$. Hence, this threshold test leads to the same decision on the part of the worker, remains trustworthy, and strictly increases the manager's expected payoff because its proposal probability is strictly larger than the proposal probability of the original test.",

      "text": "# 4.2 Optimal Test Menu \n\nNow, we relax the constraint in Section 4.1 and allow the manager to screen the worker's type by offering a test menu. Given that the worker's type space $\\Lambda$ and the state space $\\Theta$ are both continuous, one may conjecture that the optimal test menu may involve numerous complicated tests. However, the next theorem shows that the optimal menu admits a simple form-it consists of up to three tests, each of which is either a threshold test or an interval test, which indicates whether the difficulty of a task falls within a certain interval.\n\nDefinition 5. $A$ test $t=(S, \\sigma)$ is an interval test if $S=\\{0,1\\}$ and there exist $0<\\underline{\\theta}<\\bar{\\theta}<1$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{1}(\\theta)= \\begin{cases}1 & \\text { if } \\theta \\in(\\underline{\\theta}, \\bar{\\theta}) \\\\ 0 & \\text { if } \\theta>\\bar{\\theta} \\text { or } \\theta<\\underline{\\theta}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTheorem 3. (1) If $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]>0$, then it is optimal for the manager to offer a menu consisting of up to three tests, including one threshold test plus zero, one, or two interval tests.\n(2) If $\\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\lambda^{*}\\right]=0$, then the plan is never launched under any test menu.\n\nProof. See Appendix A. 4 .\n\nLike Theorem 2, this theorem says that the plan cannot be launched unless the set of worker types that are ex-ante optimistic has positive measure. In the case where the plan can be launched, the manager's optimal test menu includes a threshold test, which is targeted to high-type workers. In addition, the manager may benefit from offering one or two interval tests targeted to lower-type workers. Compared to the threshold test, the interval tests in the optimal menu correspond to lower values of $p$ (the proposal probability) and $\\mu$ (the posterior mean induced by the proposal signal). Therefore, a higher-type worker, who is less sensitive to the task's difficulty, prefers the threshold test, whereas a lower-type worker, who is more sensitive to the task's difficulty, will choose an interval test. Section 4.2.1 provides an example to illustrate how screening is achieved. ${ }^{15}$\n\nThe finding of Theorem 3-that screening may strictly benefit the manager when the worker privately knows his capability-speaks to the literature on the persuasion of a privately informed receiver. The paper closest to ours in this literature, Candogan and Strack (2023), also highlights the value of screening: It shows that in settings\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ The example in Section 4.2 .1 has two tests in the optimal menu. To show that our characterization in Theorem 3 is tight, in Appendix B.1, we provide a more complicated example where the optimal menu contains three tests.\n\nwhere the payoffs of both the sender and the receiver are linear in the state, screening can strictly benefit the sender, and the optimal menu has a laminar structure. ${ }^{16}$ Moreover, the number of information structures in the optimal menu depends linearly on the number of receiver types.\n\nThe optimal menu in our paper is much simpler than that of Candogan and Strack (2023). First, it consists of up to three tests regardless of the worker's type spaceeven when there is a continuum of worker types. Second, each test in the optimal menu takes the simple form of a threshold test or an interval test, as opposed to the more complicated laminar structure in Candogan and Strack (2023). Intuitively, the simplicity of our result is driven by the manager's ability to misreport the test result. In particular, because the manager must offer tests that are trustworthy, she cannot implement any outcomes beyond those resulting from binary tests.",

      "text": "# 4.2.1 An Example Where Screening Is Helpful \n\nConsider the following example. The state $\\theta$ is drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. The manager's payment to the worker if the plan is launched is $b=\\frac{1}{3}$. The worker has two possible types, $\\lambda_{1}=3$ and $\\lambda_{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$. The prior probabilities of these types are $q_{1}=1-\\epsilon$ and $q_{2}=\\epsilon$, respectively, where $\\epsilon>0$ is a sufficiently small constant.\n\nIn this example, the optimal menu consists of two tests: (1) a threshold test $t_{1}$ with the threshold $\\frac{1}{3}$, and (2) an interval test $t_{2}$ that indicates whether $\\theta \\in\\left(\\frac{5}{18}, \\frac{13}{18}\\right]$. If the worker chooses $t_{1}$, the manager proposes the plan if and only if $\\theta \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$; hence the plan is proposed with probability $p_{1}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and the posterior mean of $\\theta$ upon proposal is $\\mu_{1}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If the worker chooses $t_{2}$, the manager proposes the plan if and only if $\\theta \\in\\left(\\frac{5}{18}, \\frac{13}{18}\\right]$; hence the plan is proposed with probability $p_{2}=\\frac{4}{9}$, and the posterior mean of $\\theta$ upon proposal is $\\mu_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIt is not difficult to verify that it is incentive-compatible for a $\\lambda_{1}$-type worker to\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ In contrast, some other papers find that screening does not benefit the sender, such as Guo and Shmaya (2019) and Kolotilin et al. (2017).\n\nchoose $t_{1}$ and a $\\lambda_{2}$-type worker to choose $t_{2}$. Moreover, as long as $\\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, this test menu enables the manager to achieve the highest possible expected payoff, as the plan yields her a non-negative payoff if and only if $\\theta \\geq \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFor comparison, suppose the manager can offer only a single test in this example. Theorem 2 implies that the optimal single test is a threshold test. Hence, the manager may choose either the threshold 0 to induce both worker types to accept the proposal or the threshold $\\frac{1}{3}$ to serve only the high type. When $\\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, it is optimal to adopt the latter threshold, which exactly corresponds to the test $t_{1}$.\n\nWe conclude that in this example, the two-test menu outperforms the optimal single test. In particular, the addition of the interval test $t_{2}$ enables the plan to be launched, yielding the manager a positive payoff with some positive probability, when the worker has low capability.",

However, in many real-world situations, the manager (or the information acquirer in other contexts) determines the payment. In this section, we study a setting in which the manager chooses the payment $b$ at the beginning of the game. ${ }^{17}$ To simplify the analysis, we study only the case where the manager offers a single test.\n\nSince both lemmas in Section 4.1.1 continue to hold when the payment $b$ is endogenized, it is without loss of generality to restrict our attention to threshold tests. In other words, the manager's problem in this section is to jointly choose the payment\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ We could also allow $b$ to depend on the (reported) test result. However, such flexibility would not alter our findings, mainly because the manager could still misreport the test result; this means the optimal test would still need to be binary, with the payment made only if the proposal signal is realized.\n\n$b$ and the threshold $\\tilde{\\theta}$ to maximize her expected payoff,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]-b\\right) \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}\\left[\\lambda \\geq \\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]}{b}\\right] \\cdot \\operatorname{Pr}[\\theta \\geq \\tilde{\\theta}]\n$$\n\nProposition 1.

If the payment $b$ is fixed, then the manager will forgo some easy tasks, as they are not worthwhile to launch given the fixed payment. However, if the manager can choose $b$, then she can benefit from proposing the plan for more tasks while reducing the payment appropriately. In particular, by simultaneously reducing $b$ and $\\tilde{\\theta}$ in a calibrated way, she can increase the social surplus-as it is socially efficient for the worker to undertake the task (since he is more capable than the manager)\u2014while decreasing the worker's expected payoff.

      "text": "# 5.2 Multiple Workers \n\nIn many situations, a collective action requires the unanimous consent of more than two parties; therefore, the party that can acquire and communicate information needs to convince multiple other parties simultaneously. To study such situations using the manager-worker framework, we consider an alternative setting with multiple workers who are indexed by $i \\in \\mathcal{I}:=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$. Each worker $i$ 's capability $\\lambda_{i}$ follows a distribution $F_{i}(\\cdot)$. The plan is launched only when the manager proposes it and all\n\nthe workers accept it. If the plan is launched, worker $i$ 's payoff is $b_{i}-\\frac{\\theta}{\\lambda_{i}}$, and the manager's payoff is $n \\cdot \\theta-\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} b_{i}$.\n\nIn this setting, the key observation is that the worker $i$ for whom $\\lambda_{i} b_{i}$ is lowest, whom we call the pivotal worker, is the least likely to accept the manager's proposal. Formally speaking, as long as the pivotal worker accepts the proposal, the other workers will do so, too.\n\nIf the workers' types are publicly known, then the identity of the pivotal worker is also known, so the manager's problem boils down to persuading the pivotal worker. In particular, by our findings in Section 3, the plan can be launched if and only if the pivotal worker is ex-ante optimistic; moreover, if he is, then it is optimal for the manager to offer a threshold test with threshold $\\min \\left\\{\\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} b_{i}}{n}, \\tilde{\\theta}\\right\\}$, where $\\tilde{\\theta}$ satisfies $\\mathbf{E}[\\theta \\mid \\theta>\\tilde{\\theta}]=\\lambda_{i} b_{i}$.\n\nIf the workers' types are their private information, then the identity of the pivotal worker follows a certain distribution. Define the parameter $\\tilde{\\lambda}_{i}=\\lambda_{i} \\cdot \\frac{b_{i}}{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{I}} b_{j}}$, which we interpret as the normalized capability of worker $i$. The pivotal worker is the one with the lowest $\\tilde{\\lambda}_{i}$. Formally, we define the normalized capability of the pivotal worker as $\\tilde{\\lambda}_{\\text {pivotal }}:=\\min _{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} \\tilde{\\lambda}_{i}$; its distribution, denoted by $\\tilde{F}_{\\text {pivotal }}(\\cdot)$, is determined by the distributions $\\left\\{F_{i}(\\cdot)\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}$. The manager's problem, therefore, boils down to persuading a single worker whose type follows the distribution $\\tilde{F}_{\\text {pivotal }}(\\cdot)$.

Suppose the manager adopts a single test $t=(S, \\sigma)$ such that there are two signals $s^{\\prime}, s^{\\prime \\prime} \\in S$ under which she proposes the plan with positive probability. Let the posterior means induced by $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ be $\\mu^{\\prime}$ and $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}$, respectively. If $\\mu^{\\prime}=\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}$, we can combine $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ into a single signal without affecting the equilibrium outcome. If $\\mu^{\\prime}<\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}$, the manager will benefit from misreporting $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ as $s^{\\prime}$. This is because $s^{\\prime}$ will attract (weakly) more worker types to accept the proposal. Formally, let $\\Lambda^{\\#} \\subseteq \\Lambda$ be the set of worker types that accept the proposal upon seeing $s^{\\prime}$ but not $s^{\\prime \\prime}$. If $\\Lambda^{\\#}$ has zero measure, we can combine $s^{\\prime}$ and $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ into a single signal without affecting the players' equilibrium payoffs; if $\\Lambda^{\\#}$ has positive measure, then the manager will strictly benefit from misreporting $s^{\\prime \\prime}$ as $s^{\\prime}$.\n\nFinally, if there are multiple realizable signals under which the manager forgoes the plan, we can combine them into one signal without loss of generality.\n\nProof of Lemma 2. The paragraph following the statement of Lemma 2 explains the idea of the proof. Let $s$ and $s^{\\prime}$ respectively denote the proposal signal and the null signal in the non-threshold binary test, with $\\mu$ and $\\mu^{\\prime}$ denoting the posterior means they induce, and $p$ and $p^{\\prime}$ their probabilities of occurring. For the non-threshold test to be trustworthy, it must hold that $\\mu^{\\prime} \\leq b \\leq \\mu$.\n\nNow, for the threshold test constructed, we similarly define $\\left(\\tilde{\\mu}, \\tilde{\\mu}^{\\prime}, \\tilde{p}, \\tilde{p}^{\\prime}\\right)$.

Also, the worker's decision remains unchanged because $\\tilde{\\mu}=\\mu$.

The \"if\" part of Statement (a) is shown by construction. When $p \\leq 1-G\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$, it can be implemented with a binary test where $\\sigma(\\theta)=1$ with probability $\\frac{p}{1-G\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)}$ if $\\theta \\geq \\theta_{\\mu}$ and $\\sigma(\\theta)=1$ with probability 0 if $\\theta<\\theta_{\\mu}$.\n\nFor the \"only if\" part of Statement (a), suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a test $t$ that induces $(p, \\mu)$ for $p>1-G\\left(\\theta_{\\mu}\\right)$.

Suppose, in the optimal menu, the manager provides to a type- $\\lambda$ worker a binary test represented by $(p(\\lambda), \\mu(\\lambda))$. We denote a\n\ntype- $\\lambda$ worker's expected payoff from fully mimicking the behavior of a type- $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ worker (i.e., from choosing the test $\\left(p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right), \\mu\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)$ and deciding whether to accept the proposal in the same way as a type- $\\lambda^{\\prime}$ worker) by\n\n$$\nV\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)=b \\cdot p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)-\\frac{\\mu\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\nNow, we can formulate the manager's problem. In this formulation, the condition (IC-W) is necessary for the worker to report his type truthfully; (OB-M) (as explained above) ensures that the manager does not misreport; (OB-W) ensures that the worker will accept the plan if proposed; and the feasibility condition (FSB) arises from Lemma 3. ${ }^{20}$\n\nProblem (O). The manager's problem is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\max _{\\{p(\\lambda), \\mu(\\lambda)\\}_{\\lambda}} & \\mathbf{E}_{\\lambda}[p(\\lambda) \\cdot(\\mu(\\lambda)-b)] \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & V(\\lambda, \\lambda) \\geq V\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right), \\forall \\lambda^{\\prime} \\neq \\lambda \\\\\n& \\mu(\\lambda) \\geq \\max \\left\\{b, b+\\frac{\\mathbf{E}[\\theta]-b}{p(\\lambda)}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { if } p(\\lambda) \\in(0,1) \\\\\n& \\mu(\\lambda) \\leq \\lambda b, \\text { if } p(\\lambda)>0 \\\\\n& p(\\lambda) \\leq 1-G\\left(\\theta_{\\mu(\\lambda)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProblem (O) can be simplified considerably. First, by the standard envelope theorem argument (e.g., Milgrom and Segal, 2002), (IC-W) implies that $p(\\lambda)$ and $\\mu(\\lambda)$ are both weakly increasing in $\\lambda$. To see this, notice that the worker's expected payoff is equivalent to $\\hat{V}\\left(\\lambda, \\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)=\\lambda b \\cdot p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)-\\mu\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right) \\cdot p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nSecond, the following lemma says that it suffices to consider (OB-M) and (FSB)\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ As written, (IC-W) captures only one deviating strategy of the worker, which is to fully mimic the behavior of another type. Actually, since the worker's decision is binary, the conditions (IC-W) and (OB-W) combined completely account for all of his deviation strategies. In particular, the only deviation not captured by (IC-W) and (OB-W) is the double deviation in which he misreports his type and rejects the proposal. However, if this deviation is profitable, then it must also be profitable for him to reject the proposal after truthful reporting, which violates (OB-W).\n\nat certain values of $\\lambda$. If the plan is launched for some worker types, let $\\underline{\\lambda}:=$ $\\inf \\{\\lambda \\mid p(\\lambda)>0\\}$ and $\\bar{\\lambda}:=\\sup \\{\\lambda \\mid p(\\lambda)>0\\}$ denote the lowest and highest worker types such that the plan is launched with positive probability. ${ }^{21}$\n\nLemma 4. It suffices to consider (OB-M) at $\\lambda=\\underline{\\lambda}$ and (FSB) at $\\lambda=\\bar{\\lambda}$.\n\nProof. It is not difficult to see that the right-hand side of (OB-M) is weakly decreasing in $\\lambda$, and the left-hand side is weakly increasing in $\\lambda$. Hence, it suffices to consider (OB-M) at $\\lambda=\\underline{\\lambda}$. Similarly, the left-hand side of (FSB) is weakly increasing in $\\lambda$, and the right-hand side is weakly decreasing in $\\lambda$. So it suffices to consider (FSB) at $\\lambda=\\bar{\\lambda}$.\n\nThird, (OB-W) is implied by (IC-W) because the worker's interim utility must be non-negative.\n\nThe above arguments allow us to simplify Problem (O) as follows.\nProblem $(\\widehat{\\mathrm{O}})$. The manager's problem is equivalent to the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\max _{\\{p(\\lambda), \\mu(\\lambda)\\}_{\\lambda}} & \\mathbf{E}_{\\lambda}[p(\\lambda) \\cdot(\\mu(\\lambda)-b)] \\\\\n\\text { s.t. } & (\\mathrm{IC}-\\mathrm{W}),(\\mathrm{OB}-\\mathrm{M}) \\text { for } \\lambda=\\underline{\\lambda},(\\mathrm{FSB}) \\text { for } \\lambda=\\bar{\\lambda}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFixing the values of $p(\\underline{\\lambda})$ and $\\mu(\\underline{\\lambda})$ that satisfy (OB-M), we can see that (FSB) for $\\lambda=\\bar{\\lambda}$ is an integration constraint on $p(\\lambda)$; therefore, Problem $(\\widehat{\\mathrm{O}})$ is a linear optimization problem with a monotonicity constraint and an integration constraint on $p(\\lambda)$. By the extreme point argument in Nikzad (2022), the optimal solution includes up to three different values for $p(\\lambda)$ (in addition to the value $p\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}\\right)=0$ for $\\left.\\lambda^{\\prime}<\\underline{\\lambda}\\right)$.\n\nMoreover, in the optimal solution, (FSB) must bind for $\\lambda=\\bar{\\lambda}$. This is because otherwise the manager could increase $p(\\bar{\\lambda})$ and $p(\\bar{\\lambda}) \\cdot \\mu(\\bar{\\lambda})$ simultaneously so as to increase her expected payoff without violating any of the constraints in Problem ( $\\widehat{\\mathrm{O}}$ ).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ Note that $\\bar{\\lambda}$ is not necessarily $\\frac{1}{b}$, because the upper bound of the support of $F$ may not be $\\frac{1}{b}$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that in the optimal test menu, the corresponding $p(\\lambda)$ must be either (1) a step function that has at most three non-zero values and satisfies $p(\\bar{\\lambda})=1$, or (2) $p(\\lambda) \\equiv 0$. The former case can be implemented by a threshold test together with up to two interval tests. The latter case means that the plan is never launched; it corresponds to Part (2) of the theorem.",

      "text": "# B Online Appendix\n## B. 1 An Example of Optimal Menu with Three Tests\n\nConsider the following example. The state $\\theta$ is drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. The manager's payment to the worker if the plan is launched is $b=\\frac{1}{3}$. The worker has three possible types, $\\lambda_{1}=\\frac{15}{8}, \\lambda_{2}=\\frac{5}{2}$, and $\\lambda_{3}=3$. The prior probabilities of these types are $q_{1}=\\left(\\frac{95}{243}-\\delta\\right) \\cdot \\epsilon, q_{2}=\\left(\\frac{148}{243}+\\delta\\right) \\cdot \\epsilon$ and $q_{3}=1-\\epsilon$, where $\\delta>0$ and $\\epsilon>0$ are both sufficiently small constants.\n\nIn this example, the optimal menu consists of three tests: (1) $t_{1}$ is an interval test represented by $\\left(p_{1}=\\frac{4}{7}, \\mu_{1}=\\frac{5}{8}\\right)$; (2) $t_{2}$ is an interval test represented by $\\left(p_{2}=\\right.$ $\\left.\\frac{13}{21}, \\mu_{2}=\\frac{25}{39}\\right)$; and (3) $t_{3}$ is a threshold test with threshold $\\frac{1}{3}$, represented by $\\left(p_{3}=\\right.$ $\\left.\\frac{2}{3}, \\mu_{3}=\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$. We can verify that this test menu satisfies all the constraints in Problem $(O)$. Moreover, it is optimal when $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ are sufficiently small.\n\nThe intuition of why we need three tests in the optimal menu is as follows. First, when $\\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, the type distribution is concentrated around $\\lambda_{3}$. Hence, the optimal menu should mainly target $\\lambda_{3}$-type and offer $t_{3}$ as if it is the only type.\n\nSecond, for the two lower types, the idea is to design tests for them without violating the incentive constraint of the type $\\lambda_{3}$. The ratio of the probabilities $\\frac{q_{1}}{q_{2}}$ is set such that it is slightly better to offer a test with higher proposal probability for $\\lambda_{2}$ and lower proposal probability for $\\lambda_{1}$. Ideally, subjective to the worker's incentive constraint, the menu would offer $\\left(\\hat{p}_{1}=\\frac{8}{15}, \\hat{\\mu}_{1}=\\frac{5}{8}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\hat{p}_{2}=\\frac{13}{21}, \\hat{\\mu}_{2}=\\frac{19}{25}\\right)$ to the worker. However, this construction violates the manager's incentive. In particular, the manager benefits from misreporting under the test $\\left(\\hat{p}_{1}=\\frac{8}{15}, \\hat{\\mu}_{1}=\\frac{5}{8}\\right)$, because the posterior mean induced by the null signal is $\\frac{5}{14}>\\frac{1}{3}=b$.\n\nTo avoid misreporting, the manager has two options - she can either offer the three-test menu we mentioned above or remove the test option for the type $\\lambda_{1}$ (so that the $\\lambda_{1}$ does not receive any allocation). When $\\delta$ is sufficiently small, the former option provides a higher expected payoff to the manager and hence is optimal.",

  "abstract": "A manager facing a task of unknown difficulty can propose a plan to let a\nworker undertake the task; the worker can either accept the proposal or reject\nit. The plan benefits the worker only when the task is sufficiently easy and\nbenefits the manager only when it is sufficiently hard. The manager can conduct\na test at no cost to acquire information about the difficulty of the task;\nhowever, she can misreport the test result to the worker. We find that it is\noptimal for the manager to conduct a threshold test and to propose the plan\nonly when the difficulty of the task exceeds the threshold. Moreover, when the\nworker privately knows his capability, we find that the manager can benefit\nfrom screening the worker by offering up to two additional interval tests.",
