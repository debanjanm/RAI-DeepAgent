We study the dynamics of polynomial automorphisms of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, that is polynomial transformations of the ambient space $\\mathbf{C}^{3}$ that preserve $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ and are invertible there. A loxodromic automorphism $f$ is an automorphism with first dynamical degree $\\lambda_{1}>1$. Here the first dynamical degree is defined as follows. Let $X$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, that is a projective surface with an embedding $\\mathcal{M}_{D} \\hookrightarrow X$ as an open dense subset and let $H$ be an ample Cartier divisor on $X$, then\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(f):=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left(\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{*} H \\cdot H\\right)^{1 / n}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\cdot$ is the intersection product on divisors and $\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{*}$ is the pull back operator induced by $f^{n}$ on the N\u00e9ron-Severi group of $X$. One shows that this definition does not depend on the choice of $X$ nor $H$. Alternatively, it is known (see Theorem 4.2) that the topological entropy of $f$ is equal to $h_{\\text {top }}(f)=\\log \\lambda_{1}(f)$. Therefore, loxodromic automorphisms are the one with positive entropy.\n1.1. Unlikely intersections problem for special parameters. The main result of this paper is as follows.\n\nTheorem A. Let $D=0$ or $D=2-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)$ with $q \\in \\mathbf{Z}_{\\geqslant 2}$. If $f$ and $g$ are two loxodromic automorphisms of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, then the following statements are equivalent.\n(1) $\\operatorname{Per}(f) \\cap \\operatorname{Per}(g)$ is Zariski dense.\n(2) $\\operatorname{Per}(f)=\\operatorname{Per}(g)$.\n(3) $\\exists N, M \\in \\mathbf{Z} \\backslash\\{0\\}, f^{N}=g^{M}$.\n\nNotice that the implication $(3) \\Rightarrow(1)$ follows from [Xie15] which states in particular that any loxodromic automorphisms has a Zariski dense set of periodic points. This type of results are called unlikely intersection problems in the literature. The equivalence (1) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (2) of Theorem A was first established by Baker and DeMarco for endomorphisms of $\\mathbf{P}^{1}$ in [BD11] and for polarized endomorphisms of projective varieties in characteristic zero by Yuan and Zhang in [YZ17] and [YZ21]. The first instance of this result for non-projective varieties is due to Dujardin and Favre who showed Theorem A for H\u00e9non maps over a number field in [DF17]. It is believed that one could lower the hypothesis of the theorem requiring only $\\operatorname{Per}(f) \\cap \\operatorname{Per}(g)$ to be infinite (see [DF17, Theorem D and Conjecture 3]). In [CD20], Cantat and Dujardin showed a similar result for subgroups of automorphisms of projective surfaces: If $\\Gamma \\subset \\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is a large subgroup of automorphisms of a projective surface, then $\\Gamma$ cannot have a Zariski dense set of finite orbits unless $X$ is a Kummer example, that is the quotient of an abelian surface by a finite group.\n\nOur proof of Theorem A follows the ideas of the proof in [DF17]. However, the existence of the surface $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ shows that Theorem A cannot hold for any parameter $D$ (see $\\S 1.4$ and $\\S 1.5)$. Hence, the proof of [DF17] cannot work for the surfaces $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ without a new kind of argument. To finish the proof, we use the interpretation of the family of surfaces $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ given\n\nby the Character varieties of the punctured torus and results from hyperbolic geometry (see \u00a74).\n1.2. Green functions. Let $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be a loxodromic automorphism. One crucial step in the proof of Theorem A is the construction of the Green functions of $f$ (this is done in \u00a76). In fact we need to construct them over $\\mathbf{C}$ but also over non-archimedean fields. We stick to $\\mathbf{C}$ for this introduction.\n\nWe have that $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C}) \\subset \\mathbf{C}^{3}$, the Green functions $G_{f}^{+}, G_{f}^{-}$are defined as follows\n\n$$\nG_{f}^{ \\pm}(p)=\\lim _{n} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}(f)^{n}} \\log ^{+}\\left(\\left\\|f^{ \\pm n}(p)\\right\\|\\right)\n$$\n\nWe have the following properties (see [BS91b]).\n(1) $G_{f}^{+}$is well defined, continuous, nonnegative and plurisubharmonic over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$,\n(2) $G_{f}^{+} \\circ f=\\lambda_{1}(f) G_{f}^{+}$,\n(3) $G_{f}^{+}(p)=0$ if and only if the forward orbit $\\left(f^{N}(p)\\right)_{N \\geqslant 0}$ is bounded.\n\nThe function $G_{f}^{-}$satisfies similar properties. We define the Green currents $T_{f}^{+}=d d^{c} G_{f}^{+}$and $T_{f}^{-}=d d^{c} G_{f}^{-}$. These are positive closed $(1,1)$-currents over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ and the measure\n\n$$\n\\mu_{f}:=T_{f}^{+} \\wedge T_{f}^{-}\n$$\n\nis well defined. It is of finite mass, thus we can suppose that it is a probability measure. We call it the equilibrium measure of $f$. It is $f$-invariant and its support is called the Julia set of $f$. It is contained in the generalised Julia set of $f$ which is the compact $f$-invariant subset $\\left\\{G_{f}^{+}=G_{f}^{-}=0\\right\\}$. The construction is explained for example in [Can09] and [Gir14].\n1.3. Arithmetic equidistribution. If $D$ is algebraic, the construction of the Green functions of $f$ can be done over any complete field $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$ such that $\\mathbf{Q}(D) \\hookrightarrow \\mathbf{K}_{v}$. This defines an adelic divisor over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ (see $\\S 2$ ) in the sense of [YZ23]. Yuan and Zhang's arithmetic equidistribution theorem from loc.cit states that the Galois orbits of any generic sequence of periodic points equidistributes with respect to $\\mu_{v}$. This will imply that if $f$ and $g$ share a Zariski dense set of periodic points, then they have the same equilibrium measure over any complete algebraically closed field.\n\nThe last part of the proof uses Representation theory to show that over $\\mathbf{C}$ every saddle periodic point is in the support of $\\mu_{f}$ and one can construct a specific saddle fixed point $q(f) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ that must have a non-compact orbit under $g$ if $f$ and $g$ do not share a commmon iterate.\n\n1.4. The Picard parameter $D=4$. The parameter $D=4$ is very special because of the following. There is a $2: 1$ cover of $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ by the algebraic torus $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}=\\mathbf{C}^{\\times} \\times \\mathbf{C}^{\\times}$given by\n\n$$\n\\eta:(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2} \\mapsto\\left(u+\\frac{1}{u}, v+\\frac{1}{v}, u v+\\frac{1}{u v}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{4}\n$$\n\nIf $\\sigma$ is the involution on $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}$ given by $\\sigma(u, v)=\\left(u^{-1}, v^{-1}\\right)$, then $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ is the quotient $\\eta$ is the quotient map. The action of the automorphism group is very explicit for the Picard parameter $D=4$. Indeed, $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ acts on $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}$ by monomial transformations:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{array}\\right) \\cdot(u, v)=\\left(u^{a} v^{b}, u^{c} v^{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe have that $\\sigma$ corresponds to the action of the matrix - id and $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z}) /\\langle\\sigma\\rangle=\\mathrm{PGL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ acts on $\\mathcal{M}_{4}=\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2} /\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$. Up to finite index, all the automorphisms of $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ are of this form (see Theorem 4.2). Thus, all dynamical problems on $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ can be lifted to $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}$. The parameter $D=4$ is the only one where $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ is a finite equivariant quotient of $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}$. Theorem A cannot hold for the parameter $D=4$. Indeed, for every monomial transformation $M$ of $\\mathbb{G}_{m}^{2}$, the periodic points are given by $(\\mu, \\omega)$ where $\\mu, \\omega$ are roots of unity, the Julia set of $M$ is $\\mathbb{S}^{1} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{1}$ and the equilibrium measure is the Lebesgue measure on the Julia set. Thus, when looking at the quotient, we have that every loxodromic monomial automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ have the same equilibrium measure, the same Julia set and the same periodic points.\n1.5. For a general parameter. We conjecture that for every $D \\neq 4$ Theorem A holds. This is the affine counterpart to the Kummer example appearing in the result of Cantat and Dujardin. Using a specialization argument, we show the following result that goes in the direction of this conjecture.\n\nTheorem B. Let $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ be transcendental and let $f, g \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be loxodromic automorphisms. The following assertions are equivalent:\n(1) $\\operatorname{Per}(f)=\\operatorname{Per}(g)$.\n(2) $\\exists N, M \\in \\mathbf{Z}, f^{N}=g^{M}$.\n1.6. Plan of the paper. The proof of Theorem A is split into three parts. In the first part, we construct the Green functions, Green currents and the equilibrium measure of any loxodromic automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ with $D$ algebraic at both archimedean and non-archimedean places. We then apply Yuan-Zhang arithmetic equidistribution theorem from [YZ23] to show that two loxodromic automorphisms of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ sharing a Zariski dense set of periodic points must have the same equilibrium measure at every place.\n\nThe second part is to apply the method of Bedford, Lyubich and Smillie in [BLS93] to show that in $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ every saddle periodic point of a loxodromic automorphism is in the support of the equilibrium measure. We use the theory of laminar and strongly approximable currents from [Duj05] and apply techniques from [Duj04].\n\nThe third part is to construct a \"special\" saddle periodic point $q(f)$ which has the following property: the orbit of $q(f)$ under any loxodromic automorphism $g$ that does not share a common iterate with $f$ is unbounded. To construct $q(f)$ we use the theory of quasi-Fuchsian representation, the simultaneous uniformization theorem of Bers and Thurston's hyperbolisation theorem for 3-fold fibering over a circle (see [McM96]). This third part is where the hypothesis on the parameter $D$ is used. The specific values of $D$ give an interpretation of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ as representation of the fundamental group of the punctured torus $(D=0)$ or of an orbifold obtained from a genus 1 torus with a singular point of index $q\\left(D=2-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nAcknowledgments.

Weil and Cartier divisors. Let $R$ be a Noetherian integral domain, a variety over $R$ is a normal flat integral scheme of finite type over $\\operatorname{Spec} R$.\n\nLet $X$ be a variety over $R$, a Cartier divisor is a global section of the sheaf $\\mathcal{K}_{X}^{\\times} / \\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\\times}$where $\\mathcal{K}_{X}$ is the sheaf of rational functions over $X$ and $\\mathcal{O}_{X}$ the sheaf of regular functions. Let $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{R}$, an $\\mathbf{A}$-Cartier divisor is an element of the form $D=\\sum_{i} a_{i} D_{i}$ where $a_{i} \\in A$ and $D_{i}$ is a Cartier divisor. An A-Weil divisor over $X$ is a formal sum of irreducible codimension 1 subvarieties with coefficients in $\\mathbf{A}$. An $\\mathbf{A}$-Weil divisor $D=\\sum_{i} a_{i} E_{i}$ is said to be effective if $a_{i} \\geqslant 0$ for every $i$. When $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{Z}$ we will drop the notation $\\mathbf{Z}$-Cartier or Weil divisors and just call them Cartier and Weil divisors.\n\nIf $X$ is a variety over $R$, then since $X$ is normal by definition, it is regular in codimension 1 since $R$ is Noetherian. Thus, any Cartier divisor induces a unique Weil divisor over $X$, see for example [Har77, Corollary II.6.14]. If $X$ is regular, then the converse is true, every Weil divisor induces a unique Cartier divisor ([Har77, Proposition II.6.11]). Recall also that since our varieties are normal, they are regular outside a subset of codimension 2 ([Har77, Theorem I.6.2A]).\n2.2. Berkovich spaces. For a general reference on Berkovich spaces, we refer to [Ber12]. Let $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$ be a complete field with respect to an absolute value $|\\cdot|_{v}$. Let $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}=\\operatorname{Spec} A$ be an affine $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$-variety, the Berkovich analytification $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ of $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$ is the set of multiplicative seminorms\n\nover $A$ that extends $|\\cdot|_{v}$. It is a locally ringed space with a contraction map\n\n$$\nc: X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\n$$\n\ndefined as follows. If $x \\in X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$, then\n\n$$\nc(x)=\\operatorname{ker}(x)=\\left\\{a \\in A:|a|_{x}=0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $|\\cdot|_{x}$ is the seminorm associated to $x$. The topology on $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is the coarsest topology such that for every $\\phi \\in A$ the evaluation map $x \\hookrightarrow|\\phi|_{x} \\in \\mathbf{R}$ is continuous. If $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$ is a $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$-variety then $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is defined by a gluing process using affine charts and we have the contraction map $c: X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$. In particular, if $\\phi \\in \\mathbf{K}_{v}\\left(X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\right)$ is a rational function with Weil divisor $\\operatorname{div}(\\phi)$, for $x \\in X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash(\\operatorname{Supp} \\operatorname{div} \\phi)_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$, we define $|\\phi(x)|:=\\left|c^{*} \\phi\\right|_{x}$. If $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$ is proper (e.g projective), then $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is compact. If $p \\in X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\left(\\mathbf{K}_{v}\\right)$ is a closed point, then the fiber $c^{-1}(p)$ consists of a single point $|\\cdot|_{p}$ defined by\n\n$$\n|a|_{p}=|a(p)|_{v}\n$$\n\nwhere $a(p)=a \\bmod p$. This uses the fact that the local field at $p$ is $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$. We thus have an embedding\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{l}_{0}=c^{-1}: X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\left(\\mathbf{K}_{v}\\right) \\hookrightarrow X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nand we also write $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\left(\\mathbf{K}_{v}\\right)$ for its image. With an analog construction, one can show that there is a map $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}_{v}\\right) \\rightarrow X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\text {an }}$ which is not injective: two points have the same image if they are in the same Galois orbit. We still write $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}_{v}\\right)$ for its image in $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$. If $\\phi: X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}} \\rightarrow Y_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$ is a morphism of varieties, then there exists a unique morphism\n\n$$\n\\phi^{\\mathrm{an}}: X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow Y_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nsuch that the diagram\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\ncommutes. In particular, if $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}} \\subset Y_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}$, then $X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is isomorphic to $c_{Y}^{-1}\\left(X_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}\\right) \\subset Y_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\n2.3. Places and restricted analytic spaces. Let $\\mathbf{K}$ be a number field. A place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$ is an equivalence class of absolute values over $\\mathbf{K}$. If $v$ is archimedean then there is an embedding $\\sigma: \\mathbf{K} \\hookrightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ such that any absolute value representing $v$ is of the form $|x|=|\\sigma(x)|_{\\mathbf{C}}^{t}$ with $0<t \\leqslant 1$. In that case we will write $|\\cdot|_{v}$ for the absolute value with $t=1$ and we write $\\mathbf{C}_{v}=\\mathbf{C}$. If $v$ is non-archimedean (we also say that $v$ is finite), then it lies over a prime $p$ and we write $|\\cdot|_{v}$ for the absolute value of $\\mathbf{K}$ representing $v$ such that $|p|_{v}=\\frac{1}{p}$. Every finite place $v$ is of the form\n\n$$\nv(P)=\\#\\left(O_{\\mathbf{K}} / \\mathrm{m}\\right)^{-\\operatorname{ord}_{\\mathrm{m}}(P)}\n$$\n\nfor $P \\in \\mathbf{K}$ where m is a maximal ideal of $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$, the ring of integers of $\\mathbf{K}$. We write $\\mathbf{K}_{v}$ be the completion of $\\mathbf{K}$ with respect to $|\\cdot|_{v}$. We write $M(\\mathbf{K})$ for the set of places of $\\mathbf{K}$. If $V \\subset M(\\mathbf{K})$, we write $V[\\mathrm{f}]$ for the subset of finite places in $V$ and $V[\\infty]$ for the archimedean ones.\n\nIf $v$ is archimedean, then define $O_{v}=\\mathbf{C}_{v}$. If $v$ is non-archimedean, we define $O_{v}$ as the ring of elements of absolute values $\\leqslant 1$ and $\\kappa_{v}$ as the residue field\n\n$$\n\\kappa_{v}:=O_{v} / \\mathrm{m}_{v}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{m}_{v}$ is the maximal ideal of elements of absolute value $<1$. In our setting, the nonarchimedean absolute values are always discretly valued and therefore $O_{v}$ is Noetherian.\n\nLet $X$ be a variety over $\\mathbf{K}$. For every place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$, define $X_{v}:=X \\times_{\\mathbf{K}} \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbf{K}_{v}$. Similarly, if $D$ is an $\\mathbf{R}$-Cartier divisor over $X$ then we denote by $D_{v}$ its image under the base change. We write $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ for the Berkovich analytification of $X_{v}$. We also define the global Berkovich analytification of $X$ as\n\n$$\nX^{\\mathrm{an}}:=\\bigsqcup_{v} X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nComparing to [YZ23], this space is called the restricted analytic space of $X$ by Yuan and Zhang. If $V$ is a set of places, we also define\n\n$$\nX_{V}^{\\mathrm{an}}:=\\bigsqcup_{v \\in V} X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we define\n\n$$\nX^{\\mathrm{an}}[\\mathrm{f}]:=\\bigsqcup_{v \\in M(\\mathbf{K})[\\mathrm{f}]} X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}, \\quad X^{\\mathrm{an}}[\\infty]:=\\bigsqcup_{v \\in M(\\mathbf{K})[\\infty]} X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}\n$$\n\nIf $\\mathscr{X}$ is a variety over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$, we write $\\mathscr{X}_{v}$ for the base change\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{X}_{v}=\\mathscr{X} \\times_{O_{\\mathbf{K}}} \\operatorname{Spec} O_{v}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, if $\\mathscr{D}$ is an $\\mathbf{R}$-Cartier divisor over $\\mathscr{X}$, we denote by $\\mathscr{D}_{v}$ its image under the base change.\n2.4. Adelic divisors over a projective variety. Recall the notions of A-Cartier and Weil divisors from $\\S 2.1$.\n\nModels, horizontal and vertical divisors. If $D=\\sum_{i} a_{i} D_{i}$ is an $\\mathbf{R}$-Cartier divisor on $X$, a model of $(X, D)$ is the data of $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})$ where $\\mathscr{X}$ is a normal projective variety over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ with generic fiber $X$ and $\\mathscr{D}=\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\mathscr{D}_{i}$ is an $\\mathbf{R}$-Cartier divisor on $\\mathscr{X}$ such that $\\mathscr{D}_{i \\mid X}=D_{i}$.\n\nThere are two types of $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisors on a projective variety $\\mathscr{X}$ over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ : horizontal divisors whose irreducible components are the closure of prime divisors over the generic fiber and vertical divisors whose irreducible components do not intersect the generic fiber. Every $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor $\\mathscr{W}$ over $\\mathscr{X}$ can be uniquely split into a sum $\\mathscr{W}=W_{\\text {hor }}+\\mathscr{W}_{\\text {vert }}$ of a horizontal divisor and a vertical one. In particular, $W_{\\text {hor }}:=\\mathscr{W}_{\\mid X}$ is the restriction of $\\mathscr{W}$ to the generic fiber.\n\nLet $V \\subset O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ we say that $\\mathscr{D}$ is horizontal over $V$ if the Weil divisor over $\\mathscr{X}_{V}$ defined by $\\mathscr{D}_{V}$ is horizontal. In that case we will write $\\mathscr{D}_{V}=D_{V}$ for the Cartier divisor $\\mathscr{D}_{V}$ over $\\mathscr{X}_{V}$.\n\nGreen functions. A Green function of an R-Cartier divisor $D$ is a continuous function $g$ : $X^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash(\\operatorname{Supp} D)^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ such that for any point $p \\in(\\operatorname{Supp} D)^{\\mathrm{an}}$, if $z_{i}$ is a local equation of $D_{i}$ at $p$ then the function\n\n$$\ng+\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\log \\left|z_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nextends locally to a continuous function at $p$. For any place $v \\in M(\\mathbf{K})$, we write $g_{v}$ for $g_{\\mid X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}}$, $g[\\mathrm{f}]=g_{\\mid X^{\\mathrm{an}}[\\mathrm{f}]}$ and $g[\\infty]=g_{X^{\\mathrm{an}}[\\infty]}$. For the archimedean places $v$ we add the extra condition that $g_{v}$ must be invariant under complex conjugation. That is if $\\bar{v}$ is the conjugate place of $v$, then $g_{\\bar{v}}(z)=g_{v}(\\bar{z})$ for $z \\in X(\\mathbf{C})$. Notice that compared to [Mor16], our definition of Green functions differs by a factor 2 .\n\nIf $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})$ is a model of $(X, D)$, then for every finite place $v,(\\mathscr{X}_{v}, \\mathscr{D}_{v})$ induces a Green function of $D_{v}$ over $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ as follows. We have the anticontinuous reduction map (see [Ber12])\n\n$$\nr_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}: X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\rightarrow\\left(\\mathscr{X}_{v}\\right)_{\\kappa_{v}}\n$$\n\nLet $x \\in X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash(\\operatorname{Supp} D)_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$, and let $z_{i}$ be a local equation of $\\mathscr{D}_{i, v}$ at $r_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}(x)$, we define\n\n$$\ng_{\\left(\\mathscr{X}_{v}, \\mathscr{D}_{v}\\right)}(x):=-\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\log \\left|z_{i}(x)\\right|\n$$\n\nIt does not depend on the choice of the local equations $z_{i}$ because an invertible regular function $\\phi$ at $r_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}(x)$ satisfies $|\\phi(x)|=1$ (recall that here $v$ is non-archimedean).\n\nDivisorial points. Let $v$ be a finite place of $\\mathbf{K}$. Let $\\mathscr{X}_{v}$ be a projective variety over $\\mathcal{O}_{v}$ with $X_{v}=\\mathscr{X}_{v} \\times_{O_{v}} \\mathbf{K}_{v}$. The special fiber $\\mathscr{X}_{v} \\times_{O_{v}} \\kappa(v)$ has finitely many irreducible components $E_{1}, \\ldots, E_{r}$. There exists a unique point $x_{i} \\in X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ such that $r_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}\\left(x_{i}\\right)$ is the generic point of $E_{i}$. Any point in $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ that arises like this is called a divisorial point.\n\nProposition 2.1 ([MN15, 2.4.9]). The set of divisorial points is dense in $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$.\nIf $v$ is a finite place of $\\mathbf{K}$, then it is discretely valued and $\\mathcal{O}_{v}$ is Noetherian. In that case, the local ring of the generic point of an irreducible component $E_{i}$ is a Noetherian regular local ring of dimension 1, hence a discrete valuation ring. Let $\\operatorname{ord}_{E_{i}}$ be the associated valuation, then the point $x_{i}$ corresponds the seminorm given by $e^{-\\operatorname{ord}_{E_{i}}}$. The proof of Proposition 2.1 implies the following.\n\nCorollary 2.2. Let $x \\in X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ and let $\\mathscr{X}_{v}$ be a model of $X_{v}$ over $\\mathcal{O}_{v}$. Define the following sequence of models: $\\mathscr{X}_{0}=\\mathscr{X}_{v}$ and $\\mathscr{X}_{n+1}$ is the normalised blow up of $\\mathscr{X}_{n}$ along $\\overline{r_{\\mathscr{X}_{n}}(x)}$ and $E_{n+1}$ is the exceptional divisor (the one that is sent dominantly to $\\overline{r_{\\mathscr{X}_{n}}(x)}$ ). Let $x_{n}$ be the divisorial point associated to $E_{n}$, then the sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ converges to $x$.\n\nAdelic divisors. An adelic divisor $\\bar{D}$ on $X$ is the data of $\\bar{D}=(D, g)$ where $D$ is an $\\mathbf{R}$-divisor on $X$ and $g$ is a continuous Green function of $D$ over $X^{\\text {an }}$ such that\n(i) There exists an open subset $V \\subset \\operatorname{Spec} O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ and a model $\\left(\\mathscr{X}_{V}, \\mathscr{D}_{V}\\right)$ of $(X, D)$ over $V$ such that for every finite place $v$ lying over $V$,\n\n$$\ng_{v}=g_{\\left(\\mathscr{X}_{v}, \\mathscr{D}_{v}\\right)} .\n$$\n\n(ii) For any finite place not lying over $V$ and all the archimedean ones, the Green function $g_{v}$ is the uniform limit of model Green functions of $D$ over $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$.\nA model adelic divisor on $X$ is an adelic divisor $(D, g)$ on $X$ such that $g[\\mathrm{f}]$ is induced by a model $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})$. It is vertical if $\\mathscr{D}$ is vertical, in particular $D=0$.\n\nDefinition 2.3. Following [Zha93],\n(i) A model adelic divisor $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})$ is semipositive if $g[\\infty]$ is plurisubharmonic (psh) and $\\mathscr{D}$ is nef over $\\mathscr{X}$.\n(ii) An adelic divisor $\\bar{D}=(D, g)$ is semipositive if $g$ is the uniform limit of semipositive models of $(X, D)$.\n(iii) An adelic divisor is integrable if it is the difference of two semipositive adelic divisors.\n(iv) An adelic divisor $\\bar{D}=(D, g)$ is effective if $g \\geqslant 0$. In particular this implies that $D$ is an effective divisor.\n\nWe write $\\bar{D} \\geqslant \\bar{D}^{\\prime}$ if $\\bar{D}-\\bar{D}^{\\prime}$ is effective. We say that $\\bar{D}$ is strictly effective if $\\bar{D} \\geqslant 0$ and $g[\\infty]>0$.\n\nLemma 2.4. Every ample effective Cartier divisor $H$ on $X$ admits a strictly effective semipositive model.\n\nProof. Let $\\mathfrak{t}: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{K}}^{N}$ be a projective embedding such that $H=\\left\\{T_{0}=0\\right\\} \\cap \\mathfrak{t}(X)$ where $T_{0}, \\cdots, T_{N}$ are the homogeneous coordinates of $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{K}}^{N}$. We can find a model $\\mathscr{X}$ such that $\\mathfrak{t}$ extends to a regular map\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{t}: \\mathscr{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathfrak{C}_{\\mathbf{K}}}^{N}\n$$\n\nthen the Cartier divisor $\\mathscr{D}=\\mathfrak{t}^{*}\\left\\{T_{0}=0\\right\\}$ is a model of $H$ and a nef Cartier divisor over $\\mathscr{X}$ (Here $T_{0}$ is a homogeneous coordinate of $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathbf{K}}}^{N}$ ). For every archimedean place $v, g_{v}$ is given by\n\n$$\ng_{v}(p)=1+\\log ^{+} \\max \\left(\\left|t_{1}(p)\\right|, \\cdots,\\left|t_{N}(p)\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $t_{i}:=\\frac{T_{i}}{T_{0}}$. This is (one plus) the pull back of the Weil metric over $\\mathbf{P}^{N}$ (see e.g [Chal1]).\nProposition 2.5 (Lemma 3.3.3 of [YZ23]). If $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}=(D, g)$ is a model adelic divisor, then $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ is effective if and only if $g[\\infty] \\geqslant 0$ and $\\mathscr{D}$ is effective as an $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor.\n\nProof. This is shown in [YZ23] only when $\\mathscr{D}$ is a $\\mathbf{Q}$-Cartier divisor. Let $\\mathscr{X}$ be a model of $X$ over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ where $\\mathscr{D}$ is defined. First of all if $g[\\infty] \\geqslant 0$, then it is clear that $D=\\mathscr{D}_{\\text {hor }}$ is an effective $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor. Indeed, if $D=\\sum_{i} a_{i} E_{i}$ with $a_{i} \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $E_{i}$ are distinct irreducible codimension 1 subvarieties of $X$, then at a general point of $E_{i}$ we have that $g[\\infty]=-a_{i} \\log \\left|z_{i}\\right|+h$ where $z_{i}$ is a local equation of $E_{i}$ (since our varieties are normal, they are regular outside a set of codimension 2 so $E_{i}$ defines a Cartier divisor at a general point) and $h$ is continous. Since $g[\\infty] \\geqslant 0$ this shows that $a_{i} \\geqslant 0$.\n\nAssume that $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ is effective. We have that $g[\\infty] \\geqslant 0$ and that $\\mathscr{D}_{\\text {hor }}$ is an effective $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor. We now show that $\\mathscr{D}_{\\text {vert }}$ is an effective $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor. Let $E \\subset \\mathscr{X}$ be a vertical irreducible component of codimension 1 and let $v \\in \\operatorname{Spec} O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ be the place such that $E$ lies over $v$. Then, by $\\S 2.4$, there exists $x_{E} \\in X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ such that $r_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}\\left(x_{E}\\right)=\\eta_{E}$ the generic point of $E$ and $x_{E}$ is given by the seminorm $e^{-\\operatorname{ord}_{E}}$. Write $\\mathscr{D}=\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\mathscr{D}_{i}$ where $a_{i} \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathscr{D}_{i}$ are Cartier divisors with local equations $z_{i}$ at $\\eta_{E}$. We have,\n\n$$\n0 \\leqslant g\\left(x_{E}\\right)=-\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\log \\left|z_{i}\\left(x_{E}\\right)\\right|=\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\operatorname{ord}_{E}\\left(\\mathscr{D}_{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{ord}_{E}(\\mathscr{D})\n$$\n\nThis shows one implication.\nConversely, if $g[\\infty] \\geqslant 0$ and $\\mathscr{D}$ is an effective $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor, then this implies that $\\mathscr{D}_{\\text {vert }}$ is a vertical effective $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor. This implies that for any finite place $v$ and for any divisorial point $x_{E} \\in X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ we have $g\\left(x_{E}\\right)=\\operatorname{ord}_{E}(\\mathscr{D}) \\geqslant 0$. Since the divisorial points are dense by Proposition 2.1 we get that $g[\\mathrm{f}] \\geqslant 0$.\n\nA corollary of the proof is the following.\nCorollary 2.6. Let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ be a model adelic divisor and $\\mathscr{X}$ a model where $\\mathscr{D}$ is defined. Let $v$ be a finite place of $\\mathbf{K}$ and let $x \\in X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$. If $r_{\\mathscr{X}_{v}}(x)$ is not in the support of the $\\mathbf{R}$-Weil divisor $\\mathscr{D}_{v}$, then $g_{(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})}(x)=0$.\n\nProof. Let $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ be the sequence associated to $x$ defined in Corollary 2.2. Since $r_{\\mathscr{X}}(x)$ is not in the support of $\\mathscr{D}$ we have that for every $n, g_{(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})}\\left(x_{n}\\right)=0$ since for every vertical irreducible divisor $E_{n}, \\mathscr{D}$ has no support over $E_{n}$. Since $x_{n} \\rightarrow x$ we have the result.\n\nRemark 2.7. In [DF17], the authors used the theory of adelic divisors over $\\mathbf{P}^{2}$. Their approach was two construct Green functions $G^{+}, G^{-}$which are Green functions of the line at infinity except at one point and to use the following trick: The Green function $G=$ $\\max \\left(G^{+}, G^{-}\\right)$is a Green function of the line at infinity over $\\mathbf{P}^{2}$. This works because $\\mathbf{P}^{2} \\backslash \\mathbf{A}^{2}$ has only one irreducible component. In our setting, using adelic divisors over a projective variety will not be enough because the compactifications of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ have several components at infinity. In general if $\\bar{D}_{1}, \\bar{D}_{2}$ are adelic divisors with Green functions $g_{1}, g_{2}$ respectively, then $\\max \\left(g_{1}, g_{2}\\right)$ is not the Green function of any $\\mathbf{R}$-Cartier divisor. Indeed, suppose for example that $D_{1}=E$ and $D_{2}=F$ are irreducible divisors that intersect simply and normally. That means that for any point $p \\in E \\cap F, E \\cup F$ is locally given by the equation $x y=0$ where $x$\n\nis a local equation of $E$ and $y$ is the local equation of $F$. Then, $g=\\max \\left(g_{1}, g_{2}\\right)$ should be the Green function of a Cartier divisor $D$ supported on $E \\cup F$. But if we're approaching $p$ by staying very close to the axis $x=0$, then we get that $g \\simeq \\log |x|$ at $p$ so $D=E$. But the same argument with respect to the axis $y=0$ shows that $D=F$ and this is a contradiction. This explains why we have to use the theory of Yuan and Zhang over quasiprojective varieties.\n2.5. Over quasiprojective varieties. The main reference for this section is [YZ23]. Let $U$ be a normal quasiprojective variety over a number field $\\mathbf{K}$. A quasiprojective model $\\mathscr{U}$ of $U$ is a quasiprojective variety $\\mathscr{U}$ over $\\operatorname{Spec} O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ with generic fiber isomorphic to $U$. A projective model of $\\mathscr{U}$ is a projective variety $\\mathscr{X}$ over $\\operatorname{Spec} O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ with an open embedding $\\mathscr{U} \\hookrightarrow \\mathscr{X}$.\n\nA model adelic divisor on $\\mathscr{U}$ is a model adelic divisor defined over a projective model of $\\mathscr{U}$. If $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ is a model adelic divisor on some projective model $\\mathscr{X}$ of $\\mathscr{U}$. We say that $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ is supported at infinity if $\\left(\\mathscr{D}_{\\text {hor }}\\right)_{\\mid U}=0$. We write $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{U})$ for the set of model adelic divisor supported at infinity induced by a fixed projective model $\\mathscr{X}$ of $\\mathscr{U}$. Since the system of projective models of $U$ is a projective system, we can define the direct limit\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})_{\\bmod }:=\\underset{\\mathscr{X}}{\\lim } \\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{U})\n$$\n\nOur definition differs from [YZ23] because we only take divisors supported outside $U$. This makes sense for our dynamical setting.\n\nA boundary divisor on $\\mathscr{U}$ is a strictly effective model adelic divisor $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}=\\left(\\mathscr{D}_{0}, g_{0}\\right)$ over a projective model $\\mathscr{X}_{0}$ of $\\mathscr{U}$ such that $\\operatorname{Supp} \\mathscr{D}_{0}=\\mathscr{X}_{0} \\backslash \\mathscr{U}$. It defines a norm on $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})_{\\text {mod }}$ given by\n\n$$\n\\|\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}\\|=\\inf \\left\\{\\varepsilon>0:-\\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0} \\leqslant \\overline{\\mathscr{D}} \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAn adelic divisor $\\bar{D}$ on $\\mathscr{U}$ is an element of the compactification of $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})_{\\text {mod }}$ with respect to this norm. More precisely, an adelic divisor on $\\mathscr{U}$ is a sequence of model adelic divisors $\\left(\\mathscr{X}_{i}, \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i}\\right)$ such that there exists a sequence $\\varepsilon_{i}>0, \\varepsilon_{i} \\rightarrow 0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\forall j \\geqslant i, \\quad-\\varepsilon_{i} \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0} \\leqslant \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{j}-\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i} \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{i} \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}\n$$\n\nIf we denote by $g_{i}$ the Green function of the model adelic divisor $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i}$, then this is equivalent to asking that\n\n$$\n-\\varepsilon_{i} g_{0} \\leqslant g_{j}-g_{i} \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{i} g_{0}\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\left(g_{i}\\right)$ converges uniformly locally to a continuous function $g$ over $U^{\\text {an }}$. We call it the Green function of $\\bar{D}$. We write $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})$ for the compactification of $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})$ with respect to this norm. An adelic divisor on $U$ is an element of\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(U / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right):=\\underset{\\mathscr{U}}{\\lim } \\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})\n$$\n\nRemark 2.8. In [YZ23] Yuan and Zhang use only Q-model divisors for the definition of $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{U})$ and $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}(\\mathscr{U})$ whereas here we also allow $\\mathbf{R}$-model adelic divisors. If one\n\nwants to use adelic line bundles instead of adelic divisors and in particular the global section of line bundles then it make sense to use only $\\mathbf{Q}$-line bundles in the limit process defining adelic line bundles with the boundary topology but we do not need that here. Anyway, for adelic divisors, using $\\mathbf{R}$-model divisors provides the same final space thanks to the following lemma.\n\nLemma 2.9. Let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ be a model $\\mathbf{R}$-adelic divisor supported at infinity and let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}$ be a boundary divisor. Then for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\\mathbf{Q}$-model divisor $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{\\varepsilon}$ such that\n\n$$\n-\\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0} \\leqslant \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}-\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{\\varepsilon} \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\mathscr{X}$ be a model over $\\operatorname{Spec} \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{K}}$ such that $\\mathscr{D}, \\mathscr{D}_{0}$ are defined. Write $\\mathscr{D}=\\sum_{i} a_{i} \\mathscr{D}_{i}$ where $a_{i} \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathscr{D}_{i}$ are Cartier divisors over $\\mathscr{X}$. By Proposition 2.5, if $a_{i, n}$ is a sequence of rational numbers converging to $a_{i}$, then the Green function of the model divisor $\\mathscr{D}_{n}:=$ $\\sum_{i} a_{i, n} \\mathscr{D}_{i}$ converges towards the Green function of $\\mathscr{D}$ with respect to the boundary topology over every non-archimedean place. We just need to construct the Green function of $\\mathscr{D}_{n}$ at the archimedean places. Fix an archimedean place $v$, and let $g: U(\\mathbf{C}) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ be the Green function of $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ over $v$. Let $D_{1}, \\cdots, D_{r}$ be the restrictions of $\\mathscr{D}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathscr{D}_{r}$ to $X$ and let $g_{i}$ be a Green function of $D_{i}$ over $U(\\mathbf{C})$ then $g-\\sum_{i} a_{i} g_{i}=h$ is a continuous bounded function over $U(\\mathbf{C})$. We can suppose without loss of generality that $a_{1} \\neq 0$ and we replace $g_{1}$ by $g_{1}+\\frac{1}{a_{1}} h$ such that\n\n$$\ng=\\sum_{i} a_{i} g_{i}\n$$\n\nNow, let $A>0$ such that for all $i, \\sup _{U(\\mathbf{C})}\\left|\\frac{g_{i}}{g_{0}}\\right| \\leqslant A$ and let $a_{i, n}$ be a sequence of rational numbers converging towards $a_{i}$, then\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{g-\\sum_{i} a_{i, n} g_{i}}{g_{0}}\\right| \\leqslant r A \\max _{i}\\left(\\left|a_{i}-a_{i, n}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nand we have the result.\nDefinition 2.10. An adelic divisor $\\bar{D}$ over $U$ is\n(i) strongly nef if for the Cauchy sequence $\\left(\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i}\\right)$ defining it we can take for every $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i}$ a semipositive model adelic divisor.\n(ii) nef if there exists a strongly nef adelic divisor $\\bar{A}$ such that for all $m \\geqslant 1, \\bar{D}+m \\bar{A}$ is strongly nef.\n(iii) integrable if it is the difference of two strongly nef adelic divisors.\n\nIf $\\bar{D}$ is an adelic divisor over $U$, then $\\bar{D}$ has an associated height function\n\n$$\nh_{\\bar{D}}: U(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\n$$\n\nwhich is computed as follows if $D_{\\mid U}=0$ which is our use case in this paper:\n\n$$\n\\forall p \\in U(\\bar{K}), \\quad h_{\\bar{D}}(p)=\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{deg} p} \\sum_{v \\in M(\\mathbf{K})} \\sum_{q \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}, \\mathbf{K}) \\cdot p} n_{v} g_{\\bar{D}, v}(q)\n$$\n\nwhere $n_{v}=\\left[\\mathbf{K}_{v}: \\mathbf{Q}_{v}\\right]$. Moreover, for any closed $\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}$-subvariety $Z$ of $U$, we define the height of $Z$ to be\n\n$$\nh_{\\bar{D}}(Z):=\\frac{\\overline{D_{\\mid Z}^{\\operatorname{dim} Z+1}}}{(1+\\operatorname{dim} Z) D_{\\mid Z}^{\\operatorname{dim} Z}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{D_{\\mid Z}^{\\operatorname{dim} Z+1}}$ represents the intersection number of adelic divisors. See [YZ23] for more details.\n\nProposition 2.11 ([YZ23, \u00a72.5.5]). If $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism between quasiprojective varieties over $\\mathbf{K}$, then there is a pullback operator\n\n$$\nf^{*}: \\widetilde{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(Y / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\widetilde{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(X / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right)\n$$\n\nthat preserves model, strongly nef, nef and integrable adelic divisors.

PICARD-MANIN SPACE AT INFINITY \n\n3.1. Compactifications. A compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ is a projective surface $X$ with an open embedding $\\mathfrak{t}_{X}: \\mathcal{M}_{D} \\hookrightarrow X$ such that $X$ is smooth in a neighbourhood of $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$. We call $X \\backslash \\mathfrak{t}_{X}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ the boundary of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ in $X$. By [Goo69, Proposition 1], it is a connected curve. We will also refer to it at the part \"at infinity\" in $X$. For any compactification $X$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ we define $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(X)_{\\mathbf{A}}=\\oplus \\mathbf{A} E_{i}$ where $\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{Z}, \\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{R}$ and $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}=\\bigcup E_{i}$, the space of $\\mathbf{A}$-divisors at infinity. Notice that since $X$ is smooth at infinity every element of $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(X)_{\\mathbf{A}}$ is both an $\\mathbf{A}$-Cartier and Weil divisor. For any two compactifications $X, Y$ we have a birational map $\\pi_{X Y}=\\mathfrak{t}_{Y} \\circ \\mathfrak{t}_{X}^{-1}$ : $X \\rightarrow Y$. If this map is regular, we say that $\\pi_{X Y}$ is a morphism of compactifications and that $X$ is above $Y$. For any compactification $X, Y$ there exists a compactification $Z$ above $X$ and $Y$. Indeed, take $Z$ to be a resolution of indeterminacies of $\\pi_{X Y}: X \\rightarrow Y$. A morphism of compactifications defines a pullback and a pushforward operator $\\pi_{X Y}^{*},\\left(\\pi_{X Y}\\right)_{*}$ on divisors and N\u00e9ron-Severi classes. We have the projection formula,\n\n$$\n\\forall \\alpha \\in \\mathrm{NS}(X), \\beta \\in \\mathrm{NS}(Y), \\quad \\alpha \\cdot \\pi_{X Y}^{*} \\beta=\\left(\\pi_{X Y}\\right)_{*} \\alpha \\cdot \\beta\n$$\n\nLet $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$ be the closure of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ in $\\mathbf{P}^{3}$. We have that $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ is a triangle of lines all of self intersection -1 . The matrix of the intersection form on $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D}\\right)$ is\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore, the intersection form is non-degenerate over $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D}\\right)_{\\mathbf{A}}$ and we have the embedding\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D}\\right)_{\\mathbf{A}} \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{NS}\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D}\\right)_{\\mathbf{A}}\n$$\n\nAnd this holds for every compactification $X$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$.\n3.2.

We say that $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ is defined in $X$ if it is represented by $(X, \\alpha)$. We have a natural embedding $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$, we still write $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ for its image in $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. We also define the space of Weil classes\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right):=\\underset{X}{\\lim } \\mathrm{NS}(X)_{\\mathbf{R}}\n$$\n\nwhere the compatibility morphisms are given by the pushforward morphisms $\\left(\\pi_{Y X}\\right)_{*}: \\mathrm{NS}(Y) \\rightarrow$ $\\mathrm{NS}(X)$ for a morphism of compactifications $\\pi_{Y X}: Y \\rightarrow X$. An element of this inverse limit is a family $\\alpha=\\left(\\alpha_{X}\\right)_{X}$ such that if $X, Y$ are two compactifications of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ with $Y$ above $X$, then $\\left(\\pi_{Y X}\\right)_{*} \\alpha_{Y}=\\alpha_{X}$. We call $\\alpha_{X}$ the incarnation of $\\alpha$ in $X$. We have a natural embedding $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. We also define the space of Weil divisors at infinity\n\n$$\nW\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right):=\\underset{X}{\\lim } \\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(X)_{\\mathbf{R}}\n$$\n\nand we have the commutating diagram\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nThanks to the projection formula, the intersection form defines a perfect pairing\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\times \\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\n$$\n\ndefined as follows.

We write $\\alpha \\geqslant \\beta$ if $\\alpha-\\beta$ is effective. An element $\\beta \\in \\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ is nef if for every compactification $X, \\beta_{X}$ is nef.\n3.3. The Picard-Manin space of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. We provide $\\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ with the topology of the inverse limit, we call it the weak topology, $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ is dense in $\\widehat{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ for this topology. Analogously, $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ is dense in $\\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$.\n\nWe define $\\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}$ for the set of prime divisors at infinity. An element of $\\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}$ is an equivalence class of pairs $(X, E)$ where $X$ is a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ and $E$ is a prime divisor at infinity. Two pairs $(X, E),\\left(Y, E^{\\prime}\\right)$ are equivalent if the birational map $\\pi_{X Y}$ sends $E$ to $E^{\\prime}$. We will just write $E \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}$ instead of $(X, E)$. We define the function $\\operatorname{ord}_{E}: \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ as follows. Let $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$, if $X$ is any compactification where $E$ is defined (in particular $(X, E)$ represents $\\left.E \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}\\right)$, then $\\alpha_{X}$ is of the form\n\n$$\n\\alpha_{X}=a_{E} E+\\sum_{F \\neq E} a_{F} F\n$$\n\nand we set $\\operatorname{ord}_{E}\\left(\\alpha_{X}\\right)=a_{E}$. This does not depend on the choice of $(X, E)$.\nLemma 3.1 ([BFJ08] Lemma 1.5). The map\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\mapsto\\left(\\operatorname{ord}_{E}(\\alpha)\\right)_{E \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}} \\in \\mathbf{R}^{\\mathcal{D}_{\\infty}}\n$$\n\nis a homeomorphism for the product topology.\nWe can define a stronger topology on $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ as follows.

Take an ample class $\\omega$ on some compactification $X$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ such that $\\omega^{2}=1$. Every Cartier class $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ can be decomposed with respect to $\\omega$ and $\\omega^{\\perp}$\n\n$$\n\\alpha=(\\alpha \\cdot \\omega) \\omega+(\\alpha-(\\alpha \\cdot \\omega) \\omega)\n$$\n\nBy the Hodge index theorem, the intersection form is negative definite on $\\omega^{\\perp}$ and we define the norm\n\n$$\n\\|\\alpha\\|_{\\omega}^{2}=(\\alpha \\cdot \\omega)^{2}-(\\alpha-(\\alpha \\cdot \\omega) \\omega)^{2}\n$$\n\nThis defines a topology on $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ which is independent of the choice of $\\omega$. We call it the strong topology. We define $\\overline{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ to be the compactification of $\\mathcal{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ with respect to this topology. As this topology is stronger than the weak topology, $\\overline{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ is a subspace of\n\n$\\widetilde{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. This is a Hilbert space and the intersection product extends to a continuous nondegenerate bilinear form\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\times \\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\n$$\n\nWe call $\\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ the Picard-Manin space of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. We also write $\\overline{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ for the closure of $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ for the strong topology. We have in particular that every nef class in $\\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ belongs to $\\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ (see [BFJ08] Proposition 1.4).\n\nRemark 3.2. In [BFJ08] or [CLC13], the Picard-Manin space is defined by allowing blow up with arbitrary centers not only at infinity. Since we study dynamics of automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ the indeterminacy points are only at infinity. This justifies our restricted definition of the Picard-Manin space. A similar construction is used in [FJ11] for the affine plane.\n3.4. Spectral property of the dynamical degree. If $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ we define the operator $f^{*}$ on $\\mathbb{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ as follows. Let $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ defined in a compactification $X$. Let $Y$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ such that the lift $F: Y \\rightarrow X$ of $f$ is regular. We define $f^{*} \\alpha$ as the Cartier class defined by $F^{*} \\alpha$. This does not depend on the choice of $X$ or $Y$. We write $f_{*}$ for $\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^{*}$. If $X$ is a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, we write $f_{X}^{*}: \\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ for the following operator:\n\n$$\nf_{X}^{*}(D)=\\left(f^{*} D\\right)_{X}\n$$\n\nwhere we consider the class of $D$ and $f^{*} D$ in $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. We also define the operator $f_{X}^{*}$ : $\\mathrm{NS}(X) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NS}(X)$ in a similar way.\n\nProposition 3.3 (Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 3.2 of [BFJ08]). The operator $f^{*}$ extends to a continuous bounded operator $f^{*}: \\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right) \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ that satisfy the following conditions.\n(1) $f^{*} \\alpha \\cdot \\beta=\\alpha \\cdot f_{*} \\beta$.\n(2) $f^{*} \\alpha \\cdot f^{*} \\beta=\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$.\n(3) $\\lambda_{1}(f)$ is the spectral radius and an eigenvalue of $f^{*}$.\n\nIf $\\lambda_{1}(f)>1$, then $\\lambda_{1}$ is simple and there is a spectral gap property.\nTheorem 3.4 (Theorem 3.5 of [BFJ08]). Let $f$ be a loxodromic automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, there exist nef elements $\\theta_{f}^{+}, \\theta_{f}^{-} \\in \\overline{\\mathcal{C}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ unique up to multiplication by a positive constant such that the following hold.\n(1) $\\theta_{f}^{+}$and $\\theta_{f}^{-}$are effective.\n(2) $\\left(\\theta_{f}^{+}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\theta_{f}^{-}\\right)^{2}=0, \\theta_{f}^{+} \\cdot \\theta_{f}^{-}=1$.\n(3) $f^{*} \\theta_{f}^{+}=\\lambda_{1} \\theta_{f}^{+},\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\theta_{f}^{-}=\\lambda_{1} \\theta_{f}^{-}$.\n(4) For any $\\alpha \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{N}}\\left(f^{ \\pm N}\\right)^{*} \\alpha=\\left(\\theta_{f}^{ \\pm} \\cdot \\alpha\\right) \\theta_{f}^{ \\pm}+O_{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{N}}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. The only assertion not following from [BFJ08] is that $\\theta_{f}^{+}$and $\\theta_{f}^{-}$are effective and belong to $\\bar{C}$. We show the result for $\\theta_{f}^{+}$. Following the proof of [BFJ08] Theorem 3.2, we have that $\\theta_{f}^{+}$is obtained as a limit of a sequence of Cartier divisors $\\left(X_{n}, \\theta_{n}\\right)$ on compactifications of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ such that $f_{X_{n}}^{*} \\theta_{n}=\\rho_{n} \\theta_{n}$ where $\\rho_{n}$ is the spectral radius of $f_{X_{n}}^{*}$. The existence of $\\theta_{f}^{+}$follows from the fact that $\\rho_{n} \\rightarrow \\lambda_{1}$. We show that $\\theta_{n}$ can be chosen nef, effective and in $\\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}\\left(X_{n}\\right)_{\\mathbf{R}}$. Fix a compactification $X$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}, f_{X}^{*}$ preserves the nef cone $\\operatorname{Nef}(X)$ of $\\mathrm{NS}(X)$. It also preserves the subcone of $\\operatorname{Nef}(X)$ consisting of effective divisors supported at infinity. This subcone is nonempty because for example in the compactification $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$, the Cartier divisor\n\n$$\nH=\\{X=T=0\\}+\\{Y=T=0\\}+\\{Z=T=0\\}\n$$\n\nis very ample as it is equal to $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\cap\\{T=0\\}$. By Perron-Frobenius theorem, there exists $\\theta_{X}$ in this subcone such that $f_{X}^{*} \\theta_{X}=\\rho_{X} \\theta_{X}$ with $\\rho_{X}$ the spectral radius of $f_{X}^{*}$.\n3.5. Compatibility with adelic divisors. We have a forgetful group homomorphism\n\n$$\nw: \\widetilde{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D} / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)\n$$\n\ndefined as follows. Let $\\mathcal{U}$ be a quasiprojective model of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ and let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ be a model adelic divisor on $\\mathcal{U}$. Then, $w(\\overline{\\mathscr{D}})=\\mathscr{D}_{\\mathbf{K}}$ is the horizontal part of $\\mathscr{D}$, this is an element of $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ because $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ is supported at infinity.\n\nProposition 3.5. The group homomorphism $w$ extends to a continuous group homomorphism\n\n$$\nw: \\widetilde{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D} / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)\n$$\n\nsuch that if $\\bar{D}$ is integrable then $w(\\bar{D}) \\in \\bar{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ and if $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$, then\n\n$$\nw\\left(f^{*} \\bar{D}\\right)=f^{*} w(\\bar{D})\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\bar{D} \\in \\widetilde{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D} / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right)$ be given by a Cauchy sequence of model adelic divisors $\\left(\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i}\\right)$. Let $X$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. There exists a sequence $\\varepsilon_{i}$ converging to zero such that\n\n$$\n-\\varepsilon_{i} \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0} \\leqslant \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{j}-\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{i} \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{i} \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}\n$$\n\nApplying $w$, we get (write $D_{j}=w\\left(\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{j}\\right)$ )\n\n$$\n-\\varepsilon_{i} D_{0} \\leqslant D_{j}-D_{i} \\leqslant \\varepsilon_{i} D_{0}\n$$\n\nThus, for every $E \\in \\mathscr{D}_{\\infty}$, $\\operatorname{ord}_{E}\\left(D_{i}\\right)$ is a Cauchy sequence and converges to a number $\\operatorname{ord}_{E}(D)$. By Lemma 3.1 this defines a Weil divisor $w(D) \\in \\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. It is clear that $w$ is continuous, again using Lemma 3.1.\n\nIf $\\bar{D}$ is integrable, then it is the difference of two strongly nef adelic divisors and nef classes in $\\mathcal{W}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ belong to $\\mathcal{C}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$.\n\nIf $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$, it suffices to show (60) for model adelic divisors. Let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}$ be a model adelic divisor and let $\\mathscr{X}$ be a projective model of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ where $\\mathscr{D}$ is defined. There exists\n\na projective model above $\\mathscr{Y}$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{d}$ over $O_{\\mathbf{K}}$ such that the lift of $f$ extends to a regular map $F: \\mathscr{Y} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{X}$ and $f^{*} \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}=\\overline{F^{*} \\mathscr{D}}$.

Define the character variety,\n\n$$\nX:=\\operatorname{hom}\\left(\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right), \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})\\right) / / \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})\n$$\n\nwhere the action of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ is diagonal and given by conjugation and $/ /$ is the Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotient. This is also an affine variety and we have the following result of Fricke and Klein.\n\nTheorem 4.1 (Fricke, Klein, [Gol09]). The algebraic variety $X$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbf{C}^{3}$. The isomorphism is given by\n\n$$\n[\\rho] \\in X \\mapsto(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(a)), \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(b)), \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(a b)))\n$$\n\nWe will denote by $(x, y, z)=(\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(a)), \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(b)), \\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(a b)))$ these are the Frick-Klein coordinates. Let $\\kappa: X \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}$ be the regular function\n\n$$\n\\kappa(\\rho)=\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho([a, b]))\n$$\n\nwhere $[a, b]=a b a^{-1} b^{-1}$. One can show that\n\n$$\n\\kappa=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-x y z-2\n$$\n\nTherefore, if $X_{t}=\\kappa^{-1}(t)$ is the relative character variety, we have\n\n$$\nX_{t}=\\mathcal{M}_{t+2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{M}_{t+2}$ is the Markov surface of parameter $t+2$. In particular, the parameter $D=4$ corresponds to $t=2$ and every points in $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$ corresponds to a reducible representation.\n\n4.2. Automorphism group of the Markov surfaces. The generalized mapping class group $\\operatorname{Mod}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ is the group of homotopy class of homeomorphism of $T_{1}$ (not necessarily orientation preserving). It contains $\\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ as an index 2 subgroup and it acts on $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$, we have the following isomorphism:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Mod}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\simeq \\operatorname{Out}\\left(\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nFurthermore,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Out}\\left(\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)\\right) \\simeq \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})\n$$\n\nFor any element $\\Phi \\in \\operatorname{Out}\\left(\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)\\right), \\Phi([a, b])$ is conjugated to $[a, b] \\pm$. This implies, that the action of $\\operatorname{Mod}^{*}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ on $X$ preserves every $X_{t}$. Now, the matrix - id acts trivially, because in $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ we have that $\\operatorname{Tr} A=\\operatorname{Tr} A^{-1}$, so for all $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ we get a group homomorphism\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{PGL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z}) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)\n$$\n\nTheorem 4.2 ([CL07] Theorem A and B, [\u00c8H74]). Let $\\Gamma^{*} \\subset \\mathrm{PGL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ be the subgroup of element congruent to the identity modulo 2, then for any $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$,\n\n$$\n\\Gamma^{*} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)\n$$\n\nis injective and its image is of index at most 8. Furthermore if $\\Phi \\in \\Gamma^{*}$ and $\\rho$ is its spectral radius, then $\\rho=\\lambda_{1}\\left(f_{\\Phi}\\right)$ where $f_{\\Phi}$ is the automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ induced by $\\Phi$. Furthermore, the topological entropy of $f_{\\Phi}$ is equal to $\\log \\lambda_{1}\\left(f_{\\Phi}\\right)$.\n\nWe can describe the group homomorphism. Let $\\sigma_{x} \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be the automorphism\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{x}(x, y, z)=(y z-x, y, z)\n$$\n\nIf we fix the coordinates $y, z$, then the equation defining $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ becomes a polynomial equation of degree 2 with respect to $x, \\sigma_{x}$ permutes the 2 roots of this equation. We can define $\\sigma_{y}, \\sigma_{z}$ in the same way. Then, $\\sigma_{x}, \\sigma_{y}, \\sigma_{z}$ generate a free group isomorphic to $(\\mathbf{Z} / 2 \\mathbf{Z}) *(\\mathbf{Z} / 2 \\mathbf{Z}) *(\\mathbf{Z} / 2 \\mathbf{Z})$ which is of finite index in $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ (see [\u00c8H74]). The subgroup $\\Gamma^{*}$ is the free group on the three generators\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n-1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-2 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich correspond respectively to $\\sigma_{x}, \\sigma_{y}, \\sigma_{z}$. For a more detailed description of the action of $\\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ on the character variety, see the appendix of [Gol03].\n4.3. Fuchsian and Quasi-Fuchsian representation. The general reference for this part is [McM96]. Let $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ be the hyperbolic space of dimension $n$. Recall that $\\operatorname{Isom}\\left(\\mathbb{H}^{2}\\right)=\\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{R})$ and $\\operatorname{Isom}\\left(\\mathbb{H}^{3}\\right)=\\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$. The boundary of $\\mathbb{H}^{2}$ is naturally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{S}^{1}=\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ and the boundary of $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$ is naturally homeomorphic to $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{C}):=\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}$. A Fuchsian group is a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$ of $\\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{R})$. A Quasi-Fuchsian group is a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$ of $\\operatorname{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ such that its limit set ${ }^{1}$ in $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}$ is a Jordan curve. Let $S$ be an oriented compact (real)\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The limit set of $\\Gamma$ is the set of accumulation points in $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}$ of $\\Gamma \\cdot x$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{H}^{3}$ is any point.\n\nsurface of negative Euler characteristic. We say that a representation $\\rho: \\pi_{1}(S) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ is Fuchsian (resp, Quasi-Fuchsian) if $\\bar{\\rho}(S) \\subset \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ is Fuchsian (resp. Quasi-Fuchsian). We will denote by $\\mathrm{QF}(S)$ the set of Quasi-Fuchsian representation of $\\pi_{1}(S)$ in $\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$.\n\nThe Character variety of $S$ is the algebraic variety $X(S):=\\operatorname{hom}\\left(\\pi_{1}(S), \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})\\right) / / \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ where $/ /$ is the GIT quotient by the action of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ by conjugation. The mapping class group $\\operatorname{Mod}(S)$ of $S$ is the group of orientation preserving homeomorphism of $S$ modulo the ones homotopic to the identity. It acts on the Character variety.\n\nLet $\\operatorname{Teich}(S)$ be the Teichmuller space of $S$, that is the set of complete finite hyperbolic metrics over $S$. The mapping class group $\\operatorname{Mod}(S)$ acts on it. Every point of $\\operatorname{Teich}(S)$ induces a Fuchsian representation of $S$. We can actually parametrize the set of Quasi-Fuchsian representations $\\mathrm{QF}(S)$ of $S$ using $\\operatorname{Teich}(S)$ by the simultaneous uniformization theorem of Bers.\n\nTheorem 4.3 ([Ber60]). There is a biholomorphic map\n\n$$\n\\text { Bers : } \\operatorname{Teich}(S) \\times \\operatorname{Teich}(\\bar{S}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{QF}(S)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{S}$ is the surface $S$ with its reversed orientation.\nUsing this theorem, one can apply an iterative process to find a fixed point in the character variety of $S$.\n\nTheorem 4.4 ([McM96]). Let $S$ be an oriented compact surface of negative Euler characteristic. Let $(X, Y) \\in \\operatorname{Teich}(S) \\times \\operatorname{Teich}(\\bar{S})$, let $\\Phi \\in \\operatorname{Mod}(S)$ be pseudo-Anosov, then the sequence\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Bers}\\left(\\Phi^{n}(X), \\Phi^{-n}(Y)\\right)\n$$\n\nhas an accumulation point $\\rho_{\\infty}: \\pi_{1}(S) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$. Furthermore,\n(1) $\\rho_{\\infty}$ is discrete and faithful.\n(2) The limit set of $\\rho_{\\infty}\\left(\\pi_{1}(S)\\right)$ is the whole boundary $\\widehat{\\mathbf{C}}$ of $\\mathbb{H}^{3}$.\n(3) $\\rho_{\\infty}$ is a fixed point of $\\Phi$ and $\\Phi$ is conjugated to an isometry $\\alpha$ of $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi}=\\mathbb{H}^{3} / \\rho_{\\infty}\\left(\\pi_{1}(S)\\right)$.\n(4) The group of isometries of $M_{\\infty}$ is discrete and $\\alpha$ is of infinite order.\n(5) The mapping torus\n\n$$\nM_{\\Phi}:=S \\times[0,1] /(x, 0) \\sim(\\phi(x), 1)\n$$\n\nis isomorphic as an hyperbolic manifold to $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi} /<\\alpha>$.\n(6) The subgroup generated by $\\alpha$ of the group of isometries of $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi}$ is of finite index.\n(7) The fixed point $\\rho_{\\infty}$ of $\\psi$ is hyperbolic, meaning that no eigenvalues of the differential of $\\psi$\n4.4. The surface $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ and a Theorem of Minsky. We are interested in this section with the Markov surface $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ that is when $\\kappa=-2$, therefore $\\rho\\left(a b a^{-1} b^{-1}\\right)$ is a parabolic M\u00f6bius transformation. We recall the results from [Can09, \u00a74.1]. The real points $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})$ consist of an isolated point $(0,0,0)$ and four diffeomorphic connected components that are given by the\n\nsigns of $x$ and $y$. We will denote by $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$the connected component such that $x, y>0$. of area $2 \\pi$. This is equivalent to asking that there is a cusp at the puncture. It is known that $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right.$ being the punctured torus) is isomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$and we make this identification from now on. The action of $\\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ on $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ is conjugated to the usual action of $\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ by isometries on $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$. The point $(0,0,0)$ is the only singular point of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ and it corresponds to the conjugacy class of the representation\n\n$$\n\\rho(a)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & i \\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\quad \\rho(b)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nIts image is the quaternionic group of order eight. The automorphism group $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\right)$ fixes $(0,0,0)$, preserves $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$and permutes the three remaining connected components of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R}) \\backslash(0,0,0)$.\n\nAny point in $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ gives rise to a representation $\\overline{\\rho}: \\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{R})$ which can be lifted to four distinct representations $\\rho: \\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{R})$. The cusp condition gives the condition $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho(a, b))=-2$ (because $\\operatorname{Tr}=2$ corresponds to reducible representations). Therefore, we get an embedding of $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ into the 4 different connected component of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R}) \\backslash(0,0,0)$. We will restrict our attention to the embedding $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$is made of (conjugacy class of) Fuchsian representations. Let $\\mathrm{DF}_{0} \\subset$ $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{C})$ be the subset of discrete and faithful representation of $\\pi_{1}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$. Then $\\mathrm{DF}_{0}$ has four different connected components, one of them contains $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$. We denote it by $\\mathrm{DF}_{0}^{+}$and we denote by $\\mathrm{QF}_{0}^{+}$the set of Quasi-Fuchsian representation inside $\\mathrm{DF}_{0}^{+}$. In fact, $\\mathrm{QF}_{0}^{+}$is the interior of $\\mathrm{DF}_{0}^{+}$(see [Min02]). We can identify $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ with the upper half plane $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$and $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{T}}_{1}\\right)$ with the lower half plane $\\mathbb{H}^{-}$. The group $\\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ acts on $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{C})$ via M\u00f6bius transformation. It preserves $\\mathbb{H}^{+}, \\mathbb{H}^{-}$and $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$. In particular, the mapping class $\\operatorname{group} \\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)=\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ acts on $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{C})$ and we can conjugate this action to the action on $\\mathcal{M}_{0}(\\mathbf{R})^{+}$via the Bers mapping. Namely, let $\\Phi \\in \\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ and let $f_{\\Phi} \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\right)$ induced by the map from Equation (71). We have for every $(s, t) \\in \\mathbb{H}^{+} \\times \\mathbb{H}^{-}$,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Bers}(\\Phi(s, t))=f_{\\Phi}(\\operatorname{Bers}(s, t))\n$$\n\nTheorem 4.4 is not applicable directly as $\\mathbb{T}_{1}$ is not compact. However, Minsky showed that the Bers mapping can be extended to almost all the boundary of $\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\times \\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{T}}_{1}\\right)$. The boundary of $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$is $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$. We denote by $\\Delta$ the diagonal in $\\partial \\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\times \\partial \\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{T}}_{1}\\right)$.\n\nTheorem 4.5 ([Min99]). The Bers mapping extends to a continuous bijection\n\n$$\n\\text { Bers : } \\overline{\\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right) \\times \\operatorname{Teich}\\left(\\overline{\\mathbb{T}}_{1}\\right)} \\backslash \\Delta \\rightarrow \\mathrm{DF}^{+}\n$$\n\nIn particular, let $\\Phi \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})=\\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\mathbb{T}_{1}\\right)$ be a loxodromic element and let $f_{\\Phi}$ be its associated automorphism over $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$. The isometry $\\Phi$ has a repulsive fixed point $\\alpha(\\Phi)$ on $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ and an attractive one $\\omega(\\Phi)$. By Minsky's theorem, this gives two unique fixed point $p(\\Phi)=\\operatorname{Bers}((\\alpha(\\Phi), \\omega(\\Phi)))$ and $q(\\Phi)=\\operatorname{Bers}((\\omega(\\Phi), \\alpha(\\Phi)))$ of $f_{\\Phi}$ in $\\mathrm{DF}^{+} \\backslash \\mathrm{QF}^{+}$. This two\n\nfixed points are also hyperbolic because any point in $D_{F}^{+}$converges exponentially fast to $q(\\phi)$ in forward time and to $p(\\phi)$ in backward time so we can apply Corollary 3.19 of [McM96].\n4.5. The surface $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ for $D=2-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)$. The main reference for this part is [McM96, \u00a73.7]. Let $q \\geqslant 2$ be an integer. Consider the orbifold real compact surface $S_{q}$ which is a genus 1 torus with a singular point of index $q$. The modular class group of $S$ is still $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$. Let $\\psi \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ be pseudo-Anosov, i.e such that $|\\operatorname{Tr} \\psi|>2$. We can recover Theorem 4.4 for $S_{q}$ as follows. There exists a real closed compact surface $\\tilde{S}_{q}$ with a finite characteristic cover $\\tilde{S}_{q} \\rightarrow S_{q}$. In particular, $\\operatorname{Mod}\\left(S_{q}\\right)=\\operatorname{Mod}\\left(\\tilde{S}_{q}\\right)$ so we can apply Theorem 4.4 for $\\tilde{\\psi}$, the lift of $\\psi$ to $\\tilde{S}_{q}$. We get a hyperbolic 3 -fold $M_{\\tilde{\\psi}}$ which is topologically the mapping torus of $\\tilde{\\psi}$. We have a finite cover $M_{\\tilde{\\psi}} \\rightarrow M_{\\psi}$ and by Mostow's rigidity theorem this induces a hyperbolic metric on $M_{\\psi}$.\n\nNow the orbifold fundamental group of $S_{q}$ is\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}\\left(S_{q}\\right)=\\left\\langle a, b \\mid[a, b]^{q}=1\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nEvery irreducible representation $\\rho: \\pi_{1}(S) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ lifts to a representation\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\rho}: G \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})\n$$\n\nwhere $G=\\langle a, b|[a, b]^{2 q}=1\\rangle$ such that\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\rho}\\left([a, b]^{q}\\right)=-\\mathrm{id}\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\rho([a, b])$ is an elliptic element of order $2 q$ thus\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Tr}(\\rho([a, b]))=-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{2 q}\\right)=-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe get that $\\overline{\\rho} \\in \\mathcal{M}_{2-2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)}$. In particular the representation induced by $M_{\\psi}$ yields a hyperbolic fixed point of $\\psi$ over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$.\n\nRemark 4.6. In [McM96, \u00a73.7], it is stated that every irreducible representation $\\overline{\\rho}$ is a point of $M_{D}$ for $D=2-2 \\cos (2 \\pi / q)$ but we believe this is a typo as for $q=2$ we would get $D=4$ and there are no irreducible representations in $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$. The fixed point $M_{\\psi}$ constructed in $[\\mathrm{McM} 96, \\S 3.7]$ in the example for $q=2$ is actually a point in $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ and not $\\mathcal{M}_{4}$.

Cyclic compactifications and circle at infinity. Let $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$ be the closure of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ in $\\mathbf{P}^{3}$. We have that $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ is a triangle of lines. We use the following result.\n\nProposition 5.1 ([\u0116H74, CdC19]). Let $X$ be projective surface and $U$ an open subset of $X$ such that $X \\backslash U$ is a cycle of rational curves. Assume that $X \\backslash U$ is not an irreducible curve\n\nwith one nodal singularity. Let $g$ be an automorphism of $U$, then the indeterminacy points of $g$ can only be intersection points of two components of the cycle.\n\nThis shows that to understand the dynamics of a loxodromic automorphism at infinity it suffices to blow up the intersection points of the prime divisors at infinity. Therefore we can remain with compactifications $X$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ such that $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ is a cycle of rational curves. We call them cyclic compactifications.\n\nStart with $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$. If we blow up the three intersection points of the triangle at infinity we get a new compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ with a hexagon of rational curves at infinity. If we repeat the process we get a sequence of compactifications with an increasing polygon of rational curves at infinity, let $X_{n}$ be this sequence of compactifications. Let $\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ be the dual graph of $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$, i.e the vertices of $\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ are the irreducible components $E_{i}$ of $X_{n} \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ and we have an edge between $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ if and only if $E_{i} \\cap E_{j} \\neq \\varnothing$. We have a natural embedding of graphs $\\mathcal{G}_{n} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{G}_{n+1}$. We define the direct limit $\\mathcal{G}=\\lim _{\\rightarrow} \\mathcal{G}_{n}$ and $\\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ acts naturally on $\\mathcal{G}$. There is a parametrization of the vertices of $\\mathcal{G}$ called the Farey parametrization (see [CdC19] \u00a78.2), and $\\mathcal{G}$ is isomorphic to the set of rational points of the circle $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ with this parametrization. If $X$ is a cyclic compactification, the irreducible components $E_{i}$ (enumerated cyclically) of the boundary corresponds to rational points $v_{i} \\in \\mathbb{S}^{1}$. The rational points of $] v_{i}, v_{i+1}[$ are obtained by blowing up above the point $E_{i} \\cap E_{i+1}$.\n\nFollowing $\\S 2.6$ of [Can09], we identify $\\mathbb{S}^{1} \\simeq \\mathbf{R} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ with the boundary of the upper half plane of $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$. If $v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}$ are the three vertices of $\\mathcal{G}$ representing the three curves $\\{X=T=0\\}$, $\\{Y=T=0\\}$ and $\\{Z=T=0\\}$ in $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D}$, then this identification sends $v_{x}, v_{y}, v_{z}$ to $0,-1, \\infty \\in$ $\\partial \\mathbb{H}^{+}$which we write $j_{x}, j_{y}, j_{z}$ respectively. Recall the notations of $\\S 4.2$, The generator $\\sigma_{x}$ (resp. $\\sigma_{y}, \\sigma_{z}$ ) of $\\Gamma^{*}$ acts on $\\partial \\mathbb{H}^{+}$as the reflection with respect to the geodesic $\\left(j_{y}, j_{z}\\right)$ (resp. $\\left.\\left(j_{x}, j_{z}\\right),\\left(j_{x}, j_{y}\\right)\\right)$ under this identification. The isometries of $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$induced by $\\sigma_{x}, \\sigma_{y}, \\sigma_{z}$ with this identification are exactly given by (74). Hence, the action of $\\Gamma^{*}$ on $\\mathcal{G}$ is given by the action of $\\Gamma^{*}$ on $\\mathbb{H}^{+}$via isometries. Thus every loxodromic automorphism $f \\in \\Gamma^{*}$ admits two irrational fixed points $\\alpha(f), \\omega(f) \\in \\partial \\mathbb{H}^{+}, \\alpha(f)$ is repulsive and $\\omega(f)$ is attracting.\n\nThe circle $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$ has an interpretation as a special subset of the set of valuations of the ring of regular functions of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. The two fixed point $\\alpha(f), \\omega(f)$ correspond to a repulsive and attracting fixed point in this space of valuation. See $\\S 14.5$ of [Abb23] for more details.\n5.2. Dynamics of loxodromic automorphism at infinity. From the previous discussion, we get the following proposition.\n\nProposition 5.2. Let $D \\in \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{Q}(D)$ and $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. For any cyclic compactification $Y$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, there exists a cyclic compactification $X$ above $Y$ such that there exists two closed points $p_{+}, p_{-} \\in\\left(X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)(\\mathbf{K})$ satisfying the following properties\n(1) $p_{+} \\neq p_{-}$\n(2) some positive iterate of $f^{ \\pm 1}$ contracts $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ to $p_{ \\pm}$.\n\n(3) $f^{ \\pm}$is defined at $p_{ \\pm}, f^{ \\pm 1}\\left(p_{ \\pm}\\right)=p_{ \\pm}$and $p_{\\mp}$ is the unique indeterminacy point of $f^{ \\pm N}$ for $N$ large enough.\n(4) There exists local algebraic coordinates $(u, v)$ at $p_{ \\pm}$such that $u v=0$ is a local equation of the boundary and $f^{ \\pm 1}$ is locally of the form\n\n$$\nf^{ \\pm 1}(u, v)=\\left(u^{a} v^{b} \\phi, u^{c} v^{d} \\psi\\right)\n$$\n\nwith $a d-b c= \\pm 1$ and $\\phi, \\psi$ invertible. In particular, for any place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$ there exists an open neighbourhood $U_{v}^{ \\pm}$of $p_{ \\pm}$in $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ such that $f^{ \\pm}\\left(U_{\\mathbf{K}_{v}}^{ \\pm}\\right) \\Subset U_{v}^{ \\pm}$.\n(5) $f$ is algebraically stable over $X$ and\n\n$$\nf_{X}^{*} \\theta_{f, X}^{+}=\\lambda_{1} \\theta_{f, X}^{+}, \\quad\\left(f_{X}^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=\\lambda_{1} \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}\n$$\n\nProof. From the previous section, write $E_{1}, \\cdots, E_{r}$ for the irreducible components of $Y$ enumerated in cyclic order. We write $p_{+}$for the unique point $p_{+}=E_{i} \\cap E_{i+1}$ such that $\\omega(f) \\in$ $] v_{i}, v_{i+1}[$ and we define $p_{-}$similarly with respect to $\\alpha(f)$. It is clear that for $N$ large enough every $E_{i}$ is contracted to $p_{ \\pm}$by $f^{ \\pm N}$ because of the attractingness of $\\omega(f)$ and $\\alpha(f)=\\omega\\left(f^{-1}\\right)$. Thus, to get a compactification above $Y$ that satisfy Properties (1)-(5) we just need that $p_{+} \\neq p_{-}$in that compactification. Since $f$ is loxodromic, we have $\\alpha(f) \\neq \\omega(f)$, thus after enough blow-ups this will be the case. The fact that $f$ is algebraically stable follows from the fact that the action of $f$ over $\\mathcal{G} \\simeq \\mathcal{S}^{1} \\simeq \\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ is induced by a loxodromic Mobius transformation.\n\nCorollary 5.3 (Corollary 3.4 from [Can09]). Any loxodromic automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ does not admit any invariant algebraic curves.\n\nProof. Let $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be loxodromic. Let $X$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ given by Proposition 5.2. If $C \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ was an invariant algebraic curve, then its closure $\\bar{C}$ in $X$ should intersect $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$. Since the boundary is contracted by $f$, we must have $p_{+} \\in \\bar{C}$ and $f: \\bar{C} \\rightarrow C$ is an automorphism with a superattractive fixed point. This is a contradiction.\n\nProposition 5.4. Let $X$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ given by Proposition 5.2, replace $f$ by one of its iterates such that $f^{ \\pm 1}$ contracts $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$ to $p_{ \\pm}$.

If $E$ is a prime divisor at infinity distinct from $E_{+}$and $F_{+}$, then $f_{X}^{*} E=0$ because every prime divisor at infinity is contracted to $p_{+}$by $f$ and $p_{+} \\notin E$. Now if $R$ satisfies $f_{X}^{*} R=0$, then\n\n$$\n0=f_{X}^{*} R \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=R \\cdot\\left(f_{X}^{-1}\\right)^{*} \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=\\lambda_{1} R \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}\n$$\n\nThus $R \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=0$. This shows (2).\nSince $f_{X}^{*} \\theta_{f, X}^{+}=\\lambda_{1} \\theta_{f, X}^{+}$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\theta_{f, X}^{+}=\\alpha E_{+}+\\beta F_{+}+\\cdots\n$$\n\nwhere $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is an eigenvector of $A=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}a & c \\\\ b & d\\end{array}\\right)$ of eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$. Now, up to replacing $f$ by $f^{2}$ we can assume that $a d-b c=1$ and that the other eigenvalue of $A$ is $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}}$. Let $(\\gamma, \\delta)$ be an associated eigenvector, then\n\n$$\nf_{X}^{*}\\left(\\gamma E_{+}+\\delta F_{+}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}}\\left(\\gamma E_{+}+\\delta F_{+}\\right)+R\n$$\n\nwhere $R$ is a divisor at infinity which support does not contain $E_{+}$or $F_{+}$. Set $D^{-}=\\gamma E_{+}+$ $\\delta F_{+}+\\lambda_{1} R$, then by (2), $D^{-}$satisfies $f_{X}^{*} D^{-}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}} D^{-}$. This shows (1).\n\nNow,\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}} D^{-} \\cdot \\theta_{f}^{-}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}} D^{-} \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=\\left(f_{X}^{*} D^{-}\\right) \\cdot \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=D^{-} \\cdot\\left(f_{X}\\right)_{*} \\theta_{f, X}^{-}=\\lambda_{1} D^{-} \\cdot \\theta_{f}^{-}\n$$\n\nThus $D^{-} \\cdot \\theta_{f}^{-}=0$. This shows (3).\nFinally, we just have to show that the family $\\left\\{\\theta_{f, X}^{+}, D^{-}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{E ; E \\notin\\left\\{E_{+}, F_{+}\\right\\}\\right\\}$is free. Suppose that\n\n$$\n\\alpha \\theta_{f, X}^{+}+\\beta D^{-}+R=0\n$$\n\nwith $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $E_{+}, F_{+} \\notin \\operatorname{Supp} R$. Intersecting with $\\theta_{f}^{-}$in (91) and using (2) and (3), we get $\\alpha=0$. Then, applying $f_{X}^{*}$ to (91) we get $\\beta=0$.

The adelic divisor $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(X)=: \\overline{\\theta}^{+}$does not depend on $X$. It is a strongly nef and effective adelic divisor and for any adelic divisor $\\bar{D} \\in \\overline{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D} / \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{N}}\\left(f^{N}\\right)^{*} \\bar{D} \\rightarrow\\left(D \\cdot \\theta^{-}\\right) \\overline{\\theta}^{+}\n$$\n\nProof. We show that the adelic divisor $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(X)$ defined in Corollary 6.12 does not depend on the completion $X$. It suffices to show that $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(X)=\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(Y)$ for any compactification $Y$ above $X$. Let $D=\\theta_{X}^{+} \\in \\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(X)$, then $\\pi^{*} D \\in \\operatorname{Div}_{\\infty}(Y)$ and satisfies $\\pi^{*} D \\cdot \\theta_{Y}^{-}=\\theta_{X}^{+} \\cdot \\theta_{X}^{-}=\\theta^{+} \\cdot \\theta^{-}=1$. Thus we get by Corollary 6.12 that $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(X)=\\overline{\\theta}^{+}(Y)$.\n\nWe now show that $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}$is strongly nef and effective. Let $H$ be the ample divisor on $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$ defined by $H=\\{X=T=0\\}+\\{Y=T=0\\}+\\{Z=T=0\\}$. Let $\\bar{H}$ be a semipositive effective model of $H$ which exists by Lemma 2.4. Since $H$ is ample we have $H \\cdot \\theta^{-}>0$. By Proposition 2.11 and Corollary 6.12 we have that $\\overline{\\theta}^{+}$is strongly nef and effective.\n\nFinally, let $\\overline{\\mathscr{D}} \\in \\widehat{\\operatorname{Div}}_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D} / O_{\\mathbf{K}}\\right)$ be an adelic divisor. For every $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a model adelic divisor $\\mathscr{D}_{\\varepsilon}$ such that\n\n$$\n-\\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0} \\leqslant \\bar{D}-\\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{\\varepsilon} \\leqslant \\varepsilon \\overline{\\mathscr{D}}_{0}\n$$\n\nSince $D_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\theta^{-} \\rightarrow D \\cdot \\theta^{-}$and $f^{*}$ preserves effectiveness we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{N}}\\left(f^{N}\\right)^{*} \\bar{D} \\rightarrow\\left(D \\cdot \\theta^{-}\\right) \\bar{\\theta}^{+}\n$$\n\nRemark 6.14. Let $X$ be the compactification $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$ and $H$ the ample divisor $H=\\{X=T=0\\}+$ $\\{Y=T=0\\}+\\{Z=T=0\\}$. Write $D=A / B$ where $A, B \\in O_{\\mathbf{K}}$, we have a natural model $\\left(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{H}\\right)$ of $(X, H)$ given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathscr{X}=\\operatorname{Proj} O_{K}[X, Y, Z, T] /\\left(B T\\left(X^{2}+Y^{2}+Z^{2}\\right)-B X Y Z-A T^{3}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathscr{H}=\\{X=T=0\\}_{R}+\\{Y=T=0\\}_{R}+\\{Z=T=0\\}_{R}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nApplying Corollary 6.12 with $\\mathscr{H}$ yields the definitions of the Green functions from the introduction.\n\nProposition 6.15. Let $G^{+}$be the Green function of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{+}$, then\n(1) $G^{+} \\geqslant 0$.\n(2) $G^{+} \\circ f^{\\mathrm{an}}=\\lambda_{1} G^{+}$.\n(3) $G^{+}(x)=0$ if and only if the forward $f^{\\mathrm{an}}$-orbit of $x$ is bounded.\n(4) If $X$ is a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, then for any Green function $g$ of $\\theta_{f, X}^{+}, G^{+}-g$ extends to a continuous function over $X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash\\left\\{p_{-}\\right\\}$.\n(5) If $v$ is archimedean, then $G_{v}^{+}$is plurisubharmonic and pluriharmonic over the set $\\left\\{G_{v}^{+}>0\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. (1) follows from $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{+}$being effective. (2) follows from $f^{*} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{+}=\\lambda_{1} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{+}$.\nIf $X$ is any compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$, we can suppose that it satisfies Proposition 5.2 up to blowing up. Let $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})$ be a model of $\\left(X, \\theta_{f, X}^{+}\\right)$for a compactification $X$ that satisfies Proposition 5.2. Fix a place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$, let $U^{+}$be the open neighborhood of $p_{+}$in $X^{\\mathrm{an}}$ constructed in $\\S 6.3$. Since $G^{+}-g_{(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{D})}$ extends to a continuous function over $U^{+}$and $\\theta_{f, X}^{+}$is effective, we can shrink $U_{v}^{+}$such that $G_{U_{v}^{+}}^{+}>0$.\n\nBy (2), we have that $G^{+}>0$ over\n\n$$\nU_{v}:=\\bigcup_{n \\geqslant 0}\\left(f^{-n}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}}\\left(U_{v}^{+} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{D}^{\\mathrm{an}}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo show (3), let $x \\in \\mathcal{M}_{D}^{\\text {an }}$ and let $v$ be the place over which $x$ lies. It suffices to show that if the forward orbit of $x \\in\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ is unbounded, then there exists $N_{0}$ such that $\\left(f^{N_{0}}\\right)^{\\text {an }}(x) \\in$\n\n$U_{v}^{+}$. Since $X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is compact, the sequence $\\left(\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}}(x)\\right)$ must have an accumulation point $q \\in$ $X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$\n\nIf $q \\neq p_{-}^{\\nu}$, then since an iterate of $f: X \\backslash\\left\\{p_{-}^{\\nu}\\right\\} \\rightarrow X \\backslash\\left\\{p_{-}^{\\nu}\\right\\}$ contracts the complement of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ to $p_{v}^{\\nu}$ we must have $\\left(f^{k}\\right)^{\\text {an }}(q)=p_{+}^{\\nu}$ for some $k \\geqslant 1$ thus by continuity there exists $N_{0}$ such that $\\left(f^{N_{0}}\\right)^{\\text {an }}(x) \\in U_{v}^{+}$.\n\nOtherwise $\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{\\text {an }}(x) \\rightarrow p_{-}^{\\nu}$. Since $p_{-}^{\\nu}$ is an attracting fixed point for $\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^{\\text {an }}$, there exists a basis of neighbourhood $U_{v}^{k}$ of $p_{-}^{\\nu}$ in $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$ such that for all $N$ large enough, $\\left(f^{-N}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\left(U_{v}^{k}\\right) \\in U_{v}^{k}$ and we would get that $x \\in U_{v}^{k}$ for all $k \\geqslant 0$, this is absurd.\n\nTo show (5), let $H$ be the ample divisor on $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{D} \\subset \\mathbf{P}^{3}$ defined by $\\{X=T=0\\}+\\{Y=T=0\\}+$ $\\{Z=T=0\\}$ and let $\\bar{H}$ be the semipostive effective model of $H$ defined in Remark 6.14 and $g_{H}$ the associated Green function. Suppose $v$ is archimedean. Since $g_{H}$ is plurisubharmonic over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C}), \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{n}} g_{H} \\circ f^{n}$ also is. By local uniform convergence, we get that $G^{+}$ is plurisubharmonic over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$. To show the pluriharmonicity, it suffices to show that $G_{\\left[U_{v}^{+} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})\\right.}^{+}$is pluriharmonic by the proof of (3). We can suppose that $g_{H}$ is pluriharmonic over $U_{v}^{+} \\bigcap \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ up to shrinking $U_{v}^{+}$, then since $U_{v}^{+}$is $f^{\\text {an }}$-invariant, $\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{n}} g_{H} \\circ\\left(f^{\\text {an }}\\right)^{n}$ is also pluriharmonic over $U_{v}^{+} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ and $G_{\\left[U_{v}^{+} \\cap \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})\\right.}^{+}$is pluriharmonic as the local uniform limit of pluriharmonic functions.\n\nTo show (4), Let $v$ be any place of $\\mathbf{K}$, let $q \\in X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ such that $q \\neq p_{-}$. From Proposition 5.2, we can find an open neighbourhood $U_{v}^{-}$of $p_{-}$such that $q \\notin U_{v}^{-}$and $\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^{\\text {an }}\\left(U_{v}^{-}\\right) \\in$ $U_{v}^{-}$. The proof of $\\S 6.3$ shows that if $g_{+}$is a model Green function of $\\theta_{f, X}^{+}$, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}^{n}} g_{+} \\circ\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{\\mathrm{an}}-g_{+}\n$$\n\nconverges uniformly over $W_{v}^{-}=X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}} \\backslash U_{v}^{-}$to a continuous function which is equal to $G^{+}-g_{+}$. Since two Green functions of the same divisor differ by a continuous function we get the result for any Green function of $\\theta_{f, X}^{+}$.\n\nRemark 6.16. In [CD12], Chambert-Loir and Ducros developed a theory of plurisubharmonic functions, currents and differential forms on Berkovich spaces. Following their definitions, (5) also holds for non-archimedean places with the same proof.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 7. PERIODIC POINTS AND EQUILIBRIUM MEASURE \n\n7.1. Equidistribution. Let $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ be a sequence of $X(\\bar{K}) \\subset X\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}_{v}\\right)$ and let $\\mu_{v}$ be a measure on $X_{v}^{\\text {an }}$.

In particular, a generic sequence is Zariski dense.\nLemma 7.1. Let $X$ be a projective variety over a number field $\\mathbf{K}$ and let $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ be a Zariski dense sequence of $X(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}})$, then one can extract a generic subsequence of $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$.\nProof. The set of strict irreducible subvarieties of $X$ is countable because $\\mathbf{K}$ is a number field. Let $\\left(Y_{q}\\right)_{q \\in \\mathbf{N}}$ be the set of strict irreducible subvarieties of $X$. We construct a generic subsequence $\\left(x_{q}^{\\prime}\\right)_{q \\in \\mathbf{N}}$ as follows. Set $Y_{q}^{\\prime}=\\bigcup_{k \\leqslant q} Y_{k}$. This is a strict subvariety of $X$. Let $n(1)$ be such that $x_{n(1)} \\notin Y_{1}=Y_{1}^{\\prime}$ and suppose we have constructed $n(1)<\\cdots<n(q)$ such that $x_{n(i)} \\notin Y_{i}^{\\prime}$. Since $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ is Zariski dense, there exists an integer $n(q+1)>n(q)$ such that $x_{n(q)} \\notin Y_{q}^{\\prime}$. This defines an increasing sequence $n(q)$ and we set $x_{q}^{\\prime}=x_{n(q)}$, The sequence $\\left(x_{q}^{\\prime}\\right)$ is a subsequence of $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ which is clearly generic.\n\nWe will use the following arithmetic equidistribution theorem from Yuan and Zhang.\nTheorem 7.2 ([YZ23] Theorem 5.4.3). Let $X$ be a quasiprojective variety over a number field $\\mathbf{K}$ and let $\\bar{D}$ be a nef adelic divisor over $X$ such that $D^{\\operatorname{dim} X}>0$. Let $\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\in X(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}})$ be a generic sequence such that $\\lim _{n} h_{\\bar{D}}\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow h_{\\bar{D}}(X)$, then at every place $v$ the Galois orbit of the sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ is equidistributed with respect to the equilibrium measure $\\mu_{\\bar{D}, v}$ over $X_{v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\n7.2. Equidistribution of periodic points. Suppose $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ is algebraic. Let $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be loxodromic. Let $\\overline{\\theta_{f}^{+}}, \\overline{\\theta_{f}^{-}}$be the two strongly nef adelic divisors provided by Theorem 6.1 for $f$ and $f^{-1}$. Recall that $\\theta_{f}^{+} \\cdot \\theta_{f}^{-}=1$. Set\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\theta}_{f}=\\frac{\\overline{\\theta}_{f}^{+}+\\overline{\\theta_{f}^{-}}}{2}\n$$\n\nIt is a strongly nef adelic divisor over $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ and satisfies $\\theta_{f}^{2}=1$. For every place $v$, we write $\\mu_{f, v}$ for the equilibrium measure of $\\overline{\\theta}_{f}$. We also write $h_{f}:=h_{\\overline{\\theta}_{f}}$ and $G_{f}=\\frac{G_{f}^{+}+G_{f}^{-}}{2}$ for the Green function of $\\overline{\\theta}_{f}$.\nTheorem 7.3. If $\\left(p_{n}\\right)$ is a generic sequence of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\overline{\\mathbf{K}})$ of periodic points of $f$, then for every place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$ the Galois orbit of $\\left(p_{n}\\right)$ is equidistributed with respect to the measure $\\mu_{f, v}$ over $\\mathcal{M}_{D, v}^{\\mathrm{an}}$.\nProof. We apply Yuan-Zhang's equidistribution theorem to the adelic divisor $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. We need to show that the sequence $h_{f}\\left(p_{n}\\right)$ converges to $h_{f}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$. Since the points $p_{n}$ are periodic, we have for all $v, G_{v}\\left(p_{n}^{v}\\right)=0$ by Proposition 6.15 (3). Thus we need to show that $h_{f}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)=0$. To do so we apply Theorem 5.3.3 of [YZ23]. Namely, let\n\n$$\ne\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}, \\overline{\\theta}_{f}\\right):=\\sup _{U \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{D}} \\inf _{p \\in U} h_{f}(p)\n$$\n\nwhere $U$ runs through open subsets of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. This quantity is called the essential minimum of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. Since we have a generic sequence of periodic points, we get $e\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{f}\\right)=0$. Theorem 5.3.3 of [YZ23] states that\n\n$$\ne\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{f}\\right) \\geqslant h_{f}(X)\n$$\n\nTherefore we get $h_{f}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)=0$ and Yuan's equidistribution theorem gives the desired result.\n\nCorollary 7.4. If $D$ is algebraic and $f, g$ are two loxodromic automorphisms of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ such that $\\operatorname{Per}(f) \\cap \\operatorname{Per}(g)$ is Zariski dense, then for every place $v$ of $\\mathbf{Q}(D)$,\n\n$$\n\\mu_{f, v}=\\mu_{g, v}\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ be a Zariski dense sequence of $\\operatorname{Per}(f) \\cap \\operatorname{Per}(g)$. By Lemma 7.1, we can suppose that $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ is generic. By Theorem 7.3, for every place $v$ of $\\mathbf{K}$, the Galois orbit of the sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ equidistributes with respect to both the measures $\\mu_{f, v}$ and $\\mu_{g, v}$. Thus, they must be equal.\n7.3. Ergodic properties of the equilibrium measure. Let $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ and consider the embedding $\\mathbf{Q}(D) \\hookrightarrow \\mathbf{C}$. This corresponds to an archimedean place of $\\mathbf{Q}(D)$. Let $X$ be a compactification of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ (over $\\mathbf{C}$ ) that satisfies Proposition 5.2. The measure $\\mu_{f}=d d^{c} G_{f}^{+} \\wedge d d^{c} G_{f}^{-}$that we construct in this paper is exactly the measure associated to the birational transformation $f: X \\rightarrow X$ constructed in [BD05]. Indeed, The quantitative condition (3) in loc.cit is satisfied because the indeterminacy points of $f$ are intersection points of $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$. In particular the main theorem of [BD05] implies the following.\n\nTheorem 7.5. For every $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$, for every archimedean place $v$ of $\\mathbf{Q}(D)$, the measure $\\mu_{f, v}$ is ergodic, mixing and hyperbolic.\n\nA saddle point is a point where the differential of $f$ does not have any eigenvalue of modulus 1 .\n\nCorollary 7.6. For every archimedean place $v, \\operatorname{Supp} \\mu_{f, v}$ is contained in the closure of the saddle periodic points.\n\nProof. This follows from Theorem 4.2 of [Kat80] because $\\mu_{f, v}$ is ergodic, hyperbolic and not supported on a finite orbit.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# 8. SADDLE PERIODIC POINTS ARE IN THE SUPPORT OF THE EQUILIBRIUM MEASURE \n\nLet $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ be algebraic. Fix an archimedean place $v$ of $\\mathbf{Q}(D)$.

Let $f$ be a loxodromic automorphism of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$. The support of the measure $\\mu_{f}$ is the closure of the saddle periodic points of $f$.\n\nBy Corollary 7.6, it suffices to show that every saddle periodic point is in the support of $\\mu_{f}$. This theorem, stated in [Can01] and [Can09], follows directly from the work of Dinh and Sibony in [DS13], which extends [BS91a], and an argument of [BLS93] for H\u00e9non type automorphisms of the complex affine plane. A sketch of proof is given in [Can09, \u00a73.1 and 3.2]. We provide a more detailed proof here.\n8.1. Green functions and bounded orbits. First, let us summarize some of the properties of the function $G_{f}^{+}: \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C}) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}^{+}$of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{f}^{+}$from Proposition 6.15.

Rigidity of $\\overline{K^{+}(f)}$ and equidistribution of stable manifolds. The properties (a) to (g) are sufficient to apply the arguments of Sections 4, 5, 6 of [DS13]. More precisely, one first obtains Theorem 6.6 of [DS13], because its proof relies only on the above properties and general results concerning closed positive currents (in particular Corollary 3.13 of [DS13]). ${ }^{2}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The only changes in this proof are that (1) $\\mathbf{P}^{2}(\\mathbf{C})$ should be replaced by $X(\\mathbf{C})$ and the line at infinity by $X \\backslash \\mathcal{M}_{D}$; and (2) the function $\\log \\left(1+\\|z\\|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}$ should be replaced by a smooth Green function associated to the $\\mathbf{R}$-divisor $\\theta_{f, X}^{+}$.\n\nThen, one gets directly the following fact (which corresponds to a weak version of Theorem 6.5 of [DS13], with the same proof):\n\nTheorem 8.2. The set $\\overline{K^{+}(f)}$ (resp. $\\overline{K^{-}(f)}$ ) supports a unique closed positive current, namely $T_{f}^{+}=d d^{c} G_{f}^{+}$(resp. $T_{f}^{-}$) up to multiplication by a positive constant.\n\nConsequently, we get the following result: Given any algebraic curve $C_{0} \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{D}$, the sequence of currents $\\lambda_{1}(f)^{-n}\\left\\{\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{*} C_{0}\\right\\}$ converges towards a positive multiple of $T_{f}^{+}$as $n$ goes to $+\\infty$ (see Corollary 6.7 of [DS13]). Thus, $T_{f}^{+}$can be approximated by a sequence of currents of integration on algebraic curves of a fixed genus (properly renormalized); in this context, one can apply the theory of strongly approximable laminar currents, as developed by Dujardin (see [Can14, Duj04, Duj05] for an introduction and \u00a78.3).\n\nThis rigidity results provides automatic equidistribution theorems for $(1,1)$ positive currents. We shall need the following specific application.\n\nIf $q$ is a saddle periodic point of $f$, then its stable manifold $W^{s}(q)$ is biholomorphic to the complex line ${ }^{3}$. Denote by $\\xi: \\mathbf{C} \\rightarrow W^{s}(q) \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ a one to one holomorphic parametrization of $W^{s}(q) ; \\xi$ is an entire holomorphic curve. To such a curve, one can associate a family of currents of mass 1, constructed as follows. One fixes a K\u00e4hler form $\\kappa$ on $X(\\mathbf{C})$ and one measures lengths, areas and volumes with respect to this form. For instance, if $\\mathbb{D}_{r} \\subset \\mathbf{C}$ is the disk of radius $r$ centered at the origin, then\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Area}\\left(\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)\\right)=\\int_{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)} \\kappa=\\int_{\\mathbb{D}_{r}} \\xi^{*} \\kappa\n$$\n\nis the area of the image of $\\mathbb{D}_{r}$ by $\\xi$. Averaging with respect to $d r / r$, one introduces the function\n\n$$\nN(R)=\\int_{t=0}^{R} \\operatorname{Area}\\left(\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\frac{d t}{t}\n$$\n\nNow, for each disk $\\mathbb{D}_{r}$, one can consider the current of integration over $\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)$ : to a smooth form $\\alpha$ of type $(1,1)$, this current $\\left\\{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)\\right\\}$ associates the number\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)\\right\\}\\right| \\alpha\\right\\rangle=\\int_{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)} \\alpha=\\int_{\\mathbb{D}_{r}} \\xi^{*} \\alpha\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ Indeed, it is a Riemann surface, it is homeomorphic to $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$, and $f$ acts on it as a contraction fixing $q$, so $W^{s}(q)$ cannot be a disk and Riemann uniformization theorem says that it is a copy of $\\mathbf{C}$\n\nTaking averages with respect to the weight $d r / r$ one obtains the following family of currents, parametrized by a radius $R>0$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\langle N_{\\xi}(R) \\mid \\alpha\\right\\rangle & =\\frac{1}{N(R)} \\int_{t=0}^{R}\\left\\langle\\left\\{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{r}\\right)\\right\\} \\mid \\alpha\\right\\rangle \\frac{d t}{t} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{N(R)} \\int_{t=0}^{R} \\int_{\\xi\\left(\\mathbb{D}_{R}\\right)} \\alpha \\frac{d t}{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe normalization by $1 / N(R)$ assures that the mass $\\left\\langle N_{\\xi}(R) \\mid \\kappa\\right\\rangle$ is equal to 1 for every $R>0$. From an inequality of Ahlfors, and from the compactness of the space of positive currents of mass 1 , there are sequences of radii $\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ such that $N_{\\xi}\\left(R_{n}\\right)$ converges to a closed positive current $S$. A priori, such a closed positive current $S$ depends on the choice of the sequence $R_{n}$; if there is a unique closed positive current $S$ that can be obtained as such a limit, one says that there is a unique Ahlfors-Nevanlinna current (namely $S$ ) associated to $\\xi$.\nCorollary 8.3 (Proposition 4.10, Corollary 4.11 [DS13]). Let q be a saddle periodic point of $f$. Let $\\xi: \\mathbf{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ be a holomorphic parametrization of the stable manifold of $f$. Then, there is a unique Ahlfors-Nevanlinna current associated to $\\xi$, and this current is equal to $T_{f}^{+}$.\n8.3. Laminarity, Pesin theory and consequence. The measure $\\mu_{f}=T_{f}^{+} \\wedge T_{f}^{-}$is an ergodic measure of positive (and maximal) entropy for $f$, and tools from Pesin theory can be used to describe the dynamics of $f$ with respect to this measure. In particular, in our setting, one can apply the work of Bedford, Lyubich, and Smillie in [BLS93] or the work of Dujardin in [Duj04].\nDefinition 8.4. (i) A family of disjoint horizontal graphs $\\Gamma$ in $\\mathbb{D} \\times \\mathbb{D}$ is called a flow box. If it is equipped with a measure $\\lambda$ on $\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{D}$ we call it a measured flow box. It defines a closed positive current $T_{\\Gamma, \\lambda}$ in $\\mathbb{D} \\times \\mathbb{D}$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle T_{\\Gamma, \\lambda}, \\alpha\\right\\rangle=\\int_{a \\in \\mathbb{D}} \\int_{\\Gamma_{a}} \\alpha \\mathrm{~d} \\lambda(a)\n$$\n\n(ii) A current $T$ is uniformly laminar if for every $x \\in \\operatorname{Supp} T$, there exist an open subset $V \\ni x$ such that $V$ is biholomorphic to a bidisk and a measured flow box $(\\Gamma, \\lambda)$ in $V$ such that $T_{\\mid V}=T_{\\Gamma, \\lambda}$.\n(iii) A current is laminar if there exists a family of disjoint measured flow boxes $\\left(\\Gamma_{i}, \\lambda_{i}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\nT=\\sum_{i} T_{\\Gamma_{i}, \\lambda_{i}}\n$$\n\n(iv) A current is strongly approximable if it is the weak limit of a sequence of integration currents $\\frac{1}{d_{n}}\\left[C_{n}\\right]$ such that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{genus}\\left(C_{n}\\right)+\\sum_{p \\in \\operatorname{Sing}\\left(C_{n}\\right)} n_{p}\\left(C_{n}\\right)=O\\left(d_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\n(v) A current is diffuse if it does not charge algebraic curves.\n\nThe main result of [Duj05] is that if $X$ is a projective rational surface and $T$ is a strongly approximable diffuse current on $X$, then $T$ is laminar and for every flow box $\\Gamma, T_{\\mid \\Gamma}$ is uniformly laminar. The discussion after Theorem 8.2 shows that $T_{f}^{+}$and $T_{f}^{-}$are strongly approximable currents. They are also diffuse by Proposition 6.3 of [DF01].\nDefinition 8.5. If $S_{1}, S_{2}$ are two uniformly laminar diffuse currents with a representation\n\n$$\nS_{i}=\\int_{A_{i}}\\left[D_{a, i}\\right] d \\mu_{i}(a)\n$$\n\nthen we define the geometric intersection of $S_{1}, S_{2}$ as\n\n$$\nS_{1} \\bigwedge S_{2}:=\\int_{A_{1}} \\int_{A_{2}}\\left[D_{a, 1} \\cap D_{b, 2}\\right] d \\mu_{1}(a) \\otimes d \\mu_{2}(b)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left[D_{a, 1} \\cap D_{b, 2}\\right]$ is the sum of Dirac masses at the intersection point if the intersection is finite and 0 otherwise. We extend the definition of geometric intersection to sums of uniformly laminar currents by taking geometric intersection with respect to each term of the sum. We say that a product is geometric if $S_{1} \\wedge S_{2}=S_{1} \\bigwedge S_{2}$.\nDefinition 8.6. A Pesin box is a pair $(U, K)$ where $U$ is an open subset isomorphic to a bidisk $\\mathbb{D} \\times \\mathbb{D}$ and a compact $K \\subset U$ of positive $\\mu_{f}$-measure such that\n(i) Every point in $K$ is a hyperbolic point of $f$.\n(ii) The local stable and unstable manifolds of the points of $K$ are vertical and horizontal graphs in $U$.\n(iii) For all pair of distinct points $(x, y) \\in K^{2}, W_{\\text {loc }}^{s}(x) \\cap W_{\\text {loc }}^{u}(y)$ is a singleton contained in $K$.\n\nIn particular, the local stable and unstable manifolds define a lamination $K^{s}$ and $K^{u}$ in $U$. By the main theorem of [Duj05], $T_{f \\mid K^{s}}^{+}$is uniformly laminar so there exists a transverse measure $\\lambda_{K}^{+}$such that\n\n$$\nT_{f \\mid K^{s}}^{+}=T_{K^{s}, \\lambda_{K}^{+}}\n$$\n\nTheorem 8.7 (Theorem 1, Theorem 5.2 of [Duj04]). The currents $T_{f}^{+}, T_{f}^{-}$are diffuse strongly approximable and therefore laminar and the laminar structure is compatible with Pesin theory. The current $T_{f}^{+}$is equal to\n\n$$\nT_{f}^{+}=\\sum_{(U, K)} T_{K^{s}, \\lambda_{K}^{+}}\n$$\n\nand since the potentials of $T_{f}^{ \\pm}$are continuous, the product $T_{f}^{+} \\wedge T_{f}^{-}$is geometric. Thus, the measure $\\mu_{f}$ has a product structure with respect to the laminations induced by the local stable and unstable manifolds.\n\nProof of Theorem 8.1. We apply the following argument taken from Section 9 of [BLS93] and [Duj04] \u00a75.2. Pick a saddle periodic point $q$ of $f$, take a small neighborhood $W$ of $q$, and consider its stable manifold, parametrized by $\\xi: \\mathbf{C} \\rightarrow W^{s}(q)$. Take a Pesin box $(U, K)$. Since the Ahlfors-Nevanlinna current of $\\xi$ coincides with $T_{f}^{+}$, each disk of $K^{s}$ is a limit of disks $\\xi\\left(D_{i}\\right)$, for some topological disks $D_{i} \\subset \\mathbf{C}$. Now, $\\mu_{f}(K)>0$ and by the product structure we have\n\n$$\n\\mu_{f \\mid K}=T_{f \\mid K^{s}}^{+} \\bigwedge^{1} T_{f \\mid K^{u}}^{-}\n$$\n\nThus $T_{f}^{+}$and $T_{f}^{-}$give mass to $K^{s}$ and $K^{u}$ respectively. Since the laminations $K^{u}$ and $K^{s}$ intersect transversaly, one finds a disk $\\xi\\left(D_{i}\\right)$ that intersects $K^{u}$ transversaly. Then, if one applies $f^{N}$ with $N$ large, the preimages of $\\xi\\left(D_{i}\\right) \\cap K^{u}$ approach the point $q$, and the Inclination lemma (or Lambda lemma see [PDM82] \u00a77.1) implies that the images of the leaves of $K^{u}$ are (very large) disks which, in the neighborhood $W$ of $q$, converge towards $W^{u}(q)$ (in the $C^{1}$ topology). We thus obtain a sequence of uniformly laminar currents\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{f}^{n}}\\left(f^{n}\\right)_{*}\\left(T_{f \\mid K^{u}}^{-}\\right)_{\\mid W} \\leqslant T_{f}^{-}\n$$\n\nDoing the same with the unstable manifold $W^{u}(q)$ and the dynamics of $f^{-N}$, one pulls back $K^{s}$ near $q$. Thus we get the sequence of measures\n\n$$\n\\mu_{n}:=\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{f}^{2 n}}\\left(\\left(f^{n}\\right)^{*} T_{f \\mid K^{s}}^{+}\\right)_{\\mid W} \\bigwedge^{1}\\left(\\left(f^{n}\\right)_{*} T_{f \\mid K^{u}}^{-}\\right)_{\\mid W} \\leqslant \\mu_{f}\n$$\n\nthat gives mass to $W$. Since this work for any neighborhood of $q$, this point is in the support of $\\mu_{f}$ and the closure of the saddle periodic points are contained in the support of $\\mu_{f}$. Thus, Theorem 8.1 is proven.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 9. Proof of Theorem A \n\nThe proof of Theorem A relies on the following proposition.\nProposition 9.1. Let $f \\in \\operatorname{Aut}\\left(\\mathcal{M}_{D}\\right)$ be a loxodromic automorphism with $D=0$ or $D=2-$ $2 \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)$ and let $v$ be an archimedean place.

Then\n\nby Theorem 7.3 we have equality of the equilibrium measures of $f$ and $g$ at every place so in particular at every archimedean place. Fix $v$ one of them. Suppose that $f$ and $g$ do not share a common iterate, then $\\left(g^{n}(q(f))\\right)_{n}$ is unbounded. Let $\\mu=\\mu_{f, v}=\\mu_{g, v}$. Since $\\operatorname{Supp} \\mu=\\operatorname{Supp} \\mu_{f, v}=\\operatorname{Supp} \\mu_{g, v}$, we have that $\\operatorname{Supp} \\mu$ is a compact subset of $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ invariant by $f$ and $g$. Since $q(f) \\in \\operatorname{Supp} \\mu_{f, v}=\\operatorname{Supp} \\mu$ we get that $\\left(g^{n}(q(f))\\right) \\subset \\operatorname{Supp} \\mu$ which is a contradiction.\n9.1. Construction of the saddle fixed point $q(f)$. Suppose first that $D=0$. Up to taking an iterate of $f$ we can suppose that there exists a loxodromic element $\\Phi_{f} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ such that $f=f_{\\Phi_{f}}$. Denote by $p(f)=p\\left(f_{\\Phi_{f}}\\right)$ and $q(f)=q\\left(f_{\\Phi_{f}}\\right)$ the fixed points constructed using Minsky theorem. These two fixed point are saddle fixed points by [McM96] Corollary 3.19. The fixed point $q(f)$ corresponds to a representation $\\rho_{\\infty}: F_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$, one can show that $\\rho_{\\infty}$ also satisfies Theorem 4.4 even though the punctured torus is not compact. One can also show that for any automorphism $g$ of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$ the differential of $g$ at $(0,0,0)$ has order 1 or 2 , thus $p(f), q(f) \\neq(0,0,0)$ and it is a smooth point of $\\mathcal{M}_{0}$.\n\nSuppose now that $D=2-2 \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{q}$. Following $\\S 4.5$, for any $\\Phi_{f} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ we define $q(f)=$ $\\rho_{\\infty}\\left(\\Phi_{f}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{M}_{D}$.\n9.2. The sequence $\\left(g^{n}(q(f))\\right)$ is unbounded. Suppose $D=0$ we can consider $S$ as the flat torus $T=\\mathbf{R}^{2} / \\mathbf{Z}^{2}$ with a puncture at the origin, i.e. $S=T \\backslash\\{0\\}$, or as a complete hyperbolic surface $X$ of finite area (we fix such a hyperbolic structure, it corresponds to some point $X$ in the Teichm\u00fcller space $\\operatorname{Teich}(S) \\simeq \\mathbb{D})$.\n\nWe refer to $\\S 1.4$ and $\\S 1.5$ of [Ota96] for the defintions of measured laminations and the classifications of elements in $\\operatorname{Mod}(S)$ for $S$ a real compact surface with negative Euler characteristic. An element $f$ of $\\mathrm{Out}^{+}\\left(F_{2}\\right)$ is pseudo-Anosov if the corresponding matrix $A_{f} \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ has $\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(A_{f}\\right)^{2}>4$. In that case, the matrix has two eigenvalues $\\lambda(f)>1$ and $1 / \\lambda(f)<1$ and the mapping class is represented by a linear automorphism of the torus $T$ (fixing the origin $o$ ) with stable and unstable linear foliations. In the hyperbolic surface $X$, these foliations give rise to two measured laminations $F_{-}$and $F_{+}$(by geodesic lines). If $C \\subset S$ is a closed curve (represented by some geodesic in $X$ ), one can define two intersection numbers $i\\left(C, F_{+}\\right)$and $i\\left(C, F_{-}\\right)$; they depend only on the free homotopy class of $C$. The product $j(C)=i\\left(C, F_{+}\\right) i\\left(C, F_{-}\\right)$is $f$-invariant, because $f$ stretches $F_{+}$by a dilatation factor $\\lambda(f)>1$, and contracts $F_{-}$by $1 / \\lambda(f)$; if $C$ is not homotopic to a loop around the puncture $j(C)$ is strictly positive (any closed geodesic is transverse to $F_{+}$and $F_{-}$).\n\nIf $D=2-2 \\cos (\\pi / q)$, let $S$ be the genus one torus with an orbifold singularity of order $q$. We have seen that there exists a characteristic finite covering $\\tilde{S} \\rightarrow S$ with $\\tilde{S}$ a compact surface of negative Euler characteristic. We let $X=\\mathbb{H}^{2} / \\Gamma$ be a hyperbolic surface homeomorphic to $\\tilde{S}$ (i.e $X \\in \\operatorname{Teich}(\\tilde{S})$ ). If $f \\in \\mathrm{Out}^{+}\\left(F_{2}\\right)$ is pseudo-Anosov then it lifts to a pseudo-Anosov $\\tilde{f} \\in$ $\\operatorname{Mod}(X)=\\operatorname{Out}^{+}\\left(F_{2}\\right)$ pseudo-Anosov also. In that case, there exist two measured laminations $F_{+}$and $F_{-}$over $\\tilde{S}$ (the stable and the unstable one) Proposition 1.5.1 of [Ota96]. We have\n\nthat for any geodesic $\\gamma \\in \\bar{S}$,\n\n$$\n\\frac{(\\bar{f})_{*}^{ \\pm k} \\gamma}{\\ell\\left((\\bar{f})_{*}^{ \\pm k} \\gamma\\right)} \\xrightarrow[k \\rightarrow+\\infty]{ } F_{ \\pm}\n$$\n\nin the sense of measured laminations. (This also holds in the case $D=0$ ). Here $\\ell$ is the length induced by the hyperbolic structure from the quotient $\\mathbb{H}^{2} / \\Gamma$ so $\\ell\\left((\\bar{f})_{*}^{ \\pm k} \\gamma\\right)$ grows like $\\lambda(\\bar{f})^{k}$. We also have that $j(\\gamma)=i\\left(\\gamma, F_{+}\\right) i\\left(\\gamma, F_{-}\\right)$is $f$-invariant as $i\\left(\\tilde{f}_{*}(\\gamma), F_{ \\pm}\\right)=\\lambda(\\bar{f})^{\\mp 1} i\\left(\\gamma, F_{ \\pm}\\right)$and if $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, then $j(\\gamma)>0$. To unify the notations we will still denote by $f$ the lift $\\bar{f}$ of $f$ to $X$.\n\nLemma 9.2. If $f$ and $g$ are two loxodromic elements of $\\mathrm{Out}^{+}\\left(F_{2}\\right) \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ generating a non-elementary subgroup of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$, then given any geodesic $\\gamma \\subset X, j\\left(g^{n}(\\gamma)\\right)$ goes to $+\\infty$ as $n$ goes to $+\\infty$.\n\nProof. Let $G_{+}$and $G_{-}$be the unstable and stable laminations associated to $g$ in $X$. Since $f$ and $g$ generate a non-elementary subgroup of $G L_{2}(\\mathbf{Z}), G_{+}$is transverse to both $F_{+}$and $F_{-}$(equivalently, the four fixed points of $A_{f}$ and $A_{g}$ on $\\mathbf{P}^{1}(\\mathbf{R})$ are distinct). Thus, by Equation (174) $j\\left(g^{n}(C)\\right) \\simeq \\lambda(g)^{n} i\\left(G_{+}, F_{+}\\right) i\\left(G_{-}, F_{-}\\right)$by continuity of the intersection number (see [Ota96] p.151).\n\nLemma 9.3. Let $f$ and $g$ be two loxodromic elements of $\\mathrm{Out}^{+}\\left(F_{2}\\right) \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$ generating a non-elementary subgroup of $\\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{Z})$. Let $\\gamma \\subset X$ be a geodesic, and let $[\\gamma]$ be its free homotopy class. Then the sequence $g^{n}[\\gamma]$ intersects each orbit of $f$ only finitely many times.\n\nProof. This follows from the previous lemma and the fact that $j(\\cdot)$ is $f$-invariant so it is constant in each orbit of $f$.\n\nRecall the definition of $M_{\\Phi_{f}}, \\bar{M}_{\\Phi_{f}}, \\rho_{\\infty}$ and $\\alpha_{f}$ from Theorem 4.4 (here we consider $f \\in$ $\\operatorname{Mod}(\\bar{S})$ if we are in the orbifold case). In $M_{\\Phi_{f}}$, the number of simple closed geodesics of length $\\leqslant L$ is finite (for every $L>0$ ); thus, in $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi_{f}}$, given any upper bound $L$, there are only finitely many homotopy classes of simple closed curves up to the action of $f^{\\mathbf{Z}}$ (Note that, since $\\alpha_{f}$ acts by isometry, each closed geodesic $C \\subset \\bar{M}_{f}$ gives rise to infinitely many geodesics $\\alpha_{f}^{n}(C)$ with the exact same length).\nProof of Proposition 9.1 (2). Fix a generator $a$ in $\\pi_{1}(S)$ where $S$ is either the punctured torus or the genus 1 torus with an orbifold singularity of index $q$. Set $k$ to be the index of $\\pi_{1}(\\bar{S})$ in $\\pi_{1}(S)$. and $k=1$ otherwise. The element $a^{k}$ gives rise to a closed geodesic $A$ in $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi_{f}}$. From these preliminaries and the previous lemma, the sequence of homotopy classes $g^{n}\\left(a^{k}\\right)$ corresponds to a sequence of closed geodesics in $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi_{f}}$, with length going to infinity because $f$ acts by isometry on $\\bar{M}_{\\Phi_{f}}$.\n\nNow, $g^{n}\\left(a^{k}\\right)$ corresponds to a (conjugacy class of a) matrix $\\rho_{\\infty}\\left(g^{n}\\left(a^{k}\\right)\\right) \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})$, and the trace of this matrix is related to the length of the geodesic by a simple formula; in particular, the fact that the length goes to infinity implies that the modulus of the trace goes to $+\\infty$. Since\n\nfor any matrix $A \\in \\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C}), \\operatorname{Tr} A^{k}$ is a polynomial in $\\operatorname{Tr} A$ we get that $\\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\rho_{\\infty}\\left(g^{n}(a)\\right)\\right)$ goes to infinity. This implies that the orbit of $q(f)$ under the action of $g$ on $\\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ is discrete, going to infinity.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 10.

Now, if $f, g$ do not share a common iterate, then the orbit of $q(f)$ under $g_{0}$ is unbounded by Proposition 9.1. Thus, for all $k \\in \\mathbf{Z}$, we have $g_{0}^{k}(q(f)) \\neq q(f)$.

If $D \\in \\mathbf{C}$ is transcendental, then for all $k \\in \\mathbf{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}$, there exists $p \\in \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ such that\n\n$$\nf_{D}(p)=p \\text { and } g_{D}^{\\ell}(p) \\neq p, \\forall 1 \\leqslant \\ell \\leqslant k\n$$\n\nUsing the lemma, we can conclude because $f_{D}$ admits a finite number of fixed points since $f_{D}$ does not admit an invariant curve, thus we must have $\\operatorname{Per}\\left(f_{D}\\right) \\neq \\operatorname{Per}\\left(g_{D}\\right)$.\n\nProof of the lemma. Notice that this statement does not depend on the transcendental parameter $D$. Indeed, let $D^{\\prime}$ be another transcendental parameter, then there exists a Galois automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Gal}(\\mathbf{C} / \\overline{\\mathbf{Q}})$ that exchange $D$ and $D^{\\prime}$. Since the family of surfaces $\\mathcal{M}_{D}$ gives a foliation of $\\mathbf{C}^{3}$ we can view a point $p \\in \\mathcal{M}_{D}(\\mathbf{C})$ as a point in $\\mathbf{C}^{3}$ and apply $\\sigma$ to each coordinates, we denote by $p^{\\sigma} \\in \\mathbf{C}^{3}$ the new obtained point. We apply $\\sigma$ to (176) to get\n\n$$\nf_{\\sigma(D)}\\left(p^{\\sigma}\\right)=p^{\\sigma} \\text { and } g_{\\sigma(D)}^{\\ell}\\left(p^{\\sigma}\\right) \\neq p^{\\sigma}, \\forall 1 \\leqslant \\ell \\leqslant k\n$$\n\nNow, fix $k \\geqslant 1$. For any transcendental parameter $t$ small enough we have\n\n$$\nf_{t}\\left(c_{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right)=c_{\\varepsilon}(t)\n$$\n\nby construction of the curve $c_{\\varepsilon}$ and\n\n$$\n\\forall 1 \\leqslant \\ell \\leqslant k, g_{t}^{k}\\left(c_{\\varepsilon}(t)\\right) \\neq c_{\\varepsilon}(t)\n$$\n\nby continuity since we have $g_{0}^{m}(q(f)) \\neq q(f)$ for all $m \\in \\mathbf{Z}$.
