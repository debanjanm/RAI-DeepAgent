      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nGiven an infinite graph $G=(V, E)$ a sequence $r=\\left\\{v_{n} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\} \\subseteq V$ is called a ray of the graph $G$ if it is a one-to-one sequence such that $\\left\\{v_{n}, v_{n+1}\\right\\} \\in E$ for all $n \\in \\omega$. Halin's end degree conjecture concerns configurations of equivalence classes of rays, the equivalence classes are called ends and they are determined by the following relation: If $r_{0}, r_{2} \\subseteq V$ are rays of $G$ and there is a ray $r_{1}$ of $G$ such that $r_{0} \\cap r_{1}$ and $r_{1} \\cap r_{2}$ are both infinite, then $r_{0}$ and $r_{2}$ are related. Ends and the degree of an end were both first defined in [6]. The degree of an end $\\varepsilon$, denoted by $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)$, is the supremum of the cardinalities of families $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ whose elements are mutually disjoint ${ }^{1}$.\n\nWe address the problem of determining what cases of Halin's end degree conjecture can be proved or disproved in $Z F C$ alone. This paper might be of interest of graph theorists as well as set theorists, so we include some basic definitions that\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ It is a theorem due to Halin [6] that the supremum is always attained, we refer the reader to $[2]$\n\nusually would not figure in more specialized literature. We start by defining basic Graph Theoretic concepts and stating Halin's end degree conjecture:\n\n- (degree of an end) If $\\varepsilon$ is an end of a graph $G$, then $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of the families $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ such that the elements of $\\mathcal{F}$ are mutually disjoint.\n- (interior of a path) If $c=\\left\\{p_{1}, \\cdots, p_{m}\\right\\}$ is a path of a graph $G$ then the interior of $c$ is the set $\\left\\{p_{2}, \\cdots, p_{m-1}\\right\\}$, we denote the interior of $c$ by $c^{o}$.\n- (independent paths) If $\\mathcal{R}$ is a collection of rays of a graph $G$ and $c_{0}, c_{1}$ are paths of $G$, then $c_{0}, c_{1}$ are $\\mathcal{R}$-independent if $c_{0}^{o} \\cap \\bigcup \\mathcal{R}=\\emptyset=c_{1}^{o} \\cap \\bigcup \\mathcal{R}$ and $c_{0}^{o} \\cap c_{1}^{o}=\\emptyset$.\n- ( $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$-associated graph) Let $\\varepsilon$ be the end of a graph $G$ and $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$ be such that $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ is a set of mutually disjoint rays, $\\mathcal{P}$ is a set of $\\mathcal{R}$-independent paths. The $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$-associated graph $(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ is a pair such that $\\mathcal{V}=\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\left\\{r_{0}, r_{1}\\right\\} \\in \\mathcal{E}$ if and only if there are infinitely many paths in $\\mathcal{P}$ that are mutually disjoint and connect $r_{0}$ to $r_{1}$.\n- (Ray Graph) If $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$ is a pair like in the previous bullet, if the associated graph $(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$ is connect then we call it ray graph.\n\nDefinition 1 (Halin's end degree conjecture). Let $\\kappa$ be a regular cardinal. We say that Halin's end degree conjecture holds for $\\kappa$ if for every graph $G$ and for every end $\\varepsilon$ of $G$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=\\kappa$, there is a pair $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$ such that $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$, the elements of $\\mathcal{R}$ are mutually disjoint, $|\\mathcal{R}|=\\kappa, \\mathcal{P}$ is a set of $\\mathcal{R}$-independent paths and $(\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})$, the $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{P})$-associated graph, is connected.\n\nNotation. When Halin's end degree conjecture holds for $\\kappa$ we will say that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds.\n\nHalin's end degree conjecture states that Halin's end degree conjecture holds for all cardinals $\\kappa$ and it was conjecture in [7]. The conjecture was answered 20 years later in [3] where it was proved that whether it holds or not depends on the degree $\\kappa$ of the ends.\n\nTheorem (Geshcke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz [3]). The following two assertions about $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ are provable in ZFC:\n(1) $\\mathrm{HC}\\left(\\aleph_{n}\\right)$ holds for all $n \\in \\omega$,\n(2) $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails for all $\\kappa$ with $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\in\\left\\{\\mu^{+}: \\operatorname{cf}(\\mu)=\\omega\\right\\}$; in particular, $\\mathrm{HC}\\left(\\aleph_{1}\\right)$ fails.\n\nFurthermore, the following assertions about $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ are consistent:\n(3) Under GCH, $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds for all cardinals not excluded by (2).\n(4) However, for all $\\kappa$ with $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\in\\left\\{\\aleph_{\\alpha} \\mid \\omega<\\alpha<\\omega_{1}\\right\\}$ it is consistent with $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\mathrm{CH}$ that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails, and similarly, also for all $\\kappa$ strictly greater than the least cardinal $\\mu$ with $\\mu=\\aleph_{\\mu}$.\nLoosely speaking, if $\\kappa$ is a regular cardinal, Halin's end degree conjecture for ends of degree $\\kappa$ states that in all ends of degree $\\kappa$ there is a subdivision of a graph of the form $S \\times \\omega$, where $S$ is a $\\kappa$-star ${ }^{2}$. See [3, Lemma 3.1] for a formulation of $H C$ in terms of stars.\n\nIn [3] it is proved that for any sufficiently large regular cardinal $\\kappa$, it is consistent that $H C(\\kappa)$ fails, see item (4) above, we will approach the problem of determining when $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds from a global perspective. Building on [3], we will verify in Lemma 2.2 that there is a proper class of regular cardinals such that $H C(\\kappa)$ holds. This answers [3, Questions 1), 3)] positively. For a consistently negative answer to [3, Question 2)] we refer the reader to [1].\n\nIn section 2 we prove some positive results of $H C(\\kappa)$ building on [3, Section 4].\nIn Section 3, the function will be defined as a cardinal function that serves to track $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinals. Our main result is Theorem 1.1 which is proved in Section 3, it establishes that for a given cardinal $\\kappa$, it is possible to determine whether $H C(\\kappa)$ holds depending on which interval $[\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma), \\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma+1)]$ the cardinal $\\kappa$ belongs, the only exception is the case where $\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma)$ is a fixed point of the $\\aleph$ function with $c f(\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma))=\\aleph_{0}$ and $\\kappa \\in[\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma), \\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma+1)]$.\nDefinition 2 ([9]). A cardinal $\\kappa$ is said $\\theta$-inaccessible if and only if for all $\\mu<\\kappa$ it follows that $\\mu^{\\theta}<\\kappa$.\nNotation. If $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are cardinals such that $\\mu \\leq \\lambda$ we set $(\\mu, \\lambda]:=\\{\\theta \\leq \\lambda \\mid$ $\\theta$ is a cardinal and $\\mu<\\theta \\leq \\lambda\\}$. Variations of this notation occur in the text but they are all self-explanatory.\nTheorem 1.1. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\neg}: \\mathrm{ON} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CARD}$, such that for $\\beta \\in O R D$\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\beta)= \\begin{cases}2 & \\text { if } \\beta=0 \\\\ \\mathfrak{c} & \\text { if } \\beta=1 \\\\ \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)^{\\omega} & \\text { if } \\beta=\\gamma+1 \\text { for some ordinal } \\gamma \\text { such that } \\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma) \\neq \\aleph_{0} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\gamma)^{\\omega} & \\text { if } \\beta=\\gamma+1 \\text { for some limit ordinal } \\gamma \\text { such that } \\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\aleph_{0} \\\\ \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in \\beta} \\boldsymbol{\\neg}(\\alpha) & \\text { if } \\beta \\text { is a limit ordinal }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2} \\mathrm{~A} \\kappa$-star is a graph of the form $G=\\left(\\left\\{v_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\},\\left\\{\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{\\alpha}\\right\\} \\mid 0<\\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\}\\right)$\n\nSuppose $\\kappa>\\mathfrak{c}$ is any cardinal and $\\gamma$ is an ordinal such that $\\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma)$ is not a fixedpoint of the $\\aleph$-function. The following hold:\n(a) If $\\kappa \\in(\\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma), \\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\neq \\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds,\n(b) If $\\kappa \\in(\\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma+1)]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\neq \\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails,\n(c) If $\\kappa \\in(\\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma+1)]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails\n(d) $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds if $\\kappa=\\mathfrak{N}(\\gamma)$ is a singular cardinal such that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$ or $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal.\n(e) $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds for all regular cardinals $\\kappa$ that are fixed-points of the function $\\mathfrak{N}$.\n\nIn particular, it follows from the item (a) that HC holds in the interval $\\left(\\mathfrak{c}, \\mathfrak{c}^{+\\omega}\\right]$; and it fails in the interval $\\left[\\mathfrak{c}^{+\\omega+1},\\left(\\mathfrak{c}^{+\\omega}\\right)^{\\omega}\\right]$.\n\nIn section 4 we comment on the relation between SCH and HC , deriving large cardinal strength from failures of the last, and verify that $H C$ fails on finite intervals in Meremovich's model. We have a last section 5 with questions we find interesting and relevant for further developments in this topic.",

      "text": "# 2 Positive cases of HC \n\nThe results in this section are based on the results on bipartite graphs of [3, Section 4]. By focusing on $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinals we are able to eliminate the hypothesis that appear in [3, Section 4], that $G C H$ holds. At the end of this section we use the techniques from [3] and apply our results on bipartite graphs in order to obtain positive instances of $H C(\\kappa)$.\n\nDefinition 3. A $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$-graph is a bipartite graph $G=(A, B, E)$, where\n\n- $E$ is the edge-relation on the set of vertices $A \\cup B$;\n- $|A|=\\lambda<\\kappa=|B|$\n- $(A \\times\\{b\\}) \\cap E$ is infinite, for every $b \\in B$; and\n- $A^{2} \\cap E=B^{2} \\cap E=\\emptyset$ - i.e., $A$ and $B$ are both independent sets.\n\nLemma 2.1. Let $(A, B, E)$ be a $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$-graph such that $(A \\times\\{b\\}) \\cap E$ is countable, for every $b \\in B$.\n\n(1) If $\\kappa$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and regular, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$, then there exists a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B, E)$.\n(2) If $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)<\\kappa, \\kappa$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal such that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and $\\lambda<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$, then there exists a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B, E)$.\n(3) [3, Lemma 4.4] If $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)>\\omega$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\neq \\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)$, then there is a $\\left(\\lambda^{\\prime}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B, E)$, for some $\\lambda^{\\prime}<\\lambda$.\n(4) If $\\kappa$ is a singular cardinal that is also a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and $c f(\\kappa)$ is a $\\omega$ inaccessible cardinal, then either there exists an $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B, E)$; or else there exists a sequence $\\left\\langle\\theta_{\\beta} \\mid \\beta<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)\\right\\rangle$ of regular $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinals cofinal in $\\kappa$ and a sequence $\\left\\langle\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}\\right) \\mid \\beta<c f(\\kappa)\\right\\rangle$ satisfying the following two conditions:\n(i) for each $\\beta<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ we have that $\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}\\right)$ is a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\theta_{\\beta}\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B)$\n(ii) for $\\beta<\\beta^{\\prime}<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ we have $A_{\\beta} \\cap A_{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset$ and $B_{\\beta} \\cap B_{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset$\n\nProof. (1) This follows from the proof of [3, Lemma 4.3]. Since $\\kappa$ is $\\omega$-inaccessible and $\\lambda<\\kappa$, we have $\\lambda^{\\omega}<\\kappa$. By the regularity of $\\kappa$, it follows that there exist $A^{\\prime} \\subseteq A$, and $B^{\\prime} \\subseteq B$, such that $\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|=\\aleph_{0} ;\\left|B^{\\prime}\\right|=|B|=\\kappa$; and $A^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{dom}((A \\times\\{b\\}) \\cap E)$, for all $b \\in B^{\\prime}$. Thus $\\left(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}\\right)$ is our desired $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B)$.\n(2) From $\\lambda<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$, it follows that $\\lambda^{\\omega}<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$. For every $b \\in B$ we have that $\\operatorname{dom}(A \\cap\\{b\\} \\cap E)$ is a countable subset of $A$. Thus there is $B^{\\prime} \\subseteq B$ such that $\\left|B^{\\prime}\\right|=\\kappa$ and there is $A^{\\prime} \\subseteq A$ such that for all $b \\in B^{\\prime}$ we have $A^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{dom}((A \\times\\{b\\}) \\cap E)$. Hence $\\left(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}\\right)$ is a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B)$.\n(4) This follows from the proof of [3, Lemma 4.6] replacing [3, Cor 4.5] by item (3) of this Lemma 2.1:\n\nSuppose there is no $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B)$. We will define a sequence $\\left\\langle\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}\\right)\\right.$ $\\beta<c f(\\kappa)\\rangle$ satisfying the following two conditions:\n(i) for each $\\beta<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ we have that $\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}\\right)$ is a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\mu_{\\beta}^{+}\\right)$-subgraph of $(A, B)$\n(ii) for $\\beta<\\beta^{\\prime}<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ we have $A_{\\beta} \\cap A_{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset$ and $B_{\\beta} \\cap B_{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\emptyset$.\n\nSuppose we have built a sequence $\\left\\langle\\left(A_{\\alpha}, B_{\\alpha}\\right) \\mid \\alpha<\\beta\\right\\rangle$ satisfying (i) and (ii). Let $A_{\\beta}^{\\prime}=A \\backslash \\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\beta} A_{\\beta}$ and\n\n$$\nB_{\\beta}^{\\prime}:=\\left\\{b \\in B \\backslash \\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\beta} B_{\\alpha} \\mid \\operatorname{dom}((A \\times\\{b\\}) \\cap E) \\cap A_{\\beta}^{\\prime} \\text { is infinite }\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince each $A_{\\alpha}$ is countable, it follows that $\\left|\\bigcup\\left\\{A_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha<\\beta\\right\\}\\right|<\\operatorname{cf} \\kappa$. If $\\left|B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\right|<\\kappa$, applying (3) of Lemma 2.1 we find a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $\\left(\\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\beta} A_{\\alpha}, B \\backslash B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\right)$, and hence a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of of $(A, B)$, which contradicts our hypothesis on $(A, B)$. Thus $\\left|B_{\\kappa}^{\\prime}\\right|=\\kappa$ and there is $B_{\\beta}^{\\prime \\prime} \\subset B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}$ such that $\\left|B_{\\beta}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right|=\\mu_{\\beta}^{+}$, and by (1) of Lemma 2.1 obtain a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\mu_{\\beta}^{+}\\right)$-subgraph $\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}\\right)$ of $(A, B)$ satisfying (i) and (ii) as desired.\n\nLet us introduce some more notation in order to state two results from [3] that we will need:\n\nDefinition 4 (Combs). Let $\\varepsilon$ be an end of a graph $G=(V, E)$ and $U \\subseteq V$ disjoint from $\\varepsilon$. An $(\\varepsilon, U)$-comb is a set of the form $C=R \\cup \\mathcal{D}$, where $R$ is a ray that belongs to $\\varepsilon$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of independent paths with ending points in $R$ and $U$. We say that $v \\in V$ is a teeth of a $(\\varepsilon, U)$ comb $C=R \\cup\\{D\\}$ if $v \\in C \\cap U$, we set $\\mathcal{T}(C)=\\{v \\in V \\mid v$ is a teeth of $C\\}$ and $\\mathcal{S}(C)=R$.\n\nSince Halin's conjecture can be phrased in terms of stars and we shall exploit that fact very often we introduce some notation on stars and ray stars. We refer the reader to [3, Lemma 3.1] for a formulation of Halin's end degree conjecture in terms of ray stars.\n\nDefinition 5 (Stars). Let $\\kappa$ be a cardinal. A $\\kappa$-star is a graph of the form $G=$ $\\left(\\left\\{v_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\},\\left\\{\\left\\{v_{0}, v_{\\alpha}\\right\\} \\mid 0<\\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\}\\right)$ such that $\\beta<\\gamma<\\kappa$ implies $v_{\\beta} \\neq v_{\\gamma}$. A $\\kappa$-star of rays is a graph $G$ consisting of a center ray $r_{0}$, rays $\\left\\{r_{\\alpha} \\mid 0<\\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\}$ which are called leaf rays of $G$ and for every $0<\\alpha<\\kappa$ there is a family $\\left\\{p_{n}^{\\alpha} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\}$ of independent paths from $r_{0}$ to $r_{\\alpha}$.\n\nWe need the following results from [3]:\nCombs Lemma. [3, Lemma 2.1] Let $\\varepsilon$ be an end of a graph $G$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ be a $\\kappa$-sized collection of disjoint rays belonging $\\varepsilon$. If $U$ is a countable set of vertices, and $\\mathcal{C}$ is an uncountable collection of internally disjoint $(\\varepsilon, U)$-combs of $G$, then $\\varepsilon$ contains a $|\\mathcal{C}|$-star of rays whose leaf rays are the spines of (a subset of) combs in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe Greedy Lemma. [3, Lemma 2.2] Let $\\varepsilon$ be an end of a graph $G$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ be a $\\kappa$-sized collection of disjoint rays belonging $\\varepsilon$. If $\\mathrm{cf}(\\kappa)>\\aleph_{1}$, then there exists a set of vertices $U$ of $G$, and a $\\kappa$-sized collection $\\mathcal{C}$ of internally disjoint $(\\varepsilon, U)$-combs of $G$, such that $|U|<\\kappa$ and all spines of $\\mathcal{C}$ are in $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nIn what follows $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$-graphs arise from sets of vertices and sets of internally disjoint combs $\\mathcal{C}$ whose spines $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{C})$ are contained in a given collection $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ for some end $\\varepsilon$.\n\nDefinition 6. Let $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$ be cardinals such that $\\kappa<\\lambda$. Let $\\varepsilon$ be an end of a graph $G, U \\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|=\\lambda$, and $\\mathcal{C}$ be a collection of internally disjoint combs of $G$ such that $\\kappa=|\\mathcal{C}|$ and for every $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ it holds that $\\mathcal{S}(C) \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ and $\\mathcal{T}(C) \\subseteq U$. The corresponding $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$-graph $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$ of $(U, \\mathcal{C})$ is defined as follows: $(v, C) \\in E$ if, and only if, $v \\in \\mathcal{T}(C)$.\n\nWe are ready to prove Lemma 2.2:\nLemma 2.2. $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds for all $\\omega$-inaccessible regular cardinals $\\kappa$.\nProof. Follows from the proof of [3, Proposition 5.1] replacing respectvely [3, Cor 4.2 and Cor 4.4] by itens (1) and (2) of Lemma 2.1, we include the details for the readers convenience. Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with an end $\\varepsilon$ of degree $\\kappa$. Let $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ be a family of pairwise disjoint rays such that $|\\mathcal{R}|=\\kappa$. Since $\\kappa>\\omega_{1}$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)=\\kappa$, by the Greedy Lemma, there exists $U \\subseteq V$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ such that $|U|=\\lambda<\\kappa$, $|\\mathcal{C}|=\\kappa$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of internally disjoint $(\\varepsilon, U)$-combs in $G$ with all spines in $\\mathcal{R}$. Now consider the corresponding $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$-graph $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$ of $(U, \\mathcal{C})$. If $|U|=\\aleph_{0}$, then, by Combs Lemma, there exists a ray graph contained in $\\varepsilon$. If $|U|>\\aleph_{0}$, setting $\\lambda=|U|$ we consider two cases: The first case is $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$, then by (1) of Lemma 2.1 we may find $\\left(U^{\\prime}, \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime}\\right)$ a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph of $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$ to which we can apply Combs Lemma and obtain a ray graph. The second case is $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)>\\omega$. In this case, we may apply (2) of Lemma 2.1 and obtain $\\left(U^{\\prime \\prime}, \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime \\prime}, E^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$ with $\\left|U^{\\prime \\prime}\\right|<\\lambda$ a $(\\lambda, \\kappa)$ subgraph of $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$. Iterated applications of (2) of Lemma 2.1 produces a finite decreasing sequence of cardinals which stops when we find a $(\\widetilde{U}, \\widetilde{\\mathcal{C}}, \\widetilde{E})$ which is a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-sub-graph of $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$ and again Combs Lemma ensures that there exists a ray graph as we sought.\n\nLemma 2.2 provides a positive answer for the following questions:\n\n- [3, Question 1)] Is Halin's conjecture true for any $\\kappa>\\aleph_{\\omega_{1}}$ such that $H C(\\kappa)$ ?\n- [3, Question 3)] Is it true that for every cardinal $\\kappa$ there is $f(\\kappa) \\geq \\kappa$, such that for every end $\\varepsilon$ of degree $f(\\kappa)$ contains a connected ray graph of size $\\kappa$ ?\n\nThe next corollary emphasizes that $H C$ holds for cardinals of the form $\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+}$this will be used to answer Question 3) mentioned above.\n\nCorollary 2.3. $\\mathrm{HC}\\left(\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+n}\\right)$ holds for every natural $n \\geq 1$. In particular, for every $n \\in \\omega$ we have that $\\mathrm{HC}\\left((\\mathfrak{c})^{+n}\\right)$ holds.\n\nProof. We have for every $n \\geq 1$ that $\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+n}$ is regular caridnal that is $\\omega$-inaccessible. Then, by Lemma 2.2 we have that $\\mathrm{HC}\\left(\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+n}\\right)$ holds for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nCorollary 2.4. For every cardinal $\\kappa$ there is $f(\\kappa) \\geq \\kappa$ such that every end $\\varepsilon$ of degree $f(\\kappa)$ contains a connected ray graph of size $\\kappa$\n\nProof. Given a cardinal $\\kappa$, if $\\kappa=\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+}$for some cardinal $\\mu$, then by Corollary 2.3 we can set $f(\\kappa)=\\kappa$. If $\\kappa$ is not of the form $\\left(\\mu^{\\omega}\\right)^{+}$, let $f(\\kappa)=\\left(\\kappa^{\\omega}\\right)^{+}$. By Corollary 2.3 , for every end $\\varepsilon$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=f(\\kappa)$ we can find a ray graph of cardinality $f(\\kappa)$ contained in $\\varepsilon$. By [3, Lema 3.1] we can find a $f(\\kappa)$-star of rays contained in $\\varepsilon$, in particular, we can find a $\\kappa$-star of rays contained in $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe following lemma will be crucial to deal with the singular cardinals in the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n\nLemma 2.5. Suppose that $\\kappa$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and that $c f(\\kappa)=\\omega$ or $c f(\\kappa)$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal. Then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds.\n\nProof. Given a graph $G$ with an end $\\varepsilon$ such that $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=\\kappa$, let $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ be a set of pairwise disjoint rays such that $|\\mathcal{F}|=\\kappa$.\n\nWe consider two cases: $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)=\\omega$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)>\\omega_{1}$. For the first case, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)=\\omega$, we proceed as in the proof of [3, Proposition 5.3] replacing [3, Proposition 5.1] by Lemma 2.2. Let $\\left\\langle\\mu_{n} \\mid n<\\omega\\right\\rangle$ be an increasing cofinal sequence of cardinals in $\\kappa$ such that for each $n<\\omega$ it holds that $\\left(\\mu_{n}\\right)^{\\omega}=\\mu_{n}$. For each $n<\\omega=\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$, by Corollary 2.3, there is $S_{n} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ a $\\mu_{n}^{+}$-star of rays with center $R_{n}$. Notice that $\\left|\\bigcup_{k<n} S_{k} \\cup \\bigcup_{k<\\omega} R_{k}\\right| \\leq \\mu_{n-1}^{+}$, therefore $\\mu_{n}^{+}$rays in $S_{n}$ are disjoint from $\\bigcup_{k<n} S_{k} \\cup \\bigcup_{k<\\omega} R_{k}$. Hence, we can find a set of $\\varepsilon-\\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} R_{n}$ internally disjoint combs. Applying the Combs Lemma we obtain a $\\kappa$-star of rays in $G$.\n\nFor the second case, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)>\\omega_{1}$, we use the argument of [3, Theorem 5.4] replacing [3, Cor 4.6] by item (1) of Lemma 2.1 and replacing [3, Proposition 5.1] by (4) of Lemma 2.1. Let $\\varepsilon$ be an end of $G$ with $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=\\kappa$. We may assume that $\\kappa$ is singular and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)>\\aleph_{1}$. Hence, by the Greedy Lemma, there are some set of vertices $U \\subset V(G)$ with $|U|<\\kappa$ and a $\\kappa$-sized family $\\mathcal{C}$ of internally disjoint $\\varepsilon-U$ combs. Consider $H=(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$, the corresponding $(|U|, \\kappa)$-graph of $(U, \\mathcal{C})$. By item (4) of Lemma 2.1, $H$ contains either an $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\kappa\\right)$-subgraph, in which case we are done by item (1) of Lemma 2.1 and Combs Lemma, or a collection of disjoint $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\theta_{\\beta}\\right)$ subgraphs for $\\left\\{\\theta_{\\beta} \\mid \\beta<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)\\right\\}$ cofinal in $\\kappa$ with all $\\theta_{\\beta}>\\max \\left\\{\\aleph_{\\omega+1}, \\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)\\right\\}$ regular and $\\omega$-inaccessible.\n\nLet $H_{\\beta}=\\left(A_{\\beta}, B_{\\beta}, E\\right)$ be a $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\theta_{\\beta}\\right)$-subgraph of $(U, \\mathcal{C}, E)$. As $\\theta_{\\beta}$ is $\\omega$-inaccessible, in particular we have that $2^{\\aleph_{0}}<\\theta_{\\beta}$. Hence by the regularity of $\\theta_{\\beta}$ we can find a $\\left\\{z_{n} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\} \\subseteq\\left[A_{\\beta}\\right]$ and $B_{\\beta}^{\\prime} \\subseteq B_{\\beta}$ with $\\left|B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\right|=\\theta_{\\beta}$ such that $\\left\\{z_{n}, b\\right\\} \\in E$ for all $b \\in B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}$ and for all $n \\in \\omega$. Let $H_{\\beta}^{\\prime}=\\left(Z, B_{\\beta}^{\\prime}\\right)$ be such complete $\\left(\\aleph_{0}, \\theta_{\\beta}\\right)$-subgraph of $H_{\\beta}$, by the Combs Lemma there is a $\\theta_{\\beta}$-star of rays $S_{\\beta}$.\n\nLet $r_{0}^{\\beta}$ be the center of each $\\theta_{\\beta}$-star of rays $S_{\\beta}$ and $r_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}$ be its leaf rays for $0<\\alpha<\\theta_{\\beta}$ and $\\beta<c f(\\kappa)$. By Lemma 2.2, we have that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa))$ holds, and we can obtain a $c f(\\kappa)$-star of rays $S$ of size $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ with leaf rays in $\\left\\{r_{0}^{\\beta} \\mid \\beta<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)\\right\\}$. Since $|S|<\\left|S_{\\beta}\\right|$ for all $\\beta$, shrinking $S_{\\beta}$ if necessary, we may assume that each $S_{\\beta} \\cap S=r_{0}^{\\beta}$.

The function $\\urcorner$ tracks $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinals.\n\nShelah's PCF Theory plays an important role in determining Halin's conjecture, in particular, we will resort to the $p p_{\\omega}$ operator.\n\nDefinition 7 (Scale and $p p_{\\omega}$ ). We say that a sequence of functions $\\left\\langle f_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha<\\kappa\\right\\rangle$ is a $\\kappa$-scale for $\\lambda$ if there is a set of regular cardinals $\\mathfrak{a}=\\left\\{\\kappa_{n} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\}$ such that the following hold:\n(a) $\\sup (a)=\\lambda$,\n(b) $n<m$ implies $\\kappa_{n}<\\kappa_{m}$,\n(c) $f_{\\alpha} \\in \\prod_{n \\in \\omega} \\kappa_{n}$ for every $\\alpha<\\kappa$\nand there is an ideal $J$ on $\\omega$ such that the following hold:\n(i) every bounded subset of $\\omega$ belongs to $J$;\n(ii) for all $\\alpha, \\beta<\\kappa$ such that $\\alpha<\\beta$, we have that $f_{\\alpha}<_{J} f_{\\beta}$; and\n(iii) for all $g \\in \\prod_{n \\in \\omega} \\kappa_{n}$, there is $\\alpha<\\kappa$ such that $g<_{J} f_{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe operator $p p_{\\omega}(\\lambda)$ is defined as\n\n$$\np p_{\\omega}(\\lambda)=\\sup \\{\\kappa \\mid \\text { there is a } \\kappa \\text {-scale for } \\lambda\\}\n$$\n\nWe will need the following result, due to Shelah, on the pseudo-power operator:\nPseudo-Power Theorem. [10, Ch II \u00a75, Ch IX \u00a72] Suppose that $\\lambda$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$. Then $\\mathrm{pp}_{\\omega}(\\lambda) \\leq \\lambda^{\\omega}$. Moreover, if $\\lambda$ is not a fixed-point of the $\\aleph$-function, then $\\mathrm{pp}_{\\omega}(\\lambda)=\\lambda^{\\omega}$ and $\\mathrm{pp}_{\\omega}(\\lambda)$ is not a weakly inaccessible cardinal.\n\nThe following result tells how the existence of $\\kappa$-scales for $\\lambda$ implies that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\n\nCounter-Examples from Scales. [3, Theorem 8.1] [3, Proposition 7.4] If $\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$ are cardinals, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda)=\\omega$ and there is a $\\kappa$-scale for $\\lambda$, then there is a graph $G$ with an end $\\varepsilon$ such that $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=\\kappa$ and for all regular cardinals $\\kappa^{\\prime}$ such that $\\lambda<\\kappa^{\\prime} \\leq \\kappa$ there is no ray graph of cardinality $\\kappa^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe statement in Counter-Examples from Scales. is stronger than what is presented in [3, Theorem 8.1], however, the proof provided in [3] also establishes this stronger result. The next lemma will be used to deal with $H C(\\kappa)$ when $\\kappa$ is singular.\n\nLemma 3.1. Suppose that $\\kappa$ and $\\mu$ are cardinals such that $\\omega_{2} \\leq \\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)<\\kappa, \\mu<\\kappa$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)<\\operatorname{cf}(\\mu)$. If there is a increasing sequence of regular cardinals greater than $\\mu,\\left\\langle\\mu_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)\\right\\rangle$, cofinal in $\\kappa$ such that for every $\\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ there is a graph $G_{\\alpha}$ with exactly one end $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}, \\operatorname{deg}\\left(\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}\\right)=\\mu_{\\alpha}$ with no ray graph of cardinality $\\geq \\mu$. Then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\n\nProof. We will build a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with an end $\\varepsilon$ of degree $\\kappa$ with no ray graph of size $\\kappa$. Suppose that the graphs $G_{\\alpha}$ from our hypothesis are mutually disjoint. Let $r=\\left\\{v_{n} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\}$ be a set disjoint from each $G_{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha \\in \\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$. We start defining our graph $G$ by adding $\\left\\{v_{n}, v_{n+1}\\right\\}$ to the set of edges of the graph for every $n \\in \\omega$. For each $\\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$, we fix a ray $t_{\\alpha} \\in G_{\\alpha}$ and add the vertices $\\left\\{\\left(v_{n},\\left(t_{\\alpha}\\right)_{n}\\right\\}\\right.$ to $G$ for every $\\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ and every $n \\in \\omega$, that concludes our definition of $G$. It readily follows that $G$ has only one end $\\varepsilon$ and $\\operatorname{deg}(\\varepsilon)=\\kappa$.\n\nSuppose that $\\mathcal{F}_{0} \\subseteq \\varepsilon$ is a collection of pairwise disjoint rays with $\\left|\\mathcal{F}_{0}\\right|=\\kappa$. Suppose towards a contradiction that there is $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_{0}$ with $|\\mathcal{F}|=\\kappa$ and a family of paths $\\mathcal{P}$ such that $(\\mathcal{F}, \\mathcal{P})$ is a ray graph of $G$. We will find an $\\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ such that there is a ray graph in $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\cap \\mathcal{F}$ of size $\\mu$.\n\nThe hypothesis that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\mu)>\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ implies that there is $\\alpha<\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ such that $|\\mathcal{F} \\cap$ $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\mid \\geq \\mu$. We will find a ray graph of $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}$ of cardinality $\\geq \\mu$ reaching a contradiction.\n\nRecall that $r=\\left\\{v_{n} \\mid n \\in \\omega\\right\\}$ is somewhat the center of $G$. We consider two cases, on the first case we suppose that $t_{\\alpha} \\notin \\mathcal{F}$. Given $z_{0}, z_{1}, w_{0}, w_{1}$ mutually disjoint elements of $\\mathcal{F} \\cap \\varepsilon_{\\alpha}$, such that there are $p, s \\in \\mathcal{P}$ that $p$ connects $z_{0}$ to $z_{1}$ and $s$ connects $w_{0}$ to $w_{1}, p \\cap r \\neq \\emptyset$ and $s \\cap r \\neq \\emptyset$. Then $p \\cap r \\cap s=\\emptyset$, since $\\mathcal{P}$ is a family of independent paths. Therefore the set of pair of rays $z_{0}, z_{1} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that there exists a path $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ connecting $z_{0}$ to $z_{1}$ and $p \\cap r \\neq \\emptyset$ is a countable set. Then we let $\\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of $w \\in \\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\cap \\mathcal{F}$ such that for every $u \\in \\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\cap \\mathcal{F}$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ that connects $u$ to $w$ we have that $p \\cap r=\\emptyset$. We let $\\mathcal{C}=\\left\\{p \\in \\mathcal{P} \\mid p \\subseteq G_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$. Then $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{C})$ is a ray graph in $\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}$ of cardinality $\\geq \\mu$ that we seek.\n\nOn the second case we assume that $t_{\\alpha} \\in \\mathcal{F}$. We let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the paths of the form $p \\cap G_{\\alpha}$ such that $p$ connects rays $v_{0}, v_{1} \\in \\varepsilon_{\\alpha}$. From the construction of $G$, it follows that $p \\cap G_{\\alpha}$ also connectes $v_{0}$ to $v_{1}$. Since $\\left|\\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\cap \\mathcal{F}\\right|=\\kappa$, if $\\mathcal{R}=\\varepsilon_{\\alpha} \\cap \\mathcal{F}$, then it follows that $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{C})$ is a ray graph in $G_{\\alpha}$ of cardinality $\\geq \\mu$ that we seek.\n\nIn both cases we reach a contradiction to our hypothesis that $G_{\\alpha}$ has no ray graph of cardinality $\\geq \\mu$.\n\nTheorem 3.2. Let $\\urcorner: \\mathrm{ON} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CARD}$, such that for $\\beta \\in O R D$\n\n$$\n\\urcorner(\\beta)= \\begin{cases}2 & \\text { if } \\beta=0 \\\\ \\mathfrak{c} & \\text { if } \\beta=1 \\\\ \\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)^{\\omega} & \\text { if } \\beta=\\gamma+1 \\text { for some ordinal } \\gamma \\text { such that } \\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma) \\neq \\aleph_{0} \\\\ \\urcorner(\\gamma)^{\\omega} & \\text { if } \\beta=\\gamma+1 \\text { for some limit ordinal } \\gamma \\text { such that } \\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\aleph_{0} \\\\ \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in \\beta} \\urcorner(\\alpha) & \\text { if } \\beta \\text { is a limit ordinal }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSuppose $\\kappa>\\mathfrak{c}$ is any cardinal and $\\gamma$ is an ordinal such that $\\urcorner(\\gamma)$ is not a fixedpoint of the $\\aleph$-function. The following hold:\n(a) If $\\kappa \\in\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma), \\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\neq \\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds,\n(b) If $\\kappa \\in\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\urcorner(\\gamma+1)\\right]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\neq \\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails,\n(c) If $\\kappa \\in\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\urcorner(\\gamma+1)\\right]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails\n(d) $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds if $\\kappa=\\urcorner(\\gamma)$ is a singular cardinal such that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$ or $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal.\n(e) $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ holds for all regular cardinals $\\kappa$ that are fixed-points of the function $\\urcorner$.\n\nProof. Case (a): An easy induction argument proves that for every cardinal $\\kappa \\in$ $\\left\\lceil\\urcorner(\\gamma), \\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)$ we have that $\\kappa^{\\omega}=\\kappa$. Thus, applying Lemma 2.2 for $\\kappa \\in\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma), \\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)$ we have $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$. Since $\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}$ is $\\omega$-inaccessible and $\\operatorname{cf}\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)=\\omega$, it follows from Lemma 2.5 that $\\mathrm{HC}\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)$ holds.\n\nCase (b): We consider two sub-cases of (b):\nSub-case (b)(i): Suppose $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma) \\neq \\aleph_{0}$ and $\\kappa \\in\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\urcorner(\\gamma+1)\\right)$. By the Pseudo-Power Theorem applied to $\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}$ we have that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{pp}_{\\omega}\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)=\\left(\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}\\right)^{\\omega}=\\urcorner(\\gamma+1)\n$$\n\nThus we can find $\\tau \\in(\\neg(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}, \\neg(\\gamma+1))$ such that $\\tau \\geq \\kappa$ and there is a $\\tau$-scale for $\\urcorner(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}$. We can apply Counter-Examples from Scales. to $\\tau$ and obtain a graph $G$ which witnesses that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\n\nSub-case (b)(ii): suppose that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma) \\neq \\aleph_{0}$ and $\\kappa=\\neg(\\gamma+1)$. If there is a $\\neg(\\gamma+1)$ scale for $\\neg(\\gamma)^{+\\omega}$, it follows as in the previous case that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails, otherwise from Pseudo-Power Theorem it follows that $\\urcorner(\\gamma+1)$ is not a weakly inaccessible cardinal and hence it is a singular cardinal. Then we can apply Lemma 3.1 and obtain the failure of $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$.\n\nCase (c): We consider two sub-cases of (c):\nCase (c)(i): Suppose $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$ and $\\kappa \\in(\\neg(\\gamma), \\neg(\\gamma+1))$. From our hypothesis that $\\urcorner(\\gamma)$ is not a fixed-point of the $\\aleph$ function we can apply Pseudo-Power Theorem to $\\urcorner(\\gamma)$ and by the definition of $\\urcorner(\\gamma+1)$, in the case $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)=\\omega$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{pp}_{\\omega}(\\neg(\\gamma))=\\neg(\\gamma)^{\\omega}=\\neg(\\gamma+1)\n$$\n\nApplying Theorem Counter-Examples from Scales. it follows that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\nCase (c)(ii): Suppose that $\\kappa=\\neg(\\gamma+1)$. If there is a $\\neg(\\gamma+1)$-scale for $\\neg(\\gamma)$, it follows, as in the previous case, that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails. Otherwise, $\\neg(\\gamma+1)$ is a singular cardinals and by Lemma 3.1 it follows that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\n\nCase (d): Note that $\\kappa=\\neg(\\gamma)$ is $\\omega$-inaccessible. Applying Lemma 2.5 we obtain $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$.\n\nCase(e): Follows from Lemma 2.2.\nWe introduce the following notation: If $\\mu$ is not a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal, we denote by $\\theta(\\mu)$ the least cardinal $\\theta<\\mu$ such that $\\theta^{\\omega}>\\mu$. Notice that if $\\alpha<\\theta(\\mu)$, since $\\left(\\alpha^{\\omega}\\right)^{\\omega}=\\alpha^{\\omega}<\\mu$, it follows that $\\alpha^{\\omega}<\\theta(\\mu)$. Moreover, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\mu)=\\omega$, as otherwise, we have $\\mu^{\\omega}=\\mu$ from the fact that $\\mu$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal.\n\nCorollary 3.3. Suppose that $\\kappa=\\neg(\\gamma)$ for some limit ordinal $\\gamma$. If $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is not $\\omega$-inaccessible, $\\theta(\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa))$ is not a fixed point of the $\\aleph$-function and $\\theta(c f(\\kappa))>\\mathfrak{c}$, then $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.\n\nProof. An induction argument proves that every $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinals is of the form $\\neg(\\gamma)$ for some ordinal $\\gamma$. Let $\\mu=\\theta(c f(\\kappa))$, then $\\theta(\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is a $\\omega$-inaccessible cardinal and there is an ordinal $\\gamma$ such that $\\neg(\\gamma)=\\theta(\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa))$. Then $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\in(\\neg(\\gamma), \\neg(\\gamma+1)]$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\neg(\\gamma))=\\omega$. From Theorem 3.2 item (1)(b) we have that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa))$ fails. By [3, Theorem 9.1], it follows that $\\mathrm{HC}(\\kappa)$ fails.",

This answers\ntwo questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023.\nFurthermore, we comment on the relationship between \\emph{HC} and the\n\\emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from\nfailures of the former. We verify that Halin's conjecture fails on finite\nintervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model, this is a\nnew independence result on \\emph{HC}.",
