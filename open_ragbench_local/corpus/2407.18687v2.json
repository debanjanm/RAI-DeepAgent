(1999) on coherent risk measures - see Follmer and Schied (2016) for a comprehensive review. Traditionally, the theory, as summarized in Delbaen (2002), considers risk measures as real-valued functionals defined on the domain $L^{\\infty}$ of bounded random variables. However, the increasing complexity of modern financial markets demands more versatile tools capable of addressing multivariate and systemic aspects of risk, which motivates extending the traditional framework.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of a set risk measure (SRM), defined as realvalued maps whose domain, $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, comprises all non-empty, closed, and bounded sets in $L^{\\infty}$. Our rationale mirrors the foundational reasoning behind monetary risk measures built from acceptance sets, aiming to quantify the minimal capital required to render an entire set of financial positions acceptable. The major technical challenge of this extension is that $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is not a linear space, limiting the direct application of conventional analytical tools. Consequently, our approach leverages advanced topological, algebraic, and order-theoretic methods to overcome these limitations.\n\nSpaces like $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ belong to a broader class known as hyperspaces, equipped with hypertopologies. Specifically, we consider the Hausdorff distance topology, under which the canonical mapping $x \\mapsto \\dot{x}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image (Lucchetti and Pasquale, 1994). This structural property reveals a fundamental distinction from the traditional domain $L^{\\infty}$ : there is no straightforward reduction from SRMs to standard scalar risk measures. This observation emphasizes that our set-based approach genuinely extends beyond the traditional scalar-to-scalar setup.\n\nOur primary contribution is thus establishing this novel framework of \"set-to-scalar\" risk measures, distinctively generalizing existing univariate and multivariate theories. While numerous domains beyond $L^{\\infty}$ have been considered, including $L^{\\lambda}$ spaces (Kaina and R\u00fcschendorf, 2009), Orlicz spaces (Cheridito and Li, 2009; Gao and Xanthos, 2018), and spaces of probability distributions (Frittelli et al., 2014), these remain fundamentally scalar and do not capture multivariate intricacies. Even multivariate extensions found in Burgert and R\u00fcschendorf (2006, 2008), R\u00fcschendorf (2006), Ivar and Walter (2011); Ekeland et al. (2012), and others, typically handle finite-dimensional vectors rather than general sets of random variables. Our SRM approach, however, fully embraces this generality and directly addresses systemic risk considerations.\n\nMoreover, our framework differs significantly from existing \"vector-to-set\" approaches such as set-valued risk measures studied by Jouini et al. (2004); Hamel and Heyde (2010);\n\nHamel et al. (2011); Ararat et al. (2017), and from risk measures for random sets as developed by Molchanov and Cascos (2016); Molchanov and M\u00fchlemann (2021). While these methodologies either produce set-valued outcomes or assess sets in a fundamentally different manner, our approach specifically quantifies the overall acceptability of a set into a single scalar, capturing the essential financial intuition of capital adequacy in a straightforward numerical form.\n\nAdditionally, our theory is distinct from risk measures defined over spaces of stochastic processes (Cheridito et al., 2004, 2005; Frittelli and Scandolo, 2006), which focus exclusively on time-dependent structures. The generality of our SRM framework allows a broader class of set-based financial positions to be assessed directly, without imposing restrictive structures inherent to stochastic processes or Banach lattice topologies.\n\nWe structure our investigation as follows: In Section 2, we propose an axiom scheme for set risk measures, directly extending classical axioms from scalar-valued risk measures and introducing additional properties that naturally arise from set operations. We further establish a close connection between SRMs and their induced acceptance sets, providing a conceptual foundation analogous to the classical setup.\n\nIn Section 3, we present our main technical result-an axiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs through regular, finitely additive measures defined over the unit ball of ba, the dual space of $L^{\\infty}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the space of non-empty, closed, bounded, and convex subsets of $L^{\\infty}$ embeds naturally into a cone within the space of bounded continuous functions on this dual unit ball, allowing us to represent SRMs explicitly in terms of bona fide probability measures. This representation is particularly valuable from both theoretical and practical perspectives, enhancing interpretability and computational tractability.\n\nIn Section 4, we delve deeper into the class of worst-case risk measures, an essential subset of SRMs characterized by evaluating risk as the supremum of individual risks within a set. This family has attracted significant attention due to its intuitive financial interpretation and applicability to robust risk management practices, as explored in the literature (F\u00f6llmer and Schied, 2002; Laeven and Stadje, 2013; Ang et al., 2018; Bartl et al., 2019; Bellini et al., 2018). We characterize conditions under which SRMs correspond to worst-case risk measures, refining continuity conditions and their dual representations.\n\nFinally, Section 5 offers illustrative examples highlighting the practical utility of our theoretical framework, demonstrating its relevance for systemic risk evaluation, portfolio optimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. Through these concrete cases, we underscore the flexibility and potential of set risk measures in addressing contemporary\n\nchallenges in financial risk management.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2 Set risk measures \n\nWe consider a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, p)$, and denote by $L^{0}:=L^{0}(\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, p)$ and $L^{\\infty}:=$ $L^{\\infty}(\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, p)$ the spaces of (equivalence classes under $p$-a.s. equality of) finite and essentially bounded random variables, respectively. All equalities and inequalities are taken in the $p$-almost sure sense; in particular, constant random variables are real numbers. When not explicitly mentioned, we consider $L^{\\infty}$ equipped with its strong topology. We write $1_{A}$ for the indicator function of an event $A \\in \\mathscr{F}$. Convergences will be denoted by an arrow $(\\rightarrow)$ with an affixed subscript indicating the type of convergence, for instance, $x_{n} \\rightarrow_{L^{\\infty}} x$ means convergence in essential supremum norm; $x_{n} \\rightarrow_{q \\text {-a.s. }} x$ indicates $q$-a.s. convergence, for any probability measure $q$. Similarly, norms are denoted with an affixed subscript. In what follows, for any object $x$, the singleton containing $x$ will be denoted by $\\dot{x}$, that is, $\\dot{x}=\\{x\\}$. We denote by $\\operatorname{cl}(X)$ the closure of $X$, and by $\\operatorname{conv}(X)$ the closed convex hull of $X \\subseteq L^{\\infty}$. In both cases, the closure is taken with respect to the supremum norm in $L^{\\infty}$.\n\nConsider the power set $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, i.e., $X \\in \\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ if and only if $X \\subseteq L^{\\infty}$. We start off by endowing $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ with a metric structure, as follows: For any pair $X, Y \\subseteq L^{\\infty}$, define the distance between the two sets as\n\n$$\nd(X, Y)=\\inf _{x \\in X, y \\in Y}\\|x-y\\|_{\\infty}\n$$\n\nThe Hausdorff distance on $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is then defined through\n\n$$\nd_{H}(X, Y)=\\max \\left\\{\\sup _{x \\in X} d(\\dot{x}, Y), \\sup _{y \\in Y} d(\\dot{y}, X)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIn what follows, the notation $X_{n} \\rightarrow X$ means $d_{H}\\left(X_{n}, X\\right) \\rightarrow 0$. We now recall some properties of $d_{H}$ that will be used without further mention (see Beer, 1993, for details).\n\n1. $d_{H}(X, Y)=\\sup _{x \\in L^{\\infty}}|d(\\dot{x}, X)-d(\\dot{x}, Y)|$.\n2. If $Y=\\dot{y}$ is a singleton, then $d_{H}(X, Y)=\\sup _{x \\in X}\\|x-y\\|_{\\infty}$\n3. $d_{H}(X, Y) \\in[0, \\infty]$. If both sets are bounded, then $d_{H}$ is guaranteed to be finite. Further, $d_{H}(X, Y)=0$ if and only if $\\operatorname{cl}(X)=\\operatorname{cl}(Y)$.\n4. $d(\\dot{x}, X) \\leqslant d(\\dot{x}, Y)+d_{H}(X, Y)$ for any $x \\in L^{\\infty}$.\n5. If $\\operatorname{int}(X \\cap Y) \\neq \\varnothing$, then there is a $\\lambda>0$ such that, for any $Z \\subseteq L^{\\infty}$ satisfying $d_{H}(X, Z)<\\lambda$, it holds that $Y \\cap Z \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\n6. $d_{H}$ is an extended pseudometric on $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nWe write $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ to denote the collection of non-empty, closed and bounded subsets of $L^{\\infty}$, while $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ denotes the collection of subsets in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ that are convex in $L^{\\infty}$. Importantly, $d_{H}$ yields a complete metric on $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nIn view of the above, our \"domain of choice\" to work with here will be the complete metric space $\\left(\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right), d_{H}\\right)$. Clearly, the map $(X, Y) \\mapsto X \\cup Y$ is continuous on $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, and $(X, Y) \\mapsto \\operatorname{conv}(X \\cup Y)$ is continuous on $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. In addition, notice that the collection of finite sets in $L^{\\infty}$ is dense in the collection of non-empty compact sets in $L^{\\infty}$.\n\nNext, we focus on algebraic structures on $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. It is important to notice that, while these properties do depend on the topology of $L^{\\infty}$, in $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ they are indeed purely algebraic. We define the Minkowski sum of two sets $X$ and $Y$ as the operation $X+Y=\\operatorname{cl}(\\{x+y: x \\in X, y \\in Y\\})$, and we shall write $X+\\dot{x}$ and $X+x$ indistinctly when no confusion may arise. This operation is commutative and associative, with $\\hat{0}$ as the identity element. Likewise, we introduce multiplication by scalars through $\\lambda X=$ $\\{\\lambda x: x \\in X\\}$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $X-Y=X+(-1 Y)$. We also let $X+\\emptyset=\\emptyset$ and $\\lambda \\emptyset=\\emptyset$. Contrary to first-intuition, such operations do not yield a linear space, since the Minkowski sum does not fulfill the cancellation law.\n\nNow, as $d_{H}(X+\\dot{\\lambda}, Y+\\dot{\\lambda})=d_{H}(X, Y)$ and $d_{H}(\\lambda X, \\lambda Y)=|\\lambda| d_{H}(X, Y)$ for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have that both the Minkowski sum and the multiplication by scalar are continuous on respective topologies. Also, notice that the distributive property $\\lambda(X+Y)=\\lambda X+\\dot{\\lambda} Y$ holds for any $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and any $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, and that $\\lambda_{1}\\left(\\lambda_{2} X\\right)=\\left(\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}\\right) X$ as well. However, in general $\\lambda_{1} X+\\lambda_{2} X \\neq\\left(\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}\\right) X$. In summary, $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is a conlinear space, and $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is a conlinear subspace of $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ (for a review on conlinear spaces, see Schrage, 2009; Hamel, 2005). With a slight abuse of language, we employ in $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ some vector space concepts such as convex set, convex hull, linear function etc., whenever those operations are well-defined. We call $X \\mapsto\\|X\\|=\\sup _{x \\in X}\\|x\\|_{\\infty}=\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ : $p(|x|>\\alpha)=0, \\forall x \\in X\\}$ a norm in $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. From properties of both supremum and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$, we get that $X \\mapsto\\|X\\|$ is sub-additive, positive homogeneous, and finite for bounded $X$. In yet another abuse of notation, we say $X_{n}$ converges to $X$ in this essential supremum (uniform) norm when $\\left\\|X_{n}-X\\right\\| \\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, since $d_{H}(X, Y) \\leqslant$ $\\|X-Y\\|$, it follows that $\\left\\|X_{n}-X\\right\\| \\rightarrow 0$ implies in $d_{H}\\left(X_{n}, X\\right) \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nA standard pre-order in $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is defined as follows: we say that $Y$ is greater than $X$, denoted by $X \\leqslant Y$, if for any $y \\in Y$ there is a $x \\in X$ such that $x \\leqslant y$, and we write $Y \\geqslant X$ to mean $X \\leqslant Y$. Reflexivity and transitivity clearly hold for \" $\\leqslant$ \",\n\nwhile anti-symmetry does not hold. Additionally, this pre-order is compatible with the algebraic operations in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, in the sense that if $X \\leqslant Y$, then $X+Z \\leqslant Y+Z$, for any $Z \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ and $\\lambda X \\leqslant \\lambda Y$ for any $\\lambda \\geqslant 0$. Indeed, we have $X \\leqslant Y$ if and only if $X+L_{+}^{\\infty} \\supseteq Y$. The restriction of \" $\\leqslant$ \" to the monotone subsets of $L^{\\infty}$, i.e., the sets such that $X+L_{+}^{\\infty}=X$, coincides with the order complete lattice set inclusion $\\subseteq$. Finally, we have that $Y \\subseteq X$ implies $Y \\geqslant X$. For more details on this order and its link to preferences, see Kreps (1979); Dekel et al. (2001).\n\nRemark 2.1. An alternative order structure on $\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ could be $X \\lesssim Y$, if for any $x \\in X$ there is a $y \\in Y$ such that $x \\leqslant y$. This order aligns well when $x$ represents a loss instead of profit and loss, see Moresco et al. (2024) for details. In fact, it holds that $X \\lesssim Y$ if and only if $-Y \\leqslant-X$. Yet another possibility is to consider $X \\succeq Y$ if and only if $x \\geqslant y$ for any pair $(x, y) \\in X \\times Y$. This is equivalent to $(X-Y) \\subseteq L_{+}^{\\infty}$, which is a convex cone, and also equivalent to essinf $X \\geqslant \\operatorname{ess} \\sup Y$. Note that this is not a pre-order, since reflexivity does not hold in general. Clearly, \" $\\succeq$ \" is more restrictive than \" $\\geqslant$ \", that is, $X \\succeq Y$ implies $X \\geqslant Y$.\n\nLet the absolute value of $X$ be defined through $|X|=\\{|x|: x \\in X\\}$. Additionally, for any $X \\in \\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, its essential supremum, denoted ess sup $X$, is the (almost surely) unique random variable $y: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{+\\infty\\}$ that satisfies $y \\geqslant x$ for any $x \\in X$, and $y \\leqslant z$ for any $z \\in L^{\\infty}$ such that $z \\geqslant x$ for any $x \\in X$. The essential infimum of $X$ is then defined as essinf $X=-\\operatorname{ess} \\sup -X$. It is possible to show (see Theorem A. 37 in Follmer and Schied, 2016) that ess sup $X$ is well-defined, by allowing the extended real line to be its codomain, and can be taken as the pointwise supremum $(\\operatorname{ess} \\sup X)(\\omega)=$ $\\sup _{x \\in X} x(\\omega)$ when $X$ is countable. The essential supremum of a set is finite if and only if there exists a $z \\in L^{0}$ that bounds every element of its elements; it is integrable if and only if there exists an integrable random variable that dominates the set; it is bounded if and only if there exists a finite constant that serves as an upper bound for almost all values of those random variables. Note that $\\|X\\| \\geqslant \\operatorname{ess} \\sup |X|$.\n\nTo sum up, we have that, based on the topological, algebraic and order structures introduced above, the space $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, endowed with the topology induced by $d_{H}$, is a preordered Abelian topological semigroup-see Beer (1993), Chapter 3, for instance.\n\nDefinition 2.2. Any functional $R: \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is called a set risk measure (SRM henceforth), and may have the following properties, for any $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, any $0 \\leqslant \\lambda \\leqslant 1$ and any $\\gamma \\geqslant 0$ :\n(i) Monotonicity: If $X \\leqslant Y$, then $R(X) \\geqslant R(Y)$.\n\n(ii) Translation invariance: $R(X+\\dot{\\alpha})=R(X)-\\alpha$.\n(iii) WC-boundedness: $R(X) \\leqslant \\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})$.\n(iv) Convexity: $R(\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) Y) \\leqslant \\lambda R(X)+(1-\\lambda) R(Y)$.\n(v) Positive homogeneity: $R(\\gamma X)=\\gamma R(X)$.\n\nA SRM is said to be monetary if it satisfies items (i) and (ii) above. It is called convex if it is monetary and satisfies item (iv), and coherent if it is convex and satisfies item (v). In what follows, we assume that SRMs are always normalized, i.e. $R(\\hat{0})=0$.\n\nRemark 2.3. Assuming normalization does not affect our main results. For instance, this property is always present under positive homogeneity. Additionally, for a monetary SRM, say $R$, we have that $R^{\\prime}$ defined as $R^{\\prime}(X)=R(X)-R(\\hat{0})$ is monetary and normalized, and also inherits from $R$ any other property from Definition 2.2. Importantly, the map defined as $\\rho(x)=R(\\dot{x})$ yields a bona fide risk measure. We call $\\rho$ monetary, convex and coherent analogously as for $R$.\n\nMonotonicity captures the idea that if, for every random variable $y$ in $Y$ (which may represent a financial position), one can find another random variable $x$ in $X$ that is worse than $y$ (in the sense that it pays less in every possible state of the world), then $X$ is deemed riskier than $Y$. In simpler terms, if every potential financial outcome in $Y$ can be matched with a worse outcome in $X$, then $X$ as a whole is considered riskier. This aligns with the traditional notion of monotonicity for risk measures, where almost surely worse positions are associated with greater risk. This property arises naturally when $X$ models uncertainty (see Example 5.3) and implies $R(\\hat{0}) \\leqslant R(X-X)$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. Further, since $X \\subseteq Y$ implies $X \\geqslant Y$, monotone SRMs can be seen as an \"aversion to flexibility\", as in this case $X \\subseteq Y$ implies $R(X) \\leqslant R(Y)$. In particular,\n\n$$\nR(X \\cup Y) \\geqslant \\max \\{R(X), R(Y)\\} \\geqslant \\min \\{R(X), R(Y)\\} \\geqslant R(X \\cap Y)\n$$\n\nwhere the last inequality makes sense when $X \\cap Y \\neq \\varnothing$.\nAs discussed in Remark 2.1, monotonicity can be defined using alternative pre-orders (e.g., $\\lesssim$ ). However, we adhere to the standard $\\leqslant$ pre-order-the weakest pre-order consistent with the principle that worse positions entail higher risks-to ensure compatibility with worst-case SRM (see Section 2). Notably, using $\\lesssim$ would invert the risk relationship (i.e., $X \\subseteq Y \\Rightarrow R(X) \\geqslant R(Y)$ ), which corresponds to a preference for flexibility as studied in Kreps (1979).\n\nIn the traditional framework, translation invariance is essential for a risk measure to be understood as a capital requirement, and to allow for representation through accep-\n\ntance sets. It implies that adding a certain gain to every single position in $X$ decreases its risk by exactly that amount. In fact, translation invariance implies that $\\lambda \\mapsto R(X+\\dot{\\lambda})$ is strictly decreasing and affine. There are specific contexts in which one might want to relax or adjust this requirement, such as in the study of cash-subadditive risk measures or systemic risk measures (see example 5.4). However, we leave such generalizations to a future study. If $R$ is monetary, then clearly it is finite since $-\\|X\\| \\leqslant R(X) \\leqslant\\|X\\|$ for any bounded $X$.\n\nWC-boundedness in turn has an interpretation that, to make some set of positions acceptable, one needs less than the largest amount of money among all positions in this set, as this value also makes acceptable all the other positions in the set (the acronym WC stands for worst-case, see Section 4).\n\nPositive homogeneity implies that, if every position of the set is expanded by a positive factor $\\gamma$, then the risk of the whole set is also increased by the same factor. This is a direct analogy to the positive homogeneity of traditional risk measures, note that $2 X \\subseteq X+X$. Convexity is also a direct adaptation of the traditional notion of convexity, and is closely linked to diversification, implying that combining two sets does not increase the risk.\n\nSet-monotonicity and set-convexity defined in the following Lemma 2.4 are weaker properties that play an important underlying role in the SRMs. In particular, setmonotonicity is indispensable to characterize SRM as worst-case risk measures. While set-convexity allows us to identify the SRM with an set-function whose domain is CBC, which is an unskippable step in developing the dual representation, see Section 3.\n\nLemma 2.4. Let $R$ be a monotone SRM. Then $R$ satisfies\n(i) Set-monotonicity: If $X \\subseteq Y \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ then $R(X) \\leqslant R(Y)$.\n\nFurther, if $R$ is convex, then $R$ satisfies\n(ii) Set-Convexity: $R(\\operatorname{conv}(X))=R(X)$.\n\nProof. Item (i) follows directly from monotonicity, as $X \\subseteq Y$ implies $X \\geqslant Y$.\nFor item (ii), we first show that for any $\\lambda \\in(0,1)$ it holds that $\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X=$ $\\operatorname{conv} X$. Remember that the operator conv is the closed convex hull, and the we are also taking the closed sum. Thus, the inclusion $\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X \\subseteq \\operatorname{conv} X$ is clear. Now, to show that $\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X \\supseteq \\operatorname{conv} X$, take some $y \\in \\operatorname{int}(\\operatorname{conv} X)$. Then, $y$ can be written as a convex combination of random variables in $X$, and we can chose the random\n\nvariables such that at least one of the weights is exactly $\\lambda$, i.e.\n\n$$\ny=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i} x_{i}, \\text { and } \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\alpha_{i}=1\n$$\n\nfor some $\\left\\{x_{i}\\right\\} \\subseteq X, k<\\infty$, and $\\alpha_{i} \\geqslant 0$ such that $\\alpha_{j}=\\lambda$ for some $j \\leqslant k$. Now, without loss of generality, take $j=1$, and note that\n\n$$\ny=\\lambda x_{1}+(1-\\lambda) \\sum_{i=2}^{k} \\frac{\\alpha_{i}}{(1-\\lambda)} x_{i}\n$$\n\nClearly, $\\sum_{i=2}^{k} \\frac{\\alpha_{i}}{(1-\\lambda)} x_{i} \\in \\operatorname{conv} X$ and $x_{1} \\in X$, therefore, $y \\in \\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X$. Thus, we get $\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X \\supseteq \\operatorname{int}(\\operatorname{conv} X)$, and taking the closure on both sides yield the required inclusion. Lastly, we have by item (i) that $R(X) \\leqslant R(\\operatorname{conv} X)$, then the previous reasoning and convexity of the SRM yields, for all $\\lambda \\in(0,1)$\n\n$$\nR(X) \\leqslant R(\\operatorname{conv} X)=R(\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) \\operatorname{conv} X) \\leqslant \\lambda R(X)+(1-\\lambda) R(\\operatorname{conv} X)\n$$\n\nand taking $\\lambda \\rightarrow 1$ gives the claim.\nSet-convexity means that diversification alongside positions within the set does not increase risk. This property was called Indifference to Randomization in Dekel et al. (2001) in a context of preferences of sets of distributions. The implication that a setconvex SRM is convex is explored on Section 4.\n\nWe highlight that our results would not be affected by the use of a different pre-order, as long as the monetary SRM also satisfy set-monotonicity. In fact, set-monotonicity is necessary in Section 2, particularly in Proposition 2.7 item (i)b, Theorem 4.2, Theorem 4.5, and in Proposition 5.6.\nRemark 2.5. If $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, then obviously $X^{\\complement} \\notin \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. Thus, properties for other set operations such as $R\\left(X^{\\complement}\\right), R(X \\backslash Y)$ and $R(X \\triangle Y)$ are outside our proposed scope. While this kind of operation may be interesting, particularly for risk budgeting and risk sharing problems, its exploration is left for future works. Other algebraic and order properties from risk measures on random variables, such as quasi-convexity, cashsubbaditivity, relevance, surplus invariance and star-shapedness, on the other hand, can be directly adapted to our framework. Besides, properties that depend on distributions and quantiles, such as law invariance and comonotonic additivity, require a more in-depth discussion on the proper probability distribution of a set of random variables-possibly beyond the collection of finite-dimensional distributions. We leave this stream of inquiry\n\nfor future research.\nDefinition 2.6. The acceptance set of a SRM $R$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}_{R}=\\left\\{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right): R(X) \\leqslant 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProposition 2.7. Let $R$ be a monetary SRM. Then,\n(i) $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is non-empty and satisfies the following:\n(a) if $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ and $Y \\geqslant X$, then $Y \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$.\n(b) if $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ and $Y \\subseteq X$ then $Y \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$.\n(c) $\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\}=0$.\n(ii) for all $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$,\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\min \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n(iii) $R$ is lower semi-continuous if and only if $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is closed.\n(iv) $R$ is WC-bounded if and only if, for each $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, the following implication holds: if $\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ for all $x \\in X$, then $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$.\n(v) $R$ is convex if and only if $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is a convex set in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n(vi) $R$ is positive homogeneous if and only if $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is a cone in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nProof. For item (i), the claim directly follows from the fact that $R$ is monetary, normalized and that $Y \\subseteq X$ imply $Y \\geqslant X$.\n\nFor item (ii), note that if $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ then $X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ for any real $\\alpha$. A direct calculation leads to\n\n$$\n\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\}=\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: R(X) \\leqslant \\alpha\\}=R(X)\n$$\n\nfor any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. Since $X+R(X) \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$, the infimum is attained.\nFor item (iii), if $R$ is lower semi-continuous, then $\\mathscr{A}_{R} \\equiv R^{-1}((-\\infty, 0])$ is closed. Conversely, assume $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is closed. For any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have by translation invariance that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right): R(X) \\leqslant \\alpha\\right\\} \\\\\n= & \\left\\{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right): R(X+\\dot{\\alpha}) \\leqslant 0\\right\\}=\\left\\{X-\\dot{\\alpha}: X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, all lower sublevel sets of $R$ are closed, which implies that it is lower semi-continuous.\n\nFor item (iv), first let $R$ be WC-bounded and let $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ be such that $\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ for all $x \\in X$. Then $R(X) \\leqslant \\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant 0$ guarantees that $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$. For the \"if\" part of the statement, fix $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ such that $\\{x+\\alpha\\} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ for all $x \\in X$. Then $X+\\dot{\\alpha}=\\bigcup_{x \\in X}\\{x+\\alpha\\} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$. Thus, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(X) & =\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\{x+\\alpha\\} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}\\right\\} \\text { for all } x \\in X \\\\\n& =\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant \\alpha\\} \\text { for all } x \\in X \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe \"only if\" part of items (v) and (vi) are both straightforward. The \"if\" part of both statements comes from items (v) and (vi) in Proposition 2.9, respectively.\n\nWe now consider the converse problem of generating a SRM from a given collection of acceptable ensembles of positions.\n\nDefinition 2.8. If $\\mathscr{A} \\subseteq \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is non-empty, then its induced SRM is defined as\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)=\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nProposition 2.9. Let $\\mathscr{A} \\subseteq \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ satisfy the following:\n\n1. if $X \\in \\mathscr{A}$ and $Y \\geqslant X$, then $Y \\in \\mathscr{A}$.\n2. $\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}\\}=0$.\n\nThen:\n(i) $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ is a monetary SRM.\n(ii) if $R$ is an arbitrary monetary SRM, then $R_{\\mathscr{A}_{R}}=R$.\n(iii) if $\\mathscr{A}$ is closed, then $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ is lower semi-continuous and $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}=\\mathscr{A}$. Conversely, if $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ is lower semi-continuous, then $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}=\\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A})$.\n(iv) if, for every $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, the implication holds that $X \\in \\mathscr{A}$ whenever $\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}$ for all $x \\in X$, then $R$ is WC-bounded.\n(v) if $\\mathscr{A}$ is a convex set, then $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ is a convex SRM.\n(vi) if $\\mathscr{A}$ is a cone, then $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ is a positive homogeneous SRM.\n\nFurther, if $\\mathscr{A}$ is closed, then the converse implications in items (iv) to (vi) also hold. In this case, the infimum in eq. (2.3) is attained.\n\nProof. Item (i) is straightforward from the properties of $\\mathscr{A}$.\nItem (ii) follows from Proposition 2.7, item (ii).\nFor item (iii), in view of Proposition 2.7, item (iii), it suffices to show that $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}$ is closed. Since $\\mathscr{A}$ is closed, we have that $X+R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X) \\in \\mathscr{A}$, for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. We then see that\n\n$$\n\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}=\\left\\{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right): X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A} \\text { for some } \\alpha \\leqslant 0\\right\\}=\\mathscr{A}\n$$\n\nNow, let $R_{\\mathscr{A}}$ be lower semi-continuous. It follows that $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}$, being a lower sublevel set, is closed. Take $X \\in \\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A})$. Then, there is a sequence $\\left\\{X_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\} \\subseteq \\mathscr{A}$ such that $X_{n} \\rightarrow_{d_{H}} X$. Thus, $R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X) \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} R_{\\mathscr{A}}\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\leqslant 0$, which implies $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}$. Hence, $\\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A}) \\subseteq \\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}$.\n\nTo see that $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}} \\subseteq \\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A})$, let $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}$. Then $R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X) \\leqslant 0$, and thus, there is a scalar sequence $\\left\\{\\alpha_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\alpha_{n} \\downarrow R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)$ and $X+\\dot{\\alpha}_{n} \\in \\mathscr{A}$. By hypothesis on $\\mathscr{A}$, we also have that $X_{n}=X+\\dot{\\alpha}_{n}-R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X) \\in \\mathscr{A}$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{H}\\left(X_{n}, X\\right) & =\\sup _{z \\in L^{\\infty}}\\left|\\inf _{x \\in X}\\left\\|z-\\left(x+\\alpha_{n}-R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)\\right)\\right\\|_{\\infty}-\\inf _{x \\in X}\\left\\|z-x\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\sup _{z \\in L^{\\infty}}\\left|\\inf _{x \\in X}\\right\\| z-x \\|_{\\infty}-\\inf _{x \\in X}\\left\\|z-x\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\mid+\\left|\\alpha_{n}-R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)\\right| \\\\\n& =\\left|\\alpha_{n}-R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)\\right| \\rightarrow 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, we get $X_{n} \\rightarrow_{d_{H}} X$, which implies $X \\in \\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A})$, and we get the desired inclusion and, by consequence, $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\mathscr{A}}}=\\operatorname{cl}(\\mathscr{A})$.\n\nItem (iv) follows the same steps as item (iv) in Proposition 2.7.\nFor item (v) we have, given any $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $X+\\dot{\\alpha}_{1}, Y+\\dot{\\alpha}_{2} \\in \\mathscr{A}$, that $\\lambda\\left(X+\\dot{\\alpha}_{1}\\right)+(1-\\lambda)\\left(Y+\\dot{\\alpha}_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathscr{A}$, for all $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$. Thus, $R_{\\mathscr{A}}(\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) Y) \\leqslant$ $\\lambda \\alpha_{1}+(1-\\lambda) \\alpha_{2}$. Hence, by taking the infimum over those $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$, we get the claim.\n\nFor item (vi), let $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ and $\\lambda \\geqslant 0$. In fact, due to normalization, without loss of generality we can take $\\lambda>0$. A direct calculation yields\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{\\mathscr{A}}(\\lambda X) & =\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\lambda X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}\\} \\\\\n& =\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\lambda\\left(X+\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha\\right) \\in \\mathscr{A}\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\lambda^{-1} \\alpha \\in \\mathscr{A}\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\inf \\{\\lambda \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: X+\\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}\\} \\\\\n& =\\lambda R_{\\mathscr{A}}(X)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, the last claim holds directly by Proposition 2.7 and item (iii).\nInterestingly, we have proved the following fact.\nCorollary 2.10. If $\\mathscr{A} \\subseteq \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is convex, monotone with respect to ' $\\subseteq$ ', and satisfies the condition $\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\dot{\\alpha} \\in \\mathscr{A}\\}>-\\infty$, then the following implication holds:\n\n$$\nA \\in \\mathscr{A} \\Rightarrow \\operatorname{conv}(A) \\in \\mathscr{A}\n$$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3 Dual representations \n\nIn what follows, we shall use the term measure in the broad sense, allowing it to refer to both finitely- and countably additive set functions, indicating the type of additivity explicitly in each case. Nevertheless, a probability measure is always understood in the $\\sigma$-additive sense. We denote the topological dual $\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)^{\\prime}$ of $L^{\\infty} \\equiv L^{\\infty}(p)$ by $\\mathbf{b a} \\equiv \\mathbf{b a}(\\mathscr{F})$, which is the space of all finitely additive signed measures on $(\\Omega, \\mathscr{F})$ that are absolutely continuous with respect to $p$ and with finite total variation norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{T V}$. The canonical bilinear form on $\\mathbf{b a} \\times L^{\\infty}$ is denoted simply as $\\langle q, x\\rangle=\\int_{\\Omega} x \\mathrm{~d} q$. Moreover, we let $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}$ denote the subset of ba comprised of finitely additive, non-negative measures $q$ on $\\mathscr{F}$ with unit total variation, and $P^{\\mathrm{ac}} \\subseteq \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}$ is the set of probability measures $q$ that are absolutely continuous with respect to $p$, with Radon-Nikodym derivative $\\mathrm{d} q / \\mathrm{d} p$. With no risk of confusion, we write, for any collection $Q \\subseteq \\mathbf{b a}$, the norm of $Q$ as $\\|Q\\|:=\\sup _{q \\in Q}\\|q\\|_{T V}$.\n\nWe also let $U$ denote the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{T V}$-unit ball on $\\mathbf{b a}$, and $U_{+}=U \\cap \\mathbf{b a}_{+}$, where $\\mathbf{b a}_{+}$ are the non-negative elements in ba. In addition, we let $\\mathbf{b a}^{r}:=\\mathbf{b a}^{r}\\left(\\mathscr{A}_{U}\\right)$ be the set of regular, signed finitely additive measures of bounded variation on $\\mathscr{A}_{U} \\subseteq \\operatorname{pwr}(\\mathbf{b a})$, the algebra generated by the open subsets of $U$. We follow Aliprantis and Border (2006) and say that a finitely additive measure $\\mu$ is regular if (i) it is finite-valued on compact sets; (ii) $\\mu(A)=\\sup \\{\\mu(K): K \\subseteq A, K$ is compact and measurable $\\}$, and; (iii) $\\mu(A)=\\inf \\{\\mu(V): V \\supseteq A, V \\subseteq$ $)$. Notice that an element $\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}^{r}$ is a measure on a class of subsets of $\\mathbf{b a}$, in particular $\\mathbf{b a}^{r} \\nsubseteq \\mathbf{b a}$. We define $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{r}$ similarly to $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}$ and so on.\n\nLet $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}:=\\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{-\\infty, \\infty\\}$. For each $Q \\subseteq \\mathbf{b a}$ we have that the functional $f_{Q}: \\operatorname{pwr}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow$ $\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, defined through\n\n$$\nf_{Q}(X):=\\langle Q, X\\rangle:=\\sup _{x \\in X, q \\in Q}\\langle q, x\\rangle, \\quad X \\subseteq L^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nis sub-additive, positive homogeneous, additive for constants, and satisfies the Cauchy-\n\nSchwarz type inequality $f_{Q}(X) \\leqslant\\|X\\| \\cdot\\|Q\\|$. Thus, it is finite when both $X$ and $Q$ are bounded, and monotone for any $Q \\subseteq \\mathbf{b a}_{+}$. Notice that by taking closures and convex hulls one does not alter the supremum due to the continuity and bi-linear properties of $\\langle q, x\\rangle$; thus, for example $f_{\\text {int }(Q)}(\\operatorname{int}(X))=f_{Q}(X)$. Furthermore, when $Q=\\dot{q}$ is a singleton, the map is additive and coincides with the support function of $X$. Additionally, when $(\\operatorname{ess} \\sup X) \\in X$, we have that $f_{Q}(X)=f_{Q}(\\operatorname{ess} \\sup X)$. We also have that $d_{H}(X, Y)=\\sup _{q \\in U}\\left|\\langle\\dot{q}, X\\rangle-\\langle\\dot{q}, Y\\rangle\\right|$ for any $X, Y \\in \\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\nRemark 3.1. The choice for the weak topological pair $\\left(L^{\\infty}, \\mathbf{b a}\\right)$ instead of the more intuitive weak* pair $\\left(L^{\\infty}, L^{1}\\right)$ is due to the technical machinery used to prove the main results in the paper, which relies on set functional analysis. Most concepts and results of the paper can be adjusted for a more general base domain $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\lambda}(p)\\right), \\lambda \\in[1, \\infty)$, under the replacement of ba by $L^{\\gamma}(p)$, where $1 / \\lambda+1 / \\gamma=1$. In this case, duality is given by $f_{Y}(X)=\\langle X, Y\\rangle=\\sup _{x \\in X, y \\in Y}\\langle p, x y\\rangle$, where $X \\subseteq L^{\\lambda}, Y \\subseteq L^{\\gamma}$.\n\nBefore stating our first dual representation theorem below, we need the following facts and definitions. Let $C_{b}(U)$ be the Banach lattice comprised of all the real valued functions $f$ defined on $\\left(U,\\|\\cdot\\|_{T V}\\right)$ such that $f$ is continuous and bounded. Furthermore, for each $X \\in \\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, define $\\tilde{X}: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ through\n\n$$\n\\tilde{X}(q):=\\sup _{x \\in X}\\langle q, x\\rangle \\equiv\\langle\\dot{q}, X\\rangle \\equiv f_{\\dot{q}}(X), \\quad q \\in U\n$$\n\nA key step in the proof of Theorem 3.2 below is H\u00f6rmander's Theorem (see Theorem 3.2.9 in Beer, 1993), according to which $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is embedded as a closed convex cone $\\mathbb{C} \\subseteq C_{b}(U)$ under the algebraic and isometric embedding $X \\mapsto \\tilde{X}$.\n\nTheorem 3.2. $R$ is a convex, lower semi-continuous SRM if and only if\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{*}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{R}: \\mathbf{b a}^{r} \\rightarrow[0, \\infty]$ is the non-negative, convex and weak* lower semi-continuous functional defined through\n\n$$\n\\tau_{R}(\\mu)=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}} \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q), \\quad \\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}^{r}\n$$\n\nProof. The \"if\" part of the claim can be directly checked, so we focus on the \"only if\" part. By Lemma 2.4, we have that $R(X)=R(\\operatorname{conv}(X))$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. Thus, it is enough to understand the properties of $R$ in $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, the space of non-empty,\n\nclosed and convex sets in $L^{\\infty}$. Note that sum and multiplication by non-negative scalar are continuous operations. Furthermore, by the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, elements of $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ are weak* compact.\n\nNow, take $C_{b}(U)^{\\prime}$ as the topological dual of $C_{b}(U)$, and $f$ and $f^{\\prime}$ for elements of $C_{b}(U)$ and $C_{b}(U)^{\\prime}$, respectively. By Theorem 14.10 in Aliprantis and Border (2006), we can identify $C_{b}(U)^{\\prime}$ with $\\mathbf{b a}^{\\prime}$. In this case, for $\\mu \\approx f^{\\prime}$, the bi-linear form is $\\left\\langle f, f^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle=$ $f^{\\prime}(f)=\\langle\\mu, f\\rangle=\\int_{U} f \\mathrm{~d} \\mu$.\n\nFrom the Fenchel-Moreau Conjugation Theorem, a functional $\\Pi: C_{b}(U) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is proper, convex and lower semi-continuous if and only if\n\n$$\n\\Pi(f)=\\sup _{f^{\\prime} \\in C_{b}(U)^{\\prime}}\\left\\{f^{\\prime}(f)-\\Pi^{\\prime}\\left(f^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Pi^{\\prime}\\left(f^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sup _{f \\in C_{b}(U)}\\left\\{f^{\\prime}(f)-\\Pi(f)\\right\\}$. Let then\n\n$$\n\\Pi(f)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nR(X), \\text { if } f=\\hat{X} \\text { for some } X \\in \\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right) \\\\\n\\infty, \\text { otherwise. }\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThus, $\\left.R\\right|_{\\mathrm{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)}(X)=\\left.\\Pi\\right|_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\hat{X})$, where we recall that $\\mathbb{C}$ denotes the range of $X \\mapsto \\hat{X}$. We then get, for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(X) & =R(\\operatorname{conv}(X)) \\\\\n& =\\sup _{f^{\\prime} \\in C_{b}(U)^{\\prime}}\\left\\{f^{\\prime}(-\\operatorname{conv}(X))-\\Pi^{\\prime}\\left(f^{\\prime}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{\\prime}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-\\operatorname{conv}(X)\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\Pi^{\\prime}(\\mu)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{\\prime}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pi^{\\prime}(\\mu) & =\\sup _{f \\in C_{b}(U)}\\left\\{f^{\\prime}(-f)-\\Pi(f)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-\\operatorname{conv}(X)\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-R(\\operatorname{conv}(X))\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}} \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-\\operatorname{conv}(X)\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q) \\\\\n& =\\sup _{X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}} \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe last two equalities in both deductions, as well as the integral being over $U_{+}$, arise from monotonicity and translation invariance of $R$. The sign adjustment in the bi-linear form is in order to deal with the Monotonicity of $R$. Concerning properties of $\\tau_{R}$, convexity is straightforward. Non-negativity follows since $\\dot{0} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$, and weak* lower semicontinuity is due the fact that $\\tau_{R}$ is the pointwise supremum over $\\mathbb{C}$ of the weak* continuous linear maps $f^{\\prime} \\mapsto f^{\\prime}(f)$. Since $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{r}$ is weak* compact by Alaoglu's Theorem, and $\\mu \\mapsto \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)$ is weak* upper semi-continuous, the supremum is attained.\n\nRemark 3.3. By the Extended Namioka Theorem (see Biagini and Frittelli, 2010; Kaina and R\u00fcschendorf, 2009) we get that, if a functional $\\Pi: C_{b}(U) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$ is proper, convex, and monotone, then $\\Pi$ is continuous on int(dom $\\Pi$ ). Thus, if $R$ is a convex SRM, we have that it is continuous on $A=T^{-1}(\\operatorname{int}(\\mathbb{C}))$, where $T$ is the embedding from $\\operatorname{CBC}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ into $C_{b}(U)$ appearing in the proof of the theorem. In particular, a dual representation as that in eq. (3.2) holds for any $X \\in A$.\n\nRemark 3.4. Given any $\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}^{r}$, that is, $\\mu: \\mathscr{A}_{U} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ is regular, finitely additive and of bounded variation, it can be extended to a finitely additive measure $\\mu^{\\text {ext }}$ defined on $\\operatorname{pwr}(U)$. The existence of such extensions follows immediately from the Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem applied to the subspace $C_{b}(U)$ of $B(U)$, the space of all bounded real functions on $U$-see Luxemburg (1991) and Corollary 14.11 of Aliprantis and Border (2006), for instance. Furthermore, positivity and regularity are preserved in the extension (Theorem 2.1 in Bachman and Sultan, 1980). Let then $\\mathbf{b a}^{\\text {ext }} \\subseteq \\mathbf{b a}(\\operatorname{pwr}(U))$ be the set of such extensions. It is convex and weak* compact (i.e., in the $\\sigma\\left(\\operatorname{ba}(\\operatorname{pwr}(U)), B(U)\\right)$ topology). Since any $f \\in C_{b}(U)$ also belongs to $B(U)$, a convex duality argument similar\n\nto that in Theorem 3.2 leads to a representation of $R$ over $\\mathbf{b a}^{\\text {ext }}$ as\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1:+}^{\\text {ext }}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\hat{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we study some notions of continuity for SRMs.\nDefinition 3.5. Let $X, X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots$ be elements in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, and let $R$ be a SRM. We say that $R$ is:\n(i) continuous from above if it holds that $R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(X)$ whenever $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\downarrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$ pointwise.\n(ii) continuous from below if it holds that $R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(X)$ whenever $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\uparrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$ pointwise.\n(iii) Fatou continuous if it holds that $R(X) \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)$ whenever $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant\\right.$ $1\\}$ is a bounded sequence in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$such that $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\rightarrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise.\n(iv) Lebesgue continuous if it holds that $R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(X)$ whenever $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is a bounded sequence in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$such that $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\rightarrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise.\n(v) represented over probabilities if, for every $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$,\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\mathrm{ext}}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\hat{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}:=\\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}(\\operatorname{pwr}(U))$ are the probability measures over $(U, \\operatorname{pwr} U)$ such that $\\left.\\mu\\right|_{\\partial \\hat{u}_{i}} \\in \\mathbf{b a}^{r}$.\n\nRemark 3.6. By Ulam's Theorem (see Theorem 1.12.40 and Corollary 1.12.41 in Bogachev, 2006), under the Continuum Hypothesis, $\\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}$ contains only discrete probability measures. Thus, for example, the integrals appearing in eq. (3.4) are actually sums over $q$, with $q$ varying in the support of $\\mu$.\n\nTheorem 3.7. Let $R$ be a convex, lower semi-continuous SRM. Then the following hold:\n(i) $R$ is Fatou continuous if and only if it is continuous from above.\n(ii) $R$ is Lebesgue continuous if and only if it is continuous from above and continuous from below.\n(iii) if $R$ is represented over probabilities, then $R$ is Lebesgue continuous.\n\nProof. For the \"only if\" part of item (i), let $R$ be Fatou continuous and assume $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\downarrow$ $\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise. Notice that $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is bounded since $\\widehat{X}_{1} \\geqslant \\widehat{X}_{n} \\geqslant \\widehat{X}$ on $U_{+}$.\n\nMonotonicity and Fatou continuity then imply, by Theorem 3.2, that\n\n$$\n\\limsup _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\leqslant R(X) \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor the \"if\" part, let $R$ be continuous from above and a bounded sequence $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant\\right.$ 1\\} in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$such that $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\rightarrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise. Notice that, letting $Z:=\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X_{n}$, one has $\\widehat{Z} \\in C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$. Define, for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}, y_{m}=\\operatorname{ess} \\sup \\bigcup_{n \\geqslant m} X_{n}$. Then, we get for any $q \\in U_{+}$ that $\\left\\langle q, y_{1}\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle q, y_{2}\\right\\rangle, \\ldots$ is non-increasing and $\\left\\langle q, y_{n}\\right\\rangle \\geqslant\\left\\langle\\dot{q}, X_{n}\\right\\rangle$. Thus, $\\left\\langle q, y_{n}\\right\\rangle \\downarrow\\langle\\dot{q}, X\\rangle$. Continuity from above and monotonicity then imply\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\liminf _{n} R\\left(\\dot{y}_{n}\\right) \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nRegarding item (ii), let $R$ be Lebesgue continuous. Take $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\uparrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise and notice that this implies that $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is a bounded sequence in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$. Lebesgue continuity then implies $R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(X)$. A similar reasoning with $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\uparrow$ $\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$leads to continuity from above. For the converse implication, let $R$ be continuous from below, and let $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\uparrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise. Again, this yields that $\\left\\{\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is a bounded sequence in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$. Similarly to item (ii), we can show that $R(X) \\geqslant$ $\\lim \\sup _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)$. Further, by item (i) we have that $R$ is Fatou continuous, which grants $R(X) \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)$. Hence, $R$ is Lebesgue continuous.\n\nFor item (iii), assume $R$ is represented over probabilities. Take $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\rightarrow\\left.\\widehat{X}\\right|_{U_{+}}$pointwise such that $\\left\\{\\widehat{X}_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is bounded in $C_{b}\\left(U_{+}\\right)$. By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(X) & =\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}}\\left\\{\\lim _{n} \\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\liminf _{n} \\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, $R$ is Fatou continuous. By item (i), it is continuous from above. Now, take $\\left\\{X_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ such that $\\widehat{X}_{n} \\uparrow \\widehat{X}$. Assume, without loss of generality (due to translation invariance), that $\\left.\\widehat{X}_{n}\\right|_{U_{+}} \\leqslant 0$. Let for each $k \\in \\mathbb{R}$ the set $L_{k}=\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{\\text {ext }}: \\tau(\\mu) \\leqslant k\\right\\}$, and notice that such sets are weak* compact as they are bounded, closed and convex. Moreover, the mappings $\\Lambda_{n}(\\mu):=\\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)$ are weak* continuous over each $L_{k}$. Since, $\\Lambda_{n}(\\mu) \\uparrow \\Lambda(\\mu):=\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)$, we have by Dini's Lemma that $\\Lambda_{n}$ converges\n\nuniformly to $\\Lambda$. We then obtain for any $k>0$ that\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\mu \\in L_{k}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\} \\rightarrow \\max _{\\mu \\in L_{k}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X,\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNow, note that for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and each $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ we have\n\n$$\nR(X) \\leqslant R\\left(X_{n}\\right)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nSince the linear part $\\int_{U_{+}}\\left\\langle\\dot{q},-X_{n}\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)$ is non-positive for any $\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}$, we have that the supremum in the representation is not altered if taken only over those $\\mu$ such that $\\tau_{R}(\\mu) \\leqslant\\|X\\|-R(X)$, i.e., $\\mu \\in L_{\\|X\\|-R(X)}$. Then, by the uniform convergence of $\\Lambda_{n}$ to $\\Lambda$ we obtain that $\\lim _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right)=R(X)$. Hence, $R$ is continuous from below. Hence, from item (ii) it is Lebesgue continuous.\n\nRemark 3.8. While Fatou continuity is necessary for a dual representation under probabilities, it is, in general, not sufficient. Nonetheless, when $U_{+}$is Polish, the recent papers of Delbaen (2022) and Nendel (2024) show that, in the setting of traditional risk measures, under some technical conditions we have that Fatou continuity is equivalent to a representation over the supremum of probabilities in the Borel sigma-algebra of $U_{+}$.\n\nCorollary 3.9. $R$ is a coherent, lower semi-continuous SRM if and only if\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}^{r}} \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q), \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}^{r}$ is non-empty, convex and weak* closed, defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}^{r} & =\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{r}: \\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q) \\leqslant R(X) \\text { for all } X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{r}: \\tau_{R}(\\mu)=0 .\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, $R$ is Lebesgue continuous if $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}^{r} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}^{\\text {ext }}$.\nProof. From Theorem 3.2, positive homogeneity for $R$ implies that $\\tau_{R}$ can take values only in $\\{0, \\infty\\}$. Finiteness of $R$ then assures the claim. The properties of $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}^{r}$ are directly inherited from those of $\\tau_{R}$. The last claim is directly obtained from Theorem 3.7.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 4 Worst-case SRMs \n\nIn this section, we will focus on set risk measures $R$ that are of the worst-case type, that is, when $R(X)=\\sup_{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})$ for all $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. Before proceeding, we begin recalling the notion of Painlev\u00e9-Kuratowski convergence (Aubin and Frankowska, 2009; Beer, 1993). Let $X, X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots$ be subsets of $L^{\\infty}$. We say that $X_{n}$ set-converges to $X$, written $X_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} X$ or $\\lim _{n} X_{n}=X$, if $X$ is closed and $d\\left(\\dot{x}, X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow d(\\dot{x}, X)$ for any $x \\in L^{\\infty}$. For instance, a sequence of closed balls converge: if $x_{n} \\rightarrow x$ and $\\epsilon_{n} \\rightarrow \\epsilon$, then $\\lim _{n}\\left\\{y \\in L^{\\infty}:\\left\\|x_{n}-y\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant \\epsilon_{n}\\right\\}=\\left\\{y \\in L^{\\infty}:\\|x-y\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant \\epsilon\\right\\}$. Notice that if $d_{H}\\left(X_{n}, X\\right) \\rightarrow 0$, then $\\lim _{n} X_{n}=\\operatorname{cl}(X)$, as seen from Corollary 5.1.11 and Theorem 5.2.10 in Beer (1993). However, the converse implication may not be true. Both convergences coincide if and only if the space is compact, and since $L^{\\infty}$ is not compact as a Banach space, these two notions of convergence do not agree in general (Beer, 1993). Additionally, the inner limit and the outer limit of $\\left\\{X_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ are defined, respectively, as\n\n$$\n\\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}=\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}: \\lim \\sup _{n} d\\left(\\dot{x}, X_{n}\\right)=0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\lim \\text { out }_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}=\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}: \\liminf _{n} d\\left(\\dot{x}, X_{n}\\right)=0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe shall use the following properties without further mention, see Aubin and Frankowska (2009) for details:\n\n1. $\\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\} \\subseteq \\lim \\operatorname{out}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$.\n2. $x \\in \\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ if and only if, for each $n$ there is an $x_{n} \\in X_{n}$ such that $x_{n} \\rightarrow x$.\n3. $x \\in \\lim \\operatorname{out}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ if and only if there exist integers $k_{1}<k_{2}<\\cdots$ and random variables $x_{k_{n}} \\in X_{k_{n}}$ such that $x_{k_{n}} \\rightarrow x$.\n4. $\\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\lim \\operatorname{out}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ are closed sets.\n5. $\\lim _{n} X_{n}=X$ if and only if $\\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}=\\lim \\operatorname{out}_{n}\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}=X$.\n6. if $\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ is increasing (i.e., $X_{n} \\subseteq X_{n+1}$ for all $n$ ), then $\\lim _{n} X_{n}=\\operatorname{cl}\\left(\\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_{n}\\right)$\n7. if $\\left\\{X_{n}\\right\\}$ is decreasing (i.e., $X_{n} \\supseteq X_{n+1}$ for all $n$ ), then $\\lim _{n} X_{n}=\\cap_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\operatorname{cl}\\left(X_{n}\\right)$.\n\nNow let, for any $f: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, its proper domain, epi-graph and hypo-graph be defined, respectively, as $\\operatorname{dom} f=\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}: f(x)>-\\infty\\right\\}$, epi $f=\\{(x, r) \\in L^{\\infty} \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}: f(x) \\leqslant r\\}$ and $\\operatorname{hyp} f=\\left\\{(x, r) \\in L^{\\infty} \\times \\mathbb{R}: f(x) \\geqslant r\\right\\}$. When we have epi $f_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon}$ epi $f$ we say that $\\left\\{f_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ epi-converges to $f$, and similarly for hyp-convergence. In order to link epi-convergence to convergence of the infimum, we need the following definition.\n\nWe say that a sequence of functions $\\left\\{f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is tight if, for each $\\epsilon>0$, there is a compact set $X_{\\epsilon} \\subseteq L^{\\infty}$ and $N_{\\epsilon} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $n \\geqslant N_{\\epsilon}$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{x \\in X_{\\epsilon}} f_{n}(x) \\geqslant \\sup _{x \\in L^{\\infty}} f_{n}(x)-\\epsilon\n$$\n\nThe functions epi-converge tightly if, in addition to being tight, they also epi-converge to some function. It is straightforward to verify that when $\\left\\{f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is contained in a compact set, then it is tight. Such property implies that hypo-convergence implies convergence and finiteness of the supremum. This is formalized in the lemma below.\n\nLemma 4.1 (Proposition 7.3.5 of Aubin and Frankowska (2009)). Let $f: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ and $\\left\\{f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ be proper. If epi $f_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon}$ epi $f$, then we have the following:\n(i) $\\lim \\sup _{n} \\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{n}(x) \\leqslant \\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n(ii) if some sub-sequence $\\left\\{x_{k_{n}} \\in \\arg \\min _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{k_{n}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ converges, then we have $\\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{k_{n}}(x) \\rightarrow \\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n(iii) $\\left\\{f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is tight if and only if $\\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{n}(x) \\rightarrow \\inf _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n\nLikewise, if hyp $f_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon}$ hyp $f$, then we have the following:\n(i') $\\liminf _{n} \\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{n}(x) \\geqslant \\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n(ii') if some sub-sequence $\\left\\{x_{k_{n}} \\in \\arg \\max _{x \\in L^{\\infty}} f_{k_{n}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ converges, then we have $\\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{k_{n}}(x) \\rightarrow \\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n(iii') $\\left\\{f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is tight if and only if $\\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f_{n}(x) \\rightarrow \\sup _{\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}\\right\\}} f(x)$.\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let $R$ be a monetary SRM. Then $R$ is WC-bounded if and only if the worst-case representation\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})\n$$\n\nholds for all $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. In this case, the following holds:\n(i) $R$ is lower semi-continuous.\n(ii) The acceptance set of $R$ is given by the condition $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ if and only if $R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n(iii) The bound $|R(X)-R(Y)| \\leqslant\\|X-Y\\|$ holds for all pairs $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nProof. The claim follows from Proposition 2.7 because $R$ being WC-bounded is equivalent to $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ if and only if $\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ for any $x \\in X$ and any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$.\n\nTo prove $R$ fulfills lower semi-continuity, it is sufficient to show that it is true for set convergence, as this implies the property w.r.t. $d_{H}$. Let then $X_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\dot{\\rightarrow}} X$. Define, for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the mappings $f, f_{n}: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$ through\n\n$$\nf_{n}(x)= \\begin{cases}R(\\dot{x}), & x \\in X_{n} \\\\ -\\infty, & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(x)= \\begin{cases}R(\\dot{x}), & x \\in X \\\\ -\\infty, & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe show that hyp $f_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\dot{\\rightarrow}} \\operatorname{hyp} f$. Let $(x, r) \\in$ hyp $f$. Then, $f(x)=R(\\dot{x}) \\geqslant r$. Since $X_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\dot{\\rightarrow}}$ $X$, there is both $x_{n} \\in X_{n}$ and $x_{k_{n}} \\in X_{k_{n}}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x_{n} \\rightarrow x$ and $x_{k_{n}} \\rightarrow x$. We have that $\\left(x_{n}, R\\left(\\dot{x}_{n}\\right)\\right) \\in$ hyp $f_{n}$. Thus, $\\left(x_{n}, R\\left(\\dot{x}_{n}\\right)-(R(\\dot{x})-r)\\right) \\in$ hyp $f_{n}$. Continuity of $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$, which holds since it is monetary (see Lemma 4.3 in Follmer and Schied, 2016) then implies $R\\left(\\dot{x}_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(\\dot{x}) \\geqslant r$. Therefore, $\\left(x_{n}, R\\left(\\dot{x_{n}}\\right)-(R(\\dot{x})-r)\\right) \\rightarrow(x, r)$. A similar reasoning holds for to $\\left\\{x_{k_{n}}\\right\\}$. Thus, $\\lim \\operatorname{inn}_{n}\\left\\{\\right.$ hyp $\\left.f_{n}\\right\\}=\\lim \\operatorname{out}_{n}\\left\\{\\right.$ hyp $\\left.f_{n}\\right\\}=$ hyp $f$. Such equality implies $\\lim _{n}$ hyp $f_{n}=$ hyp $f$. Hence, by item (i) in Lemma 4.1 we have the following\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\liminf _{n} R\\left(X_{n}\\right) & =\\liminf _{n} \\sup _{x \\in X_{n}} R(\\dot{x})=\\liminf _{n} \\sup _{x \\in X} f_{n}(x) \\\\\n& \\geqslant \\sup _{x \\in X} f(x)=\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})=R(X)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, we have the desired lower semi-continuity. The deduction for $\\mathscr{A}_{R}$ is straightforward. Regarding the remaining inequality, let $\\|X-Y\\|<\\infty$. We then have, by Lipschitz continuity, that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|R(X)-R(Y)| & =\\left|\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})-\\sup _{y \\in Y} R(\\dot{y})\\right| \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\sup _{x \\in X, y \\in Y}|R(\\dot{x})-R(\\dot{y})| \\\\\n& \\leqslant \\sup _{x \\in X, y \\in Y}\\|x-y\\|_{\\infty} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{z \\in X-Y}\\|z\\|_{\\infty}=\\|X-Y\\|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.\nRemark 4.3. Under finiteness, WC-boundedness is equivalent to the following implication: if, for some real scalar $\\alpha, R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant \\alpha$ for all $x \\in X$ then $R(X) \\leqslant \\alpha$. Both these properties are implied by the stronger one, which we call element monotonicity: for all $X, Y \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, if $R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant R(\\dot{y})$ for any $x \\in X$ and any $y \\in Y$, then $R(X) \\leqslant R(Y)$. That\n\nthis is indeed a stronger condition that can be checked by taking $Y=\\left\\{-\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})\\right\\}$. In addition, under monotonicity, Theorem 4.2 implies that all these properties are equivalent, since the worst-case representation (4.1) implies element monotonicity.\n\nRemark 4.4. In view of the last theorem, under the worst-case representation there is a link between SRMs and usual, univariate risk measures on $L^{\\infty}$. Indeed, let $\\rho$ be a monetary risk measure on $L^{\\infty}$, and suppose $R$ is defined on $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ through $R(X)=$ $\\sup _{x \\in X} \\rho(x)$. By recalling that the acceptance set of $\\rho$ is $A_{\\rho}=\\left\\{x \\in L^{\\infty}: \\rho(x) \\leqslant 0\\right\\}$, we have by Theorem 4.2 that $\\mathscr{A}_{R}=\\left\\{X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right): X \\subseteq A_{\\rho}\\right\\}$, that is, $\\mathscr{A}_{R}=\\operatorname{pwr}\\left(A_{\\rho}\\right) \\cap$ $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ or yet, for $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ one has $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ if and only if $X \\subseteq A_{\\rho}$.\n\nTheorem 4.5. Let $R$ be a WC-bounded monetary SRM. Then, the following are equivalent:\n(i) $R$ is convex.\n(ii) $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is convex.\n(iii) $R$ is set-convex.\n(iv) it holds, for every $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, that\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}}\\left\\{\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle-\\tau_{R}\\left(\\delta_{q}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{R}$ is as in (3.3) and $\\delta_{q}$ is the Dirac measure concentrated at $q$.\nIn particular, $R$ is coherent if and only if $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is coherent, and this is equivalent to the representation\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R} & =\\left\\{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}:\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\leqslant R(X) \\text { for all } X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}: \\tau_{R}\\left(\\delta_{q}\\right)=0\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. Regarding (i) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (ii), the equivalence is straightforward. For (ii) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (iii), notice that taking convex combinations does not alter the supremum that represents $R$, which implies $R(X)=R(\\operatorname{conv}(X))$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. For the converse, let $x, y \\in L^{\\infty}$ and $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$. Then,\n\n$$\nR(\\{\\lambda x+(1-\\lambda) y\\}) \\leqslant R(\\operatorname{conv}(\\{x, y\\})) \\leqslant R(\\{x, y\\})=\\max \\{R(\\dot{x}), R(\\dot{y})\\}\n$$\n\nThus, $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is quasi-convex. By translation invariance, it is a convex risk measure in $L^{\\infty}$. Additionally, we have (i) $\\Leftrightarrow$ (iii) by noticing that\n\n$$\nR(\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda) Y) \\leqslant R(\\operatorname{conv}(X \\cup Y)) \\leqslant R(X \\cup Y)=\\max \\{R(X), R(Y)\\}\n$$\n\nBefore proving the representation, we need the following definitions: given a riskmeasure $\\rho$ in $L^{\\infty}$ with acceptance set $A_{\\rho}=\\rho^{-1}(-\\infty, 0]$, the corresponding penalty term is the mapping $\\tau_{\\rho}: \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\cup\\{\\infty\\}$, defined through $\\tau_{\\rho}(q)=\\sup _{x \\in A_{\\rho}}\\langle q,-x\\rangle$. As is well known in the literature, the penalty term is convex and lower semi-continuous in the total variation norm. Theorem 4.33 in Follmer and Schied (2016) states that $\\rho$ is a convex risk measure if and only if it can be represented as\n\n$$\n\\rho(x)=\\max _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}}\\left\\{\\langle q,-x\\rangle-\\tau_{\\rho}(q)\\right\\}, \\quad x \\in L^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nIn this setup, assume (iv) holds. Then it is clear that (4.2) defines a WC-bounded, convex and set-convex SRM. Thus, the equivalences in items (i) to (iii) hold. For the converse implication, let $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})=: \\rho(x)$. By Theorem 4.2 we have that $R$ is lower semi-continuous. We then get that $R(X)=\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})$ holds if and only if\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(X) & =\\sup _{x \\in X} \\sup _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}}\\left\\{\\langle q,-x\\rangle-\\tau_{\\rho}(q)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}}\\left\\{\\sup _{x \\in X}\\langle q,-x\\rangle-\\tau_{\\rho}(q)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\sup _{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}}\\left\\{\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle-\\tau_{\\rho}(q)\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRegarding the penalty term, recall from Theorem 4.2 that, for $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, one has $X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ if and only if $\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}$ for all $x \\in X$. Thus, the penalty term is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tau_{\\rho}(q) & =\\sup _{\\dot{x} \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}}\\langle q,-x\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\sup _{X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}} \\sup _{x \\in X}\\langle q,-x\\rangle \\\\\n& =\\sup _{X \\in \\mathscr{A}_{R}}\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle=\\tau_{R}\\left(\\delta_{q}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, for the coherent case, the equivalence for positive homogeneity is clear. From\n\n(4.2) we get that $\\tau_{R}$ only takes 0 and $\\infty$ as possible values, and then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R} & =\\left\\{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}: \\tau_{R}(q)=0\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}:\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle \\leqslant R(X) \\text { for all } X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is straightforward, from linearity and continuity of $q \\mapsto\\langle\\dot{q},-X\\rangle$, that $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R}$ is nonempty, closed and convex. This concludes the proof.\n\nRemark 4.6. The connection between eqs. (3.2) and (4.2) is that the latter is equivalent to the former by taking the supremum over $\\left\\{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{c}: \\mu=\\delta_{q}, q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}\\right\\}$. When $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is Fatou continuous, the representations in the last theorem are taken over probability measures. In this case, one has to replace the maximum for a supremum. If in addition $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is Lebesgue continuous, then the supremum over probability measures is attained.\n\nRemark 4.7. A question of interest here is whether the supremum in the worst-case formulation is attained. Under monotonicity, we have $\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x}) \\leqslant R(\\operatorname{ess} \\inf X)$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$. The converse inequality holds when essinf $X \\in X$. Thus,\n\n$$\nR(X)=\\max _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})=R(\\operatorname{ess} \\inf X)\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is convex, then we have that\n\n$$\nR(X)=R(\\operatorname{conv}(X))=\\sup _{x \\in \\operatorname{conv}(X)} R(\\dot{x}), \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nNoticing that $\\operatorname{conv}(X) \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, it is clear that $\\operatorname{conv}(X)$ is weak* compact. Then, when $x \\mapsto R(\\dot{x})$ is weak* upper semi-continuous, which is equivalent to Lebesgue continuity, we have that the supremum is then attained for any $X$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 5 Examples and applications \n\nExample 5.1. A prominent example is based on the concept of Bochner integral. See the chapter 11.8 in Aliprantis and Border (2006) for specific details and results. For any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, we have that the set $X(\\omega)=\\{x(\\omega): x \\in X\\}$ is both closed and bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$ (this is true $p$-a.s.). Boundedness is directly inherited from that of $X$, while closedness follows since $\\left|x_{n}(\\omega)-x(\\omega)\\right| \\leqslant\\left\\|x_{n}-x\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}}$. Thus, $X(\\omega) \\in K(\\mathbb{R})$, where $K(\\mathbb{R})$ is the collection of compact subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$. Notice that $K(\\mathbb{R})$ is in fact a Banach space, since sum and multiplication by scalar for compact spaces are closed operations. A function $\\varphi: \\Omega \\rightarrow$\n\n$K(\\mathbb{R})$ is simple if $\\varphi(\\omega)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_{i} 1_{A_{i}}(\\omega)$, for some collection $K_{1}, \\ldots, K_{n}$ of compact sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ and some events $\\left\\{A_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n} \\subseteq \\mathscr{F}$. The Bochner integral (w.r.t $p$ ) of a simple function is the monotone, linear operator from the linear space of step functions to $K(\\mathbb{R})$ defined as $\\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi \\mathrm{d} p=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_{i} p\\left(A_{i}\\right)$. We say that $\\omega \\mapsto X(\\omega)$ is strongly measurable if there is a sequence of simple functions $\\left\\{\\varphi_{n}: \\Omega \\rightarrow K(\\mathbb{R}), n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$, such that\n\n$$\n\\|X(\\omega)-\\varphi_{n}(\\omega)\\|_{K(\\mathbb{R})} \\rightarrow 0, \\quad p \\text {-a.s. }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\|\\cdot\\|_{K(\\mathbb{R})}$ is the norm in $K(\\mathbb{R})$. In addition, we say that $X$ is Bochner integrable if there is a sequence of simple functions (which can be taken to be the same one as above) such that $\\omega \\mapsto\\left\\|X(\\omega)-\\varphi_{n}(\\omega)\\right\\|_{K(\\mathbb{R})}$ is Lebesgue integrable with respect to $p$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left\\|X(\\omega)-\\varphi_{n}(\\omega)\\right\\|_{K(\\mathbb{R})} \\mathrm{d} p(\\omega)=0\n$$\n\nIn this case, we define the Bochner integral of $X$ with respect to $p$ as\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} X \\mathrm{~d} p=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{\\Omega} \\varphi_{n} \\mathrm{~d} p\n$$\n\nwhere the limit is taken on the norm of $K(\\mathbb{R})$. Thus, examples of SRMs over the subspace of Bochner integrable sets in $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ are, but of course not limited to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{1}(X)=-\\min \\int_{\\Omega} X \\mathrm{~d} p \\\\\n& R_{2}(X)=-\\min \\bigcup_{q \\subseteq Q_{R_{2}}} \\int_{\\Omega} X \\mathrm{~d} q\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{R_{2}} \\subseteq Q$ is non-empty, closed and convex. $R_{2}$ is well-defined since $L^{\\infty}(p) \\subseteq L^{\\infty}(q)$ for any $q \\in Q$. Both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are coherent SRMs. Of course, many other real valued operators over $K(\\mathbb{R})$ can be considered beyond the minimum.\n\nExample 5.2 (New SRMs from old SRMs). Given a collection $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}$ of base SRMs, it is possible to obtain new SRMs by composition with a multivariate transformation $g: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Below, we provide a few examples. First, consider the risk averse $R_{\\max }$ defined through\n\n$$\nR_{\\max }(X)=\\max \\left\\{R_{1}(X), \\ldots, R_{n}(X)\\right\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis map inherits the properties from $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}$, and, in this case, we get $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\max }}=$\n\n$\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} \\mathscr{A}_{R_{i}}$. In view of Theorem 4.2, under convexity (respectively, coherence) of the base SRMs, we get $\\tau_{R_{\\max }}=\\operatorname{conv}\\left(\\min _{i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}} \\tau_{R_{i}}\\right)$ (respectively, dual set $\\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R_{\\max }}=$ $\\left.\\operatorname{conv}\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+R_{i}}\\right)\\right)$. Alternatively, consider the permissive $\\mathrm{SRM}, R_{\\min }$, given by\n\n$$\nR_{\\min }(X)=\\min \\left\\{R_{1}(X), \\ldots, R_{n}(X)\\right\\}, \\quad X \\in \\operatorname{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this case, we get $\\mathscr{A}_{R_{\\min }}=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \\mathscr{A}_{R_{i}}$, but notice that $R_{\\min }$ does not inherit convexity from $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}$. In particular, this implies $R_{\\min }$ lacks a representation under a penalty function or a dual set. It also fails to inherit WC-boundedness, since we can easily take some $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\min _{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\sup _{x \\in X} R_{i}(\\dot{x})>\\sup _{x \\in X} \\min _{i=1, \\ldots, n} R_{i}(\\dot{x})=\\sup _{x \\in X} R_{\\min }(\\dot{x})\n$$\n\nLast but not least, one could consider an averaging of the form\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} R_{i}(X), \\quad X \\in \\operatorname{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{n} \\in[0,1]$ are convex weights such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i}=1$. This map does inherit from the base SRMs all the properties of Definition 2.2, with exception to WCboundedness, since we can take some $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} \\sup _{x \\in X} R_{i}(\\dot{x})>\\sup _{x \\in X} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} R_{i}(\\dot{x})=\\sup _{x \\in X} \\bar{R}(\\dot{x})\n$$\n\nThe three SRMs above can be considered as a way to tackle uncertainty about the adequacy/quality of the risk assessments offered by each individual base SRM $R_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}$.\n\nExample 5.3 (Knightian uncertainty). This examples offers an alternative approach to tackle uncertainty. Two topics broadly discussed in the literature, model misspecification and Knightian uncertainty in a dynamic decision-making framework are theoretical frameworks that try to overcome the difficulties arising from an environment of imperfect information, where decision-makers are confronted with the consequences of their risk assessments. To give an example, Moresco et al. (2024) consider a worst-case SRM similar to (4.1). In the context of financial losses represented by $x$, uncertainty may arise as the agent faces ambiguity about whether $x$ accurately models the true payoff. In such instances, it becomes prudent for the agent to contemplate a set of alternative random variables. These alternatives are payoffs that are considered \"close\" to $x$ or share common attributes, such as similar distributional features. The uncertainty set of $x$ is\n\nthen written as $u(x)$, where $u: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$ is translation invariant, positive homogeneous, convex, and monotone, i.e. if $x \\leqslant y$, then $u(x)=: X \\leqslant Y:=u(y)$. There is a plethora of uncertainty sets considered in the literature, including uncertainty sets defined via, e.g., mixtures of distributions (Zhu and Fukushima, 2009), moment constraints (Natarajan et al., 2009), divergence constraints (Wang et al., 2016), and combinations of moment and divergence constraints (Bernard et al., 2023). Those are prime examples of uncertainty sets that are constructed as neighborhoods around a reference distribution or random variable, with radius given by a tolerance distance, that is\n\n$$\nu_{D}(x):=\\left\\{y \\in L^{\\infty}: D(x, y) \\leqslant \\varepsilon\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $D$ can be, for example, a semi-norm (Gotoh et al., 2013), the Wasserstein distance (Pflug and Wozabal, 2007), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Calafiore, 2007), general $f$-divergences, and expected scores (Moresco et al., 2024). Given a traditional coherent risk measure $\\rho: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and an uncertainty set $u$, the corresponding worst-case robust risk measure $\\rho_{u}$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\rho_{u}(x)=\\sup _{y \\in u(x)} \\rho(y)=R_{\\rho}(u(x))=\\left\\langle Q^{\\rho},-u(x)\\right\\rangle, \\quad x \\in L^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{\\rho}$ is the worst-case SRM associated with $\\rho$, and the set $Q^{\\rho}=\\left\\{Q \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}\\right.$ : $\\left.\\sup _{x \\in A_{\\rho}}\\langle q,-x\\rangle<\\infty\\right\\}$.\n\nExample 5.4 (Systemic risk). The next example has some relation to systemic risk measures, as studied in Chen et al. (2013) and Kromer et al. (2016), for instance. Let an aggregation function be a surjective map $\\Lambda: \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}$ that is monotone, translation invariant, normalized, concave and continuous. Prominent examples are $\\Lambda(X)=$ $\\operatorname{ess} \\inf X$ or $\\Lambda(X)=$ ess sup $X$. For some risk measure $\\rho$ we have a SRM defined as\n\n$$\nR(X):=R_{\\rho, \\Lambda}(X)=\\inf \\left\\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\Lambda(X)+\\alpha \\in A_{\\rho}\\right\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that such map is a convex SRM. It can be monetary or coherent, by dropping or demanding the necessary properties for both $\\Lambda$ and $\\rho$. Now, by translation invariance,\n\n$$\nR(X):=R_{A, \\Lambda}(X)=\\inf \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}: \\Lambda(X+\\dot{\\alpha}) \\in A\\}, \\quad X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a convex acceptance set. Both maps coincide over $A=A_{\\rho}$ or $\\rho=\\rho_{A}$. or This is the case for $\\Lambda(X)=$ essinf $X$. In this case we get that $R(X)=-\\inf _{x \\in X}$ essinf $x=$\n\n$\\sup _{x \\in X} \\mathrm{ML}(x)$, where ML stands for the maximum loss risk measure.\nExample 5.5. A usual risk-neutral stochastic problem has the form\n\n$$\n\\min _{a \\in A}\\langle p, \\ell(a, x)\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $A$ is a set of possible/allowable actions, $x \\in\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)^{n}$, and $\\ell: A \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a suitable loss function. A possible risk-averse counterpart to the above is\n\n$$\n\\min _{a \\in A} \\rho(\\ell(a, x))\n$$\n\nwhich, in the conditions of Theorem 4.2, can be extended to\n\n$$\n\\min _{a \\in A} R(\\ell(a, X))=\\min _{a \\in A} \\sup _{x \\in X} \\rho(\\ell(a, x)), \\quad X \\in \\operatorname{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)^{n}\n$$\n\nA natural question that arises in this venue is whether this problem is robust, in the sense of how it responds to small perturbations in $X$. We have the following result.\n\nProposition 5.6. Assume $R$ is WC-bounded monetary SRM. If $X_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon} X$, and $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X_{n}$ is precompact, then\n\n$$\n\\min _{a \\in A} R\\left(\\ell\\left(a, X_{n}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow \\min _{a \\in A} R(\\ell(a, X))\n$$\n\nProof. In this case we have that the sequence $\\left\\{f_{n}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ as defined in the proof of Theorem 4.2 is tight. By item (iii) in Lemma 4.1, hypo-convergence then implies convergence and finiteness of the supremum. Hence, we have that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{x \\in X_{n}} R(\\dot{x})=\\sup _{x \\in X} f_{n}(x) \\rightarrow \\sup _{x \\in X} f(x)=\\sup _{x \\in X} R(\\dot{x})\n$$\n\nThus, we have $R\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow R(X)$. For ease of notation, let $g_{n}, g: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be defined as $g_{n}(a)=R\\left(\\ell\\left(a, X_{n}\\right)\\right)$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and $g(a)=R(\\ell(a, X))$. Then, we have that $g_{n} \\rightarrow g$ pointwise. That is, if $a_{n} \\rightarrow a$, then $g_{n}\\left(a_{n}\\right)=R\\left(\\ell\\left(a_{n}, X_{n}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow R(\\ell(a, X))=g(a)$, which implies epi $g_{n} \\xrightarrow{\\epsilon}$ epi $g$. Now, take\n\n$$\na_{n}^{*} \\in \\underset{a \\in A}{\\arg \\min } R\\left(\\ell\\left(a, X_{n}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nfor each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since, translation invariance and monotonicity imply $|R(X)| \\leqslant\\|X\\|$ for any $X \\in \\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, we get that $\\left\\{a_{n}^{*}, n \\geqslant 1\\right\\}$ is bounded since $\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} X_{n}$ is precompact, and hence bounded. Then, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, $a_{n}^{*}$ converges\n\n(by taking a sub-sequence if needed). Thus, from item (ii) in Lemma 4.1 we get that $\\inf _{a \\in A} R\\left(\\ell\\left(a, X_{n}\\right)\\right) \\rightarrow \\inf _{a \\in A} R(\\ell(a, X))$. The claim follows, since the infimum is attained.\n\nExample 5.7. It is well known that risk measures are closely linked to preferences. In fact, a traditional risk measure $\\rho: L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ induces a preference relation $x \\bar{\\leqslant} y$ if and only if $\\rho(x) \\geqslant \\rho(y)$. For more details, see, for example, Drapeau and Kupper (2013). Following this idea, our SRM also induces a preference relation over $\\mathrm{CB}\\left(L^{\\infty}\\right)$, which can be understood as one basket of goods being preferred to another. Specifically, we define the preference order $\\leqslant$ by setting $X \\leqslant Y$ if and only if $R(X) \\geqslant R(Y)$. There are several studies on the representation of preferences over sets of goods; see, for instance, Kreps (1979); Dekel et al. (2001, 2007). These works often rely on the concept of a \"subjective state space,\" which can be challenging to identify explicitly. By Lemma 1 and Theorem 3 of Dekel et al. (2001), if $R$ is a continuous convex SRM, then it satisfies set-convexity and admits a representation of the form\n\n$$\nR(-X)=u\\left(\\left(\\sup _{x \\in X} \\mathfrak{u}(q, x)\\right)_{q \\in S}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $S$ is a state space, $\\mathfrak{u}: S \\times L^{\\infty} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a state-dependent expected utility function that is affine in the second argument, and $u$ is an increasing aggregator function. In light of Theorem 3.2, we can take $S=U_{+}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{u}(q, x)=\\langle\\hat{q}, x\\rangle-\\tau_{R}(\\mu), \\quad \\text { and } \\quad u(\\psi)=\\max _{\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{T}}\\left\\{\\int_{U_{+}} \\psi(q) \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor admissible $\\psi$; eq. (5.1) is recovered by taking $\\psi(q)=\\sup _{x \\in X} \\mathfrak{u}(q, x)$. The idea here is that the agent chooses a basket of assets (say, $X$ ), and then he evaluates the utility of this choice when the \"latent state\" $q$ is revealed. A preference order $\\bar{\\leqslant}$ on the space of random variables admits a representation via an affine risk measure $\\rho$ if and only if it satisfies the independence and Archimedean properties (Drapeau and Kupper, 2013, Proposition 1). This result extends to the preference order $\\bar{\\leqslant}$ on sets of random variables, as established in Theorem 4 of Dekel et al. (2001) and Theorem S2 of Dekel et al. (2007). Specifically, a preference order $\\leqslant$ over sets of random variables admits a representation via an affine SRM $R$ if and only if it satisfies the independence and Archimedean properties. In this case, there exists a measure $\\mu \\in \\mathbf{b a}_{1,+}^{T}$ such that $R(X)=\\int_{U_{+}}\\langle\\hat{q},-X\\rangle \\mathrm{d} \\mu(q)-\\tau_{R}(\\mu)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# References \n\nAliprantis, C.

Traditional risk measures typically operate on\nspaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random\nvariables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk\nmeasures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an\naxiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely\nadditive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded\nrandom variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the\nsupremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples\nillustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio\noptimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the\ntheory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a\nbroader range of financial and mathematical applications.", "updated": "2025-03-22T16:10:02Z", "published": "2024-07-26T12:08:58Z"}
