In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems.

In brief, an agent observes feedback from interactions with an environment, updates its current behavior according to its experience, and aims to discover the best possible actions based on a certain criterion. RL provides an appealing alternative to modelbased methods; indeed, with RL various environmental assumptions come at a low computational cost, while solving analytically for the optimal policies may be difficult and are often intractable for complex models.

The rationale behind this approach is that despite not interacting with the intended environment, training experience should reflect events similar to those likely to occur during the testing phase. Uncertainty in the real-world environment, however, may result in algorithms optimized on training models to perform poorly during testing. Therefore, it is crucial to consider robustifying the agent's actions, that is to account for inherent environmental uncertainty in sequential decision making problems.\n\nThere exist several distances to construct uncertainty sets and robustify optimization problems, such as the Kantorovich distance (see e.g. Pflug and Wozabal, 2007), Kullback-Leibler divergence (see e.g. Glasserman and Xu, 2014), distances originating from mass transportation (see e.g. Blanchet and Murthy, 2019), or the supremum over all risk induced by Bayesian mixture probability measures (Cuchiero et al., 2022). In the literature, robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) in a model-based setting were first initiated concurrently in Nilim and El Ghaoui (2005); Iyengar (2005) where uncertainties are uncoupled between states, a property known as rectangularity ambiguity. Many works extended this framework for computational improvements, including robust policy gradient methods (see e.g. Kumar et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023) and the references therein). Despite the connections between risk-aware and robust MDPs Osogami (2012); Li and Shapiro (2023), however, it remains unclear how to formally generalize those ideas to scalable model-free algorithms. Some researchers have developed methodologies to account for model uncertainty in model-free RL problems. Among others, Smirnova et al. (2019) propose a distributionally robust risk-neutral RL algorithm, where the uncertainty set consists of all policies having a Kullback-Leibler divergence within a given epsilon of a reference action probability distribution, Abdullah et al. (2019) develop a robust risk-neutral RL method, where the robustness is induced by considering all transition probabilities in a Wasserstein ball from a reference dynamics model, and Clavier et al. (2022) give a robust distributional RL algorithm constrained with a $\\phi$-divergence on the transition probabilities.\n\nAccounting for uncertainty in the testing environment is important, but ideally, risk must also simultaneously be accounted for. Indeed, agents often want to follow a strategy that goes beyond \"on-average\" optimal performance, especially in mathematical finance applications with low-probability but high-cost outcomes. Risk-aware RL, or risksensitive RL, aims to mitigate risk by replacing the expectation in the optimization problem with risk measures. It also provides more flexibility than traditional risk-neutral approaches, because the agent may choose the measure of risk according to her own goals and risk preferences - moreover, the agent may use risk measures to trade off risk and reward.\n\nThere are numerous proposals for optimizing static risk measures in sequential decision making problems. One main issue with these works is that their proposed algorithms find optimal precommitment strategies, i.e., they result in time-inconsistent strategies. In the more recent literature, many authors have attempted to overcome this issue with risk measures adapted to a dynamic setting. Among others, B\u00e4uerle and Glauner (2021) propose iterated coherent risk measures, where they both derive risk-aware dynamic programming (DP) equations and provide policy iteration algorithms, Ahmadi et al. (2021) investigate bounded policy iteration algorithms for partially observable MDPs, Kose and Ruszczy\u0144ski (2021) prove the convergence of temporal difference algorithms optimising dynamic Markov coherent risk measures, and Cheng and Jaimungal (2022) derive a DP principle for Kusuoka-type conditional risk mappings. These works, however, require computing the value function for every possible state of the environment, limiting their applicability to problems with a small number of state-action pairs.\n\nThe articles closest in spirit to ours are those in Jaimungal et al. (2022), Coache et al. (2023), and Bielecki et al. (2023). First, Jaimungal et al. (2022) develop a deep RL approach to solve a wide class of robust risk-aware RL problems, where an agent minimizes the static worst-case rank dependent expected utility measure of risk of all random variables\n\nwithin a certain uncertainty set. It generalizes the approach from Pesenti and Jaimungal (2023), in which the authors aim to find an optimal strategy, whose terminal wealth is distributionally close to a benchmark's according to the 2-Wasserstein distance, minimizing a static distortion risk measure of the terminal P\\&L in a portfolio allocation application. Wu and Jaimungal (2023) apply the approach to robustify path dependent option hedging. Then, Coache et al. (2023) design a deep RL algorithm to solve time-consistent RL problems where the agent optimizes dynamic spectral risk measures. It builds upon the work from Coache and Jaimungal (2024) by exploiting the conditional elicitability property of spectral risk measures to improve their estimation, and Marzban et al. (2023) which focus on dynamic expectile risk measures. These ideas are also used in Jaimungal et al. (2023) for risk budgeting allocation with dynamic distortion risk measures. Finally, Bielecki et al. (2023) derive dynamic programming equations for risk-averse control problems with model uncertainty from a Bayesian perspective and partially observed costs. This approach simultaneously accounts for risk and model uncertainty, but requires finite state and action spaces.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this paper bridges the gaps between those works, as it simultaneously accounts for risk with dynamic risk measures and robustifies the actions against the uncertainty of the environment using the Wasserstein distance within the one-step conditional risk measures. Our contributions may be summarized as follows: (i) we consider robust risk-aware RL problems with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures; (ii) we analyze the worst-case distribution function of those dynamic robust distortion risk measures with uncertainty sets induced by the conditional Wasserstein distance via their quantile representation; (iii) we derive a formula for computing the deterministic policy gradient using the Envelope theorem for saddle-point problems; (iv) we devise a deep actorcritic style algorithm for solving those RL problems, which optimizes a deterministic policy and estimates elicitable functionals using strictly consistent scoring functions; and (v) we prove that, for a fixed policy, there exists a neural network approximating the corresponding Q-function to any arbitrary accuracy. Moresco et al. (2024) proves (under certain technical assumptions) that the form of robustification that we utilize indeed leads to time-consistent optimal strategies, as well, they provide an even more general equivalence between time-consistency and robust dynamic risk measures. Tam and Pesenti (2025) proves that our model uncertainty can be interpreted as an upper bound for distributionally robust problems with multivariate random variables under Lipschitz aggregation.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the fundamental concepts to formally define dynamic robust risk measures and their properties. We then introduce the class of RL problems and explore their worst-case distributions for various dynamic robust distortion risk measures in Section 3. Section 4 presents our developed actor-critic algorithm to solve those risk-aware RL problems, and Section 5 provides some universal approximation theorem results for our approach. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our RL methodology on a portfolio allocation application in Section 6 and explain our work's limitations and future extensions in Section 7.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Risk Assessment \n\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of dynamic risk measures. There exist several classes of static risk measures (see e.g. F\u00f6llmer and Schied, 2016, and the references therein), and various extensions to dynamic risk measures in the literature (see e.g. Acciaio and Penner, 2011; Bielecki et al., 2016). Here, we briefly summarize the work of Ruszczy\u0144ski (2010), which derives a recursive equation for dynamic risk measures using general principles, and present a class of one-step conditional robust distortion risk measures with their properties inline with the framework of Moresco et al. (2024).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "### 2.1 Dynamic Risk\n\nWhile one may employ static risk measures in sequential decision making problems, doing so often leads to an optimal precommitment strategy, as static risk measures are not dynamically time-consistent risk measures - we discuss the precise definition below. In essence, an optimal strategy planned for a future state of the environment when optimizing a static risk measure may not be optimal anymore once the agent reaches this state. Therefore, we must adapt risk\n\nassessment to a dynamic framework to properly monitor the flow of information. For the remaining of this section, we follow the work of Ruszczy\u0144ski (2010).\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}:=\\{0, \\ldots, T\\}$ denote a sequence of periods, and define $\\mathcal{Z}_{t}:=\\mathcal{L}^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ as the space of bounded $\\mathcal{F}_{t^{-}}$ measurable random variables. We consider a filtration $\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}=: \\mathcal{F}_{0} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_{1} \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$ on a filtered probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F},\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$. We also define $\\mathcal{Z}_{t_{1}, t_{2}}:=\\mathcal{Z}_{t_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathcal{Z}_{t_{2}}$. In what follows, we assume that $Z \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}$ is a $\\mathcal{F}_{t+1}$-measurable random cost with support on $\\mathbb{K} \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}$, conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF)\n\n$$\nF_{t}(z):=\\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\leq z \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right) \\in[0,1] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\hat{F}_{t}(u):=\\inf \\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{K}: F_{t}(z) \\geq u\\right\\}\n$$\n\nrespectively. Furthermore, for the remaining of the paper, all inequalities between sequences of random variables are to be understood component-wise and in the almost sure sense.\n\nDefinition 2.1. A dynamic risk measure is a sequence of conditional risk measures $\\left\\{\\rho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$, where $\\rho_{t_{1}, t_{2}}$ is a map $\\rho_{t_{1}, t_{2}}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t_{1}, t_{2}} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}_{t_{1}}$ for any $t_{1}, t_{2} \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $t_{1}<t_{2}$.\n\nThe mappings $\\rho_{t, T}(Z)$ may be interpreted as $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable charges one would be willing to incur at time $t$ instead of the sequence of costs $Z$. We next enumerate some properties of various dynamic risk measures - not all properties are required, but some, such as normalization, monotonicity, and cash additivity, are crucial in various settings.\nDefinition 2.2. Let $Z, W \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t, T}$, and $\\beta>0$, where $\\beta \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t}$. A dynamic risk measure $\\left\\{\\rho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ is said to be the following if the statement holds for any $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ :\n\n1. normalized if $\\rho_{t, T}(0, \\ldots, 0)=0$;\n2. monotone if $Z \\leq W$ implies $\\rho_{t, T}(Z) \\leq \\rho_{t, T}(W)$;\n3. cash additive if $\\rho_{t, T}\\left(Z_{t}, Z_{t+1}, \\ldots, Z_{T}\\right)=Z_{t}+\\rho_{t, T}\\left(0, Z_{t+1}, \\ldots, Z_{T}\\right)$;\n4. positive homogeneous if $\\rho_{t, T}(\\beta Z)=\\beta \\rho_{t, T}(Z)$;\n5. subadditive if $\\rho_{t, T}(Z+W) \\leq \\rho_{t, T}(Z)+\\rho_{t, T}(W)$;\n6. comonotonic additive if $\\rho_{t, T}(Z+W)=\\rho_{t, T}(Z)+\\rho_{t, T}(W)$ for all comonotonic pairs $(Z, W)$.\n\nAs in the static setting, a dynamic risk measure is called coherent if it satisfies the properties of monotonicity, cash additivity, positive homogeneity and subadditivity.\n\nA pivotal property of dynamic risk measures is their time-consistency, to ensure that risk assessments of future outcomes do not result in contradictions over time (see e.g. Cheridito et al., 2006).\n\nDefinition 2.3. A dynamic risk measure $\\left\\{\\rho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ is said to be strongly time-consistent iff for any sequence $Z, W \\in$ $\\mathcal{Z}_{t_{1}, T}$ and any $t_{1}, t_{2} \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $0 \\leq t_{1}<t_{2} \\leq T$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t_{2}, T}\\left(Z_{t_{2}, T}\\right) \\leq \\rho_{t_{2}, T}\\left(W_{t_{2}, T}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad Z_{t_{1}, t_{2}-1}=W_{t_{1}, t_{2}-1}\n$$\n\nimplies that $\\rho_{t_{1}, T}\\left(Z_{t_{1}, T}\\right) \\leq \\rho_{t_{1}, T}\\left(W_{t_{1}, T}\\right)$.\nDefinition 2.3 may be interpreted as follows: if $Z$ will be at least as good as $W$ tomorrow (in terms of the dynamic risk $\\rho_{t_{2}, T}$ ) and they are identical today (between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ ), then, all other things being equal, $Z$ should not be worse than $W$ today (in terms of $\\rho_{t_{1}, T}$ ). A key result to derive a recursive relationship for strongly time-consistent dynamic risk measures is the following characterisation (see Theorem 1 of Ruszczy\u0144ski (2010)).\nProposition 2.4. Let $\\left\\{\\rho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ be a dynamic risk measure satisfying the normalization, monotonicity and cash additivity properties. Then $\\left\\{\\rho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ is time-consistent iff for any $0 \\leq t_{1} \\leq t_{2} \\leq T$ and $Z \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{0, T}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t_{1}, T}\\left(Z_{t_{1}, T}\\right)=\\rho_{t_{1}, t_{2}}\\left(Z_{t_{1}}, \\ldots, Z_{t_{2}-1}, \\rho_{t_{2}, T}\\left(Z_{t_{2}, T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nA time-consistent dynamic risk measure at any time $t_{1}$ can be seen to include the sequence of costs up to a certain time $t_{2}$, and the $\\mathcal{F}_{t_{2}}$-measurable charge for the remaining future costs. As a consequence of Proposition 2.4, for any\n\n$t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we have the recursive relationship\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t, T}\\left(Z_{t, T}\\right)=Z_{t}+\\rho_{t}\\left(Z_{t+1}+\\rho_{t+1}\\left(Z_{t+2}+\\cdots+\\rho_{T-2}\\left(Z_{T-1}+\\rho_{T-1}\\left(Z_{T}\\right)\\right) \\cdots\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the one-step conditional risk measures $\\rho_{t}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}_{t}$ satisfy $\\rho_{t}(Z)=\\rho_{t, t+1}(0, Z)$ for any $Z \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}$. The one-step conditional risk measures may have stronger properties, e.g., be convex or coherent. Eq. (2.1) provides a tractable expression to work with for deriving dynamic programming principles in RL problems.\n\nThe following class of one-step conditional risk measures, defined through Choquet integrals and introduced by Yaari (1987) in a static setting, subsumes many risk measures commonly used in the literature.\n\nDefinition 2.5. Let $\\nu: \\mathcal{F}_{t+1} \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow[0,1]$ be a regular conditional distribution of $Z$ given $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$, i.e. $\\nu(\\cdot, \\omega)$ is a probability measure for any $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ and $\\nu(z, \\cdot)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable for any $z \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t+1}$. A one-step conditional distortion risk measure $\\rho_{t}^{g}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}_{t}$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t}^{\\gamma}(Z)(\\omega)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z \\gamma\\left(F_{t}(Z)\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right](\\omega)=\\int_{0}^{1} \\gamma(u) \\bar{F}_{t}(u)(\\omega) \\mathrm{d} u, \\quad \\text { for a.e. } \\omega \\in \\Omega\n$$\n\nwhere $g:[0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1]$, called distortion function, is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable, nondecreasing and such that $g(0)=0$ and $g(1)=1$. Alternatively, if $g$ is absolutely continuous, it admits the representation\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t}^{g}(Z)(\\omega)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z \\gamma\\left(F_{Z \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}}(Z)\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right](\\omega)=\\int_{0}^{1} \\gamma(u) \\bar{F}_{Z \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}}(u)(\\omega) \\mathrm{d} u, \\quad \\text { for a.e. } \\omega \\in \\Omega\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$satisfies $\\gamma(u)=\\partial_{-} g(x)]_{x=1-u}$ (and hence $\\int_{[0,1]} \\gamma(u) \\mathrm{d} u=1$ ) and $\\partial_{-}$denotes the derivative from the left (see Theorem 6 in Dhaene et al., 2012).\n\nRemark 2.6. If the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ is trivial, i.e. $\\mathcal{F}_{t}=\\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}$, then $\\rho_{t}^{g}(Z)$ in Definition 2.5 becomes the static distortion risk measure of a random cost $Z$. We suppress the dependence on $\\omega$ for one-step conditional risk measures in the sequel for readability.\n\nBy the properties of Choquet integrals, such one-step conditional distortion risk measures are cash additive, monotone, positively homogeneous and comonotonic additive. Such risk measures allow for risk-averse, risk-seeking, or partially risk-averse and risk-seeking attitudes by judiciously choosing the distortion function $g$ (or $\\gamma$ ).\n\nIn practice, there is often uncertainty on distribution of the random costs $Z$, and therefore we propose to robustify risk measures by using the worst-case risk of a random variable $W$ that lies within an $\\epsilon$-Wasserstein ball of $Z$. Such robustification has desirable properties and is an important line of research in financial risk management. Recently, Moresco et al. (2024) have investigated the inclusion of uncertainty sets within dynamic risk measures from a very general perspective. One of their results shows that, under suitable mild assumptions, considering uncertainty on the entire stochastic process is equivalent to considering one-step uncertainty sets. In our work, we use precisely this onestep uncertainty ball formulation. As well, Tam and Pesenti (2025) have studied static robust optimization problems with uncertainty sets involving various multivariate Wasserstein distances. They prove that for Lipschitz aggregation functions, the uncertainty set of the aggregate random variable contains the aggregate of the multivariate uncertainty set. In our work, these uncertainty sets may be viewed as an upper bound on aggregate uncertainty.\n\nDefinition 2.7. Let $\\langle f, g\\rangle=\\int_{[0,1]} f(u) g(u) \\mathrm{d} u$ be the $L^{2}$-inner product between two real functions $f, g$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\|f\\|^{2}=\\langle f, f\\rangle$. The conditional Wasserstein distance of order 2 between two random variables on $\\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}$ with conditional quantile functions denoted by $\\bar{F}_{t}, \\bar{G}_{t}$ and distributions on the real line is given by\n\n$$\nd_{t}^{2}\\left(\\bar{F}_{t}, \\bar{G}_{t}\\right)=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left(\\bar{F}_{t}(u)-\\bar{G}_{t}(u)\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} u=\\left\\|\\bar{F}_{t}-\\bar{G}_{t}\\right\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nDefinition 2.8. A robust one-step conditional measure of risk $\\rho_{t}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Z}_{t}$ under the uncertainty set $\\varphi^{\\epsilon}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} \\rightarrow$ $2^{\\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}}$ with tolerance $\\epsilon \\geq 0$ is defined as\n\n$$\ng_{t}^{\\epsilon}(Z):=\\underset{Z^{\\phi} \\in \\varphi_{Z}^{\\epsilon}}{\\operatorname{ess} \\sup } \\rho_{t}\\left(Z^{\\phi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this paper, we consider the following two uncertainty sets induced by the conditional Wasserstein distance, where $F_{\\phi, t}$ is the $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-conditional CDF of $Z^{\\phi}$ and $\\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}$ its quantile function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\vartheta_{Z}^{\\epsilon} & =\\left\\{Z^{\\phi} \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}: \\quad\\left\\|\\bar{F}_{t}-\\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}\\right\\| \\leq \\epsilon\\right\\}, \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n\\varsigma_{Z}^{\\epsilon} & =\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\left\\|\\bar{F}_{t}-\\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}\\right\\| \\leq \\epsilon, \\\\\nZ^{\\phi} \\in \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1}: & \\left\\langle\\bar{F}_{t}, 1\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}, 1\\right\\rangle, \\\\\n& \\left\\|\\bar{F}_{t}\\right\\|^{2}=\\left\\|\\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}\\right\\|^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEq. (2.2a) contains all $\\mathcal{F}_{t+1}$-measurable random variable that are distributionally close to $Z$ wrt the conditional Wasserstein distance, while Eq. (2.2b) additionally imposes they have the same first two moments. These uncertainty sets expand as the tolerance $\\epsilon$ increases, and one recovers the original risk measure $\\rho_{t}$ when $\\epsilon=0$. Here, $\\epsilon$ in Definition 2.8 is directly driven by the agent's risk preferences. Rules of thumb for this tolerance $\\epsilon$ are explored in Section 6.\n\nIn what follows, we work with dynamic risk measures where each one-step conditional risk measure is a robust distortion risk measure, as described in Definitions 2.5 and 2.8, with a tolerance $\\epsilon_{t} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t}$ and an absolutely continuous piecewise linear distortion function $g_{t}$ :\n\n$$\ng_{t}^{\\epsilon_{t}, g_{t}}(Z):=\\underset{Z^{\\phi} \\in \\varphi_{Z}^{\\epsilon_{t}}}{\\operatorname{ess} \\sup } \\mathbb{E}\\left[Z^{\\phi} \\gamma_{t}\\left(F_{\\phi, t}\\left(Z^{\\phi}\\right)\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis class of risk measures takes into account the uncertainty of the random variable with the robustification, allows risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviors with the distortion function, and are conditionally elicitable, because they may be written as a linear combination of CVaRs. We first explore uncertainty sets $\\varphi_{Z}^{\\epsilon}$ satisfying Eq. (2.2a) in Subsection 3.1, and then show in Subsection 3.2 why including moment constraints as in Eq. (2.2b) becomes essential for decision making problems.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 2.2 Elicitability \n\nOne desirable property for risk measures, which plays a crucial role in the algorithmic part of this work, is their elicitability. Indeed, an elicitable measure of risk admits the existence of a certain loss function that can be used as a penalizer when updating its point estimate. Here, we follow the work from Gneiting (2011).\nDefinition 2.9. Let $\\mathbb{A} \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathbb{R}}^{k}$, for $k \\geq 1$. A mapping $\\rho_{t}: \\mathcal{Z}_{t+1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}$ is $k$-elicitable Gneiting (2011) iff there exists a strictly consistent scoring function $S: \\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{K} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ for $\\rho$, that is, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim F_{t}}\\left[S\\left(\\rho_{t}(Z), Z\\right)\\right] \\leq \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim F_{t}}[S(\\mathfrak{a}, Z)]\n$$\n\nfor any $F_{t}$ and $\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathbb{A}$, with equality when $\\mathfrak{a}=\\rho_{t}(Z)$.\nIn view of Definition 2.9, a risk measure is elicitable if and only if there exists a scoring function $S$ such that its estimate is the unique minimizer of the expected score, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t}(Z)=\\underset{\\mathfrak{a} \\in \\mathbb{A}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim F_{t}}[S(\\mathfrak{a}, Z)]\n$$\n\nTo fix ideas, let us describe some strictly consistent scoring functions for well-known risk measures. The mean is 1 -elicitable and a strictly consistent scoring function must be of the form $S(\\mathfrak{a}, z)=h(z)-h(\\mathfrak{a})+h^{\\prime}(\\mathfrak{a})(\\mathfrak{a}-z)$, where\n\n$h$ is strictly convex with subgradient $h^{\\prime}$. We remark that using $h(z)=z^{2}$ leads to the squared error. The value-at-risk $\\left(\\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha}\\right)$ at level $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, and thus any $\\alpha$-quantile, is also 1 -elicitable and a strictly consistent scoring function is necessarily written as $S(\\mathfrak{a}, z)=\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\{a \\leq z\\}}-\\alpha\\right)(h(\\mathfrak{a})-h(z))$ for a nondecreasing $h$. The conditional value-at-risk $\\left(\\mathrm{CVaR}_{\\alpha}\\right)$ at level $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ is not 1-elicitable, but rather 2-elicitable along side the value-at-risk.

In addition, as noted by Frongillo and Kash (2015), we may construct a strictly consistent scoring function for a vector of elicitable components using the scoring functions of each component.\n\nRemark 2.10. As we can observe, there exist infinitely many characterizations of strictly consistent scoring functions for $k$-elicitable mappings. In this paper, we do not investigate how different characterizations may affect optimization performances and potentially improve the convergence speed of our RL algorithm.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 3 Problem Setup \n\nIn this section, we introduce and rigorously define the class of RL problems we aim to solve. We describe each problem as an agent who tries to learn an optimal behavior, or agent's policy, that attains the minimum in a given objective function by interacting with a certain environment in a model-agnostic manner.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ be arbitrary state and action spaces respectively, and let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ be a cost space. We represent the environment as a MDP with the tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, c, \\mathbb{P})$, where $c\\left(s, a, s^{\\prime}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is a cost function and $\\mathbb{P}\\left(s_{t+1}=s^{\\prime} \\mid s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)$ characterize the transition probabilities. The transition probability is assumed stationary, although time may be a component of the state. In what follows, we take the augmented state space where the first dimension represents time. An episode consists of a sequence of $T+1$ periods, where $T \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is known and finite. We often assume that the periods refer to fixed intervals, but the framework may be extended to periods of arbitrary length. At each period, the agent begins in a state $s_{t} \\in \\mathcal{S}$, takes an action $a_{t} \\in \\mathcal{A}$ according to a deterministic policy $\\pi: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{A}$, moves to the next state $s_{t+1} \\in \\mathcal{S}$, and receives a cost $c_{t}=c\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}, s_{t+1}\\right)<\\infty$. We view the cost function as a deterministic mapping of the states and actions, but we can easily generalize to include other sources of randomness. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe consider strongly time-consistent dynamic risk measures $\\left\\{\\varrho_{t, T}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ with one-step conditional risk measures that are robust distortion risk measures with piecewise constant distortion functions, as defined in Subsection 2.1. We aim to solve $(T+1)$-period robust risk-aware RL problems of the form\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\pi} \\varrho_{0, T}^{\\epsilon, \\gamma}\\left(\\left\\{c_{t}^{\\pi}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}\\right)=\\min _{\\pi} \\varrho_{0}^{\\epsilon_{s_{0}}, \\gamma_{s_{0}}}\\left(c_{0}^{\\pi}+\\varrho_{1}^{\\epsilon_{s_{1}}, \\gamma_{s_{1}}}\\left(c_{1}^{\\pi}+\\cdots+\\varrho_{T}^{\\epsilon_{s_{T}}, \\gamma_{s_{T}}}\\left(c_{T}^{\\pi}\\right) \\cdots\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $c_{t}^{\\pi}=c\\left(s_{t}, \\pi\\left(s_{t}\\right), s_{t+1}\\right)$ is a bounded $\\mathcal{F}_{t+1}$-measurable random cost modulated by the policy $\\pi$. State-dependent distortion functions $\\gamma_{s_{i}}$ and tolerances $\\epsilon_{s_{i}}$ may be used to illustrate an agent that, for instance, slowly reduces her model uncertainty as she gets closer to the terminal period or drastically changes her risk preferences in less favorable states. In this paper, we prove the results under the assumption of state-dependent distortions and tolerances, but focus on simpler state-independent dynamic risk measures in the experimental section.\n\nAs opposed to the typical literature on robust MDPs, we consider uncertainty sets directly on the distribution of costs-to-go instead of the transition probabilities. This allows us to capture dependence on the factors that generates them, such as the transition probabilities, the agent's actions, and other moment constraints through the form of $\\varphi$. Moreover,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ Considering randomized policies would require additional care to establish a proper dynamic programming principle and extending to this case is outside the scope of this paper. See, e.g., Cheng and Jaimungal (2022; 2024).\n\nin a RL setting, the agent can sample transitions but does not necessarily know the true underlying dynamics. In this sense, our formulation makes no explicit assumptions on how the uncertainty set interacts with $\\mathbb{P}\\left(s^{\\prime} \\mid s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)$.\n\nRemark 3.1. Here, we do not subtract the dynamic robust risk of zero to obtain a weak recursive dynamic risk measure (see Theorem 4 of Moresco et al. (2024)), as the risk of zero does not depend on the policy parameters and, hence, does not play a role in the optimization procedure.\n\nGiven Eq. (P), we define the value function for an agent as the running risk-to-go\n\n$$\nV_{t}(s ; \\pi):=\\varrho_{t}^{r_{s_{t}}, \\gamma_{s_{t}}}\\left(c_{t}^{\\pi}+\\varrho_{t+1}^{r_{s_{t+1}}, \\gamma_{s_{t+1}}}\\left(c_{t+1}^{\\pi}+\\cdots+\\varrho_{T}^{r_{s_{T}}, \\gamma_{s_{T}}}\\left(c_{T}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right) \\mid s_{t}=s\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$. It gives the (time-consistent) dynamic risk of the sequence of future costs for the agent following the policy $\\pi$ at a certain time $t$ when being in a specific state $s$. Using Definition 2.8 , the dynamic programming equations for a specific policy $\\pi$ are\n\n$$\nV_{t}(s ; \\pi)=\\varrho_{t}^{r_{s}, \\gamma_{s}}\\left(c_{t}^{\\pi}+V_{t+1}\\left(s_{t+1}^{\\pi} ; \\pi\\right) \\mid s_{t}=s\\right)=\\underset{Z_{t}^{\\phi} \\in \\varphi_{Z_{t}^{\\pi}}^{\\tau_{s}}}{\\operatorname{ess} \\sup }\\left\\langle\\gamma_{s}, \\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}(\\cdot \\mid s)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{t}^{\\pi}=c_{t}^{\\pi}+V_{t+1}\\left(s_{t+1}^{\\pi} ; \\pi\\right), \\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}(\\cdot \\mid s)$ is the CDF of $Z_{t}^{\\phi}$ given $s_{t}=s$, and $V_{T+1}=0$. We apply the dynamic programming principle (DPP) to recover a Bellman-like equation for the value function:\n\n$$\nV_{t}(s ; \\pi^{*})=\\min _{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\underset{Z_{t}^{\\phi} \\in \\varphi_{Z_{t}^{\\pi}}^{\\tau_{s}}}{\\operatorname{ess} \\sup }\\left\\langle\\gamma_{s}, \\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}(\\cdot \\mid s)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{t}^{a, \\pi^{*}}=c\\left(s_{t}, a, s_{t+1}\\right)+V_{t+1}\\left(s_{t+1} ; \\pi^{*}\\right)$. The previous equation indicates the optimal policy for the agent at any point in state with a recursive equation involving the future costs, composed of the cost at current time $t$, the running risk-to-go at the next time $t+1$, and an adversary who distorts both to get the worst performance.\n\nAlternatively, we define the quality function or $Q$-function, which effectively represents the running risk-to-go for an agent starting in any state-action tuple and thereafter following the policy $\\pi$, as\n\n$$\nQ_{t}(s, a ; \\pi):=\\varrho_{t}^{r_{s_{t}}, \\gamma_{s_{t}}}\\left(c\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}, s_{t+1}\\right)+\\varrho_{t+1}^{r_{s_{t+1}}, \\gamma_{s_{t+1}}}\\left(c_{t+1}^{\\pi}+\\cdots+\\varrho_{T}^{r_{s_{T}}, \\gamma_{s_{T}}}\\left(c_{T}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right) \\mid s_{t}=s, a_{t}=a\\right)\n$$\n\nfor all $s \\in \\mathcal{S}, t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ and $a_{t} \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Using the DPP for the value function in Eq. (3.1), we have a similar Bellman-like equation for the Q-function.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the value function $V_{t}(s ; \\pi)=Q_{t}(s, \\pi(s) ; \\pi)$ over policies $\\pi$, which also requires maximizing the worst-case risk over $\\phi$ in the uncertainty set and estimating the value function itself. We propose to use parametric approximators for the different components we optimize, and thus we aim to estimate the Q-function\n\n$$\nQ_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)=\\underset{Z_{t}^{\\phi} \\in \\varphi_{Z_{t}^{\\theta}}^{\\tau_{s}}}{\\operatorname{ess} \\sup }\\left\\langle\\gamma_{s}, \\bar{F}_{\\phi, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ are the policy parameters. For compact notation, we denote costs-to-go by $Z_{t}^{\\theta}:=c_{t}+Q_{t+1}\\left(s_{t+1}, \\pi^{\\theta}\\left(s_{t+1}\\right) ; \\theta\\right)$ and their conditional CDF by $F_{\\theta, t}(z \\mid s, a):=F_{Z_{t}^{\\theta} \\mid s_{t}=s, a_{t}=a}(z)$. In the next sections, we determine the distribution of the worst-case cost-to-go $Z_{t}^{\\phi}$ conditionally on a state-action pair $(s, a)$ for different uncertainty sets. This allows us to design random variables that maximize the one-step conditional risk measure within the Q-function while remaining distributionally close to the original cost-to-go according to the appropriate uncertainty set.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 3.1 Wasserstein uncertainty set \n\nIn this section, we investigate dynamic robust risk measures, where the one-step conditional risk measures are distortion risk measures with uncertainty sets of the form in Eq. (2.2a). More precisely, we restrict the random variable's distribution to lie within a Wasserstein ball within the original distribution. The next result is similar to Theorem 3.9 of Pesenti and Jaimungal (2023), here, however, we reformulate to account for conditional distributions and study the problem without any terminal or copula constraints. The proof of Theorem 3.2 is deferred to Appendix C.1.\nTheorem 3.2. Let $F^{\\uparrow}$ be the isotonic projection of a function $F$, more precisely its projection onto the set of quantile functions $F^{\\uparrow}:=\\arg \\min _{G \\in \\widetilde{\\mathbb{P}}}\\|G-F\\|^{2}$, where $\\widetilde{\\mathbb{P}}:=\\left\\{F \\in \\mathbb{L}^{2}([0,1]): F\\right.$ is nondecreasing and left-continuous $\\}$. Further, consider the $Q$-function in Eq. (3.2), where its uncertainty set is of the form in Eq. (2.2a). The quantile function of the optimal random variable in the optimization problem $Q_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{F}_{\\phi, t}^{*}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)=\\left(\\tilde{F}_{\\theta, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)+\\frac{\\gamma_{s}(\\cdot)}{2 \\lambda^{*}}\\right)^{\\uparrow}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda^{*}>0$ is such that $\\left\\|\\tilde{F}_{\\phi, t}^{*}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)-\\tilde{F}_{\\theta, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)\\right\\|=\\epsilon_{s}$.\nEquipped with the previous result, finding the optimal quantile function may be computationally intensive, because it requires repeatedly solving the optimization problem in Theorem 3.2 to find the optimal $\\lambda^{*}$ for any pair $(s, a) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}$. One solution to alleviate this issue consists of performing parallel computations to accelerate the process. Another approach is to work with a smaller class of dynamic risk measures. Indeed, Theorem 3.2 may be simplified if we consider one-step conditional distortion risk measures that are coherent. We specify this observation in the result below.\n\nCorollary 3.3. Consider the Q-function in Eq. (3.2), where its uncertainty set is of the form in Eq. (2.2a) and the distortion function $\\gamma_{s}$ of each one-step conditional risk measure is nondecreasing. The quantile function of the optimal random variable in the optimization problem $Q_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)$ is\n\n$$\n\\tilde{F}_{\\phi, t}^{*}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)=\\tilde{F}_{\\theta, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)+\\frac{\\epsilon_{s} \\gamma_{s}(\\cdot)}{\\left\\|\\gamma_{s}\\right\\|}\n$$\n\nProof. The result follows from Theorem 3.2. Since both $\\tilde{F}_{\\theta, t}$ and $\\gamma_{s}$ are nondecreasing, the isotonic projection equals itself and we recover $\\lambda^{*}=\\left\\|\\gamma_{s}\\right\\| / 2 \\epsilon_{s}$ from the constraint.\n\nUsing nondecreasing distortion functions, Corollary 3.3 implies that\n\n$$\nQ_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)=\\left\\langle\\gamma_{s}, \\tilde{F}_{\\theta, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)\\right\\rangle+\\epsilon_{s}\\left\\|\\gamma_{s}\\right\\|=\\left\\langle\\gamma_{s}, \\tilde{F}_{\\mathcal{Z}_{t}^{p}+\\epsilon_{s} \\| \\gamma_{s} \\|, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nAs conditional distortion risk measures are cash-additive, the $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable shift $\\epsilon_{s}\\left\\|\\gamma_{s}\\right\\|$ in Eq. (3.3) may be included as part of the cost function $c_{t}$, regardless of the tolerance being constant or state-dependent. Therefore, for dynamic distortion risk measures with nondecreasing distortion functions and uncertainty sets of the form in Eq. (2.2a), robustness is equivalent to modulating the cost function. In fact, this observation may be extended to other dynamic monetary risk measures with uncertainty sets induced only by semi-norms on the space of random variables. Furthermore, with state-independent parameters, the robust and non-robust optimal policies remain identical, because the shift $\\epsilon\\|\\gamma\\|_{2}$ does not depend whatsoever on the policy parameters $\\theta$.\n\nRemark 3.4. For this class of problems, the structure of the resulting actor-critic algorithm resembles other deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms found in the literature (see e.g. Lillicrap et al. (2015); Marzban et al. (2023)).

In this section, we explore the latter option by considering dynamic robust distortion risk measures with uncertainty sets of the form in Eq. (2.2b).

{"section_id": 10, "text": "# 4.1 CDF of Costs-to-go \n\nThe objective consists of estimating with the ANN $F^{\\vartheta}$ the CDF of the costs-to-go $Z_{t}^{\\theta}$ conditionally on the current state-action pair $(s, a)$, formally $F_{\\theta, t}(z \\mid s, a)$. If one knows the conditional distribution of the costs-to-go, then in view of Theorems 3.2 and 3.5, one understands how to perturb the costs-to-go in order to maximize the distortion risk. In this procedure, we suppose that all other networks, i.e., Q-function $Q^{\\psi}$, first moment $\\mu^{\\chi}$ and policy $\\pi^{\\theta}$, are fixed.\n\nWe propose to use scoring rules in order to obtain an estimation of this conditional CDF. A strictly proper scoring rule for probabilistic forecasts is the equivalent of a strictly consistent scoring function for point forecasts. We refer the reader to Gneiting and Raftery (2007) for a thorough discussion and numerous examples of proper scoring rules on general sample spaces. The continuous ranked probability score is known to be a strictly proper scoring rule for the class of CDFs with finite first moments. For any random variable $Z$, its CDF $F_{Z}$ is\n\n$$\nF_{Z}=\\underset{F \\in \\mathbb{F}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{Z \\sim F_{Z}}[S(F, Z)]\n$$\n\nwith the strictly proper scoring rule $S(F, z)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(F(y)-\\mathbb{1}_{\\{z \\leq y\\}}\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} y$. Therefore, we may update our estimation $F^{\\vartheta}$ for the conditional CDF $F_{\\theta, t}(z \\mid s, a)$ by using the fact that\n\n$$\nF_{\\theta, t}(\\cdot \\mid s, a)=\\underset{F \\in \\mathbb{F}}{\\arg \\min } \\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}^{g} \\sim \\mathcal{F}}\\left[\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(F\\left(y \\mid s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)-\\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{Z_{t}^{g} \\leq y\\right\\}}\\right)^{2} \\mathrm{~d} y \\mid s_{t}=s, a_{t}=a\\right]\n$$\n\nFor each epoch of the training procedure, we first compute realizations of the costs-to-go $Z_{t, b}^{g}:=c_{t, b}+$ $Q^{\\psi}\\left(s_{t+1, b}, \\pi^{\\theta}\\left(s_{t+1, b}\\right)\\right)$. We then evaluate the integral within the continuous ranked probability score of Eq. (4.1) over a partition of $N$ points covering the cost space $\\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\\left\\{y_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1, \\ldots, N}$. The choice of the partition is ultimately application-dependent, and must be carefully chosen by the user. The loss we aim to minimize is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\vartheta}=\\frac{1}{B T} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(F^{\\vartheta}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}, y_{i}\\right)-\\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{Z_{t, b}^{g} \\leq y_{i}\\right\\}}\\right)^{2} \\Delta y_{i}\n$$\n\nWe repeat these steps to update the parameters $\\vartheta$ and train the ANN $F^{\\vartheta}$ until convergence.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "### 4.2 First Moment of Costs-to-go and Q-function\n\nFor the critic, we want to estimate the first moment $\\mu(s, a)$ and Q-function $Q_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)$ while fixing the other ANN structures. Without loss of generality, we assume that the one-step conditional risk measures are 1-elicitable with a corresponding strictly consistent scoring function $S$. Recall that, in our setting, the sequence of costs induced by the agent's policy is explained by the sequence of states and actions. Therefore, the first moment and Q-function must be approximated using a function, as opposed to a point forecast, because it is an elicitable functional of the conditional CDF given $\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)$. We wish to find mappings $\\mu, Q: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that minimize the following expected scores:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\min _{\\mu: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}^{g} \\sim \\mathcal{F}}\\left[\\left(\\mu\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)-Z_{t}^{\\theta}\\right)^{2} \\mid s_{t}=s, a_{t}=a\\right] \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n\\min _{Q: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1}^{g} \\sim \\mathcal{F}}\\left[S\\left(Q\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\\right) ; Z_{t}^{\\phi}\\right) \\mid s_{t}=s, a_{t}=a\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nFor the critic, we use this deep composite regression approach, where we restrict the space of mappings to ANNs parametrized by some parameters $\\chi, \\psi$, respectively. To keep a model-agnostic algorithm, we replace the expectation by the empirical mean over a batch of $B$ observed transitions. Finally, we generate realizations of the worst-case costs-to-go $Z_{t}^{\\phi}$ using the inverse transform sampling on its optimal quantile function.\n\nWhen estimating the first moment, we optimize the loss function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\chi}=\\frac{1}{B T} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{b=1}^{B}\\left(\\mu^{\\chi}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}\\right)-Z_{t, b}^{\\theta}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nLet $\\hat{\\theta}, \\hat{\\psi}, \\tilde{\\chi}, \\tilde{\\vartheta}$ denote frozen parametrizations of the ANN approximations that are slowly updated. This technique can be thought of as using target networks to avoid numerical instabilities (see e.g. Van Hasselt et al. (2016)). For the Q-function, if the uncertainty set is of the form in Eq. (2.2b) with a nondecreasing distortion function $\\gamma_{s}$, we may use the optimal quantile function $\\tilde{F}_{\\phi}^{*}$ as in Theorem 3.5. It leads to the loss function\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\psi}=\\frac{1}{B T} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} S\\left(Q^{\\psi}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}\\right) ; \\widetilde{\\mu}_{t, b}+\\frac{\\lambda_{t, b}^{*}\\left(\\widetilde{Z}_{t, b}^{\\theta}-\\widetilde{\\mu}_{t, b}\\right)+\\gamma_{s_{t, b}}\\left(\\widetilde{U}_{t, b}\\right)-1}{b_{\\lambda_{t, b}^{*}}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\mu}_{t, b}:=\\mu^{\\tilde{\\chi}}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}\\right), \\widetilde{Z}_{t, b}^{\\theta}:=c_{t, b}+Q^{\\tilde{\\psi}}\\left(s_{t+1, b}, \\pi^{\\tilde{\\theta}}\\left(s_{t+1, b}\\right)\\right), \\widetilde{U}_{t, b}:=F^{\\tilde{\\vartheta}}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}, \\widetilde{Z}_{t, b}^{\\theta}\\right)$, and $\\lambda_{t, b}^{*}, b_{\\lambda_{t, b}^{*}}$ for each transition are given in Theorem 3.5. Using target networks ensures that the random variables $\\widetilde{U}_{t, b}$ remain conditionally uniform on $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ while the Q-function changes.\n\nRemark 4.3. Alternatively, if the uncertainty set is of the form in Eq. (2.2a), we obtain an estimate of the appropriate optimal quantile function by (i) evaluating the $\\operatorname{CDF} F^{\\vartheta}\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}, \\cdot\\right)$ on the partition covering the cost space $\\left\\{y_{i}\\right\\}_{i}$, (ii) inverting it to get an estimate of the quantile function $\\hat{F}^{\\vartheta}\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}, \\cdot\\right)$, and (iii) performing an isotonic regression with a given $\\lambda^{*}$ until the Wasserstein constraint in Theorem 3.2 is satisfied. Altogether we wish to minimize the loss\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\psi}=\\frac{1}{B T} \\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} S\\left(\\left.Q^{\\psi}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}\\right) ;\\left(\\hat{F}^{\\vartheta}\\left(s_{t, b}, a_{t, b}, x\\right)+\\left.\\frac{\\gamma_{s_{t, b}}(x)}{2 \\lambda_{t, b}^{*}}\\right)^{\\dagger}\\right|_{x=\\widetilde{U}_{t, b}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that this loss function involves constantly solving optimization problems to obtain $\\lambda_{t}^{*}$ and calculating isotonic projections, which is computationally expensive.\n\nThis approach is straightforward to implement with a 1-elicitable functional, as one substitutes $S$ with the strictly consistent scoring function for the corresponding one-step conditional risk measure. For $k$-elicitable mappings, one must modify the structure of $Q^{\\psi}$ according to the number of elicitable mappings such that the one-step conditional risk measure becomes elicitable. If we consider the dynamic $\\mathrm{CVaR}_{\\alpha}$, the Q-function consists of two ANNs returning the approximations of the dynamic $\\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha}$ and the excess between the dynamic $\\mathrm{CVaR}_{\\alpha}$ and dynamic $\\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha}$, while the scoring function is of the form given in Eq. (2.4). For general $\\alpha-\\beta$ risk measures with a distortion function characterized by\n\n$$\n\\gamma(u)=\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\left(p \\mathbb{1}_{\\{u<\\alpha\\}}+(1-p) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{u \\geq \\beta\\}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $p \\in[0,1], 0<\\alpha \\leq \\beta<1$ and $\\eta=p \\alpha+(1-p)(1-\\beta)$, we wish to estimate the vector $\\left(\\mathrm{LTE}_{\\alpha}, \\mathrm{VaR}_{\\alpha}, \\mathrm{VaR}_{\\beta}, \\mathrm{CVaR}_{\\beta}\\right)$, which is 4 -elicitable, and we recover the Q-function with $\\frac{p \\alpha}{\\eta} \\mathrm{LTE}_{\\alpha}+$ $\\frac{(1-p)(1-\\beta)}{\\eta} \\mathrm{CVaR}_{\\beta}$. We refer the reader to Coache et al. (2023) for a similar procedure with dynamic spectral risk measures.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 12, "text": "# 4.3 Policy \n\nTo update the policy, we want to update the policy parameters in the direction of the gradient of the value function.

That is a common approach in the literature (see e.g. Degris et al. (2012)). We repeat these steps for a certain number of epochs, which updates the policy parameters in the direction of the gradient of the value function. The number of epochs for the actor must remain relatively small, because the estimations $Q^{\\psi}, \\mu^{\\chi}, F^{\\vartheta}$ quickly become obsolete as the policy changes.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 5 Universal Approximation Theorem \n\nIn this section, we show that, all things being held equal, there exist sufficiently large ANNs of the form given in Section 4 accurately approximating the relevant mappings, in the same spirit as universal approximation theorems. These theorems rely on the universal approximation theorem for arbitrary width (Lemma B.1), the fact that finite ensembles of ANNs can be approximated by a single ANN with augmented input space (Lemma B.2), and the robustification considered here preserves cash additivity and monotonicity (Lemma B.3), given in the supplemental materials for completeness.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let $\\pi^{\\theta}, F^{\\vartheta}, Q^{\\psi}$ be fixed. Then, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists an ANN, denoted by $\\mu^{\\chi}$, such that $\\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{(s, a) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}}\\left\\|\\mathbb{E}\\left[c_{t}+Q^{\\psi}\\left(s_{t+1}, \\pi^{\\theta}\\left(s_{t+1}\\right)\\right) \\mid\\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\\right)=(s, a)\\right]-\\mu^{\\chi}(s, a)\\right\\|<\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nProof. We give a sketch of the proof, as the result follows closely Theorem 6.2 of Coache and Jaimungal (2024). We aim to estimate the dynamic expectation of the costs-to-go, where each one-step conditional risk measure is monetary. Mappings satisfying cash additivity and monotonicity are Lipschitz continuous and, hence, absolutely continuous. Using Lemma B.1, for each $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, there exists an ANN, denoted by $\\mu_{t}$, approximating to an arbitrary accuracy $\\varepsilon_{t}>0$ the first moment of the costs-to-go $\\mathbb{E}\\left[c_{t}+Q^{\\psi}\\left(s_{t+1}, \\pi^{\\theta}\\left(s_{t+1}\\right)\\right) \\mid s_{t}, a_{t}\\right]$. Using Lemma B.2, there exists a single ANN approximating to an arbitrary accuracy this collection of $\\mathrm{ANNs}\\left\\{\\mu_{t}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$.\n\nTheorem 5.2. Let $\\pi^{\\theta}, F^{\\vartheta}, \\mu^{\\chi}$ be fixed and consider the $Q$-function in Eq. (3.2). Then, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $A N N$, denoted by $Q^{\\psi}$, such that, $\\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$,\n\n$$\n\\sup _{(s, a) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A}}\\left\\|Q_{t}(s, a ; \\theta)-Q^{\\psi}(s, a)\\right\\|<\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nProof. Again, we give a sketch of the proof, as the result follows closely Theorem 6.1 and Corollary 6.2 of Coache et al. (2023). Assume that the Q-function is $k$-elicitable with a given decomposition. Using Lemma B.3, the one-step conditional risk measures, which are robust distortion risk, satisfy the monetary properties and, thus, are absolutely continuous. Furthermore, all $k$ components may be expressed as linear combinations of VaRs and CVaRs, so they are absolutely continuous as well.\n\nWe use a proof by induction to show that all each component may be approximated arbitrarily accurately at every period $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ as long as we have an adequate approximation at the subsequent periods. Using Lemma B.1, the base case at $t=T$ is true. We then assume that the statement is true for $t+1$, that is there exist ANNs, denoted by $Q_{\\kappa, t}$, approximating to an arbitrary accuracy $\\varepsilon_{\\kappa, t}>0$ the $\\kappa$-th component for $\\kappa=1, \\ldots, k$. We prove that the $k$\n\ncomponents may be approximated to any arbitrary accuracy at $t$ using the cash additivity property, triangle inequality and Lemma B.1, which completes the proof by induction.\n\nUsing Lemma B.2, there exist $k$ ANNs approximating to an arbitrary accuracy the collection of $\\mathrm{ANNs}\\left\\{Q_{\\kappa, t}\\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}}$ for $\\kappa=1, \\ldots, k$. Finally, we can construct a single ANN approximating to an arbitrary accuracy the Q-function using the triangle inequality, since it is a linear combination of those $k$ ANNs.\n\nRemark 5.3. Regarding a universal approximation theorem for the conditional CDF, the issue here lies in the partial monotonicity of the conditional CDF, which makes proving uniform convergence results quite challenging. Nonetheless, we believe the combination of unconstrained and constrained layers preserves some suitable universal approximation guarantees. Indeed, we suspect that results such as Theorem 2 of Mikulincer and Reichman (2022) may be extended to our setting, potentially with an accuracy depending on the nonmonotonic inputs, but this remains to be proven. In practice, as we are more invested in ensuring the monotonicity property to avoid numerical instabilities than the approximation guarantees, we recover an adequate estimation of the costs-to-go distribution as part of our actor-critic algorithm, which points that this conjecture holds given a sufficiently large ANN in terms of width and depth.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 14, "text": "# 6 Experimental Results \n\nThis collection of experiments is performed on a portfolio allocation problem similar to Section 7.2 of Coache et al. (2023). Suppose an agent can allocate her wealth between different risky assets during $T=12$ periods over a six month horizon. The agent intents on minimizing a dynamic risk measure of her profit and loss (P\\&L) with robust distortion one-step conditional risk measures. Depending on her own risk preferences, the agent has the possibility to tune her objective by (i) selecting a distortion function that leads to risk-neutral, risk-averse or risk-seeking policies, and (ii) choosing larger $\\epsilon$ 's to robustify her actions against the uncertainty of the true dynamics of the market.\n\nThe choice of the tolerance $\\epsilon$ may be influenced by some additional exogenous information, such as expert opinion or known bounds on the moments of the cost distribution that the agent is willing to accept (see e.g. Pesenti and Jaimungal (2023); Bernard et al. (2023)). Otherwise, the agent may decide on an appropriate $\\epsilon$ using the following data-driven approach. Given a training environment, suppose that the agent designs a testing environment she aims to robustify against. The tolerance $\\epsilon$ should then be just large enough such that the optimal time-consistent robust policy (i) stays close to the optimal policy of the training environment, and (ii) performs relatively well for the testing environment. From the agent's perspective, this specific choice of dynamic robust distortion risk measure gives a notion of robustness she is willing to tolerate for a given pair of trainingtesting environments, which should robustify as well other (unknown) testing environments.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Initial price $S_{0}$, mean and standard deviation of the relative price change $\\frac{S_{t+1}-S_{t}}{S_{t}}$ for each asset estimated over 100,000 simulated sample paths from the VECM. We highlight two distinct groups: riskier assets with greater returns on average (in blue) and less volatile assets with smaller returns (in orange).\n\nWe consider price dynamics driven by a co-integration model to mimic realistic price paths. More precisely, we estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) using daily data from $I=8$ different stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange between September 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 inclusively. The resulting estimated model, with two cointegration factors and no lag differences (both selected using the BIC criterion), is used as a simulation engine to generate price paths $\\left(S_{t}^{(i)}\\right)_{t}, i \\in \\mathcal{I}:=\\{1, \\ldots, I\\}$. We refer the reader to Appendix C of Coache et al. (2023) for\n\nexplanations on VECMs and the parameter estimates for this dataset. We report some statistics of interest for the different stocks in Table 1.\n\nAt each period $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, the agent observes the information available and decides on the proportions of her wealth, denoted by $\\left(\\pi_{t}^{(i)}\\right)_{t}, i \\in \\mathcal{I}$, to invest in the different financial instruments. We impose these actions to be a $I$-simplex in order to avoid short selling, i.e. $\\pi_{t}^{(i)} \\geq 0, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{I}$ and $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} \\pi_{t}^{(i)}=1$, by applying a softmax transformation on the output layer of the policy network. The observed costs corresponds to the P\\&L fluctuation between two subsequent periods $c_{t}=y_{t}+y_{t+1}$, where the agent's wealth $\\left(y_{t}\\right)_{t}$ is determined by\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} y_{t}=y_{t}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\pi_{t}^{(i)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} S_{t}^{(i)}}{S_{t}^{(i)}}\\right), \\quad y_{0}=1\n$$\n\nWe suggest the following approach to include exploratory noise in the current policy. For each action $a=\\pi(s) \\in$ $[0,1]^{I}$, we generate independently a Bernoulli random variable $\\xi \\in\\{0,1\\}$ with an exploration probability $p_{\\mathrm{ex}}=$ 0.5 such that $\\xi \\sim \\operatorname{Ber}\\left(p_{\\mathrm{ex}}\\right)$. For each action such that $\\xi=1$, we additionally generate a Dirichlet noise $\\mathcal{N} \\sim$ Dirichlet( 0.05$)$, and then compute the randomized action $a^{\\prime}=0.75 a+0.25 \\mathcal{N}$. Algorithm parameters and computation times are included in Appendix A.\n\nTo understand what the learned optimal policy dictates, Fig. 2 shows the average investment proportions in each asset for every period when optimizing a dynamic robust $\\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ and varying the the uncertainty tolerance $\\epsilon$. Without robustification, when $\\epsilon=0$, the agent prioritizes a mix of assets, some with greater returns and others with lower volatilities. The learned optimal policy evolves as we increase $\\epsilon$ and the P\\&L distribution moves to the left. For larger tolerances, the learned policy becomes closer to an equal weight portfolio over all available assets. We then repeat the exercise with the dynamic robust $\\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.2}$, as shown in Fig. 3, and obtain the same behavior when increasing $\\epsilon$. Additionally, with a higher risk-awareness, we observe that the learned optimal policy prefers investments in less volatile assets on average. In general, larger uncertainty tolerances lead to more conservative policies that do not perform optimally in terms of P\\&L, and we retrieve the non-robust optimal policies as $\\epsilon$ decreases to zero.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: P\\&L distributions when following learnt optimal policies wrt dynamic robust $\\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: P\\&L

{"section_id": 15, "text": "# 7 Conclusion \n\nIn this work, we present a robust RL framework for time-consistent risk-aware agents. Our approach utilizes dynamic risk measures constructed with a class of robust distortion risk measures of all random variables within a Wasserstein uncertainty set to robustify the agent's actions. We estimate the dynamic risk using the elicitability of distortion risk measures and derive a deterministic policy gradient procedure by reformulating the optimization problem via a quantile representation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed deep learning algorithm performs well on a portfolio allocation example.\n\nOne limitation of the universal approximation theorems provided in Section 5 is that while we prove the existence of arbitrarily accurate ANNs, we do not show how to attain them. It remains an open challenge to provide methodologies with convergence guarantees to the true dynamic risk, and, more generally, to develop deep actor-critic algorithms with convergence guarantees to the optimal policy. Other interesting avenues to pursue in future work consist of deriving RL algorithms for different classes of time-consistent dynamic robust risk measures, such as those with an uncertainty set constructed using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and formally comparing robust RL approaches available in the literature.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 16, "text": "## References\n\nMohammed Amin Abdullah, Hang Ren, Haitham Bou Ammar, Vladimir Milenkovic, Rui Luo, Mingtian Zhang, and Jun Wang.

We generate a partition $\\left\\{y_{i}\\right\\}_{i}$ of 501 evenly spaced points on an interval that covers the costs-to-go $\\widetilde{Z}_{t, b}^{\\vartheta}$ at each iteration, and use mini-batch sizes of $B^{\\vartheta}=B^{\\psi}=B^{\\chi}=B^{\\theta}=128$. The ANNs have the following structure:\n$\\pi^{\\theta}$ : five layers of 32 hidden nodes each with SiLU activation functions and a softmax output activation function;\n$Q^{\\psi}$ : six layers of 32 hidden nodes each with SiLU activation functions, a tanh output activation function for the dynamic VaR and a softplus output activation function for the excess between dynamic CVaR and VaR;\n$\\mu^{\\chi}$ : six layers of 32 hidden nodes each with SiLU activation functions;\n$F^{\\vartheta}$ : four layers of 32 hidden nodes each with SiLU activation functions, followed by four layers of 32 hidden nodes each with tanh activation functions, positive weights, and a sigmoid output activation function.\n\nLearning rates for the critic are initially set to $5 \\times 10^{-4}$, while the learning rate for the actor is set to $3 \\times 10^{-6}$ and decays by 0.999995 at every epoch. The target networks are updated at every iteration with a soft update parameter of $\\tau=0.008$. We train all models for 500,000 iterations (approximately 24 hours) on the Graham servers, managed by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.\n\nTo analyze the computational speed of our algorithm, we report the execution time per 10 iterations using a Tesla T4 GPU on Google Colaboratory in Table 2. Again, each iteration consists of $K^{\\vartheta}=K^{\\psi}=K^{\\chi}=5$ epochs for the critic, before executing the actor for $K^{\\theta}=1$ epoch. Our results seems to indicate sublinear scaling when increasing the number of periods and mini-batch sizes, while the number of assets has a negligible effect. It is important to note here that (i) achieving high precision requires more iterations when increasing the number of periods (see the universal\n\napproximation theorems in Section 5), and (ii) the size of GPU memory for computing gradients represents the main computational bottleneck.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\n(a) 4 assets\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\n(b) 8 assets\n\nTable 2: Average execution time, in seconds, for 10 iterations of the actor-critic algorithm estimated over 10 runs.", "tables": {"table_1": "|  | $B=128$ | $B=256$ | $B=512$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $T=6$ | 1.64 | 2.14 | 3.26 |\n| $T=8$ | 1.69 | 2.32 | 3.55 |\n| $T=12$ | 1.90 | 2.66 | 4.15 |\n| $T=24$ | 2.68 | 3.78 | 5.95 |\n| $T=48$ | 4.20 | 6.01 | 8.54 |", "table_2": "|  | $B=128$ | $B=256$ | $B=512$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $T=6$ | 1.61 | 2.21 | 3.31 |\n| $T=8$ | 1.77 | 2.36 | 3.63 |\n| $T=12$ | 2.02 | 2.73 | 4.24 |\n| $T=24$ | 2.80 | 3.91 | 6.10 |\n| $T=48$ | 4.49 | 6.23 | 8.93 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 18, "text": "# B Additional Lemmas \n\nLemma B.1.

In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL\nproblems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk\nwith a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is\nintroduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a\nreference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural\nnetworks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy\ngradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk\nmeasures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust\nrisk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a\nportfolio allocation example.", "updated": "2025-04-14T18:57:13Z", "published": "2024-09-16T08:54:59Z"}
