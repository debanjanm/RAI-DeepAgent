Introduced in the axiomatic literature by Sprumont (1991), the uniform rule selects an efficient allocation that is as close to equal division as possible: each agent receives either their peak amount or a common amount chosen to ensure feasibility of the overall assignment.\n\nOf paramount importance is the fact that the uniform rule is strategy-proof, i.e., manipulations of the rule by misreporting preferences are not possible. Several characterizations of the rule involve strategy-proofness (see, among others, Sprumont, 1991; Ching, 1994). Recently, a weakening of the notion of strategy-proofness has been proposed. It relies on a refinement of the concept of manipulation. Assuming that an agent knows all possible outcomes under any preference misreport, a manipulation (i.e. a profitable misreport) is obvious if it either makes the agent better off than truth-telling in the worst case or makes the agent better off than truth-telling in the best case, and a rule is non-obviously manipulable if no manipulation of the rule results obvious. The idea underlying this requirement, introduced by Troyan and Morrill (2020), is that even though manipulations are pervasive, agents may not realize they can manipulate a rule because they lack information about others' behavior or they are cognitively limited.\n\nRelaxing strategy-proofness to this weaker version enables the exploration of a diverse range of compelling allocation rules. Arribillaga and Bonifacio (2023) identify a broad class of non-obviously manipulable rules, among which the uniform rule is included. ${ }^{1}$ This raises the question of whether this central rule can be uniquely characterized by imposing, together with non-obvious manipulability, additional meaningful properties. One such property is consistency, a variable-population invariance criterion that has played a fundamental role in axiomatic analysis (Thomson, 2012). Consistency says that the allocation recommended by a rule in a given problem should remain in agreement with the allocation it would recommend in a reduced problem obtained when some participants leave with their assigned allotments.\n\nIn this note, we propose a new characterization of the uniform rule marrying nonobvious manipulability, consistency, efficiency, and a mild fairness axiom. This last one, called the equal division guarantee, requires that if an agent's most preferred level of consumption matches equal division, they should receive exactly that amount.\n\nThere are characterizations of the uniform rule involving consistency (see, among others, Thomson, 1994; S\u00f6nmez, 1994). However, to the best of our knowledge, the result we present here is the first characterization of this rule that incorporates an incentive compatibility criterion alongside consistency.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The existence of an abundance of non-obviously manipulable rules has been established in various settings, including two-sided matching (Troyan and Morrill, 2020; Arribillaga and Risma, 2023), voting (Aziz and Lam, 2021; Arribillaga and Bonifacio, 2024), and cake-cutting (Ortega and Segal-Halevi, 2022).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Preliminaries \n\nWe consider the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ as the set of potential agents. Denote by $\\mathcal{N}$ the collection of all finite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$. Each agent $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is equipped with a single-peaked preference relation $R_{i}$ defined over $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$with a unique peak $p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$, and such that for each pair $\\left\\{x_{i}, x_{i}^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, we have $x_{i} P_{i} x_{i}^{\\prime}$ as long as either $x_{i}^{\\prime}<x_{i} \\leq p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$ or $p\\left(R_{i}\\right) \\leq x_{i}<$ $x_{i}^{\\prime}$ holds. Denote by $\\mathcal{S P}$ the domain of all such preferences. Call $P_{i}$ and $I_{i}$ to the strict preference and indifference relations associated with $R_{i}$, respectively.\n\nGiven $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$, an economy consists of a profile of preferences $R=\\left(R_{j}\\right)_{j \\in N} \\in \\mathcal{S P}^{N}$ and a social endowment $\\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}$and is denoted by $(R, \\Omega)$. Let $\\mathcal{E}^{N}$ be the domain of economies with agents in $N$. Let $\\mathcal{E}=\\bigcup_{N \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathcal{E}^{N}$ denote the set of all potential economies. For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$, let $X(R, \\Omega)=\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N}: \\sum_{j \\in N} x_{j}=\\Omega\\right\\}$ be the set of allocations for economy $(R, \\Omega)$ and let $X=\\bigcup_{(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}} X(R, \\Omega)$. A rule is a function $\\varphi: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ such that $\\varphi(R, \\Omega) \\in X(R, \\Omega)$ for each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n\nGiven a rule $\\varphi$, some desirable properties we consider are listed next.\nThe first property demands the rule to always recommend a Pareto optimal allocation. In this model, this is equivalent to asking that, in economies with excess demand (the sum of the peaks surpasses the social endowment), each agent obtains at most their peak amount; whereas in economies with excess supply (the sum of the peaks falls behind the social endowment), each agent receives at least their peak amount. To formalize this, for each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each economy $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$, let $z(R, \\Omega)=\\sum_{j \\in N} p\\left(R_{j}\\right)-\\Omega$.\nEfficiency: For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}, z(R, \\Omega) \\geq 0$ implies $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega) \\leq p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$ for each $i \\in N$, and $z(R, \\Omega) \\leq 0$ implies $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega) \\geq p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$ for each $i \\in N$.\n\nThe second property, introduced in Arribillaga and Bonifacio (2023), is a mild fairness requirement. It says that an agent should obtain their share of the equal division whenever their peak consumption demands it.\nEqual division guarantee: For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$, each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$ and each $i \\in N$ such that $p\\left(R_{i}\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega}{|\\mathcal{N}|}$, we have $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\frac{\\Omega}{|\\mathcal{N}|}$.\n\nThe third property requires coherence in the treatment of economies and their associated sub-economies. Specifically, if some agents leave an economy with their allocations as determined by the rule, the rule must assign to each remaining agent in the subeconomy the same allocation as in the original economy. Let $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$. If $N^{\\prime} \\subseteq N$ and $R \\in \\mathcal{S P}^{N}$, let $R_{N^{\\prime}}=\\left(R_{j}\\right)_{j \\in N^{\\prime}}$ denote the restriction of $R$ to $N^{\\prime}$.\nConsistency: For each pair $N, N^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{N}$ such that $N^{\\prime} \\subseteq N$, each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$, and each $i \\in N^{\\prime}$, we have $\\varphi_{i}\\left(R_{N^{\\prime}}, \\sum_{j \\in N^{\\prime}} \\varphi_{j}(R, \\Omega)\\right)=\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)$.\n\nFinally, for our incentive compatibility property, we need some definitions. Let $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$,\n\n$i \\in N, R_{i} \\in \\mathcal{S P}$ and $\\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}$. The option set attainable with $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$ at $\\varphi$ is\n\n$$\nO^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)=\\left\\{x \\in[0, \\Omega]: x=\\varphi_{i}\\left(R_{i}, R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right) \\text { for some } R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\in \\mathcal{S P}^{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}\\right\\} .^{2}\n$$\n\nPreference $R_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S P}$ is an obvious manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$ if:\n(i) there is $R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}} \\in \\mathcal{S P}^{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}$ such that $\\varphi_{i}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}, \\Omega\\right) P_{i} \\varphi_{i}\\left(R_{i}, R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}, \\Omega\\right)$; and\n(ii) for each $x^{\\prime} \\in O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right)$ there is $x \\in O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$ such that $x^{\\prime} P_{i} x$.\n\nWhen $R_{i}^{\\prime}$ satisfies (i) we say that $R_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$. A manipulation becomes obvious if (ii) holds, i.e., if each possible outcome under the manipulation is strictly better than some possible outcome under truth-telling.\n\nThe following property precludes such behavior.\nNon-obvious manipulability: For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$, each $i \\in N$, and each $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S P} \\times$ $\\mathbb{R}_{++}$, there is no obvious manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$.\n\nIf rule $\\varphi$ has no manipulation, it is strategy-proof. Clearly, strategy-proofness implies non-obvious manipulability.\n\nRemark 1 The original definition of obvious manipulation introduced by Troyan and Morrill (2020) says that the best possible outcome in $O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right)$ should be strictly better than the best possible outcome in $O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$ or the worst possible outcome in $O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right)$ should be strictly better than the worst possible outcome in $O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$. However, under efficiency, the best possible outcome under truth-telling for an agent is always the agent's peak alternative in our model and thus no manipulation becomes obvious by considering such outcomes. Furthermore, when the set of alternatives is infinite (as in our case), worst possible outcomes may not be well-defined and a more general definition is necessary. For a formal discussion and comparison of our definition of non-obvious manipulability and the original presented by Troyan and Morrill (2020), see Arribillaga and Bonifacio (2023).\n\nThe rule that has played a predominant role in this literature is the uniform rule:\nUniform rule, $u$ : For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$, each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$, and each $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nu_{i}(R, \\Omega)= \\begin{cases}\\min \\left\\{p\\left(R_{i}\\right), \\lambda\\right\\} & \\text { if } z(R, \\Omega) \\geq 0 \\\\ \\max \\left\\{p\\left(R_{i}\\right), \\lambda\\right\\} & \\text { if } z(R, \\Omega)<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda \\geq 0$ and solves $\\sum_{j \\in N} u_{j}(R, \\Omega)=\\Omega$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Barber\u00e0 and Peleg (1990) were the first to use option sets in the context of preference aggregation.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3 Characterization \n\nNow we present our characterization result.\nTheorem 1 The uniform rule is the only rule that satisfies efficiency, the equal division guarantee, consistency, and non-obvious manipulability.\n\nProof. It is clear that the uniform rule satisfies efficiency, the equal division guarantee, consistency (Thomson, 1994), and strategy-proofness (Sprumont, 1991) implying therefore nonobvious manipulability.\n\nNow, let us see uniqueness. Let $\\varphi: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ be a rule satisfying efficiency, the equal division guarantee, consistency, and non-obvious manipulability. We will prove that $\\varphi=u$. Let $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$. The case $\\sum_{j \\in N} p\\left(R_{j}\\right)=\\Omega$ is trivial by efficiency. Without loss of generality, assume that $\\sum_{j \\in N} p\\left(R_{j}\\right)>\\Omega$. The case $\\sum_{j \\in N} p\\left(R_{j}\\right)<\\Omega$ can be handled symmetrically. Let $|N|=n$. The proof proceeds in three steps:\nStep 1: If $\\boldsymbol{p}\\left(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}\\right) \\geq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $\\boldsymbol{i} \\in \\boldsymbol{N}$, then $\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}(\\boldsymbol{R}, \\boldsymbol{\\Omega})=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $\\boldsymbol{i} \\in \\boldsymbol{N}$. We will prove that $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega) \\geq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $i \\in N$. Thus, by feasibility, $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $i \\in N$. Assume on contradiction that there is $i \\in N$ such that $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)<\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$. Then, by singlepeakedness, $\\frac{\\Omega}{n} P_{i} \\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)$. Now, let $R_{i}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S P}$ be such that $p\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$. By the equal division guarantee, $\\varphi_{i}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, R_{N \\backslash\\{i\\}}, \\Omega\\right)=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$. Therefore, $R_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$. Furthermore, as $O^{\\varphi}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}\\right))=\\left\\{\\frac{\\Omega}{n}\\right\\}$, we have that $R_{i}^{\\prime}$ is an obvious manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$. This contradicts that $\\varphi$ satisfies non-obvious manipulability. Hence, $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $i \\in N$.\nStep 2: Let $\\boldsymbol{i} \\in \\boldsymbol{N}$. If $\\boldsymbol{p}\\left(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}$, then $\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}(\\boldsymbol{R}, \\boldsymbol{\\Omega})=\\boldsymbol{p}\\left(\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\boldsymbol{i}}\\right)$. By efficiency, $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega) \\leq p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$. Assume, on contradiction, that $\\lambda \\equiv \\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)<p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$. Let $\\gamma \\in\\left(\\lambda, p\\left(R_{i}\\right)\\right)$. Then, $p\\left(R_{i}\\right)-$ $\\gamma>0$. First, choose $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n\n$$\nk\\left(p\\left(R_{i}\\right)-\\gamma\\right)>\\Omega-n p\\left(R_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\gamma<p\\left(R_{i}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}$, we have $n \\gamma<\\Omega$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{n \\gamma+k \\gamma}{n+k}<\\frac{\\Omega+k \\gamma}{n+k}\n$$\n\nTherefore, by (1) and (2),\n\n$$\n\\gamma<\\frac{\\Omega+k \\gamma}{n+k}<p\\left(R_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, let $N^{*} \\in \\mathcal{N}$ be such that $N \\subseteq N^{*}$ and $\\left|N^{*}\\right|=n+k$, and let $\\Omega^{*}=\\Omega+k \\gamma$. Consider an economy $\\left(R^{*}, \\Omega^{*}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N^{*}}$ where $R_{N}^{*}=R$ and, for each $j \\in N^{*} \\backslash N, R_{j}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{S P}$ is such that\n\n$$\np\\left(R_{j}^{*}\\right)=\\gamma \\text { and } \\frac{\\Omega^{*}}{n+k} P_{j}^{*} x \\text { for each } x \\in(0, \\gamma)\n$$\n\nThe existence of such $R_{j}^{\\star} \\in \\mathcal{S P}$ is guaranteed by (3).\nSince $\\sum_{j \\in N^{\\star}} p\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}\\right)=\\sum_{j \\in N} p\\left(R_{j}\\right)+\\sum_{j \\in N^{\\star} \\backslash N} p\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}\\right)>\\Omega+k \\gamma=\\Omega^{\\star}$, it follows that $\\sum_{j \\in N^{\\star}} p\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}\\right)>\\Omega^{\\star}$. By efficiency, we have $\\varphi_{j}\\left(R^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right) \\leq p\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}\\right)=\\gamma$ for each $j \\in N^{\\star} \\backslash N$.\nClaim: $\\varphi_{j}\\left(R^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)=\\gamma$ for each $j \\in N^{\\star} \\backslash N$. Otherwise, $\\varphi_{j}\\left(R^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)<\\gamma$ for some $j \\in$ $N^{\\star} \\backslash N$ implies, by the equal division guarantee and (4), that such agent $j$ has an obvious manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)$ by declaring a preference with $\\frac{\\Omega^{\\star}}{n+k}$ as its peak alternative. This contradicts that $\\varphi$ is non-obvious manipulability, so the claim is proved.\nTherefore, by the Claim we have $\\sum_{j \\in N^{\\star} \\backslash N} \\varphi\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)=k \\gamma$ or, equivalently, $\\sum_{j \\in N} \\varphi\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)=$ $\\Omega$. Thus, by consistency, $\\varphi_{i}\\left(R^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)=\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\lambda$. As $\\lambda<\\gamma$, (3) implies\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{i}\\left(R^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)<\\frac{\\Omega^{\\star}}{n+k}<p\\left(R_{i}\\right)=p\\left(R_{i}^{\\star}\\right)\n$$\n\nso agent $i$, by the equal division guarantee, has an obvious manipulation of $\\varphi$ at $\\left(R_{j}^{\\star}, \\Omega^{\\star}\\right)$ by declaring a preference with $\\frac{\\Omega^{\\star}}{n+k}$ as its peak alternative. This contradicts that $\\varphi$ is nonobvious manipulability. Hence, $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=p\\left(R_{i}\\right)$, as desired.\n\nStep 3: Concluding. Without loss of generality, assume $N=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $p\\left(R_{1}\\right) \\leq$ $p\\left(R_{2}\\right) \\leq \\ldots \\leq p\\left(R_{n}\\right)$. There are two cases to consider:\n\n1. $p\\left(R_{i}\\right) \\geq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}$ for each $i \\in N$. Then, by Step $1, \\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\frac{\\Omega}{n}=u_{i}(R, \\Omega)$ for each $i \\in N$.\n2. $p\\left(R_{1}\\right)<\\frac{\\Omega}{n}$. Then, by Step $2, \\varphi_{1}(R, \\Omega)=p\\left(R_{1}\\right)=\\min \\left\\{p\\left(R_{1}\\right), \\frac{\\Omega}{n}\\right\\}=u_{1}(R, \\Omega)$. Now, let agent 1 leave with their consumption. By consistency,\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{2}(R, \\Omega)=\\varphi_{2}\\left(R_{N \\backslash\\{1\\}}, \\Omega-\\varphi_{1}(R, \\Omega)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy a similar argument to the one used in economy $(R, \\Omega)$ for agent 1 and the fact that $\\varphi_{1}(R, \\Omega)=u_{1}(R, \\Omega)$, it follows that\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{2}\\left(R_{N \\backslash\\{1\\}}, \\Omega-\\varphi_{1}(R, \\Omega)\\right)=\\min \\left\\{p\\left(R_{2}\\right), \\frac{\\Omega-u_{1}(R, \\Omega)}{n-1}\\right\\}=u_{2}\\left(R_{N \\backslash\\{1\\}}, \\Omega-u_{1}(R, \\Omega)\\right)\n$$\n\nAs $u$ is consistent, $u_{2}\\left(R_{N \\backslash\\{1\\}}, \\Omega-u_{1}(R, \\Omega)\\right)=u_{2}(R, \\Omega)$ and, using (5) and (6), it follows that $\\varphi_{2}(R, \\Omega)=u_{2}(R, \\Omega)$. Continuing in the same way, letting agents leave the economy one by one with their consumptions, we obtain the desired result.\n\nHence, it follows that $\\varphi(R, \\Omega)=u(R, \\Omega)$.\n\nRemark 2 The reasoning in Step 3 of the previous theorem closely follows the approach outlined in Theorem 1 of S\u00f6nmez (1994).\n\nTo analyze the independence of the axioms involved in the characterization of Theorem 1, we consider the following rules.\n\n- Let $\\widetilde{\\varphi}: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ be such that, for each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$ and each $i \\in N$, $\\varphi_{i}(R, \\Omega)=\\frac{\\Omega}{|N|}$. Then $\\widetilde{\\varphi}$ satisfies all properties but efficiency.\n- Let $\\varphi^{<}: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ be a sequential dictator. For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in$ $\\mathcal{E}^{N}$, agents in $N$ following the usual order $<$ choose their best option within the amount left by previous agents. Then, $\\varphi^{<}$satisfies all properties but the equal division guarantee.\n- Let $\\widetilde{\\varphi}: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ be such that, for each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\varphi}(R, \\Omega)= \\begin{cases}\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\Omega, \\frac{2}{3} \\Omega, 0, \\ldots, 0\\right) & \\text { if } p\\left(R_{1}\\right)=p\\left(R_{2}\\right)=\\Omega \\text { and } \\\\ & p\\left(R_{j}\\right)=0 \\text { for each } j \\in N \\backslash\\{1,2\\} \\\\ u(R, \\Omega) & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis rule satisfies efficiency and the equal division guarantee. Observe that\n\n$$\nO^{\\widetilde{\\varphi}}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)=O^{u}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)= \\begin{cases}{\\left[\\frac{\\Omega}{n}, p\\left(R_{i}\\right)\\right]} & \\text { if } p\\left(R_{i}\\right)>\\frac{\\Omega}{n} \\\\ p\\left(R_{i}\\right), \\frac{\\Omega}{n} & \\text { if } p\\left(R_{i}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\Omega}{n}\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nTherefore, if $R_{i}^{\\prime}$ is a manipulation of $\\widetilde{\\varphi}$ at $\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right), \\frac{\\Omega}{n} \\in O^{\\widetilde{\\varphi}}\\left(R_{i}^{\\prime}, \\Omega\\right)$. Then, by singlepeakedness, there is no $x \\in O^{\\widetilde{\\varphi}}\\left(R_{i}, \\Omega\\right)$ such that $\\frac{\\Omega}{n} P_{i} x$, implying that $\\widetilde{\\varphi}$ satisfies non-obvious manipulability. Therefore, $\\widetilde{\\varphi}$ satisfies all properties but consistency.\n\n- Let $\\varphi^{\\star}: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ be such that, for each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in \\mathcal{E}^{N}$,\n\n$$\n\\varphi^{\\star}(R, \\Omega)= \\begin{cases}\\varphi^{m}(R, \\Omega) & \\text { if } z(R, \\Omega)>0 \\\\ u(R, \\Omega) & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\varphi^{m}: \\mathcal{E} \\longrightarrow X$ is a sequential dictator where the order of the agents is given by ordering their peaks in an increasing manner. ${ }^{3}$ For each $N \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and each $(R, \\Omega) \\in$ $\\mathcal{E}^{N}$, agents in $N$ following the order of their preferences' peaks choose their best option within the amount left by previous agents. Clearly, $\\varphi^{\\star}$ satisfies efficiency and the equal division guarantee. As $\\varphi^{m}$ and $u$ satisfy consistency it follows that $\\varphi^{\\star}$ also satisfies it. Then, $\\varphi^{\\star}$ satisfies all properties but non-obvious manipulability.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ Ties are broken by an arbitrary fixed order.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# References \n\nArribillaga, R.
