InTRODUCTION\n\n1.1. Tilings of the integers and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture. Let $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ be a finite set. One says that $A$ tiles the integers by translations if a disjoint union of translated copies of $A$ covers $\\mathbb{Z}$. Alternatively, if there exists a set of translations $T \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ such that any integer $n$ can be uniquely expressed as the sum $a+t=n$, with $a \\in A$ and $t \\in T$. It is well-known [14] that in this case the set $T$ must be periodic, i.e. there exist $M \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a finite set $B \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $T=B \\oplus M \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies that $|A||B|=M$ and $A \\oplus B$ is a tiling of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, with addition $\\bmod M$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $M$ will be denoted by $M=\\prod_{i=1}^{K} p_{i}^{n_{i}}$.\nLet $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ be an arbitrary function.

Secondary 11C08, 43A47, 51D20, 52C22.\n\nGiven $m \\mid M$, we define the set\n\n$$\nR_{m}:=\\left\\{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}:(z, M)=m\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNote, for future reference, that $R_{M}=\\{0\\}$. We refer to each of the sets $R_{m}$ as a step class.\nDefinition 1.1. We say that $f$ is a step function if $f$ is constant on each step class $R_{m}$. We will denote the set of step functions by $\\mathcal{A}(M)$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{A}(M)$ is a vector space with the additional property that the Fourier transform maps it to itself (see Lemma 1.5 below).\n\nGiven a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, its mask polynomial, defined in (1.1) with $f=\\mathbf{1}_{A}$, will be denoted by $A(X)$. As $A(X)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, for any $m \\mid M$ the Fourier transform $\\hat{1}_{A}$ is either constant zero on the step class $R_{m}$, or it has no zeros in $R_{m}$ at all. As such, the support of $\\hat{1}_{A}$ is always a union of step classes. Also, the total weight of $\\mathbf{1}_{A}$ coincides with the cardinality of the set $A$, which will be denoted $|A|$.\n\nUsing the language of mask polynomials one may reformulate the tiling property in $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ in terms of cyclotomic polynomials. Due to translation invariance we may assume $0 \\in A \\cap B$.

Let $A$ be a finite set of integers and\n\n$$\nS_{A}:=\\left\\{p^{\\alpha}: p^{\\alpha} \\text { is a prime power and } \\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X) \\mid A(X)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nConsider the following two conditions\n(T1) $A(1)=\\prod_{s \\in S_{A}} \\Phi_{s}(1)$\n(T2) if $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k} \\in S_{A}$ are powers of different primes, then $\\Phi_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}}(X) \\mid A(X)$.\nThen\n\n- If $A$ satisfies both (T1) and (T2) then $A$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- If $A$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}$ then it must satisfy (T1).\n\n- If $A$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}$, and $|A|$ has at most two prime factors, then it satisfies (T2).\n\nThe question whether conditions (T1) and (T2) characterize all sets which tile the integers, without any restriction on the prime factorization of the cardinality of a tile, has been referred to in the literature as the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture (the first instance it was referred to as an explicit conjecture is [6]). This conjecture is considered to be the main open question in the topic of integer tilings. Until recent years, the conjecture has been verified only in some special cases $[2,6,12,16,18]$. More recently there has been noticeable progress. In $[8,9]$ it has been confirmed for all tilings of period $M=\\left(p_{1} p_{2} p_{3}\\right)^{2}$, where $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ are distinct primes. Subsequently, in [10] it has been confirmed for tilings of period $M$ having arbitrarily many prime factors with some specified restrictions on their sizes and powers.\n\nConditions (T1) and (T2) can also be naturally formulated for arbitrary nonnegative functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. For the mask polynomial $F(X)$ of $f$, for any $m \\mid M$ we say that $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid F(X)$ if $F\\left(\\eta^{\\xi}\\right)=0$ for all $\\xi \\in R_{M / m}$. Then, letting $S_{F}$ denote the set of prime-powers $p^{\\alpha} \\mid M$ such that $\\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X) \\mid F(X)$, we say that $F$ satisfies condition (T1) if $F(1)=\\prod_{s \\in S_{F}} \\Phi_{s}(1)$, and $F$ satisfies condition (T2) if $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k} \\in S_{F}$ being powers of different primes implies that $\\Phi_{s_{1} \\ldots s_{k}}(X) \\mid F(X)$.\n\nGoing back to condition (1.4), given a collection $H=\\left\\{m_{1}, m_{2}, \\ldots, m_{s}\\right\\}$ of divisors of $M$, the main difficulty is to decide whether there exists a set $A$ such that the cyclotomic divisors of $A(X)$ are exactly $\\Phi_{m_{j}}(1 \\leq j \\leq s)$, and $A$ satisfies condition (T1). It is not hard to see that this question is equivalent to solving an integer programming (IP) problem (we will discuss this fact in Section 2 below). It is therefore natural to consider a linear programming relaxation of the tiling criteria, to which we turn next.\n1.2. Weak-tiling and pd-tiling. The notion of weak tiling was introduced in [11] as a key concept in proving Fuglede's conjecture for convex bodies. In the context of finite cyclic groups, it is a relaxation of proper tilings in the following way: a set $A$ is said to tile $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ weakly if there exists a nonnegative function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$such that $f(0)=1$ and $\\mathbf{1}_{A} * f=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}$. Clearly, when $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is a tiling, one can choose $f=\\mathbf{1}_{B}$ (where we assumed, without loss of generality, that $0 \\in B$ ).\n\nWeak tiling is a very natural concept. However, in order to be able to invoke tools from linear programming, the following slightly modified definition was introduced in [3].\nDefinition 1.3. A set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ weakly, if there exists a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying\n(i) $f(0)=1$,\n(ii) $f \\geq 0$,\n(iii) $\\hat{f} \\geq 0$\nand such that\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}_{A} * f=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}\n$$\n\nTo abbreviate the terminology, we will just say that $A$ pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, dropping the term \"weakly\". Any function $f$ with the properties above will be called a pd-tiling complement of $A$.\n\nIn this terminology, \"pd\" stands for positive definite. As observed in [3] if $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, then $A$ pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with the function $\\frac{1}{|B|} \\mathbf{1}_{B} * \\mathbf{1}_{-B}$. In connection with Fuglede's conjecture we remark that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is spectral then $A$ also pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ (cf. [3]).\n\nWe also note that for any pd-tiling, equation (1.8) is equivalent to the analogue of (1.5):\n\n$$\n|A||F|=M, \\text { and for all } 0 \\neq \\xi \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\text { we have } \\check{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}(\\xi)=0 \\text { or } \\check{f}(\\xi)=0\n$$\n\nwhere $|F|$ denotes the total weight of $f$, as defined in (1.2).\nFurthermore, due to the fact that the support of $\\check{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}$ is a union of step classes $R_{m}$, the function $\\check{f}$ must vanish on those classes, i.e. $F(X)$ must be divisible by the corresponding cyclotomic polynomials $\\Phi_{M / m}(X)$.\n\nFormally speaking, the concept of pd-tiling is a relaxation of proper tiling. It is therefore natural to ask the following questions.\n\nProblem 1.1. Is it true that whenever $A$ pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, then $A$ also tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ properly?\nProblem 1.2. Is the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture true for all pd-tilings, i.e. is it true that for any set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ that pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, and any a pd-tiling complement $f$ of $A$, both $A$ and $F$ satisfy conditions (T1) and (T2)?\n\nWhile these questions remain open in full generality, in this paper we give a partial answer to Problem 1.1 (see Proposition 4.1 below), and solve a functional variant of Problem 1.2.\n1.3. Functional pd-tiling. As in [3], it is natural to go one step further with the relaxation of the tiling conditions.\n\nDefinition 1.4. Let $f, g: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be functions satisfying conditions (i)-(iii) of Definition 1.3. We say that the pair $(f, g)$ is a functional pd-tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ if\n\n$$\nf * g=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}\n$$\n\nClearly, if $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is a tiling, then the functions $h_{A}^{(1)}=\\frac{1}{|A|} \\mathbf{1}_{A} * \\mathbf{1}_{-A}$ and $h_{B}^{(1)}=$ $\\frac{1}{|B|} \\mathbf{1}_{B} * \\mathbf{1}_{-B}$ form a functional pd-tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, and the cyclotomic divisors of $H_{A}^{(1)}(X)=$ $\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h_{A}^{(1)}(z) X^{z}$ and $H_{B}^{(1)}(X)=\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h_{B}^{(1)}(z) X^{z}$ are the same as those of $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, respectively. As such, condition (T1) holds for both $H_{A}^{(1)}$ and $H_{B}^{(1)}$.\n\nIn the context of the functional pd-tiling $\\left(h_{A}^{(1)}, h_{B}^{(1)}\\right)$ above, it is natural to carry out an averaging procedure which, as we shall see, leads to step functions $h_{A}, h_{B}$ while not altering the cyclotomic divisors of the corresponding mask polynomials. This enables us to study the Coven-Meyerowitz conditions in the class of step functions.\n\nGiven the functions $h_{A}^{(1)}, h_{B}^{(1)}$ above, and an element $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ such that $(r, M)=1$, we define $h_{A}^{(r)}(z)=h_{A}^{(1)}(r z)$ and\n\n$$\nh_{A}(z)=\\frac{1}{\\phi(M)} \\sum_{r \\in R_{1}} h_{A}^{(r)}(z)\n$$\n\nand similarly for $h_{B}$. Here $\\phi$ denotes Euler's totient function.\nFor any $z, y$ in the same step class $R_{d}$ there exists an $r \\in R_{1}$, such that $r z \\equiv y(\\bmod M)$, therefore $h_{A}(z)=h_{A}(y)$, and hence the functions $h_{A}$ and $h_{B}$ are constant over step classes, i.e. they are step functions, $h_{A}, h_{B} \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$. It is also well known that the Fourier transform of a step function is also a step function, and we cite the formula for the Fourier transform of the indicator function of a single step class $R_{m}$ as follows:\nLemma 1.5 ( [7], Lemma 4.8). Let $m \\mid M$, then\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbf{1}_{R_{m}}}(\\xi)=\\sum_{d|(M / m, \\xi)} \\mu\\left(\\frac{M}{m d}\\right) d\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the M\u00f6bius function.\nThe functions $h_{A}, h_{B}$ and their Fourier transforms $\\hat{h}_{A}, \\hat{h}_{B}$ are all nonnegative, and their positive values are all bounded away from zero. Indeed, $h_{A}=\\frac{1}{|A| \\phi(M)} \\sum_{r \\in R_{1}} 1_{r A} * 1_{-r A}$, and the sum is a nonnegative, integer-valued function, therefore the non-zero values of $h_{A}$ satisfy\n\n$$\nh_{A}(z) \\geq \\frac{1}{|A| \\phi(M)} \\geq \\frac{1}{M \\phi(M)}=: \\delta_{M}, \\quad\\left(\\text { if } h_{A}(z) \\neq 0\\right)\n$$\n\nand the same argument holds for $h_{B}$. Interestingly, the same lower bound also holds for $\\hat{h}_{A}$ and $\\hat{h}_{B}$ for the following reason:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{h}_{A}(\\xi)=\\frac{1}{|A| \\phi(M)}\\left(\\sum_{r \\in R_{1}} 1_{r A} * 1_{-r A}\\right)^{\\Lambda}(\\xi) \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere the expression is nonnegative because the Fourier transform of each term inside the bracket is $\\left|\\hat{1}_{r A}\\right|^{2}(\\xi) \\geq 0$. Also, the sum in the bracket is integer-valued, and hence its Fourier transform is also integer valued by Lemma 1.5 above. Therefore, we conclude that all nonzero values of $\\widehat{h}_{A}$ satisfy\n\n$$\n\\widehat{h}_{A}(\\xi) \\geq \\frac{1}{|A| \\phi(M)} \\geq \\frac{1}{M \\phi(M)}, \\quad\\left(\\text { if } \\widehat{h}_{A}(\\xi) \\neq 0\\right)\n$$\n\nand the same argument holds for $\\widehat{h}_{B}$.\nThe advantage of the averaging procedure above is that the class of step functions is easier to study with tools from linear programming (LP). As such, we will be able to formulate some non-trivial LP conditions for any functional pd-tilings and also for proper tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ (see Section 2). The downside of averaging, however, is that when any nonnegative step function $f$ is given, it is a often a nontrivial task to determine whether there exists a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ such that $f=h_{A}$.\n\nConsider now the mask polynomials $H_{A}$ and $H_{B}$ corresponding to $h_{A}, h_{B}$, as defined in equation (1.1). We claim that the averaging process preserves cyclotomic divisibility. First, due to (1.6), for every $m \\mid M$ and every $(r, M)=1$ we have that $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid H_{A}^{(r)}(X)$ if and only if $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid H_{A}^{(1)}(X)$. As the values $H_{A}^{(r)}\\left(\\eta^{\\xi}\\right)=\\hat{h}_{A}(\\xi)$ are all nonnegative by (1.13), we conclude\n\nthat $H_{A}\\left(\\eta^{\\xi}\\right)=0$ if and only if $H_{A}^{(r)}\\left(\\eta^{\\xi}\\right)=0$ for all $r$. That is, $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid H_{A}(X)$ if and only if $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid H_{A}^{(r)}(X)$ for all $r$, which happens if and only if $\\Phi_{m}(X) \\mid H_{A}^{(1)}(X)$. Therefore, the cyclotomic divisors of $H_{A}(X)$ and $H_{B}(X)$ are the same as those of $A(X)$ and $B(X)$. In particular, condition (T1) of Coven-Meyerowitz is satisfied for both $H_{A}$ and $H_{B}$.\n\nIt is therefore natural to ask the following question.\nProblem 1.3. Let $(f, g)$ be a functional pd-tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ as in Definition 1.4. Assume that both $f$ and $g$ are step functions, and the corresponding mask polynomials $F$ and $G$ both satisfy condition (T1). Do $F$ and $G$ necessarily satisfy condition (T2)?\n\nA positive answer to this question would mean that the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture holds in this much more general setting. However, the main result of this paper is to answer this question in the negative.\n\nTheorem 1.6. Let $p, q$ be prime numbers such that $p<q<p^{2}$, and set $M=p^{4} q^{2}$. Then there exists a functional pd-tiling $(f, g)$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ such that both $f$ and $g$ are step functions (as in Definition 1.1) and the corresponding polynomials $F, G$ satisfy condition (T1), but neither of them satisfies condition (T2).\n\nTheorem 1.2 implies that the functional pd-tilings of Theorem 1.6 cannot originate from proper tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, i.e. there do not exist sets $A, B \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ such that $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, and $f=h_{A}, g=h_{B}$. However, in principle, it could be possible that one of the functions originates from a set, i.e. there exists a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ such that $f=h_{A}$, but no corresponding set $B$ exists for which $g=h_{B}$ (or vice versa, $g$ originates from a set, but $f$ does not).\n\nA natural follow-up question is whether the examples $f * g=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}$ can be used in the future to construct proper counterexamples $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M_{1}}$ to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture for some other value $M_{1}$. For example, one could hope to combine the functional pd-tilings of Theorem 1.6 for $M=p^{4} q^{2}$ and $M^{\\prime}=r^{4} s^{2}$, and try to construct a proper tiling counterexample in the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{M_{1}}=\\mathbb{Z}_{M M^{\\prime}}$.\n\nNote also, that by extending $f$ and $g$ periodically in an appropriate way, one may obtain such examples of functional pd-tilings for any $M^{\\prime}$ divisible by $M$. We also remark here that the examples in Theorem 1.6 are far from being unique, e.g. other examples exist for $M=(p q r)^{2}$ (see Section 5 for a detailed account of the case where $p=3, q=5, r=7$ ). On the other hand, it is not hard to prove that there are no examples in the spirit of Theorem 1.6 for $M=p q$, and it also appears (by computer experiment) that there are no such examples for $M=p^{\\alpha} q^{\\beta}$ where $\\beta=1, \\alpha \\leq 6$, or $\\beta=2, \\alpha \\leq 3$.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we explain the theoretical background of the linear programming formulation of the problem. This formulation gives a very convenient and efficient way to tackle the problem of functional tilings, while also providing non-trivial conditions for proper tilings. In Section 3 we introduce some further auxiliary tools, similar to those developed in [7]. Finally, in Section 4 we present a detailed account of the functional pd-tilings violating the (T2) condition for $M=p^{4} q^{2}$, thus settling Problem 1.3. We also give a minor positive result concerning Problem 1.1.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. LINEAR PROGRAMMING CONSTRAINTS \n\nThe aim of this section is to study tilings and functional pd-tilings with tools from linear programming. In particular, we will see that questions of tiling are inherently related to finding maximal cliques in Cayley graphs, and Delsarte's linear programming bound is a natural tool to give upper bounds for the size of such cliques. As such, we can expect non-trivial tiling conditions to arise from linear programming methods.\n\nGiven a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, recall [7] that the divisor set of $A$ is defined as $\\operatorname{Div}(A)=\\left\\{\\left(a-a^{\\prime}, M\\right)\\right.$ : $\\left.a, a^{\\prime} \\in A\\right\\}$. We will use the notation $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)=\\cup_{d \\in \\operatorname{Div}(A)} R_{d}$, i.e. $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)$ is the union of step classes corresponding to the divisors of $M$ appearing in $\\operatorname{Div}(A)$. We will refer to such step classes $R_{d}(d \\in \\operatorname{Div}(A))$ as divisor classes corresponding to $A$. The following theorem of Sands is fundamental in the study of tilings of cyclic groups.\nTheorem 2.1 ( [15]). For sets $A, B \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}, A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is a tiling if and only if $|A||B|=M$ and $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A) \\cap \\operatorname{Div}^{*}(B)=\\{0\\}$.\n\nIt is easy to see that this theorem translates questions of tiling into questions about maximal cliques in Cayley graphs defined on $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$. Namely, for a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, define the Cayley graph $\\Gamma_{A}$ as follows: the vertices of $\\Gamma_{A}$ are the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, i.e. $\\{0,1, \\ldots, M-1\\}$, and two distinct vertices $x, y$ are connected if and only if $x-y \\in \\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)$. By Theorem 2.1 we conclude that $A$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ if and only if $|A|$ divides $M$ and there exists an independent set $B$ in the graph $\\Gamma_{A}$ (i.e. a clique $B$ in the complement graph) of size $M /|A|$.\n\nAs the graph $\\Gamma_{A}$ depends only on $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)$, it is natural to introduce the following general definition.\n\nDefinition 2.2. Given $M$, and a collection of step classes $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}$ with $0 \\in H$, we use the notation $H^{\\prime}=\\left(\\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\backslash H\\right) \\cup\\{0\\}$ to denote the standard complement of $H$ (the word \"standard\" refers to the fact that 0 appears in both $H$ and $H^{\\prime}$ ). We define the graph $\\Gamma_{H}$ such that the vertices are the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, i.e. $\\{0,1, \\ldots, M-1\\}$, and two distinct vertices $x, y$ are connected if and only if $x-y \\in H$. Also, we let $\\omega(H)$ denote the maximal cardinality of a clique in the graph $\\Gamma_{H}$.\n\nWith this terminology at hand, we can formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for tilings with reference only to the sets $H$ and $H^{\\prime}$. It is easy to see that $\\omega(H) \\omega\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq M$ for any $H$ and, as a direct corollary of Theorem 2.1, the case of equality is equivalent to tiling.\nProposition 2.3. Let $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$ be given. There exists a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A) \\subset H$ and $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(B) \\subset H^{\\prime}$ if and only if $\\omega(H) \\omega\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=M$.\n\nThis means that given $M$ and $H$ we can, in principle, decide whether there exists a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A) \\subset H$ and $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(B) \\subset H^{\\prime}$. In practice, however, determining the size of maximal cliques is an NP-hard problem. Of course, an upper bound on the clique number can be given by linear programming (there are several formulations of this bound - we prefer to call it the Delsarte LP bound, cf [13]). We recall the following terminology from $[13]$.\n\nDefinition 2.4. For a collection of step classes $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$, and any positive number $\\delta>0$, the Delsarte parameters corresponding to $H$ and $\\delta$ are defined as follows:\n\n$D^{+}(H)=\\max \\left\\{\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h(z): h \\in \\mathcal{A}(M), h(0)=1, \\hat{h} \\geq\\left.0, h\\right|_{H} \\geq\\left.0, h\\right|_{H^{c}}=0\\right\\}$,\n$D^{-}(H)=\\max \\left\\{\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h(z):\\left.h \\in \\mathcal{A}(M), h(0)=1, \\hat{h} \\geq\\left.0, h\\right|_{H^{c}} \\leq 0\\right\\}\\right.$,\n$D^{\\delta+}(H)=\\max \\left\\{\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h(z):\\left.h \\in \\mathcal{A}(M), h(0)=1, \\hat{h} \\geq\\left.0, h\\right|_{H} \\geq \\delta, h\\right|_{H^{c}}=0\\right\\}$,\nand their reciprocals,\n$\\lambda^{+}(H)=1 / D^{+}(H), \\lambda^{-}(H)=1 / D^{-}(H), \\lambda^{\\delta+}(H)=1 / D^{\\delta+}(H)$.\nWe remark here that in [13] the parameters $\\lambda^{+}, \\lambda^{-}$were defined, but it is slightly more convenient for us here to work with their reciprocals, $D^{+}$and $D^{-}$.\n\nIn order to gain some intuition of the concepts $D^{+}, D^{-}$and $D^{\\delta+}$, it is easiest to think of the continuous analogue of these quantities. If $B_{1}$ is the unit ball in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (take $d=8$ for concreteness), then $D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ is the maximal integral of a nonnegative, positive definite function supported on $B_{1}$. It is known [5], that the unique extremizer in this case is $\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Vol}\\left(B_{1 / 2}\\right)} 1_{B_{1 / 2}} * 1_{B_{1 / 2}}$, and $D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)=\\operatorname{Vol}\\left(B_{1 / 2}\\right)$. For $D^{\\delta+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ we insist that the function is at least $\\delta$ over the entire ball. As such, $D^{\\delta+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ is strictly less than $D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, because the unique extremizer for $D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ above is zero on the boundary. On the contrary, for $D^{-}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ we allow the function to take any non-positive values outside the ball, which results in greater freedom. The quantity $D^{-}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ gives a strong upper bound the density of sphere packings (in fact, the exact bound in dimension 8, c.f. [19]), which is better than the volume bound given by $D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$. As such, for the ball $B_{1}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{8}$ we have $D^{\\delta+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)<D^{+}\\left(B_{1}\\right)<D^{-}\\left(B_{1}\\right)$ with strict inequalities at both places. Unfortunately, the situation is not so clear in the discrete setting of $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$. It is an interesting project to give necessary (or sufficient) conditions for the quantities $D^{\\delta+}(H), D^{+}(H), D^{-}(H)$ to coincide or differ.\n\nThere is an obvious hierarchy among the numbers $D^{\\delta+}(H), D^{+}(H), D^{-}(H)$, and two of them give an upper bound on the clique number of $H$.\n\nProposition 2.5. For any $H$ and any $\\delta>0$, we have $D^{\\delta+}(H) \\leq D^{+}(H) \\leq D^{-}(H)$, and $\\omega(H) \\leq D^{+}(H)$.\n\nProof. The first inequalities are obvious because of the hierarchy of the constraints in the linear programs defining them. The second inequality follows from the fact that for any clique $A$ in $\\Gamma_{H}$ the function $h_{A}$ defined in (1.11) is an admissible function in the definition of $D^{+}(H)$, and $\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} h_{A}(z)=|A|$. (The function $h_{A}$ is indeed admissible, as it is a nonnegative, positive definite step function, supported on $\\cup_{r \\in R_{1}} r(A-A) \\subset H$, and $h_{A}(0)=1$.)\n\nThere is an important duality between these Delsarte parameters.\nProposition 2.6 ( [13]). For any $H$ we have $D^{+}(H) D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=M$.\nProof. This is the content of Theorem 4.2 in [13].\nWe remark here that the main use of the Delsarte parameters is to give an upper bound on the clique numbers of Cayley graphs via this duality. Indeed, $\\omega(H) \\leq D^{+}(H)=\\frac{M}{D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)} \\leq$ $\\frac{M}{h(0)}$ for any admissible function $h$ in the definition of $D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, any admissible function leads to an upper bound on $\\omega(H)$.\n\nNext, we give a connection of these parameters to tilings.\nProposition 2.7. Let $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$ be given. If there exists a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A) \\subset H$ and $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(B) \\subset H^{\\prime}$, then $|A|=\\omega(H)=D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)$ and $|B|=$ $\\omega\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Due to the assumed tiling, and Propositions 2.5 and 2.6, we have $|A| \\leq \\omega(H) \\leq$ $D^{+}(H) \\leq D^{-}(H)=\\frac{M}{D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{M}{\\omega\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{M}{|B|}=|A|$. Therefore, equality must hold everywhere.\n\nThe same argument holds for $H^{\\prime}$.\nThere are two important points here: first, $D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)$ is a non-trivial linear programming constraint on $H$ and, second, the equalities $|A|=D^{+}(H),|B|=D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$ determine the only possible sizes of $A$ and $B$ for a given $H$.\n\nNotice that we have assumed $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A) \\subset H$. If, instead, we require $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)=H$, we obtain the following additional condition on $H$.\nProposition 2.8. Let $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$ be given, and let $\\delta=\\frac{1}{M \\phi(M)}$. If there exists a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)=H$, then $|A|=\\omega(H)=D^{\\delta+}(H)=D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)$, and $|B|=\\omega\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nProof. Due to the previous proposition, we only need to prove $|A|=D^{\\delta+}(H)$.\nAs $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A)=H$, the function $h_{A}$ defined in (1.11) is an admissible function in the class of $D^{\\delta+}(H)$. As such, $|A| \\leq D^{\\delta+}(H) \\leq D^{+}(H)=|A|$, where the last equality follows from the previous proposition.\n\nSo far, we have not considered the Coven-Meyerowitz conditions (T1) and (T2), due to the fact that these conditions are associated with the cyclotomic factors of $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, and not the divisor classes $\\operatorname{Div}^{*}(A), \\operatorname{Div}^{*}(B)$. We will now consider the Fourier transforms $\\hat{h}_{A}$ and $\\hat{h}_{B}$, and make use of condition (T1).\n\nRecall that for a divisor $d \\mid M$ we have $\\Phi_{d}(X) \\mid A(X)$ if and only if $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}(M / d)=0$, which happens if and only if $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}$ vanishes on the class $R_{M / d}$.\n\nAssume that $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is a tiling. As explained in the introduction, for any $d \\mid M(d \\neq 1)$ we have $\\Phi_{d}(X) \\mid A(X)$ or $\\Phi_{d}(X) \\mid B(X)$, or possibly both. However, when $d$ is a prime-power, condition (T1) ensures that exactly one of the two divisibilities holds. That is, for any $p^{\\alpha} \\mid M$ we have either $\\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X) \\mid A(X)$ or $\\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X) \\mid B(X)$, but not both. Also, condition (T1) makes a connection between the cardinalities of $A$ and $B$, and the cyclotomic divisors $\\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X)$. This motivates the following definition.\n\nDefinition 2.9. Let $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$ be given. Let $S_{H}$ denote the set of prime-powers $p^{\\alpha}$ such that $M / p^{\\alpha}$ is among the indices $m_{i}$. Let $k_{H}=\\prod_{p^{\\alpha} \\in S_{H}} \\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(1)$.\n\nFor any $H$ and its standard complement $H^{\\prime}$, and any prime power $p^{\\alpha} \\mid M$, the class $R_{M / p^{\\alpha}}$ appears either in $H$ or in $H^{\\prime}$ (but not both). Also, $\\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(1)=p$. Therefore we have\n\n$$\nk_{H} k_{H^{\\prime}}=M\n$$\n\nThe question arises: how can we recognize if $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$, is the support of the Fourier transform of $\\mathbf{1}_{A}$ for a set $A$ appearing in a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$. We have the following important necessary conditions.\nProposition 2.10. Let $\\delta=\\frac{1}{M^{2} \\phi(M)}>0$, and let $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}, 0 \\in H$ be given. If there exists a tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ with $H=\\operatorname{supp}\\left|\\check{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}\\right|^{2}$, then $D^{\\delta+}(H)=D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)=k_{H}=$ $|B|$, and $D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=k_{H^{\\prime}}=|A|$.\n\nProof. The proof exploits the fact that given any tiling $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, the functions $h_{A}, h_{B}$ (as defined in (1.11)) and $\\check{h}_{A}, \\check{h}_{B}$ are all extremal in their respective $D^{+}$-classes. We can make this claim rigorous as follows.\n\nIt is enough to prove\n\n$$\nD^{\\delta+}(H)=D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)=k_{H}=|B|\n$$\n\nbecause the second chain of equalities will be implied by the following duality relations (cf. Proposition 2.6 and equation (2.1)):\n\n$$\nD^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{M}{D^{-}(H)}, D^{-}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{M}{D^{+}(H)}, k_{H^{\\prime}}=\\frac{M}{k_{H}},|A|=\\frac{M}{|B|}\n$$\n\nand all quantities are equal to the right hand side by (2.2), so the left hand sides must also be equal.\n\nTo prove (2.2), notice first the following equivalent statements for any prime power $p^{\\alpha} \\mid M$ : $p^{\\alpha} \\in S_{A} \\Leftrightarrow \\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(X) \\mid A(X) \\Leftrightarrow \\check{1}_{A}$ vanishes on $R_{M / p^{\\alpha}} \\Leftrightarrow R_{M / p^{\\alpha}} \\subset H^{\\prime} \\Leftrightarrow p^{\\alpha} \\in S_{H^{\\prime}}$. The first equivalence is just the definition of $S_{A}$, the second follows form (1.7), the third follows from the assumption that the support of $\\check{1}_{A}$ is exactly $H$, while the last is just the definition of $S_{H^{\\prime}}$. Hence, invoking the (T1) tiling condition of Coven-Meyerowitz in Theorem 1.2, we obtain $|A|=\\prod_{p^{\\alpha} \\in S_{A}} \\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(1)=\\prod_{p^{\\alpha} \\in S_{H^{\\prime}}} \\Phi_{p^{\\alpha}}(1)=k_{H^{\\prime}}$. Furthermore, by $A \\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ we have $|A||B|=M$, and by equation (2.1) we have $k_{H} k_{H^{\\prime}}=M$, which implies $|B|=k_{H}$.\n\nFurthermore, let $h_{A}$ be as in equation (1.11), and $u=\\frac{1}{|\\bar{A}|} \\check{h}_{A}$. Then $\\operatorname{supp} u=H$ by assumption, $u(0)=1, \\check{u} \\geq 0$, and due to (1.14) we have $u(z) \\geq \\frac{1}{|\\bar{A}|^{2} \\phi(M)} \\geq \\delta$ for all $z \\in H$. This shows that $u$ is an admissible function in the class $D^{\\delta+}(H)$. As $\\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} u(z)=\\check{u}(0)=$ $\\frac{M}{|\\bar{A}|} h_{A}(0)=|B|$, we conclude $|B| \\leq D^{\\delta+}(H)$.\n\nSimilarly, for $v=\\frac{1}{|B|} \\check{h}_{B}$ we have that $\\operatorname{supp} v \\subset H^{\\prime}$ (by the tiling condition the supports must be essentially disjoint), $v(0)=1, \\check{v} \\geq 0, \\sum_{z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} v(z)=|A|$. This shows that $|A| \\leq$ $D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, putting everything together, we have $k_{H}=|B| \\leq D^{\\delta+}(H) \\leq D^{+}(H) \\leq D^{-}(H)=$ $\\frac{M}{D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)} \\leq \\frac{M}{|\\bar{A}|}=|B|$, and hence equality must hold everywhere.\n\nThe chain of equalities $D^{\\delta+}(H)=D^{+}(H)=D^{-}(H)=k_{H}$ puts severe restrictions on $H$. While these restrictions fall short of proving the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture, they rule out the vast majority of sets $H=\\cup_{i=1}^{r} R_{m_{i}}$ as candidates for the support of the Fourier transform\n\nof a tile in $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$. As an indication, in Section 5 we will provide some statistics of a computer experiment carried out for a specific value of $M$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. CYCLOTOMIC DIVISIONILITY FOR AVERAGED FUNCTIONS \n\nIn connection to cyclotomic divisibility, the class of step functions enjoys another useful property. Strictly speaking, the results of this section are not needed to verify the forthcoming examples in Section 4. However, we include them for two reasons. One is that Proposition 3.5 below gives a potentially useful tool in studying cyclotomic divisibility of step functions in the future. The second is that we have actually used these conditions in producing the examples presented in Section 4.\n\nIn service of our discussion we borrow some notation from [7] for (classic) $M$-cuboids.\nDefinition 3.1. Let $M=\\prod_{i=1}^{K} p_{i}^{n_{i}}$, where $p_{i}$ are distinct primes and $n_{i} \\geq 1$ are integers. Let $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n- An M-cuboid is a weighted set corresponding to the mask polynomial of the form\n\n$$\n\\Delta(X)=X^{c} \\prod_{i=1}^{K}\\left(1-X^{d_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}, d_{i}=\\rho_{i} M / p_{i}$ with $\\rho_{i} \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, p_{i}-1\\right\\}$ for all $i$.\n\n- The associated $\\Delta$-evaluation of $f$ is\n\n$$\nF[\\Delta]=\\sum_{\\vec{\\epsilon} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{K}}(-1)^{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\epsilon_{j}} f\\left(x_{\\epsilon}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{\\epsilon}=c+\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\epsilon_{j} d_{j}(\\bmod M)$ are the vertices of $\\Delta$.\nThere is a well-known cyclotomic divisibility test given in terms of cuboids, which was first observed by Steinberger [17], and later reestablished in [4, 7].\nProposition 3.2. Let $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) $\\Phi_{M}(X) \\mid F(X)$,\n(ii) For all $M$-cuboids $\\Delta$, we have $F[\\Delta]=0$.\n\nGiven a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, cyclotomic divisibility of $f$ by $\\Phi_{N}$ with $N \\mid M$ is determined by Proposition 3.2 with $M$ and $f$ replaced by $N$ and $f_{N}$ respectively, where $f_{N}$ is the function defined on $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$\n\n$$\nf_{N}(z)=\\sum_{N \\mid z-y} f(y)\n$$\n\nWe will show that when $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$ is a step function, Proposition 3.2 considerably simplifies. We first need an auxiliary result.\nLemma 3.3. Let $\\Delta$ be an $M$-cuboid and $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$. Suppose that there exists $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$ and $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-1$ such that for all vertices $x_{\\epsilon}$ of $\\Delta$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{\\epsilon}, p_{i}^{n_{i}}\\right)=p_{i}^{\\beta}\n$$\n\nThen for any pair of vertices $x_{\\epsilon}, x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}}$ of $\\Delta$ with\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{\\epsilon}-x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}}, M\\right)=M / p_{i}\n$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$\nf\\left(x_{\\epsilon}\\right)=f\\left(x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, if (3.4) holds with $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-2$ for one single vertex of $\\Delta$, then it holds for all the vertices with the same exponent $\\beta$, and hence (3.6) holds for any pair of vertices of $\\Delta$ satisfying (3.5).\n\nProof. Let $m \\mid M$, and suppose that $x_{\\epsilon} \\in R_{m}$. As $f$ is a step function, it is enough to show that $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}} \\in R_{m}$.\n\nThe exponent of $p_{i}$ in $m$ is $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-1$ by (3.4). If $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-2$, then by (3.5) we have $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}} \\equiv x_{\\epsilon}-c p_{1}^{n_{1}} \\ldots p_{i}^{n_{i}-1} \\ldots p_{K}^{n_{K}}(\\bmod M)$, with some $1 \\leq c \\leq p_{i}-1$. Hence we obtain $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}} \\in R_{m}$, because the exponents of all the primes in $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}}$ remain the same as in $x_{\\epsilon}$. Assume now that $\\beta=n_{i}-1$. In $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}}$ the exponents of primes different from $p_{i}$ still remain the same as in $x_{\\epsilon}$, and that of $p_{i}$ either remains $n_{i}-1$ or becomes $n_{i}$. However, the latter is excluded by assumption (3.4). Again, we conclude $x_{\\epsilon^{\\prime}} \\in R_{m}$.\n\nFor the last sentence of the proposition, notice that the difference between any two vertices of an $M$-cuboid is divisible by $p_{1}^{n_{1}-1} \\ldots p_{K}^{n_{K}-1}$. Therefore, if the exponent of $p_{i}$ in $x_{\\epsilon}$ is $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-2$, then it is the same for all the other the vertices.\n\nCorollary 3.4. Let $\\Delta$ be an $M$-cuboid and $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$. Suppose that there exists $i \\in$ $\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$, and $\\beta \\leq n_{i}-1$ such that (3.4) holds for all vertices $x_{\\epsilon}$ of $\\Delta$. Then $F[\\Delta]=0$.\n\nProof. Write $\\Delta$ as a disjoint union of its two facets $\\Delta_{i} \\cup \\Delta_{i}^{\\prime}$, with respect to $p_{i}$ : explicitly, each facet is defined as the maximal subset of vertices such that the pairwise difference between any two elements is divisible by $p_{i}^{n_{i}}$. The vertices of the facets $\\Delta_{i}$ and $\\Delta_{i}^{\\prime}$ appear with opposite signs in the evaluation (3.2). Also, for every element $v$ of $\\Delta_{i}$ there exists a unique element $v^{\\prime}$ of $\\Delta_{i}^{\\prime}$ such that $\\left(v-v^{\\prime}, M\\right)=M / p_{i}$. By Lemma $3.3 f(v)=f\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)$ which implies $F[\\Delta]=0$.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the strengthening of Proposition 3.2 for step functions.\nProposition 3.5. Let $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$. The following are equivalent:\n(I) $\\Phi_{M}(X) \\mid F(X)$,\n(II) $F[\\Delta]=0$ for all $M$-cuboids $\\Delta$ with a vertex at 0 ,\n(III) $F[\\Delta]=0$ for one $M$-cuboid $\\Delta$ with a vertex at 0 .\n\nProof. By Proposition 3.2 (I) implies (II). Clearly (II) implies (III).\nWe prove (II) implies (I). By Proposition 3.2 we need to prove $F[\\Delta]=0$ for all $M$-cuboids $\\Delta$. By Corollary 3.4 it is enough to consider $M$-cuboids which violate (3.4) for all $i$. Fix an index $i$. By the last part of Lemma 3.3, the condition (3.4) can only be violated if at some vertices of the cuboid the exponent of $p_{i}$ is equal to $n_{i}-1$, while at other vertices it is equal to $n_{i}$.\n\nThat is, for every $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$ there exists a vertex $x_{i}$ of $\\Delta$ satisfying\n\n$$\np_{i}^{n_{i}} \\mid x_{i}\n$$\n\nNow, for every index $i$, partition $\\Delta$ into two facets, with respect to $p_{i}, \\Delta=\\Delta_{i} \\cup \\Delta_{i}^{\\prime}$ such that for every $i=1, \\ldots, K x_{i} \\in \\Delta_{i}$. By definition $p_{i}^{n_{i}} \\mid x-x_{i}$ for all vertices $x$ of $\\Delta_{i}$, and hence by (3.7) we have\n\n$$\np_{i}^{n_{i}} \\mid x\n$$\n\nLet $v=\\cap_{i=1}^{K} \\Delta_{i}$ (the intersection is non-empty, as $K$ facets of different orientation of $\\Delta$ always intersect at exactly one point - just like $K$ axis-parallel hyperplanes intersect in one point in $\\mathbb{R}^{K}$ ). Clearly, $p_{i}^{n_{i}} \\mid v$ for all $i$, and this is equivalent to $v=0$. By (II) we have $F[\\Delta]=0$.\n\nIn order to prove (III) implies (II) we take two $M$-cuboids $\\Delta, \\Delta^{\\prime}$ so that 0 is a joint vertex of both. Let $v=\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\epsilon_{j} d_{j}$ be a vertex of $\\Delta$ and $v^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j=1}^{K} \\epsilon_{j} d_{j}^{\\prime}$ the corresponding vertex of $\\Delta^{\\prime}$, with the same coefficients $\\epsilon_{j}$. As such, the vertices $v$ and $v^{\\prime}$ have the same sign in the evaluation (3.2) corresponding to $\\Delta$ and $\\Delta^{\\prime}$, respectively. Also, it is clear that $(v, M)=\\left(v^{\\prime}, M\\right)$, and hence $v$ and $v^{\\prime}$ fall into the same step class, implying $f(v)=f\\left(v^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, the terms in the evaluation (3.2) for $\\Delta$ are exactly the same as those for $\\Delta^{\\prime}$, and hence we have $F[\\Delta]=0$ if and only if $F\\left[\\Delta^{\\prime}\\right]=0$.\n\nIn practical terms, when $M=p^{n} q^{m}, p$ and $q$ are primes, and $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, Proposition 3.5 implies that for any $f \\in \\mathcal{A}(M)$ and any $N \\mid M$ divisible by $p q$\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{N}(X) \\mid F(X) \\text { if and only if } f_{N}(0)-f_{N}(N / p)-f_{N}(N / q)+f_{N}(N / p q)=0\n$$\n\nwhere $f_{N}$ is defined in (3.3).

Functional pd-Tilings violating the (T2) condition \n\nIn this final section we first present a minor positive result concerning Problem 1.1, and then provide a family of functional pd-tilings which violate the (T2) condition of CovenMeyerowitz for $M=p^{4} q^{2}$.\n\nProposition 4.1. Let $M$ be a prime-power, $M=p^{\\alpha}$. In this case, any set $A$ which pd-tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, also tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ properly.\n\nProof. As the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture is true for $M=p^{\\alpha}$, it is enough to prove conditions (T1) and (T2) for $A$, and as (T2) is vacuous in this case, it is sufficient to prove (T1) only.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{1}_{A} * f=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}$ be a pd-tiling. By (1.9) the support of $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}$ and $\\hat{f}$ intersect only at zero. Let $H=\\{0\\} \\cup_{k=1}^{r} R_{p^{i k}}$ denote the support of $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}$ (the support is necessarily a union of step classes, as noted in the Introduction). As $r$ denotes the number of step classes in the support of $\\hat{1}_{A}$, there are $\\alpha-r$ cyclotomic divisors of $A(X)$, and hence condition (T1) means that $|A|=p^{\\alpha-r}$.\n\nConsider the \"standard\" tiling $C \\oplus D=\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$, corresponding to $H$ and its complement $H^{\\prime}$, where the mask polynomial of $C$ is $\\prod_{k=1}^{r} \\Phi_{M / p^{\\prime k}}(X)$, and the mask polynomial of $D$ is the product of the remaining cyclotomic polynomials $\\Phi_{M / p^{s}}\\left(s \\neq j_{k}\\right)$. In this tiling $|C|=p^{r}$, $|D|=p^{\\alpha-r}$, and the support of $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{C}$ is $H^{\\prime}$, and the support of $\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{D}$ is $H$. Hence, Proposition 2.10 shows that $D^{+}(H)=p^{r}, D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=p^{\\alpha-r}$.\n\nOn the other hand, we claim that $D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=|A|$. Informally, this is true because the functions $\\frac{1}{|A|^{2}}\\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}\\right|^{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{f(0)} \\hat{f}$ are both extremal in the classes defining $D^{-}(H)$ and $D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. Formally, the functions clearly belong to these classes, and $\\frac{1}{|A|^{2}} \\sum_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}}\\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}\\right|^{2}(\\xi)=\\frac{M}{|A|}$, $\\frac{1}{f(0)} \\sum_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}} \\hat{f}(\\xi)=\\frac{M}{|F|}=|A|$, and hence (invoking Porposition 2.6 in the middle equality)\n\n$$\n|A|=\\frac{M}{\\frac{1}{|A|^{2}} \\sum_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{M}}\\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{1}}_{A}\\right|^{2}(\\xi)} \\geq \\frac{M}{D^{-}(H)}=D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq \\frac{\\sum_{\\xi} \\hat{f}(\\xi)}{\\hat{f}(0)}=|A|\n$$\n\nand equality must hold everywhere.\nIn summary, we see that $p^{\\alpha-r}=D^{+}\\left(H^{\\prime}\\right)=|A|$ which proves exactly (T1).\nIn the terminology of [3] this means that the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ is $p d$-flat for $M=p^{\\alpha}$. We do not know whether the analogous statement holds true for $M=p^{\\alpha} q^{\\beta}$. If so, it would imply the \"spectral $\\rightarrow$ tile\" direction of Fuglede's conjecture in those groups, which would be a highly nontrivial result (for the sharpest currently known results in those groups see [12]).\n\nWe now present the proof of Theorem 1.6, by describing examples of functional pd-tilings that violate the Coven-Meyerowitz (T2) condition for $M=p^{4} q^{2}$ under the additional assumption\n\n$$\np<q<p^{2}\n$$\n\nProof of Theorem 1.6.

The array entry $\\left(M / p^{\\alpha}, M / q^{\\beta}\\right)$ will correspond to the value of the function on the step class $R_{M / p^{\\alpha} q^{\\beta}}$, i.e. either $c_{M / p^{\\alpha} q^{\\beta}}$ or $\\nu_{M / p^{\\alpha} q^{\\beta}}$.\n\nConsider the function $f$ defined as follows\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nSet $d=2 p q-p^{2}-q$. The function $g$ is as follows\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nBy the restriction (4.1) it is easy to verify that both $f$ and $g$ are nonnegative.\nTo calculate the Fourier transforms of $f$ and $g$ one can use the explicit formula given in Lemma 1.5 (because $f$ and $g$ are linear combinations of indicator functions of step classes). Using that formula one can directly verify that $f$ and $g$ are indeed eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform with eigenvalue $\\sqrt{M}=p^{2} q$, and consequently all conditions in Definition 1.4 are satisfied.\n\nConsidering the zero sets of $f$ and $g$, while keeping in mind that $c_{m}=0$ if and only if $\\Phi_{M / m}(X) \\mid F(X)$ (and similarly for $\\nu_{m}$ and $g$ ), we see that\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{p} \\Phi_{p^{4}} \\Phi_{q} \\mid F(X), \\Phi_{p^{2}} \\Phi_{p^{3}} \\Phi_{q^{2}} \\mid G(X)\n$$\n\nOn the one hand, a direct calculation shows $\\hat{f}(0)=\\hat{g}(0)=p^{2} q$, hence condition (T1) is satisfied. On the other hand, we observe that $c_{M / p q}$ and $\\nu_{M / p^{2} q^{2}}$ are positive therefore, respectively, $\\Phi_{p q} \\nmid F(X)$ and $\\Phi_{p^{2} q^{2}} \\nmid G(X)$ which in turn implies that both functions violate condition (T2).\n\nWe note that cyclotomic divisibility of $f$ and $g$ can also be explicitly verified through Proposition 3.5, which provides a system of linear constraints on the coefficients $c_{m}, \\nu_{m}$. For example, by Proposition 3.5 the fact that $\\Phi_{M}(X) \\mid G(X)$ is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\nu_{M}-\\nu_{M / p}-\\nu_{M / q}+\\nu_{M / p q}=0\n$$\n\nwhich evidently holds true. Similarly, the fact that $\\Phi_{M / p} \\mid F(X)$, is equivalent to $\\Phi_{M / p} \\mid F_{M / p}(X)$ (where the polynomial $F_{M / p}(X)$ is defined by (1.1) for the function $f_{M / p}$ in (3.3)), and by (3.8) this can be further restated as\n\n$$\nc_{M}-\\phi(p) c_{M / p q}-p c_{M / p^{2}}+p c_{M / p^{2} q}=0\n$$\n\nand directly verified. All cyclotomic divisibility conditions can be verified in this manner (as an alternative way, instead of checking that $f$ and $g$ are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform).", "tables": {"table_0": "| $f$ | $M$ | $M / q$ | $M / q^{2}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $M$ | 1 | 0 | $(q-p) / \\phi\\left(q^{2}\\right)$ |\n| $M / p$ | 0 | $1 / \\phi(q)$ | $(q-p) / \\phi\\left(q^{2}\\right)$ |\n| $M / p^{2}$ | $\\left(q^{2}-p q+p^{2}-q\\right) / p \\phi\\left(q^{2}\\right)$ | $\\left(p^{2}-q\\right) / p \\phi\\left(q^{2}\\right)$ | 0 |\n| $M / p^{3}$ | $(q-p) / p \\phi(q)$ | 0 | 0 |\n| $M / p^{4}$ | 0 | 0 | $1 / p^{2} \\phi(q)$ |", "table_1": "| $g$ | $M$ | $M / q$ | $M / q^{2}$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $M$ | 1 | $p(q-p) / d$ | 0 |\n| $M / p$ | $q \\phi(p) / d$ | 0 | 0 |\n| $M / p^{2}$ | 0 | 0 | $1 / d$ |\n| $M / p^{3}$ | 0 | $q / p d$ | $\\phi(p) / p d$ |\n| $M / p^{4}$ | $(q-p) / p d$ | $(q-p) / p d$ | 0 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 5. APPENDIX \n\nFinally, in order to demonstrate the strength of Proposition 2.10 we include here some statistical data of a computer experiment for a specific (fairly small) value of $M$.\n\nLet $M=3^{2} 5^{2} 7^{2}$, and let us try to make a list of those subsets $H \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ which satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2.10 with $k_{H}=p q r$.\n\nThere are 27 divisors $m$ of $M$, and correspondingly 27 classes $R_{m}$. As a first step, from each pair of classes $\\left\\{R_{M / p}, R_{M / p^{2}}\\right\\},\\left\\{R_{M / q}, R_{M / q^{2}}\\right\\},\\left\\{R_{M / r}, R_{M / r^{2}}\\right\\}$ we put one into $H$, and the other into the standard complement $H^{\\prime}$. We refer to these as the 'prime-power classes'. There are $2^{3}=8$ ways to make this selection. We put 0 into both $H$ and $H^{\\prime}$ in all cases. As such, after distributing the prime-power classes, 7 of the classes $R_{m}$ are positioned into $H$ or $H^{\\prime}$. There are 20 remaining classes $R_{M / d}$ (corresponding to the non-prime-power divisors $d$ ). There are $2^{20}$ ways to select which ones we put into $H$. For each selection we run two linear programs (LPs) to test whether $D^{\\delta+}(H)=D^{-}(H)$, and whether $D^{\\delta+}=p q r$, i.e whether $H$ satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.10. This means running $2^{3} \\cdot 2^{20} \\cdot 2 \\approx 16 \\cdot 10^{6} \\mathrm{LP}$ 's. Finally, if $H$ satisfies the conditions of Proposition 2.10, we can check whether it violates (T2) or not.\n\nThe results are as follows. For each selection of prime-power classes in $H$, the total number of possible selections of non-prime-power classes is $2^{20}$, and we indicate the number of those which satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2.10, and which do not satisfy the (T2) condition:\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nIn summary, the total number of sets $H$ satisfying the conditions of Proposition 2.10 is 37362 , which may seem large, but recall that we had about 8 million sets $H$ to test, so these represent less than half percent of the cases. The vast majority of these satisfy condition (T2). The total number of sets $H$ which violate (T2) is only 113 out of 37362 . For each such $H$, we can obtain a functional pd-tiling $f * g=\\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbb{Z}_{M}}$ such that $f$ violates the (T2) condition. Interestingly, in all such examples we have found, $g$ also violates the (T2) condition. In some of these examples $f$ and $g$ are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform (as in Theorem 1.6), while in others they are not.\n\nIt remains to be determined by future research whether these functional counterexamples can be used as building blocks of a proper counterexample to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture.\n\nAcknowledgements.
