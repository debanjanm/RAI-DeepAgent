      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nThe zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) model is the workhorse model for when the outcome variable is a non-zero count $(y=1,2, \\ldots)$. Yet, we find that ZTNB is misspecified in nearly every instance, due to one-inflation, which leads to biased and inconsistent estimators for the parameters of the model. It is common to find a preponderance of 1 counts in data, but distributions that allow for one-inflation have only recently been developed. While gaining popularity in biometrics, criminology and epidemiology, one-inflation has not yet extended into economics and other social sciences, perhaps due to a lack of an available regression model ${ }^{1}$. To rectify this we develop the one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) and oneinflated positive Poisson (OIPP) regression models. To illustrate their importance, we apply them to four common datasets traditionally used to highlight and exemplify the standard ZTNB, finding the presence of one-inflation in each case. We will argue that one-inflation should be the norm when data is collected administratively, and therefore recommend the estimation of OIZTNB instead of ZTNB, for most truncated data.\n\nTruncated count models are used in several areas of economics. In health economics, individual health care usage is often measured through doctor visits or days in a hospital. Patients do not enter the administrative sample until they make their first visit, so 0 counts are not observed. In tourism economics and recreation demand, the number of times an individual visits a site is often collected on-site making 0 counts impossible. In labour economics, the number of times a worker becomes unemployed or changes jobs is often zero-truncated when the data are collected administratively. Further examples of interest to social scientists include\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *email: ryan.godwin@umanitoba.ca; address: University of Manitoba, 646 Fletcher Argue Building, Winnipeg, MB, R3T5V5, Canada\n    ${ }^{1}$ A brief attempt was made in an unpublished conference paper by (Hassanzadeh et al., 2014)\n\nthe number of arrests or incarcerations, the number of patents filed by a firm, or the number of insurance claims.\n\nTruncation occurs if the observational apparatus only becomes active with the occurrence of one event (Johnson and Kotz, 1969). One-inflation occurs if the observational apparatus has an effect on that which is being observed, or on some associated party. It is usually not only the researcher that gains information at the first event. Revelations made at first visit disrupt the probability of a 1 count, but subsequent visits do not garner additional information, and the distortion to the counting distribution is confined to the 1 s . A doctor may learn that a patient is healthy and need not return after the first visit. A consumer may learn that they hate the experience and only do it once. A worker may have lower utility than they expected due to unemployment, and learn to avoid subsequent unemployment spells. In situations where information is learned at first visit, but not from subsequent visits, one-inflation (or deflation) is likely to occur.\n\nThe recent attention to one-inflated distributions in biology, epidemiology, and criminology, is due to population size estimation. A truncated count model is fit to \"capture-recapture\" data, in order to infer the number of missing 0 s , thus obtaining an estimate for the entire population. One-inflation has been found for many such data. For example, consider the number of times a prostitute is arrested. Rossmo and Routledge (1990) write: \"prudent ones seem to learn from the experience, not to avoid street prostitution, but to avoid being arrested... This would lead to a relatively large number of single arrests.\" A portion of individuals gain a desire or ability to avoid recapture; this portion is the amount of one-inflation in the data. The recognition of the one-inflating phenomenon has led to the development of several one-inflated distributions; the one-inflated positive Poisson (Godwin and B\u00f6hning, 2017), the one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial (Godwin, 2017), the one-inflated positive Poisson mixture model (Godwin, 2019), the one-inflated positive Poisson-Lindley (Tajuddin et al., 2022), and others. To our knowledge, none of these distributions have been extended to a regression framework, until now.\n\nThe development of regression models for one-inflated data entails several mathematical contributions. A novel link function for the one-inflation parameter is proposed. Marginal effects are derived. Log-likelihoods are determined. Various tests, including for no one-inflation, are presented. In addition, simulation studies verify the consistency of the proposed estimators, as well as illustrate the bias and inconsistency of the standard ZTNB estimator arising from ignoring one-inflation. A suite of tools to aid in the estimation, specification, and interpretation of the models are developed, and presented in the R package oneinfl. The importance of these contributions is highlighted through the finding of one-inflation in four applications where ZTNB has been the standard.",

      "text": "### 2.1 Poisson distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution is often the starting point for the analysis of count data, due to its relationship to more complicated but more suitable count distributions. The mass function for\n\na random variable, $y$, that follows a Poisson distribution, is:\n\n$$\nf^{P}=\\frac{\\lambda^{y}}{\\exp (\\lambda) y!} \\quad ; \\quad y=0,1, \\ldots\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda>0$ is the mean and variance of $y$ over the period of observation. The key limiting assumption of the Poisson model is homogeneity; the mean intensity of counts over the period of observation should be the same for all individuals in the sample. Violation of this assumption is usually dealt with by using the negative binomial model instead.\n\nBefore we develop the regression model, we discuss three main issues that cause the basic Poisson distribution to require extension. (i) Zero-truncation, the impossibility of observing a 0 count due to the administrative nature of the data. (ii) Unobserved heterogeneity, where the regressors can not explain enough of the variation in counts in order to satisfy the Poisson assumption of homogeneity. (iii) One-inflation (or deflation), a phenomenon where there is an excess (or a lack of) 1 counts.\n\nConsideration of these issues will lead to the OIPP distribution (Godwin and B\u00f6hning, 2017) and the OIZTNB distribution (Godwin, 2017). After these models have been discussed, regressors are introduced and a regression model is developed.",

Homogeneity is often too restrictive. Violation of this assumption is often detected through overdispersion of the data. A potential solution is to use a regression model, since the rigid Poisson assumption of homogeneity is more easily satisfied by allowing the Poisson parameter $\\lambda$ to be a function of regressors. If there is still unobserved heterogeneity, a richer model is required.\n\nThe negative binomial distribution is one such distribution capable of dealing with unobserved heterogeneity, and may be generated several ways. For example, one way is to include a gamma distributed error term in the function that links regressors to $\\lambda$. The mass function for a random variable $y$ that follows the negative binomial (NB) distribution is:\n\n$$\nf^{N B}=\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+y)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\Gamma(y+1)}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{y} \\quad ; \\quad y=0,1, \\ldots\n$$\n\nUsing equation (2), the mass function for a random variable $y$ that follows the zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) distribution is:\n\n$$\nf^{Z T N B}=\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+y)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha) \\Gamma(y+1)}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1+\\theta}\\right)^{y}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-(1+\\theta)^{-\\alpha}}\\right) \\quad ; \\quad y=1,2, \\ldots\n$$",

The link function for $\\omega_{i}$ requires care and development, and does not follow any convention that we are aware of.\n\nIt is desirable for the regression models to allow for one-deflation, as well as one-inflation. One-deflation (in a truncated model) is likely more empirically common than zero-deflation (in an un-truncated model) because of the nature of the phenomenon. While the two are conceptually and mathematically similar, zero-inflation typically occurs because \"non-users\" (always 0 s ) are mixed into the population of \"users\". 1-altered counts in administrative data, however, occur from a behavioural response due to the experience of being observed for the first time. The effect can be positive or negative; either the observational experience is a deterrent or an encouragement, and may vary by individual or context.\n\nThe zero-inflated Poisson model (Lambert, 1992) provides some guidance, where a logisticlike reparameterization is used: $\\omega_{i}=\\phi_{i} /\\left(1+\\phi_{i}\\right)$, and regressors are linked linearly by $\\phi_{i}=\\boldsymbol{Z}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$, where $\\gamma$ is an additional vector of parameters to be estimated. This ensures $\\omega_{i} \\in[0,1]$ for $\\boldsymbol{Z}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\in(-\\infty, \\infty)$. If the same link were used for the one-inflated models, then $f^{O I}(1) \\in$ $[f(1), 1]^{2}$. This would be acceptable if 1 -deflation (a lack of 1 s ) is ruled out a priori, but is not an appropriate restriction for the reasons outlined above. Instead, the $\\omega_{i}$ parameter should be bound such that the probability of a 1 -count lies between 0 and 1 :\n\n$$\nf^{O I}(1) \\in[0,1]\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2} f^{O I}$ denotes the one-inflated distribution, and $f$ denotes the underlying un-altered count distribution, as in equation 6 .\n\nThat is, the inflation parameter should be able to completely alter the probability of a 1-count to any allowable value. Equation 11 can be ensured by binding $\\omega_{i}$ appropriately:\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i} \\in\\left[\\frac{-f(1)}{1-f(1)}, 1\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere the domain of $\\omega_{i}$ is found by setting $f^{O I}(1)=0$ and $f^{O I}(1)=1$ in equation 6 . Finally, the generalized logistic function is used to link regressors to $\\omega_{i}$ :\n\n$$\n\\omega_{i}=L_{i}+\\frac{1-L_{i}}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\boldsymbol{Z}_{i} \\gamma\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $L_{i}$ is the lower bound from equation 12: $L_{i}=\\frac{-f(1)}{1-f(1)}, \\boldsymbol{Z}_{i}$ is the vector of regressors affecting one-inflation, and where $\\gamma$ is a parameter vector to be estimated. The link function in equation 13 ensures that the bounds on $\\omega_{i}$ in equation 12 are satisfied, and that $f^{O I}(y) \\geq 0$ and $\\sum f^{O I}=1 \\quad \\forall \\quad y=1,2, \\ldots$ (provided that $f$ is a proper mass function).\n\nFor the OIPP regression model, the lower bound $L_{i}$ takes on the form:\n\n$$\nL_{i}=\\frac{-\\lambda_{i}}{\\exp \\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right)-\\lambda_{i}-1}\n$$\n\nand for the OIZTNB regression model the lower bound $L_{i}$ takes the form:\n\n$$\nL_{i}=-\\left\\{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\lambda_{i}}\\right)^{-\\alpha} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{i}}\\left[1+\\frac{\\lambda_{i}}{\\alpha}-\\left(1+\\frac{\\lambda_{i}}{\\alpha}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\\right]-1\\right\\}^{-1}\n$$\n\nSince $\\lambda_{i}=\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)$, these lower bounds $L_{i}$ depend on the data and vary between individuals. This must be taken into account when determining marginal effects, and when estimating the parameters of the regression models.\n\nIn summary, the OIPP regression model is obtained by substituting the log link for $\\lambda_{i}$ (equation 9), the logistic link for $\\omega_{i}$, and the lower bound $L_{i}$ (equation 14), into the OIPP mass function (equation 7). The OIZTNB regression model is similarly achieved, except the lower bound for $L_{i}$ in equation 15 must instead be used.",

Obtaining the estimated marginal effects is a standard goal of regression modelling. The following derivatives need to be determined:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{i}\\right]}{\\partial q_{i j}}\n$$\n\nwhere $q_{i j}$ is the $j^{\\text {th }}$ regressor in $X$ and/or $Z$, for individual $i$. These partial derivatives are derived in Appendix B. The marginal effects in equations 21 or 23 are evaluated at the MLEs, and either averaged over all data points (\"average effects\"), evaluated once at the sample means of the data (\"effect at means\"), or at some representative case $X_{i}, Z_{i}$. For binary dummy variables, the \"marginal effect\" is instead $\\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{i} \\mid D_{i j}=1\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[y_{i} \\mid D_{i j}=0\\right]$, for some dummy in $X$ and/or $Z$. This is straightforward to estimate by evaluating the expected difference at multiple data points.\n\nModel parameters from PP or ZTNB models are incident risk ratios when exponentiated, offering an interpretation of the impact of a regressor on the outcome variable. However, this is not possible for the OIPP and OIZTNB models, since each regressor typically enters the model through a mean link (equation 9) and through a one-inflation link (equation 13). Marginal effects offer an alternative way to compare the impact of regressors between ZTNB and OIZTNB.\n\nIn order to determine whether the estimated marginal effects are significant, their standard errors must be estimated. There are two widely popular options available; the delta method and the bootstrap. We employ the delta method since significant computational time can be required in order to estimate some one-inflated models.\n\nThe delta method can provide the variance of a function $h(\\hat{\\theta})$, where $\\hat{\\theta}$ has a known asymptotic distribution (Normal in the case of MLEs) with variance-covariance matrix $\\mathbb{V}(\\hat{\\theta})$. Justified by a first order Taylor series approximation, the asymptotic variance of $h(\\hat{\\theta})$ is approximately equal to $J(\\hat{\\theta}) \\overline{\\mathbb{V}}(\\hat{\\theta}) J(\\hat{\\theta})^{\\prime}$. The Jacobian matrix $J(\\hat{\\theta})$ is the vector of first partial derivatives of $h(\\hat{\\theta})$. Standard errors for the marginal effects are estimated by setting $h(\\hat{\\theta})$ equal to the marginal effects derived in equations 21 or 23 , numerically approximating $J(\\hat{\\theta})$ using the numericDeriv() function in base R (R Core Team, 2024), and taking the square roots of the diagonal elements of $J(\\hat{\\theta}) \\overline{\\mathbb{V}}(\\hat{\\theta}) J(\\hat{\\theta})^{\\prime}$. These standard errors, as well as $z$-tests for the significance of the marginal effects, are reported in the margins () function in the oneinfl package.",

This is facilitated in the oneinfl package using the pred() function.\n\nVisualizing the data and predicted counts is an important diagnostic tool, as often the presence of one-inflation is immediately apparent. The oneplot() function in the oneinfl\n\npackage generates a barplot of the actual data, as well as plotting the predicted counts for up to four models: positive Poisson (PP), one-inflated positive Poisson (OIPP), zero truncated negative binomial (ZTNB), and one-inflated zero truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB). Figures 1 - 4 show the result of applying oneplot() to ZTNB and OIZTNB models.",

      "text": "# 5 Simulation studies \n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Percent biases of the MLEs from various models, under a one-inflated DGP (either OIPP or OIZTNB).\n\nSimulation studies are undertaken to examine the percent bias of various maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) under different data generating processes (DGPs) and for differently specified models. The simulations suggest massive bias of the MLEs for when one-inflation is present, but is ignored. That is, the MLEs from the standard positive Poisson (PP) or zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) exhibit large bias when the true data generating process is characteristic of one-inflation. The bias of the estimators depends on the values of the parameters chosen in the DGP, but it is not difficult to find values for which there is over $100 \\%$ bias.\n\nWe conduct two main simulations, one each for a one-inflated positive Poisson (OIPP) DGP and for a one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) DGP. Under each DGP, both the standard and one-inflated models are estimated. The same two regressors are used in the $X$ and $Z$ matrices; $x_{1}$ is generated according to a $N(10,1)$ distribution and $x_{2}$ is a dummy variable with mean 0.5 . The parameter values under OIPP are chosen to be $\\beta=(-2,0.4,0.2)$, $\\gamma=(-21,2,0.5)$. The same parameter values are chosen for OIZTNB, but with the addition of $\\alpha=10$. The simulations are run for various sample sizes, and all experiments use 10,000 replications. Random variates for OIPP and OIZTNB were generated using the roipp() and roiztnb() functions in oneinfl. The results of the experiments are reported in Table 1.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: The one-inflated zero truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) regression model, and the zero truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) regression model, fit to the MedPar data set.\n\nTable 1 shows very high percent biases for PP and ZTNB (between $75 \\%$ and $325 \\%$ bias), that do not diminish as $n$ increases, reflecting the inconsistency of the estimators in the presence of one-inflation. In contrast, the percent biases of OIPP and OIZTNB are always less than $4 \\%$, and diminish further as $n$ increases. These results reflect the consistency of a correctly specified MLE.",

      "text": "### 6.1 Hospital length of stay: MedPar data\n\nA particular data set from the 1991 Arizona MedPar database has championed and exemplified the zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) regression model. The data appears in articles (Hardin and Hilbe, 2007, 2015), books (Hilbe, 2011, 2014), R packages (Hilbe, 2016; Hilbe and Robinson, 2018), and several web vignettes for ZTNB estimation. ZTNB regression models have been estimated for subsequent waves of MedPar data in many research articles (Baser et al., 2010; Kleindorfer et al., 2009; Lasater et al., 2021), to name a few.\n\nThe goal is to model a patient's hospital length of stay (los), which is a zero-truncated count. Some illustrations of the ZTNB model use membership to a health maintenance organization as an explanatory variable, but we instead estimate the model from \"11.1: Zerotruncated count models\", in Hilbe (2011). All of the explanatory variables are dummies: white $==1$ if the patient identifies as Caucasian; died $==1$ if the patient died during their stay; and categorical dummies for the type of admission, whether elective, urgent (type2 == 1) or emergency (type3 == 1).\n\nThe estimated ZTNB and OIZTNB models, and the marginal effects from each, are displayed in Table 2. Average and absolute one-inflation is $4.2 \\%$ and $6.8 \\%$ respectively. Oneinflation is plausible in such data, for at least two reasons. Suppose there are two types of\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nSignificance at the $1 \\%(* * *), 5 \\%(* *)$, and $10 \\%(*)$ levels.\nTable 2: ZTNB and OIZTNB models fit to the MedPar data.\nindividuals mixed into the sample; ill and healthy. Type is revealed through examination by a doctor, when los $=1$. Those that are healthy are discharged and one-inflate the data. As a second channel for one-inflation, suppose that patients that die tend to do so on their first day of stay. Both Wald and LRT tests of no one-inflation support the presence of one-inflation with test statistics of 469.1 and 131.4 respectively, giving associated p-values of 0 .\n\nDespite its association with the MedPar data set, the ZTNB regression model is likely misspecified, and the MLEs are biased and inconsistent.\n\nA plot of the actual data, as well as the predicted counts from the ZTNB and OIZTNB models, is generated using oneplot() and displayed in Figure 1. One-inflation is visibly apparent.\n\nAll estimates and standard errors for the parameters and marginal effects change somewhat between ZTNB and OIZTNB models. Most notably is for that of the regressor died, whose association to los occurs through one-inflation rather than through the mean of the underlying count distribution.

      "text": "# 6.2 Hospital length of stay: Arizona Medicare data \n\nThis illustration uses 1995 Arizona Medicare data for the hospital length of stay for patients undergoing a heart procedure. The data may be found in the R package COUNT (Hilbe, 2016). This data has appeared as an application of the ZTNB model, and a two component truncated negative binomial mixture model, in Hilbe (2007, 2011). Note that finite mixture models are incapable of capturing one-inflation, since the mixture component would need to reach the boundary (i.e. $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ ). Regressors are again all dummies: gender == 1 for male; type1 == 1 for emergency/urgent admission and $==0$ for elective admission; and age $75==1$ if the patient is over the age of 75 .\n\nOIZTNB and ZTNB models and marginal effects are estimated similar to Section 6.1. Results are reported in Table 3. Actual and predicted counts appear in Figure 2. One-deflation is present (average one-inflation is estimated to be $-16.4 \\%$ ), and is seemingly driven by type of admission. A one-count is less probable under an emergency/urgent admission. Wald and LRT tests for no one-inflation again produce $p$-values of 0 . Table 3 shows big swings in the values of the estimated $\\hat{\\beta}$ between ZTNB and OIZTNB, as well as some moderate changes in\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: OIZTNB and ZTNB regression models fit to the Arizona Medicare data set.\nthe estimated marginal effects.",

      "text": "# 6.3 Recreation demand \n\nThe data is from Loomis (2003) and is on number of trips taken to a recreation site. Estimates of the effect of travel cost on the number of visits can be used to value the site. Endogenous stratification is of concern for this type of data; it is collected on-site, and risks over-sampling avid users. However, in this illustration, and in other examples for recreation demand, endogenous stratification seems to have little impact. For this data, Hilbe (2011) finds that the \"zero-truncated model without adjustment for endogenous stratification is preferred.\" Additionally, he writes, \"the extreme number of 1 s in the data is the likely cause of the model not fitting.\" Descriptions of the variables can be found in Loomis (2003) or the R package COUNT (Hilbe, 2016).\n\nZTNB and OIZTNB regression models are estimated for the data (see Figure 3). Massive changes in the estimated $\\hat{\\beta}$ and the marginal effects can be seen in Table 4, namely the effect of income2 changes from 41.26 to 4.154 . Average one-inflation is estimated to be $24 \\%$ (with some observations having one-deflation), and both Wald and LRT tests ( $p$-values 0 ) again support the presence of one-inflation.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nSignificance at the $1 \\%\\left({ }^{* * *}\\right), 5 \\%\\left({ }^{* *}\\right)$, and $10 \\%\\left({ }^{*}\\right)$ levels.\nTable 3: ZTNB and OIZTNB models fit to the Arizona Medicare data.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: OIZTNB and ZTNB regression models fit to the Loomis (2003) data set.",

      "text": "# 6.4 Fishing trips \n\nIn \"Models for truncated counts\" (Grogger and Carson, 1991), zero-truncated Poisson and negative binomial (PP and ZTNB) models are presented as important and viable in the fields of recreation demand, crime, transporation, and labour economics. The merits of the truncated models (in comparison to the untruncated counterparts), in particular the merits of ZTNB, are exemplified. To illustrate, the authors estimate a participation equation using data on the number of fishing trips taken by households in Alaska.\n\nEstimating an OIZTNB model, average absolute one-inflation is estimated to be $4.4 \\%$, and average inflation is $-2.2 \\%$. The Wald statistic (p-value 0.000 ) supports the presence of one-inflation, but the LRT is borderline (p-value is 0.09 , unless the insignificant variables are dropped from $Z$, in which case the p -value is 0.02 ). The fit of the models is illustrated\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nSignificance at the $1 \\%(* * *), 5 \\%(* *)$, and $10 \\%(*)$ levels.\nTable 4: ZTNB and OIZTNB models fit to the Loomis (2003) data.\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: OIZTNB and ZTNB regression models fit to the fishing trip data set.\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nSignificance at the $1 \\%(* * *), 5 \\%(* *)$, and $10 \\%(*)$ levels.\nTable 5: ZTNB and OIZTNB models fit to the fishing trip data set.\nin Figure 4, and estimated parameters are reported in Table 5. Most notably, a significant marginal effect (on AVLONG) changes sign.\n\nOur replication efforts use data from Carson et al. (2009), with small differences in the parameter estimates from ZTNB, due to our inability to reproduce a TRATE variable that was an inclusive variable from a nested logit model. Nonetheless, the highlighted discrepancies between the ZTNB and OIZTNB models should be invariant to the presence of this missing variable; when one-inflation is present (as supported by the Wald and LRT), additional variables can not explain away its presence unless they are linked to the one-inflation parameter.",

      "text": "# 7 Conclusions \n\nIn administrative settings, the number of visits is typically a truncated count. For such data, the individual is not observed unless they visit the entity that is collecting the data. For example, data on the number of health care visits typically begin at the 1 -count; individuals that do not visit the doctor are not observed. A common endeavour is to determine how a policy or characteristic might influence the expected number of visits, and for data that are zero-truncated, an appropriate zero-truncated distribution must be used in order to avoid biased and inconsistent estimators.\n\nThe current standard truncated count model, the zero truncated negative binomial (ZTNB), is likely biased and inconsistent in most settings that it is employed. This is due to one-inflation. One-inflation occurs because the individual experiences being observed during their first visit. Information is revealed, and behaviour is altered, typically in a way that discourages future visits. Individuals must experience the observational setting before they can enter the data set, but the experience itself alters their behaviour. This causes altered 1 counts as the experience either encourages or dissuades future visits. While one-inflated distributions have been developed in areas outside social sciences, the distributions have not yet been extended to a regression framework, until now.\n\nThis paper develops one-inflated zero truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) and oneinflated positive Poisson (OIPP) regression models, as well as a plethora of related estimators and tools, all made available in the R package oneinfl. The methods developed here are applied to four data sets that have traditionally been used to champion the ZTNB regression model. In all cases, one-inflation is found, suggesting that the ZTNB model is actually misspecified. Simulation studies suggest large biases when specifying the wrong model. Accordingly, we recommend the use of the OIZTNB model in place of the ZTNB, for administrative type data.",

  "abstract": "The workhorse model for zero-truncated count data (y = 1, 2, ...) is the\nzero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) model. We find it should seldom be\nused. Instead, we recommend the one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial\n(OIZTNB) model developed here. Zero-truncated count data often contain an\nexcess of 1s, leading to bias and inconsistency in the ZTNB model. The\nimportance of the OIZTNB model is apparent given the obvious presence of\none-inflation in four datasets that have traditionally championed the standard\nZTNB. We provide estimation, marginal effects, and a suite of accompanying\ntools in the R package oneinfl, available on CRAN.",
