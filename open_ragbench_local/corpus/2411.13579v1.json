The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the relative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon, featuring the dynamic adjustments in portfolio decision according to past achievements. Under power utility, we transform the original infinite horizon optimal control problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem under a modified utility function. To cope with the convex trading constraints, we further introduce an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem in a modified market model and develop the martingale duality approach to establish the existence of the dual minimizer such that the optimal unconstrained wealth process can be obtained using the dual representation. With the help of the duality results in the auxiliary problems, the relationship between the constrained and unconstrained models as well as some fixed point arguments, we finally derive and verify the optimal constrained portfolio process in a periodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon.\n\n\nKeywords: Periodic evaluation, relative portfolio performance, incomplete market, stochastic factor model, convex trading constraints, convex duality approach\n\nJEL Classification: G11, C61", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nIt has been well documented that for portfolio management by institutional managers, the long term portfolio performance often dictates the daily decision making for the fund management. Various long-run criteria for portfolio optimization have been proposed and studied in the literature, leading to several well-known stochastic control and optimizaiton problems over a large or an infinite horizon. The long term optimal growth rate, also named Kelly's criterion, has been popularized thanks to its tractability and simple financial implications. As an important extension, the so-called risk-sensitive portfolio management was introduced by Bielecki and Pliska (1999) and Fleming and Sheu (1999) to encode diverse risk attitudes. Later, Pham (2003) formulated the longrun outperformance criterion as a large deviation probability control problem to incorporate the benchmark tracking for the fund management. Recently, another new long-run portfolio criterion was proposed in Tse and Zheng (2023), which suggests to roll over the same utility sequentially for infinite periods. In Tse and Zheng (2023), the utility during each period is generated by the difference between the wealth levels at two adjacent evaluation dates. In particular, the S-shaped\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *School of Mathematics and Statistics, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, 350007, China; and School of Mathematical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.

This type of periodic evaluation can partially match with the practical exercises in the annual appraisal review in the fund industry. However, as a common consequence of the S-shaped utility, when the current wealth level falls below the benchmark of the previous evaluation date, the optimal solution under loss aversion may suggest to cease the investment in the risky asset as the bankruptcy occurs.\n\nIn the present paper, we are interested in generalizing the periodic evaluation in Tse and Zheng (2023) by considering its variation when the relative performance is generated by the ratio of wealth processes at two evaluation dates. One advantage of the ratio-type relative performance is that the opportunity of investment cessation is ruled out from the admissible portfolio processes as the resulting optimal wealth process always stays above zero, yielding the optimal portfolio strategy truly supported over the infinite horizon. Moreover, in contrast to Tse and Zheng (2023) that focus on the Black-Scholes model, we study the ratio-type periodic evaluation problem in incomplete market models with price dynamics driven by unhedgeable stochastic factors and general convex constraints on portfolio strategies.\n\nOn one hand, stochastic factor models have been extensively employed in optimal investment to integrate the asset predictability of the return and the stochastic volatility. For example, some early studies on the predictability of stock returns using the stochastic factor can be found in Fama and Schwert (1977), Ferson and Harvey (1993), Brennan et al. (1997), Brennan (1998), Campbell and Viceira (1999), Wachter (2002) among others. The optimal investment under the stochastic volatility and unhedgeable risk or the combination of the stochastic returns and stochastic volatility was investigated in French et al. (1987), Kim and Omberg (1996), Scruggs (1998), Fouque et al. (2000), Zariphopoulou (2001), Pham (2002), Fleming and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2003), Chacko and Viceira (2005), Kraft (2005), Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005), Liu (2007), Fouque et al. (2013), Hata et al. (2018), Avanesyan et al. (2020), to name a few.\n\nOn the other hand, convex trading constraints have also attracted a lot of attention in academic studies in portfolio management problems, which have been used as regulatory ways to stabilize stock prices in the financial market and as effective methods to minify the portfolio risk in fund management. Two typical examples are the short-selling constraint and borrowing constraint, which have been extensively studied in the literature. See, for instance, some empirical studies on the short-selling constraint and the economic influence in the financial market among Allen et al. (1993), Chen et al. (2002), Almazan et al. (2004), G\u00f3mez and Sharma (2006), Beber and Pagano (2013), Boehmer et al. (2013), Grullon et al. (2015), and et al. See also some relevant studies on portfolio optimization with no short-selling such as the utility maximization (Xu and Shreve (1992a), Xu and Shreve (1992b), Shirakawa (1994)); the mean-variance portfolio optimization (Li et al. (2002)); the arbitrage theory in general market models (Pulido (2014)). For portfolio management problems under borrowing constraints, we refer to Fleming and Zariphopoulou (1991), Grossman and Vila (1992), Tepla (2000), Dybvig and Liu (2011), Lee and et al. (2019), Jeon and et al. (2024) and references therein. In the main result of the paper, we consider the general convex trading constraints similar to Cvitani\u0107 and Karatzas (1992) and Escobar-Anel et al. (2023), and aim to develop a general convex duality approach.\n\nInspired by Tse and Zheng (2023), we first reformulate the infinite horizon optimization problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem based on dynamic programming principle, leading to two subsequent questions: (1). The existence and the characterization of the optimal portfolio for the auxiliary terminal wealth utility maximization problem; (2). The fixed point argument to characterize the original value function and the verification proof of the constructed optimal portfolio for the original problem over the infinite horizon. Comparing with Tse and Zheng\n\n(2023) in the Black-Scholes model, the mixture of convex trading constraints and the stochastic factor model render both questions significantly more challenging. For technical convenience, we focus on the power utility for the periodic evaluation in this study. Firstly, to address the auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem under a modified utility function (see the induced utility in (3.12) and (4.11)), we need to develop the convex duality approach in the incomplete market model in the face of infinitely many dual processes (see (4.17)) due to unhedgeable stochastic factor process and convex trading constraints. We need to overcome some new challenges to define the proper dual space and show the existence of and characterize the dual minimizer because our modified utility in (3.12) does not satisfy some standard assumptions in the existing literature. Secondly, due to the presence of the stochastic factor, the fixed point in (3.11) depends on the variable $y$ instead of the constant fixed point in Tse and Zheng (2023). More importantly, the verification proof for the constructed portfolio using the result from the auxiliary problem also becomes more technical as the we first need to establish the connection between the constrained optimization problem and the unconstrained optimization problem in a modified model and then leverage some duality arguments to verify the optimality condition.\n\nThe present paper contributes to the methodology in resolving the aforementioned issues. To address the existence of the optimal solution in the auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem fulfilling the convex constraints, in the first step, we introduce and study the auxiliary optimization problem formulated as a combination of the stochastic factor model in Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005) and the general convex constraints in Cvitani\u0107 and Karatzas (1992). That is, we introduce a fictitious market model without portfolio constraints described by (4.3) such that the dual processes enjoy the local martingale characterization in (4.4) depending on two parameter processes $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}$ defined by (4.1), referring as the constraint parameter process and the market completion parameter process respectively. We fix the constraint parameter process $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and first study the unconstrained primal optimization problem (4.9) under the modified utility function given in (3.12). To this end, we establish the existence of the dual minimizer to the auxiliary dual problem in (4.17) over the market completion parameter processes $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}$ and the Lagrange multipliers. In particular, due to the modified utility function, some new technical proofs are developed in the present paper for two cases when risk aversion parameter $0<\\alpha<1$ (see Proposition 4.2) and $\\alpha<0$ (see Proposition 4.3), respectively. In the second step, we first provide a sufficient condition on the constraint parameter process $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{D}$ such that the unconstrained optimal portfolio process in the modified model coincide with the optimal solution to the constrained terminal wealth optimization problem (3.11) in the original market model; see Proposition 5.1. Building upon this condition, we can further consider the dual problem (5.22) associated to the constrained terminal wealth optimization problem (3.11) formulated as a minimization problem over both parameter processes $\\nu \\in \\mathcal{D}$ and $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}$. By showing the existence of the dual optimizer pair $\\left(\\nu^{*}, \\eta^{*}\\right)$ and choosing the appropriate Lagrange multiplier, we can verify that the optimal wealth process induced by the dual representation satisfies the convex constraints and is therefore the optimal solution to the constrained problem (3.11); see Proposition 5.3. To tackle the second question regarding the optimal portfolio for the original periodic evaluation problem, we show the existence of the unique fixed point by the contraction mapping in the space of bounded and continuous nonnegative functions; see Proposition 6.1. Based on the characterization of the dual minimizer in the auxiliary problem and the fixed point result, we are able to verify the optimality of the concatenated wealth process period by period (see Theorem 6.1) using some convergence arguments involving the dual processes and the duality relationship.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the stochastic factor model and formulates the ratio-type periodic evaluation problem under power utility and convex trading constraints over an infinite horizon. Based on dynamic programming principle, Section 3\n\nreformulates the periodic evaluation problem as a fixed point problem where the operator becomes an auxiliary constrained terminal wealth optimization problem with a modified utility. To tackle this auxiliary problem, Section 4 introduces a parameterized market model and an unconstrained optimization problem, for which the dual problem is thoroughly studied. In Section 5, by passing from the unconstrained optimization problem to the constrained optimization problem, the convex duality theorem for the auxiliary constrained terminal wealth optimization problem is developed and the characterization of the optimal portfolio fulfilling the constraints is derived. Based on the convex duality results in the auxiliary problem, Section 6 completes the proof of the fixed point and the verification of the constructed optimal portfolio in a periodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon. Section 7 presents two examples, namely one special case of power utility with parameter $\\gamma=1$ under short-selling and borrowing constraints and one example of logarithmic utility with general convex constraints, in which the dual optimizer for each auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem admits some explicit characterization.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Market Model and Problem Formulation \n\nLet $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F},\\{\\mathcal{F}\\}_{t \\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P})$ be a standard filtered probability space supporting a $n+1$-dimensional Brownian motion $W=\\left(W_{1}, W_{2}\\right)^{\\top}$ with $W_{1}=\\left(W_{1 t}^{1}, \\ldots, W_{1 t}^{n}\\right)_{t \\geq 0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $W_{2}=\\left(W_{2 t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

For simplicity, we shall consider the equal period $T_{i}=i \\tau$ for $i \\geq 0$ with some $\\tau>0$ such that the portfolio is evaluated every $\\tau$ unit of time (e.g. monthly or annually). However, in contrast to the problem formulation in Tse and Zheng (2023) where the portfolio performance is measured by the difference $X_{T_{i}}-\\gamma X_{T_{i-1}}$ periodically between each time epoch $T_{i}$ and the previous date $T_{i-1}$, we consider the relative wealth performance in the present paper as periodic evaluation in the ratio type that\n\n$$\n\\frac{X_{T_{i}}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\sigma} X_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{\\gamma}}, \\quad i \\geq 1\n$$\n\nfor some relative performance parameter $\\gamma \\in(0,1]$ and the agent's subjective discount factor $\\rho>0$. That is, when $\\gamma \\rightarrow 1$, the agent cares more about the relative ratio comparing with the wealth level at the previous evaluation date $T_{i-1}$; while $\\gamma \\rightarrow 0$ indicates that the agent values more on the absolute value of the current wealth. In addition, to take into account the present values of wealth at different time spots $T_{i}$ and $T_{i-1}, i \\geq 1$, we also consider the discount inside the ratio-type relative performance.\n\nAs a direct consequence, while the optimal wealth $X_{t}$ is allowed to hit 0 in Tse and Zheng (2023), i.e., the bankruptcy $X_{t}=0$ may occur at some time $t$ and will remain at 0 afterwards, our formulation in the ratio-type enforces the positive wealth constraint $X_{t}>0$ as an inherent nature by the problem formulation and the resulting optimal wealth will retain positive for all time $t \\geq 0$, which makes more sense if we are interested in the periodic evaluation over an infinite horizon.\n\nMathematically speaking, our objective is to solve the optimal portfolio problem over an infinite horizon by employing a periodic evaluation of the relative performance defined by\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\pi \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho T_{i}} U\\left(\\frac{X_{T_{i}}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\sigma} X_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{\\gamma}}, Y_{T_{i}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho>0$ is the agent's subjective discount factor, and $\\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)$ is the set of admissible portfolio processes defined by\n$\\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y):=\\left\\{X^{x, y, \\pi}: \\pi\\right.$ is a $\\left.\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\right.$-progressively measurable and locally square-integrabale process\n\nsuch that $\\pi \\in K$, and $X_{t}^{x, y, \\pi}=x+\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\int_{0}^{t} \\pi_{u}^{i} X_{u}^{x, y, \\pi} \\frac{d S_{u}^{i}}{S_{u}^{i}}+\\int_{0}^{t} X_{u}^{x, y, \\pi}\\left(1-\\mathbf{1}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\pi_{u}\\right) \\frac{d B_{u}}{B_{u}}>0$\nfor $t \\geq 0$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho T_{i}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(U\\left(\\frac{X_{T_{i}}^{x, y, \\pi}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau} X_{T_{i-1}}^{x, y, \\pi}\\right)^{\\gamma}}\\right)\\right)_{-}]<\\infty\\right\\}, \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$,\nwith $a_{-}=\\max \\{-a, 0\\}$ and $K$ being the closed, convex set, and $Y_{0}=y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

By Sections 3 and 4 of Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005), one knows that the dual problem of $\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{A}_{T_{i-1}}\\left(1, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} X_{T_{i}}^{\\alpha} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{T_{i-1}}\\right]$ is equal to (4.2) in Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005). Then, due to the strong duality relationship, one has\n\n$$\n\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{A}_{T_{i-1}}\\left(1, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} X_{T_{i}}^{\\alpha} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{T_{i-1}}\\right]=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha} W\\left(\\tau, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha}\n$$\n\nwhere $W\\left(\\tau, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)$ is defined by (4.5) in Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005). Using (4.18) of Castaneda-Leyva and Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez (2005) and (3.7), we have\n\n$$\n\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{T_{i-1}}\\left(1, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} X_{T_{i}}^{\\alpha} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{T_{i-1}}\\right] \\leq \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha} W\\left(\\tau, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{\\zeta(\\alpha) \\tau}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)} X_{T_{i-1}}^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right] \\leq \\frac{x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}}{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)} e^{\\zeta(\\alpha(1-\\gamma))(i-1) \\tau}\n$$\n\nCombining (3.5)-(3.9), we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{-\\rho T_{i}}\\left(\\frac{X_{T_{i}}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau} X_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{\\gamma}}\\right)^{\\alpha} h\\left(Y_{T_{i}}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\\leq & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{-\\rho T_{i}} e^{-\\rho \\gamma \\alpha \\tau} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{T_{i-1}}}\\left(1, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)}{\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{T_{i-1}}}\\left(1, Y_{T_{i-1}}\\right)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{T_{i}}^{\\alpha} \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{T_{i-1}}\\right]\\right) X_{T_{i-1}}^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)} \\\\\n\\leq & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{-\\rho T_{i}} e^{-\\rho \\gamma \\alpha \\tau} e^{\\zeta(\\alpha) \\tau} \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} X_{T_{i-1}}^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right] \\\\\n\\leq & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e^{-\\rho T_{i}} e^{-\\rho \\gamma \\alpha \\tau} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{\\zeta(\\alpha) \\tau} e^{\\zeta(\\alpha(1-\\gamma))(i-1) \\tau} x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe desired upper bound in Proposition 3.1 follows after sending $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ on both sides. The proof for the case $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ can be easily modified, and it is hence omitted.\n\nIn view of the scaling property of the utility function $U(x, y)=x^{\\alpha} U(1, y)$ and the fact that the value function $V(x, y)$ is bounded with respect to $y$, we heuristically conjecture that our value function takes the form of $V(x, y)=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-\\rho \\tau \\gamma \\alpha} A^{*}(y) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}$ for some continuous, bounded, and nonnegative function $A^{*}(\\cdot)$. Substituting this form of $V$ into (3.2) and then dividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{\\alpha} e^{-\\rho \\tau \\gamma \\alpha} x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}$, one obtains\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA^{*}(y) & =\\alpha \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho T_{1}} \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{X_{T_{1}}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha} h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+e^{-\\rho T_{1}} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} A^{*}\\left(Y_{T_{1}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{X_{T_{1}}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right] \\\\\n& =\\alpha \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(1, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho \\tau} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} X_{\\tau}^{\\alpha} h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+e^{-\\rho \\tau} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} A^{*}\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right) X_{\\tau}^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, under power utility, the characterization of $V$ now simplifies to the characterization of the unknown, non-negative, continuous, and bounded function $A^{*}(\\cdot)$. More importantly, the unknown function $A^{*}(\\cdot)$ will be proven as the the fixed point of a contraction operator defined on the function space $C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ consisting of all continuous, bounded, and non-negative functions on $\\mathbb{R}$. To this end, we will first establish the existence of the optimizer to the auxiliary one-period terminal wealth optimization problem (3.11) for a fixed $A^{*}$, and then show the existence of the unique fixed point $A^{*}$ to the operator.\n\nFurthermore, let us consider the modified utility function $\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\ni(x, y) \\mapsto h_{A}(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ given by\n\n$$\nh_{A}(x, y):=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha} h(y)+\\frac{1}{\\alpha} A(y) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}, \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $A(\\cdot) \\in C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ is viewed as a parameter of the function $h_{A}$. As a preparation for the main result, we first derive some preliminary properties of the function $h_{A}$, which play pivotal roles in later proofs.\n\nLemma 3.1 The function $h_{A}(x, y)$ defined by (3.12) is strictly increasing and strictly concave in $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, and it holds that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(0+, y)=\\infty$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(\\infty, y)=0$ for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In addition, there exist some constants $\\vartheta \\in(0,1)$ and $\\varrho \\in(1, \\infty)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\vartheta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y) \\geq \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(\\varrho x, y), \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, when $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, there exist some constants $\\kappa_{1} \\in(0, \\infty)$ and $\\rho_{1} \\in(0,1)$ such that\n\n$$\n0<h_{A}(x, y) \\leq \\kappa_{1}\\left(1+x^{\\rho_{1}}\\right), \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nand when $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$, there exist some constants $\\kappa_{2} \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ and $\\rho_{2} \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ such that\n\n$$\n0>h_{A}(x, y) \\geq \\kappa_{2}\\left(1+x^{\\rho_{2}}\\right), \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nProof. The results follow from elementary calculus. Recall that the function $h(\\cdot) \\in[m, 1]$ with $m \\in(0,1)$ and $A(\\cdot) \\in C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$. Differentiating twice the both sides of (3.12) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y)=x^{\\alpha-1} h(y)+A(y)(1-\\gamma) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1}, \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} h_{A}(x, y)=(\\alpha-1) x^{\\alpha-2} h(y)+A(y)(1-\\gamma)(\\alpha-1-\\alpha \\gamma) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-2}, \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nDue to the facts of $\\gamma \\in(0,1]$ and $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0) \\cup(0,1)$, we have $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y)>0$ and $\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} h_{A}(x, y)<0$ for any $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, implying that the function $h_{A}(x, y)$ is strictly concave and strictly increasing with respect to $x$ on $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Furthermore, by (3.16), one can easily get $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(0+, y)=\\infty$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(\\infty, y)=0$ for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To prove the second claim, for any constant $\\varrho \\in(1, \\infty)$, one can take $\\vartheta=\\varrho^{\\alpha-1} \\vee \\varrho^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1} \\in(0,1)$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\vartheta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y) & =\\vartheta x^{\\alpha-1} h(y)+A(y)(1-\\gamma) \\vartheta x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1} \\\\\n& \\geq(\\varrho x)^{\\alpha-1} h(y)+A(y)(1-\\gamma)(\\varrho x)^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(\\varrho x, y), \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, when $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$, taking $\\kappa_{1}=\\frac{2}{\\alpha} \\max \\left\\{1, \\sup _{y \\in \\mathbb{R}} A(y)\\right\\} \\in(0, \\infty)$ and $\\rho_{1}=\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ yields (3.14); when $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$, taking $\\kappa_{2}=\\frac{2}{\\alpha} \\max \\left\\{1, \\sup _{y \\in \\mathbb{R}} A(y)\\right\\} \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ and $\\rho_{2}=\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$ yields (3.15).

It follows that $\\Phi_{f}(y)=f\\left(x_{f}^{*}(y)\\right)-y x_{f}^{*}(y)$.\n\nBy Lemma 3.1, for fixed $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, one can define the inverse function of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y)$ by $\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\ni x \\mapsto$ $I(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, which is a strictly decreasing function. Let $\\Phi_{h_{A}}(u, y)=\\sup _{x \\geq 0}\\left\\{h_{A}(x, y)-x u\\right\\}$ be the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the concave function $h_{A}(x, y)$.

Let us assume (4.19) holds.

Then, for any $X \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{+}$and $(\\eta, \\lambda) \\in \\mathcal{H} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, using (3.12) and (4.13), one can get\n\n$$\nh_{A}\\left(X, Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} X \\leq h_{A}\\left(x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right), Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right) \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}\n$$\n\nBy (4.17), (4.19) and (4.20), for each $(\\eta, \\lambda) \\in \\mathcal{H} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\inf _{\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}, \\lambda>0} L_{\\nu}(\\eta, \\lambda)=\\inf _{\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}, \\lambda>0}\\left\\{\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{+}}\\left\\{\\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{A}\\left(X, Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} X\\right]\\right\\}+\\lambda\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\inf _{\\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}, \\lambda>0}\\left\\{\\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{A}\\left(x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right), Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right) \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}\\right]+\\lambda\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\leq \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{A}\\left(x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda^{*} \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta^{*}}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right), Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda^{*} x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda^{*} \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta^{*}}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right) \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta^{*}}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}\\right]+\\lambda^{*} \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\left(x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda^{*} \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta^{*}}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\right)^{\\alpha} h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\alpha} A\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\left(x_{h_{A}}^{*}\\left(\\lambda^{*} \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta^{*}}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\right)^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{G}_{0, \\tau}^{v}(1, g)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha} X^{\\alpha} h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+\\frac{1}{\\alpha} A\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right) X^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich, together with (4.18), implies that there is no duality gap. As a result, $X^{\\nu, *}$ is the optimal solution to the unconstrained problem (4.11) and $\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\lambda^{*}\\right)$ is the optimal solution to the dual problem (4.17). Hence, the first claim holds.\n\nFor the second claim, it is not hard to verify that the function\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}_{+} \\ni \\lambda \\mapsto \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{+}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{A}\\left(X, Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\lambda \\frac{Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} X\\right]\n$$\n\nis decreasing and convex.

Denote by $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{Y}$ the smallest $\\sigma$-field generated by $\\left(Y_{t}\\right)_{0 \\leq t \\leq \\tau}$. We first verify that, for fixed $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}, L(\\cdot, \\lambda)$ defined by (4.17) is a convex functional on $\\mathcal{D}$. Note that the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n-\\frac{x \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}} h_{A}(x, y)}{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} h_{A}(x, y)} & =-\\frac{(\\alpha-1) x^{\\alpha-1} h(y)+(1-\\gamma)(\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1} A(y)}{x^{\\alpha-1} h(y)+(1-\\gamma) x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)-1} A(y)} \\\\\n& \\leq 1, \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen, by Lemma 12.6 of Karatzas et al. (1991), one knows that the function $z \\mapsto \\Phi_{h_{A}}\\left(e^{z}, y\\right)$ is convex on $\\mathbb{R}$ for any fixed $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This, together with the convexity of the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}$, the decreasing property of $\\Phi_{h_{A}}$ and Jensen's inequality, implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& L_{\\nu}\\left(\\omega_{1} \\eta_{1}+\\omega_{2} \\eta_{2}, \\lambda\\right) \\\\\n\\leq & \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Phi_{h_{A}}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{1}}\\left(-\\theta^{\\nu}\\right)\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{2}}\\left(\\eta_{1}\\right)\\right)^{\\omega_{1}}\\left(\\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{2}}\\left(\\eta_{2}\\right)\\right)^{\\omega_{2}}, Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\right]+\\lambda \\\\\n\\leq & \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\omega_{1} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Phi_{h_{A}}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{1}}\\left(-\\theta^{\\nu}\\right) \\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{2}}\\left(\\eta_{1}\\right), Y_{\\tau}\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{Y}\\right] \\\\\n& \\quad+\\omega_{2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Phi_{h_{A}}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}} \\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{1}}\\left(-\\theta^{\\nu}\\right) \\mathcal{E}_{\\tau}^{W_{2}}\\left(\\eta_{2}\\right), Y_{\\tau}\\right) \\mid \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau}^{Y}\\right]\\right]+\\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\omega_{1} L_{\\nu}\\left(\\eta_{1}, \\lambda\\right)+\\omega_{2} L_{\\nu}\\left(\\eta_{2}, \\lambda\\right)\n$$\n\nfor any $\\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2} \\in \\mathcal{H}$ and $\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2} \\geq 0$ with $\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}=1$. Hence, for fixed $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}, L_{\\nu}(\\cdot, \\lambda)$ is a convex functional on $\\mathcal{H}$. Furthermore, one can employ similar arguments in the proof of Theorem 12.3 in Karatzas et al. (1991) to show the existence of optimal solution to dual problem (4.17) when $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ because the remaining assumptions of that theorem are fulfilled.\n\nThe next result handles the more sophisticated case when $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$. In this case, the arguments in Karatzas et al. (1991) (see, Lemma 12.6 and Theorem 12.3 of Karatzas et al. (1991)) are no longer applicable because (4.26) does not hold. In fact, $z \\mapsto \\Phi_{h_{A}}\\left(e^{z}, y\\right)$ is concave on $\\mathbb{R}$. We note that Larsen (2011) investigated this special case and established the existence of the optimal solution to the dual problem when the utility function is of form $U(x)=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha<0$, by connecting the dual problem to a fictitious market through a change-of-measure argument. The use of this change-of-measure argument is possible because their dual functional allows for the separation of the variable that needs to be optimized. In our context, however, due to the form of modified utility function $h_{A}(x, y)=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha} h(y)+\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x^{\\alpha(1-\\gamma)} A(y)$, it becomes infeasible for our dual functional to separate the variables. Nevertheless, we show below that it is not necessary to change the measure, and we can still finish the task by establishing the relationship to another artificial optimization problem.\n\nProposition 4.3 For $\\alpha \\in(-\\infty, 0)$, there exists an optimal solution to the dual problem (4.17).\nProof. We consider a fictitious risky asset $\\tilde{S}=\\left(\\tilde{S}_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ given by\n\n$$\nd \\tilde{S}_{t}=\\tilde{S}_{t} d W_{2 t}, \\quad t \\in[0, \\tau]\n$$\n\nwith $\\tilde{S}_{0}=1$, and the artificial risk-free asset with interest rate 0 . A trading strategy $\\eta=\\left(\\eta_{t}\\right)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a predictable process representing the admissible portfolio fraction invested in the risky asset $\\tilde{S}$ at time $t$.

We can then obtain the existence of optimal solution to the dual problem (4.30) by employing a similar argument as that of Proposition 4.2. In addition, following the proof of Proposition 4.1, the existence of optimizer to problem (4.30) implies the existence of optimal solution to the artificial primal problem (4.29).

To this end, we first provide a sufficient condition for the optimal solution of the unconstrained problem (4.9) such that it coincides with the optimal solution to the constrained problem (3.11).\n\nProposition 5.1 Assume that for some $v \\in \\mathcal{D},\\left(\\eta^{*}, \\lambda^{*}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{H} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}$is the optimal solution to the dual problem (4.17), and, the corresponding portfolio process $\\pi^{\\uplus}$ of the wealth process $X^{\\uplus}$ given by (4.31) satisfies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\pi_{t}^{v} \\in K, \\quad \\text { a.s. } \\\\\n& \\delta\\left(v_{t}\\right)+\\pi_{t}^{v, \\top} v_{t}=0, \\quad \\text { a.s.. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen, the wealth process $X^{\\uplus}$ is optimal for the auxiliary constrained optimization problem (3.11) in the original market $\\mathcal{M}$.

Therefore, we present here some main results on the logarithmic utility for the periodic evaluation problem without proof.\n\nConsider\n\n$$\nU(x, y):=\\log x+h(y), \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{R} \\ni y \\mapsto h(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$is a bounded continuous function such that, $m \\leq h(y) \\leq 1$ for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $m \\in(0,1)$.\n\nThe value function of the portfolio optimization problem under periodic evaluation is defined by\n\n$$\nV(x, y):=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\rho T_{i}}\\left(\\log \\frac{X_{T_{i}}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau} X_{T_{i-1}}\\right)^{\\gamma}}+h\\left(Y_{T_{i}}\\right)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{U}_{0}$ is the set of admissible portfolio processes defined by (2.6). Again, using the dynamic programming principle, we can heuristically derive that\n\n$$\nV(x, y)=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{-\\rho \\tau}\\left(\\log \\frac{X_{\\tau}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau} x\\right)^{\\gamma}}+h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\right)+e^{-\\rho \\tau} V\\left(X_{\\tau}, Y_{\\tau}\\right)\\right], \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nThanks to the structure of the logarithmic utility and the fact that it is bounded with respect to $y$, we heuristically conjecture that our value function would have the form of $V(x, y)=A^{*}(y)+$ $C^{*} \\log x$ for some continuous, bounded, and non-negative function $A^{*}(\\cdot) \\in C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ as well as some constant $C^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Substituting this form of $V$ into (7.9) and then subtract the both sides by $C^{*} \\log x$, one obtains\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA^{*}(y)=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E} & {\\left[e^{-\\rho T_{1}}\\left(\\log \\frac{X_{T_{1}}}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau} x\\right)^{\\gamma}}+h\\left(Y_{T_{1}}\\right)\\right)+e^{-\\rho T_{1}}\\left[A^{*}\\left(Y_{T_{1}}\\right)+C^{*} \\log X_{T_{1}}\\right]-C^{*} \\log x\\right] } \\\\\n=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E} & {\\left[e^{-\\rho \\tau}\\left(1+C^{*}\\right) \\log \\frac{X_{\\tau}}{x}+\\left[C^{*}\\left(e^{-\\rho \\tau}-1\\right)+(1-\\gamma) e^{-\\rho \\tau}\\right] \\log x\\right.} \\\\\n& \\left.+e^{-\\rho \\tau}\\left(h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+A^{*}\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\rho \\tau \\gamma\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy setting $C^{*}=\\frac{1-\\gamma}{e^{\\rho \\tau}-1}$ in the above equation, (7.10) can be reformulated as\n\n$$\nA^{*}(y)=\\frac{1-\\gamma e^{-\\rho \\tau}}{e^{\\rho \\tau}-1} \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(1, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log X_{\\tau}\\right]+e^{-\\rho \\tau} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+A^{*}\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\rho \\tau \\gamma\\right]\n$$\n\nHence, in the case of logarithmic utility, the characterization of $V$ now simplifies to the characterization of the unknown, non-negative, continuous, and bounded function $A^{*}(\\cdot)$. We again first solve the terminal wealth utility maximization problem in the stochastic factor model with convex trading constraints:\n\n$$\n\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log X_{\\tau}\\right], \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nWe denote the dual functional as\n\n$$\nL_{\\nu}(\\eta, \\lambda):=L_{\\nu}(\\eta, \\lambda ; x, y)=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{F}_{r}^{+}}\\left\\{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log X-\\lambda \\frac{X Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu, \\eta}}{B_{\\tau}^{\\nu}}\\right]\\right\\}+\\lambda x, \\quad(\\nu, \\eta, \\lambda) \\in \\mathcal{D} \\times \\mathcal{H} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\n$$\n\nThe dual problem associated to the primal problem (7.12) is defined by\n\n$$\n\\text { minimizing } \\quad L_{\\nu}(\\eta, \\lambda), \\quad \\text { over } \\quad(\\nu, \\eta, \\lambda) \\in \\mathcal{D} \\times \\mathcal{H} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\n$$\n\nProposition 7.2 For fixed $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, set $\\eta^{*} \\equiv 0, \\nu_{t}^{*}=\\arg \\min _{x \\in \\bar{K}}\\left\\{2 \\delta(x)+\\left\\|\\theta\\left(Y_{t}\\right)+\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.\\sigma^{-1}\\left(Y_{t}\\right) x\\right\\|^{2}\\right\\}, \\lambda^{*}=\\frac{1}{x}$ and $X^{*}:=\\frac{B_{\\tau}^{*}}{\\lambda^{*} Z_{\\tau}^{\\nu^{*}, \\eta^{*}}}$. It holds that $X^{*}$ is the optimal solution to the primal problem (7.12), and $\\left(\\nu^{*}, \\eta^{*}, \\lambda^{*}\\right)$ is the optimal solution to the dual problem (7.13). In particular, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\inf _{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{D}, \\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}, \\lambda>0} L_{\\nu}(\\eta, \\lambda)=\\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(x, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log X_{\\tau}\\right], \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nSimilar to the proof for power utility, we can also verify the existence of fixed point $A^{*}(\\cdot) \\in$ $C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ solving equation (7.11). Hence, we present the following Proposition 7.3 without proof.\n\nProposition 7.3 Define a functional $\\Psi: C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R}) \\mapsto C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$ as\n\n$$\n\\Psi(A):=\\Psi(A ; y):=\\frac{1-\\gamma e^{-\\rho \\tau}}{e^{\\rho \\tau}-1} \\sup _{X \\in \\mathcal{U}_{0}(1, y)} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log X_{\\tau}\\right]+e^{-\\rho \\tau} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)+A\\left(Y_{\\tau}\\right)-\\rho \\tau \\gamma\\right], \\quad y \\in \\mathbb{R} .(7.15)\n$$\n\nThen $\\Psi$ is a contraction on the metric space $\\left(C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R}), d\\right)$, where the metric $d$ is defined by $d(x, y):=$ $\\sup _{t \\in \\mathbb{R}}|x(t)-y(t)|, x, y \\in C_{b}^{+}(\\mathbb{R})$. Furthermore, $\\Psi$ admits a unique fixed-point $A^{*}(\\cdot)$ such that $A^{*}(y)=\\Psi\\left(A^{*} ; y\\right)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $A^{*}(\\cdot)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\frac{e^{\\rho \\tau}-\\gamma}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau}-1\\right)^{2}} \\underline{\\tau} \\tau+\\frac{(m-\\rho \\tau \\gamma) e^{-\\rho \\tau}}{1-e^{-\\rho \\tau}} \\leq A^{*}(y) \\leq \\frac{e^{\\rho \\tau}-\\gamma}{\\left(e^{\\rho \\tau}-1\\right)^{2}}\\left(\\bar{\\tau}+\\frac{M_{0}}{2}\\right) \\tau+\\frac{(1-\\rho \\tau \\gamma) e^{-\\rho \\tau}}{1-e^{-\\rho \\tau}}, \\quad y \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nWith the previous preparations, we present the next theorem without proof.\nTheorem 7.1 The value function of the problem (7.8) is given by\n\n$$\nV(x, y)=A^{*}(y)+C^{*} \\log x, \\quad(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+} \\times \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $A^{*}(\\cdot)$ is the unique fixed-point of the function $\\Psi$ defined in (7.15) and $C^{*}=\\frac{1-\\gamma}{e^{\\rho \\tau}-1}$. In addition, the optimal wealth process is given by\n\n$$\nX_{t}^{*}:=x \\frac{B_{t}^{\\nu^{*}}}{Z_{t}^{\\nu^{*}, 0}}, \\quad t \\in[0, \\infty)\n$$\n\nwhere the process $Z_{t}^{\\nu^{*}, 0}$ is given by (4.4) with $\\eta^{*} \\equiv 0$ and $\\nu_{t}^{*}:=\\arg \\min _{x \\in \\tilde{K}}\\left\\{2 \\delta(x)+\\left\\|\\theta\\left(Y_{t}\\right)+\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.\\sigma^{-1}\\left(Y_{t}\\right) x\\right\\|^{2}\\right\\}$. The optimal portfolio process satisfying the convex constraints is characterized by\n\n$$\n\\pi_{t}^{*}=\\left(\\sigma\\left(Y_{t}\\right) \\sigma^{\\top}\\left(Y_{t}\\right)\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\nu_{t}^{*}+\\mu\\left(Y_{t}\\right)-r\\left(Y_{t}\\right) \\mathbf{1}\\right), \\quad t \\in[0, \\infty)\n$$\n\nAcknowledgements: W.
