Not only are most single stock options of American style, applications to real options, i.e., the valuation of capital investments using optionpricing methods, abound. The absence of a closed-form benchmark (as the Black-Scholes formula in the European case) makes them a target for research in numerical methods. Additionally, theoretical questions on optimal stopping in nonlinear market models saw recent progress, in particular in incomplete markets.\n\nWhile the no-arbitrage principle guarantees a unique price in complete markets, in incomplete markets it provides only price bounds (super- and sub-hedging prices) that are typically very wide and do not provide a practical indication of a reasonable price. Therefore, further techniques have been developed to characterize fair and reasonable prices. One of the most prominent ones is indifferences pricing, developed first by Hodges and Neuberger [27]; see the book [9] (edited by Carmona) for a survey. The goal is to establish a threshold or reservation price, at which a potential buyer or seller is indifferent between buying the claim for this price or not buying it, while in either case allowing for continuous trading in the underlying market. Originally developed in a framework of utility maximization, it has been extended to other criteria, such as forward performance measures [38] and risk measures [4, 33]. The formulation via convex dynamic risk measures is in particular attractive, as it is not only nicely connected to the theory of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs), but relies on concepts widely used in the industry and in line with the current regulatory framework [28, Section 12].\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *R.

To capture the time evolution of risk, conditional and dynamic versions have been developed (see, e.g., Cheridito, Delbean and Kupper [10]), and a close connection to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations has been established, see, e.g., Peng [42] and Rosazza Gianin [43]. Most recently fully dynamic convex risk measures became a focus point, i.e., risk measures where both time parameters, the horizon and the evaluation time are considered dynamic, see [8] and [17]. A crucial property in this context is time consistency; it has been studied extensively, see, e.g., the overview papers by Acciaio and Penner [1] and Bielecki, Cialenco and Pitera [7] in discrete time and Rosazza Gianin and DiNunno [17] for fully time-consistent risk measures in continuous time.\n\nThe use for indifference pricing was pioneered by Xu [48] and Barrieu and El Karoui [3], generalizing earlier results by Rouge and El Karoui [44] for exponential utility which can be seen as an entropic risk measure en guise and studied systematically in a general setting by Kl\u00f6ppel and Schweizer [33] and Barrieu and El Karoui [4]. Applications to stochastic volatility models and the inverse problem of calibrating risk measures to market data has been studied in Sircar and Sturm [45] and Kumar [36], see also [21].\n\nIndifference pricing for American options appeared first in the study of transaction costs by Davis and Zariphopoulou [15], extending work by Davis, Panas and Zariphpoulou [14] for the European case. The literature encompasses $[6,13,25,35,37,38,41,47,49,50]$ who use utility functions, stochastic differential utilities and forward performance processes as criteria for indifference, we are not aware of any use of dynamic risk measures for the American case (despite the use of Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations for American options dating back to El Karoui, Pardoux and Quenez [20]). For a full discussion of the papers of indifference pricing of American options, we refer to Section 2.5.\n\nThe conceptual challenges in implementing indifference pricing stem from the fact that option buyer and seller share different perspectives and the seller's pricing consideration has to take into account the buyer's exercise decision. This calls for a careful consideration of which strategies are admissible - something that has been carefully studied in the case of finitely many payoff options by K\u00fchn [35] and whose perspective we amend with a genral counterpart. The pricing by the buyer is slightly more straightforward, however one has to carefully consider at which time one imposes indifference (at the exercise time or maturity?) and how this connects to the notion of arbitrage. In our opinion clarity is best achieved when considering a general case, where one allows buyer and seller to work in different filtrations, reflecting difference in access to market information.\n\nWe then specialize to the setting of stochastic volatility models, following the general setup of [45] and [36]. We find that the American indifference prices can be described through Backward Stochastic Differential Equations reflected at Backward Stochastic Differential equations (BSDE-R-BSDEs for short), i.e., Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (RBSDEs) for which the reflection boundary is given by a BSDE itself. This structure reflects that risk mitigation through trading in the market continues after the exercise of the option - we observe that the reflecting boundary encapsulates, in addition to the exercise value of the option, the risk of holding a zero contract from exercise time to maturity (cf. Remark 3.6). Also, in this setting, the proof of the characterization of the seller's price requires a substantial amount of work, while the characterization of the buyer's price is more straightforward. We illustrate our findings by means of a numerical example, the pricing of an American put option, for which we use deep learning methods to simulate the BSDE-R-BSDEs.\n\nNew methods on solving BSDEs and RBSDEs through deep learning have been proposed recently and show much promise. Initially, E, Han and Jentzen developed the DEEP BSDE Solver as a forward scheme [18, 26], able to tackle high dimensional problems. A global backward scheme, the Backward Deep BSDE Method was developed by Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen [46] and studied in detail by Gao, Gao, Hui and Zhu [24], who also analyze the convergence in the case of Lipschitz drivers and show how to use the scheme for Bermudan options. Hur\u00e9, Pham and Warin [30] introduced schemes based on dynamic programming, namely the Deeep Backward Dynamic Programming schemes, containing in particular one for RBSDEs on which our simulations rely. Recent overview articles on work in this general direction can be found in the papers by E, Jentzen and Han [19] as well as Chessari, Kawai, Shinozaki and Yamada [11].\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a general setup for the risk-indifference pricing of claims of American style, with minimal conditions on the risk measures involved and considering potentially different information available to buyers and sellers. Section 3 studies the risk-indifference pricing of\n\nAmerican claims in stochastic volatility models via BSDE-R-BSDEs, and Section 4 provides a numerical implementation via deep learning. Section 5 concludes by reviewing the contributions of the current work.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 Risk-indifference pricing \n\nTo elucidate the conceptual ideas at the heart of our problem, we initially consider general risk measures and American contingent claims in a general semimartinglae setup, in which the buyer and seller have access to different information represented by different filtrations. We first explain the market setup and the notion of fully dynamic risk measures, before defining the indifference prices from a buyer's and seller's perspective and showing that they are free of arbitrage. We conclude this general section by reviewing our methodology against the backdrop of the existing literature on indifference pricing of American claims..", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "### 2.1 Setup\n\nWe consider a filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{G}, \\mathbb{P})$ with complete and right-continuous filtration $\\mathbb{G}=$ $\\left(\\mathcal{G}_{t}\\right)_{0 \\leq t \\leq T}$ assuming $\\mathcal{G}_{T}=\\mathcal{F}$. We consider a financial market consisting of risky assets modeled by a $d$ dimensional $\\mathbb{G}$-continuous semimartingale $\\hat{S}$ and a riskless asset modeled by a continuous, non-decreasing $\\mathbb{G}$-adapted process $B$.\n\nTo exclude arbitrage in the sense of no free lunch with vanishing risk (see [16]), we require the existence of a probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ under which the discounted asset process $S=\\hat{S} B^{-1}$ is a local $\\mathbb{G}$-martingale. The information of the buyer of the option is given by the complete and right-continuous filtration $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy }}$, while that of the seller is $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }} ; \\mathbb{F}^{S, B} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }}, \\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy }} \\subseteq \\mathbb{G}$, where $\\mathbb{F}^{S, B}$ denotes the (augmented) natural filtration generated by risky and riskless assets. For general statements that do not require one particular filtration, we will use the generic $\\mathbb{F}$. This setup allows us to model situations where the seller and buyer rely on additional, potentially differential, private information (and randomization), while precluding arbitrage opportunities.\n\nTrading in the market is continuous and self-financing. A portfolio $\\hat{V}$ at time $t$ is given by holding $h_{t}$ shares of $\\hat{S}$ and $\\eta_{t}$ shares of $B$, hence\n\n$$\n\\hat{V}_{t}=h_{t} \\hat{S}_{t}+\\eta_{t} B_{t}\n$$\n\nfor all $t \\in[0, T]$ where $h, \\eta \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {buy/sell }}$, the set of $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy/sell }}$-predictable strategies, for the buyer (resp. seller). For the discounted portfolio dynamics $V=\\hat{V} B^{-1}$ we have therefore (starting with zero initial wealth), $V_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t} h_{s} d S_{s}$. To mark the dependence of the portfolio on the hedging strategy $h$ we will use a superscript, writing $V^{h}$. To avoid doubling strategies, we will restrict ourselves to strategies with wealth bounded from below. The set of bounded claims hedgeable at no cost from time $t$ onwards is\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}_{t, T}^{\\text {buy/sell }}:=\\left\\{V_{T}^{h}: V^{h}=\\int_{t}^{1} h_{s} d S_{s} \\geq c \\text { for some constant } c \\in \\mathbb{R}, h \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {buy/sell }}\\right\\} \\cap L^{\\infty}(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})\n$$\n\nThe goal of the paper is to determine a price for an American style contingent claim $\\hat{\\xi}$, i.e., an almost surely continuous, bounded and $\\mathbb{F}^{S, B}$-adapted process that can be exercised by the buyer at an $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy }}$-stopping time $\\tau$, paying $\\hat{\\xi}_{\\tau}$ where $\\tau$ is a stopping time either on $[0, T]$ (American style claim) or a closed countable subset of it (Bermudan style claim). We denote the set of all $\\mathbb{G}$-stopping times larger than or equal to $t$ by $\\mathcal{T}_{t, T}$ and wite $\\mathcal{T}_{t, T}^{\\text {buy/sell }}$ for the stopping times measurable with respect to the buyer's (resp. seller's) filtration. In line with the notation introduced above we write $\\xi=\\hat{\\xi} B^{-1}$ for the discounted claim.\n\nThe absence of arbitrage in the financial market consisting of $\\hat{S}$ and $B$ guarantees the existence of an arbitrage free price for the derivative $\\hat{\\xi}$. However, unless if the market is complete (i.e., the local martingale measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ is unique), the no-arbitrage principle does not provide a unique price, but rather a (practically often very large) interval of arbitrage free prices.\n\nThe current article is concerned with the choice of a reasonable price among the multitude of arbitrage free prices. Our pricing method is based on the principle of indifference, i.e., we determine the price for which the buyer (resp. seller) is indifferent between buying the option for this price (and hedging in the underlying market) or not buying the option at all (but still hedging in the market).\n\nThe indifference criterion we will use is that of indifference in risk. For that purpose we introduce the notion of fully dynamic convex risk measures (see [8]):\n\nDefinition 2.1. A family of mappings $\\rho_{s, t}: L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{s}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$, with times $s, t$ satisfying $0 \\leq$ $s \\leq t \\leq T$, is called a (strongly) time-consistent fully dynamic convex risk measure if it satisfies the following properties:\nA) Monotonicity: For all $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right), \\xi_{1} \\geq \\xi_{2} \\mathbb{P}$-a.s., and for all $s \\leq t$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right) \\leq \\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right) \\quad \\mathbb{P}-a . s\n$$\n\nB) Cash-Invariance: For all $\\xi \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right), m_{s} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{s}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$, and for all $s \\leq t$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi+m_{s}\\right)=\\rho_{s, t}(\\xi)-m_{s} \\quad \\mathbb{P}-a . s\n$$\n\nC) Convexity: For all $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right), \\lambda \\in[0,1]$, and for all $s \\leq t$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\lambda \\xi_{1}+(1-\\lambda) \\xi_{2}\\right) \\leq \\lambda \\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right)+(1-\\lambda) \\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right) \\quad \\mathbb{P}-a . s\n$$\n\nD) Time-consistency: For all $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{u}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ and $s \\leq t \\leq u$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t, u}\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right)=\\rho_{t, u}\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\rho_{s, u}\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right)=\\rho_{s, u}\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right) \\quad \\mathbb{P}-a . s\n$$\n\nThere is also a stronger form of time consistency,\nD') Strong time-consistency: For all $\\xi \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{u}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ and $s \\leq t \\leq u$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, t}\\left(-\\rho_{t, u}(\\xi)\\right)=\\rho_{s, u}(\\xi) \\quad \\mathbb{P}-a . s\n$$\n\nThis property clearly implies D), so it is a stronger assumption.\nAn important additional property that follows from this definition (see [33, Section 3]) is\nF) $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-regularity: For all $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2} \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right), A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{s}$ and $s \\leq t$,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{1} \\mathbb{1}_{A}+\\xi_{2} \\mathbb{1}_{A^{c}}\\right)=\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{1}\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{A}+\\rho_{s, t}\\left(\\xi_{2}\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{A^{c}}\n$$\n\nWe note that for a time-consistent fully dynamic convex risk measure $\\rho$, the residual risk after partial mitigation is also a time-consistent fully dynamic convex risk measure, see [33, Section 4], and we write, for the buyer's and seller's perspective respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\hat{\\rho}_{s, t}(\\zeta):=\\operatorname{essinf}_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}_{s, t}^{\\text {fuy }}} \\rho_{s, t}(\\zeta+C), & \\zeta \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right) \\\\\n\\hat{\\rho}_{s, t}(\\zeta):=\\operatorname{essinf}_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}_{s, t}^{\\text {self }}} \\rho_{s, t}(\\zeta+C), & \\zeta \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nfor the residual risk from the buyers (resp. sellers) perspective. Specifically, we do not require that the risk measures are normalized and note that even if we assume normalization of $\\rho$, i.e., $\\rho_{s, t}(0)=0$ for all $0 \\leq s \\leq t \\leq T$, this property in general does not carry over to $\\hat{\\rho}$ and $\\hat{\\rho}$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 2.2 Seller's Price \n\nWe start with the discussion of the seller's price. This is the more intricate problem as the exercise of the option is done by the buyer, not the seller. Thus, the seller has to take into account any potential exercise action by the buyer. She cannot look at indifference at the time of exercise, as this time is not known to her - it is a stopping time measurable with respect to the filtration $\\mathbb{P}^{\\text {finy }}$ but might not be measurable with respect to $\\mathbb{P}^{\\text {sell }}$. Additionally, the seller does not know the exercise time as a random variable, but only its realization along the realized path of assets. Moreover, the hedging strategy should, of course, be predictable in the appropriate filtration ( $\\mathbb{P}^{\\text {sell }}$ enlarged by the realized exercise time) to make it practically implementable. The literature contains several definitions of the seller's price which, however, fall short of these requirements (we discuss details in Section 2.5). We thus start setting up our definition from scratch:\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}$ be the set of predictable processes with respect to $\\mathbb{P}^{\\text {sell }}$, the information available to the seller. It represents the trading strategies that the seller can implement over the time interval $[0, T]$ without using the information about the actual exercise. From this set we now construct the set of all strategies that the trader can perform if they take the information of the exercise into account.\n\nDefinition 2.2. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ denote the set of possible exercise times of the option, which can either be $[0, T]$ or a closed countable subset of $[0, T]$. We define\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}:=\\left\\{H: \\mathcal{I} \\times[0, T] \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}: \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{I}, H(t, \\cdot, \\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }} \\text { and } H\\left(t_{1}, s, \\cdot\\right)=H\\left(t_{2}, s, \\cdot\\right) \\text { for } s \\leq t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, if $\\mathcal{I}=[0, T]$, then all $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ must be right-continuous in the first variable, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{u \\downarrow t} H(u, \\cdot, \\cdot)=H(t, \\cdot, \\cdot)\n$$\n\nGiven any choice of strategy, $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$, we will denote by $h^{\\tau}$ the strategy followed when $\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}_{0, T}$ is the exercise time, in other words,\n\n$$\nh_{t}^{\\tau}(\\omega):=H(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega) \\quad \\text { for } 0 \\leq t \\leq T, \\omega \\in \\Omega\n$$\n\nObserve that, by definition, the strategies in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ have the following \"non-anticipativity\" property. For any $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ and $\\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2} \\in \\mathcal{T}_{0, T}$,\n\n$$\nH\\left(\\tau_{1}(\\omega), s, \\omega\\right)=H\\left(\\tau_{2}(\\omega), s, \\omega\\right), \\text { for } s \\leq \\tau_{1}(\\omega) \\wedge \\tau_{2}(\\omega)\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, we get\n\n$$\nh_{t}^{\\tau}(\\omega)=H(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)=H(T, t, \\omega) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega) \\geq t\\}}+H(\\tau(\\omega) \\wedge t, t, \\omega) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t\\}}\n$$\n\nfor any $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$. This decomposition implies that $h^{\\tau}$ is a predictable process with respect to the filtration $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}, \\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}=\\bigcap_{\\varepsilon>0} \\mathcal{K}_{t+\\varepsilon}, \\mathcal{K}_{t}=\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\text {sell }} \\vee \\sigma(\\tau \\wedge t)$, see [40, Section 9].\n\nProposition 2.3. The process $h^{\\tau}$ is $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable.\nProof. By definition, $H(T, \\cdot, \\cdot)$ is $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }}$-predictable, and using (2) we can write\n\n$$\nh_{t}^{\\tau}(\\omega)=H(T, t, \\omega)+(H(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)-H(T, t, \\omega)) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t\\}}\n$$\n\nso it remains to show that\n\n$$\nI_{t}:=(H(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)-H(T, t, \\omega)) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t\\}}\n$$\n\nis $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable. We prove this by approximating $I_{t}$ by a sequence of $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable processes as follows.\n\nDefine a sequence of stopping times $\\tau_{n}$ by setting $\\tau_{n}(\\omega)=s_{k}^{n}:=\\sup \\left\\{s \\in \\mathcal{I}: s<(k+1) 2^{-n} \\wedge T\\right\\}$ if $k 2^{-n} \\leq \\tau(\\omega)<(k+1) 2^{-n}$, for $k=0, \\ldots,\\left\\lfloor 2^{n} T\\right\\rfloor$. Then $\\tau_{n}$ are $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy }}$-stopping times taking finitely many values with $\\tau_{n} \\downarrow \\tau$. Define moreover\n\n$$\nI_{t}^{(n)}:=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\left\\lfloor 2^{n} T\\right\\rfloor} \\tilde{H}\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)=s_{k}^{n}\\right\\}} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{H}\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right)=H\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right)-H(T, t, \\omega)$ and observe that $I_{t}^{(n)}$ is a sum of $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable processes: By definition of $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}, \\tilde{H}\\left(s_{k}^{n}, t, \\omega\\right)$ is an $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }}$-predictable process (and hence $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable) for each $k$. Moreover, for each $k$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)=s_{k}^{n}\\right\\}} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}}=\\mathbb{1}_{A_{k}^{(n)}}(t, \\omega)\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{k}^{(n)}:=\\left(s_{k}^{n}, T\\right] \\times\\left\\{\\tau_{n}=s_{k}^{n}\\right\\} \\subset[0, T] \\times \\Omega$ is a set in the predictable $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}\\right)$ with respect to the filtration $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$, as $\\left\\{\\tau_{n}=s_{k}^{n}\\right\\}=\\left\\{k 2^{-n} \\leq \\tau(\\omega) \\wedge s_{k}^{n}<s_{k}^{n}\\right\\}$ is $\\sigma\\left(\\tau \\wedge s_{k}^{n}\\right)$ measurable and hence $\\mathbb{F}_{s_{k}^{n}}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$ measurable.\n\nFor each $(t, \\omega) \\in[0, T] \\times \\Omega$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_{t}(\\omega)-I_{t}^{(n)}(\\omega)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor 2^{n} T\\rfloor}\\left[\\tilde{H}(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega) \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t\\}}-\\tilde{H}\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}}\\right] \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{k 2^{-n} \\leq \\tau(\\omega)<(k+1) 2^{-n} \\wedge T\\right\\}} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor 2^{n} T\\rfloor}\\left[\\tilde{H}(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t \\leq \\tau_{n}(\\omega)\\}}+\\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}}\\right)-\\tilde{H}\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}}\\right] \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{k 2^{-n} \\leq \\tau(\\omega)<(k+1) 2^{-n} \\wedge T\\right\\}} \\\\\n= & \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor 2^{n} T\\rfloor}\\left(\\tilde{H}(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)-\\tilde{H}\\left(\\tau_{n}(\\omega), t, \\omega\\right)\\right) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{n}(\\omega)<t\\right\\}} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{k 2^{-n} \\leq \\tau(\\omega)<(k+1) 2^{-n} \\wedge T\\right\\}}+\\tilde{H}(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega) \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau(\\omega)<t \\leq \\tau_{n}(\\omega)\\right\\}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $I_{t}(\\omega)$ is the pointwise limit of $I_{t}^{(n)}(\\omega)$ for each $(t, \\omega)$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, since $\\tau_{n}(\\omega) \\downarrow \\tau(\\omega)$ and by rightcontinuity of $s \\mapsto H(s, t, \\omega)$.\n\nNote that while all process in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ are $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable, not all $\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }, \\tau}$-predictable processes are contained in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$. Specifically, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ contains only the processes that are depending on the realization of the stopping time, not on the random variable itself.\n\nBased on this clarification on the informational structure of the problem, we turn our attention to the seller's risk-indifference price for an American put. Here, the relevant set of hedging strategies in this case is $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ as the seller has no prior knowledge of the exercise time of the put; she can only choose from hedging strategies that get updated after the exercise time is observed, thus $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ is the set of strategies that is relevant. For any choice of strategy $H \\in \\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$, the seller will follow the strategy $H(T, t, \\omega)$ until $\\tau(\\omega)$, and after $\\tau(\\omega)$, she switches to the strategy $H(\\tau(\\omega), t, \\omega)$ which is $\\tau(\\omega)$ dependent. We emphasize that this strategy $h^{\\tau}(\\omega)$ is only $\\tau(\\omega)$ dependent and not $\\tau$ dependent.

Based on early results on European options in [14], Davis and Zariphopolou [15] explore utility indifference pricing in the presence of transaction costs, studying the singular control problem. This line of research has been deepened by Damgaard [13] and Zakamouline [50] who investigate the problem numerically for hyperbolic resp. constant absolute risk aversion, the latter adding the study of the seller's price. While all these papers assume asset prices given by geometric Brownian motion, Cosso, Marazzina and Sgarra [12] extend the buyer's side results to stochastic volatility. Oberman and Zariphopoulou, [41] use the indifference pricing methodology to price options on nontraded assets with dynamics correlated to traded assets from a buyer's perspective, using exponential utility in a geometric Brownian motion setting. An application to a regime switching model under expected utility indifference from the buyer's side of view is given by Gyulov and Koleva in [25].\n\nWu and Dai [47] consider the indifference price of an American claim from a seller's point of view in a jump diffusion model under exponential utility. Bayraktar and Zhou [6] consider indifference pricing of American options on defaultable claims under exponential utility, for both buyer and seller. And K\u00fchn [35] considers the problem of an option seller with a finite number of choices (such as Bermudan options) for general utility functions.\n\nTwo papers extend the problem to time dependent utilities. Leung, Sircar and Zariphopoulou [38] consider forward performance measures and consider the buyer's indifference price in a stochastic volatility\n\nmarket, contrasting it to previous results for exponential utility in [37]. Yan, Liang and Yang extend the indifference pricing setup in [49] to time dependent, additive stochastic differential utilities and optimal investment and consumption for an investor facing uncertainty about the risk-neutral probability measure. They discuss both seller's and buyer's perspectives.\n\nWe want to compare in particular the different notions of indifference price used. All papers, even those who consider both buyer's and seller's price, work with a single filtration setup. For the buyer's price, the papers $[15,13,50,41,37,38,25]$ use some form of (backward) stepwise maximization of strategies, after the exercise and before it, which is inspired from the Bellman principle in dynamic programming, solving the Merton problem from the exercise time onwards.\n\nThe definition of the buyer's and seller's price in [6] compares the expected utility of the hedged payoff for a given price at the time of the exercise with the utility of doing no investment at all. This notion strangely mixes notions of certainty equivalent and indifference price. But even if we adapt this notion in a way to compare buyer's risk at the time of exercise (determined to be risk-minimizing) and put necessary conditions that a minimal minimizing stopping time exists, this notion is in general not free of arbitrage. For the seller's price this approach is not even possible, as the potential exercise time is not known to the seller (only to the buyer).\n\nFor the seller's price the precise conditions on the admissibility of strategies are rarely fleshed out and most papers are cavalier about it. Zakamouline [50] uses an analogous version to the buyer's formulation, but assumes that the seller knows the optimal strategy of the buyer. K\u00fchn [35] alone gives a careful discussion and a precise definition, albeit only for the discrete case with finitely many payoff options. Our definition is essentially a generalization of this framework to the general case. Note that a similar formulation of nonanticipativity was given in [5] in the context of superhedging under model uncertainty. However, contrary to $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text {sell }}^{\\prime}$ in (1) they consider not only the realization of the stopping times, but the stopping times (as random variables) themselves. As the option seller has only information on the actual exercise of the option, not hypothetical different asset price and exercise scenarios, we insist that the formulation should depend only on the realization of the stopping time, a point that K\u00fchn rightfully highlights in [35, Remark 2.3]. (A further slight difference is that we use $s \\leq t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}$ instead of $s<t_{1} \\wedge t_{2}$ which assures $h^{r}$ to be a predictable process with respect to $\\mathbb{F}^{r, \\text { sell. }}$ )\n\nFinally, the forward performance formulation in [38] and the stochastic differential utility in [49] are due to their recursive nature independent of the time horizon, avoiding in this way the intricacies of the dependence on the horizon of the indifference.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 3 Stochastic Volatility Models \\& BDSE-R-BSDEs \n\nWe now turn our attention to a class of specific models to provide explicit representations of risk-indifference prices, following mainly the setup of [45]. Specifically, we assume that the risk-free asset has a constant interest rate and thus $d B_{t}=r B_{t} d t, B_{0}=1$. The price of the discounted risky asset is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& d S_{t}=\\left(\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)-r\\right) S_{t} d t+\\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right) S_{t} d W_{1, t}, \\quad S_{0}=s \\\\\n& d V_{t}=m\\left(V_{t}\\right) d t+a\\left(V_{t}\\right) d W_{2, t}, \\quad V_{0}=v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith correlated Brownian motions $W_{1}, W_{2}$ with constant correlation $\\rho$. These models are very popular among practitioners and are usually called stochastic volatility models. We will assume that the SDE for $V$ admits a pathwise unique (weak) solution (e.g., by assuming the Yamada-Watanabe conditions that $m$ is Lipschitz and $\\sigma$ H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent $\\beta \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ and of at most linear growth), $\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)$ and $\\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right)$ do not explode and $\\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right)$ is nonnegative, hitting zero with probability zero and satisfying $\\int_{0}^{T}\\left|\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)\\right| d t<\\infty$, $\\int_{0}^{T} \\sigma^{2}\\left(V_{t}\\right) d t<\\infty$ a.s. To assure the existence of an equivalent local martingale measure via Girsanov transform, we assume that the Dol\u00e9ans exponential $\\mathcal{E}\\left(-\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda\\left(V_{s}\\right) d W_{1, s}\\right)_{t}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale for the Sharpe ratio $\\lambda\\left(V_{t}\\right)=\\frac{\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)-r}{\\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right)}$ (e.g., by enforcing the Novikov condition $\\left.\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\lambda^{2}\\left(V_{s}\\right) d s\\right)\\right]<\\infty\\right)$. Moreover, we assume that both seller and buyer have no further information besides the asset prices, hence $\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {buy }}=\\mathbb{F}^{\\text {sell }}=\\mathbb{F}^{S, B}$. So, the (discounted) American claim $\\xi$ is given by an almost surely continuous, bounded and $\\mathbb{F}$-adapted process.\n\nWe consider risk measures specified via solutions of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). It is well-known (e.g., [4]) that if $g: \\Omega \\times[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a function satisfying certain properties (e.g., convexity on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ ), then $g$ (called a driver) gives rise to a fully dynamic, strongly time-consistent monetary convex risk measure as the first component of the solution $\\left(R, Z_{1}, Z_{2}\\right)$ to the BSDE given by\n\n$$\nR_{t}=-\\zeta-\\int_{t}^{u} g\\left(s, Z_{1, s}, Z_{2, s}\\right) d t-\\int_{t}^{u} Z_{1, s} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{t}^{u} Z_{2, s} d W_{2, t}\n$$\n\nI.e., the time $t$ risk of a $\\mathcal{F}_{u}$ measurable claim $\\zeta$ at time horizon $u$ is given by $\\rho_{t, u}(\\zeta):=R_{t}$. For our purpose, we will assume that $g$ is just a function of $Z_{1}, Z_{2}$. What we are mostly interested in is not the risk itself, but the residual risk when we use hedging in the market to (partially) mitigate risk. For this purpose, we have to be a bit more restrictive.\n\nDefinition 3.1. A driver $g: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is called strictly quadratic with derivatives of (at most) linear growth if it satisfies\n\n1. $g \\in C^{2,1}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$;\n2. $g_{z_{1} z_{1}}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)>0$ for all $z_{1}, z_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$;\n3. there exists constants $c_{1}, c_{2}>0$ such that\n\n$$\nc_{1}\\left(\\frac{z_{1}^{2}}{4 c_{1}^{2}}-\\left(1+z_{2}^{2}\\right)\\right) \\leq g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right) \\leq c_{2}\\left(1+z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n4. there exists a constant $c_{3}>0$ such that $\\frac{1}{c_{3}}\\left(\\left|z_{1}\\right|-c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)\\right) \\leq\\left|g_{z_{1}}\\right| \\leq c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{1}\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)$;\n5. there exists a constant $c_{4}>0$ such that $\\left|g_{z_{2}}\\right| \\leq c_{4}\\left(1+\\left|z_{1}\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)$.\n\nNote that this notion is (slightly) more restrictive then the concept used in [45], relying only on conditions 1-3. In the American case we need the additional conditions as we rely, in the proof of the following theorem, on a comparison theorem for RBSDES (specifically [34, Proposition 3.2]) that requires them (cf. also [39] for a possible slight generalization). Hedging the risk is related to solving a BSDE with driver $g^{*}\\left(-\\lambda, z_{2}\\right)+\\lambda z_{1}$, where the principal part stems from a partial Fenchel-Legendre transform in the component that represents the tradeable instruments.\n\nDefinition 3.2. The risk-adjusted driver $g^{*}: \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as the partial Fenchel conjugate of $g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$ in $z_{1}$, i.e., $g^{*}\\left(\\zeta, z_{2}\\right):=\\sup _{z_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\left\\{\\zeta z_{1}-g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)\\right\\}$.\n\nProposition 3.3. If $g$ is a strictly quadratic driver with derivatives of linear growth, then $g^{*}$ is also a strictly quadratic driver with derivatives of linear growth.\n\nProof. That a strictly quadratic driver $g$ results in a risk-adjusted driver $g^{*}$ which is also strictly quadratic follows Lemma 2.5 of [45]. It remains to be shown that the risk-adjusted driver $g^{*}$ satisfies conditions 4 and 5 of Definition 3.1 if $g$ does.\n\nSuppose condition 4 holds for $g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$. Let $g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$ denote the partial inverse of $g_{z_{1}}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$ in $z_{1}$. Through the simple variable change $z_{1}=g_{z_{1}}^{* 1}\\left(y, z_{2}\\right)$, the inequality $\\frac{1}{c_{3}}\\left(\\left|z_{1}\\right|-c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)\\right) \\leq\\left|g_{z_{1}}\\right|$ implies $\\left|g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\right| \\leq c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{1}\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)$, while the inequality $\\left|g_{z_{1}}\\right| \\leq c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{1}\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)$ implies $\\frac{1}{c_{3}}\\left(\\left|z_{1}\\right|-c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)\\right) \\leq\\left|g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\right|$, giving\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c_{3}}\\left(\\left|z_{1}\\right|-c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)\\right) \\leq\\left|g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\right| \\leq c_{3}\\left(1+\\left|z_{1}\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nThe desired inequality follows by noting $g_{z_{1}}^{-1}=g_{z_{1}}^{*}$.\nNext we suppose conditions 4 and 5 both hold for $g\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)$. Employing the same variable change as in the argument involving condition 4 above, it follows from condition 5 that $\\left|g_{z_{2}}\\left(g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right), z_{2}\\right)\\right| \\leq c_{4}(1+$ $\\left.\\left|g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)\\right|+\\left|z_{2}\\right|\\right)$. The result then follows from observing that $g_{z_{2}}^{*}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right)=-g_{z_{2}}\\left(g_{z_{1}}^{-1}\\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\\right), z_{2}\\right)$, and noting the upper bound obtained on $g_{z_{1}}^{*}=g_{z_{1}}^{-1}$ in (3).\n\nBefore proving the main theorem, we want to recall a property of risk measures defined by Brownian BSDEs.\n\nLemma 3.4. In the BSDE setting, the strong time-consistency property holds for intermediate stopping times. Specifically, for all $\\xi \\in L^{\\infty}\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{u}, \\mathbb{P}\\right), s \\leq u$, and $\\tau \\in[s, u]$ an $\\mathbb{F}$-stopping time,\n\n$$\n\\rho_{s, \\tau}\\left(-\\rho_{\\tau, u}(\\xi)\\right)=\\rho_{s, u}(\\xi)\n$$\n\nProof. This follows from [4, Theorem 3.21].\nTheorem 3.5.

Using the strong time-consistency of Lemma 3.4 and cash-invariance properties of risk measures, we can express the hedged risk of the American payoff $\\zeta$ at stopping time $\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}_{t, T}$ as\n\n$$\n\\rho_{t, T}\\left(\\int_{t}^{T} h_{s}^{\\tau} d S_{s}-\\zeta_{\\tau}\\right)=\\rho_{t, \\tau}\\left(\\int_{t}^{\\tau} H(T, s) d S_{s}-\\zeta_{\\tau}-\\rho_{\\tau, T}\\left(\\int_{\\tau}^{T} H(\\tau, s) d S_{s}\\right)\\right)=\\rho_{t, \\tau}\\left(-U_{\\tau}^{t, H}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nU_{u}^{t, H}:=\\zeta_{u}-\\int_{t}^{u} H(T, s) d S_{s}+\\rho_{u, T}\\left(\\int_{u}^{T} H(u, s) d S_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $u \\in[t, T]$. Denote the supremum over all stopping times by\n\n$$\nR_{t}^{t, H}:=\\underset{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}_{t, T}}{\\operatorname{esssup}} \\rho_{t, \\tau}\\left(-U_{\\tau}^{t, H}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy [34, Proposition 3.1] we can represent $R_{u}^{t, H}=\\operatorname{esssup}_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}_{u, T}} \\rho_{t, \\tau}\\left(-U_{\\tau}^{t, H}\\right)$, for $t \\leq u \\leq T$, as the first component of the (unique) solution of the RBSDE\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{u}^{t, H}=U_{T}^{t, H}+\\int_{u}^{T} g\\left(Z_{1, s}^{t, H}, Z_{2, s}^{t, H}\\right) d s+K_{T}^{t, H}-K_{u}^{t, H}-\\int_{u}^{T} Z_{1, s}^{t, H} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} Z_{2, s}^{t, H} d W_{2, s} \\\\\n& R_{u}^{t, H} \\geq U_{u}^{t, H}, \\quad \\int_{t}^{T}\\left(R_{r}^{t, H}-U_{r}^{t, H}\\right) d K_{r}^{t, H}=0, \\quad t \\leq u \\leq T\n\\end{aligned}\\right.\n$$\n\nNext, we have to consider $\\operatorname{essinf}_{H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}} R_{t}^{t, H}$. To do so, we first develop an alternative representation for the maximal risk. Define\n\n$$\n\\bar{R}_{u}^{H}:=R_{u}^{t, H}+\\int_{t}^{u} H(T, s) d S_{s}\n$$\n\nand note that it is the first component of the unique solution $\\left(\\bar{R}_{u}^{H}, \\bar{Z}_{s}^{H, 1}, \\bar{Z}_{s}^{H, 2}, \\bar{K}_{u}^{H}\\right)$ to the RBSDE\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\bar{R}_{u}^{H}=\\zeta_{T}-\\int_{u}^{T} H(T, s) d S_{s}+\\int_{u}^{T} g\\left(\\bar{Z}_{1, s}^{H}, \\bar{Z}_{2, s}^{H}\\right) d s+\\bar{K}_{T}^{H}-\\bar{K}_{u}^{H}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{1, s}^{H} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{2, s}^{H} d W_{2, s} \\\\\n\\bar{R}_{u}^{H} \\geq \\bar{U}_{u}^{H}, \\quad \\int_{t}^{T}\\left(\\bar{R}_{r}^{H}-\\bar{U}_{r}^{H}\\right) d \\bar{K}_{r}^{H}=0, \\quad \\text { for } t \\leq u \\leq T\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\tilde{U}_{u}^{H}:=U_{u}^{t, H}+\\int_{t}^{u} H(T, s) d S_{s}=\\zeta_{u}+\\rho_{u, T}\\left(\\int_{u}^{T} H(u, s) d S_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor $u \\in[0, T]$. Observe that at time $u=t, \\tilde{R}_{t}^{H}=R_{t}^{t, H}$, and so we proceed to find a BSDE expression for $\\operatorname{essinf}_{H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}} \\tilde{R}_{t}^{H}$.\n\nThe reason for this alternative representation for the maximal risk, $\\tilde{R}^{H}$, instead of $R^{t, H}$, now becomes clear: for each $H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$, the BSDE dynamics for $\\tilde{R}^{H}$ depends only on the strategy $H(T, \\cdot)$ and its reflection barrier $\\tilde{U}_{u}^{H}$ depends only on $H(u, \\cdot), u \\in[t, T)$. We can exploit this to separate the infima as follows:\n\n$$\n\\underset{H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}=\\underset{H(T, \\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\underset{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{H}^{H(T, \\cdot)}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\nu}\n$$\n\n(while maintaining the right-continuity property of $H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}$ in the first variable), where $\\mathcal{H}^{H(T, \\cdot)}:=\\left\\{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}\\right.$ : $\\left.\\nu(T, \\cdot)=H(T, \\cdot)\\right\\}$.\n\nWe first find an RBSDE representation for $\\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}:=\\operatorname{essinf}_{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{H}^{H(T, \\cdot)}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\nu}$. To this end, let us define for $u \\in[t, T)$,\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\zeta}_{u}:=\\underset{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{H}^{H(T, \\cdot)}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{U}_{u}^{\\nu}=\\underset{\\nu(u, \\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{U}_{u}^{\\nu}=\\zeta_{u}+\\bar{\\rho}_{u, T}(0)\n$$\n\nand let $Y_{s}:=\\bar{\\rho}_{s, T}(0)$. Then from [45, Proposition 2.7], we have that $\\left(Y, Z_{1}, Z_{2}\\right)$ is the unique solution to the BSDE with terminal condition $\\zeta_{u}$ and driver\n\n$$\n\\inf _{\\nu \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\left(-\\nu\\left(\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)-r\\right)+g\\left(z_{1}-\\nu \\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right), z_{2}\\right)\\right)=g^{*}\\left(-\\lambda_{t}, z_{2}\\right)-z_{1} \\lambda_{t}\n$$\n\nwith Sharpe ratio $\\lambda_{t}=\\frac{\\mu\\left(V_{t}\\right)-r}{\\sigma\\left(V_{t}\\right)}$. Thus,\n\n$$\nY_{u}=0-\\int_{u}^{T}\\left(g^{*}\\left(-\\lambda_{s}, \\bar{Z}_{2, s}\\right)+\\lambda_{s} \\bar{Z}_{1, s}\\right) d s-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{1, s} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{2, s} d W_{2, s}\n$$\n\nFollowing the arguments of [33, Theorem 7.17] we see that the infimum in (5) is attained and the minimizing strategy is independent of $u$. By the comparison principle for quadratic RBSDEs ([34, Proposition 3.2]), we get that $\\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}=\\operatorname{essinf}_{\\nu \\in \\mathcal{H}^{H(T, \\cdot)}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\nu}$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}=\\zeta_{T}-\\int_{u}^{T} H(T, s) d S_{s}+\\int_{u}^{T} g\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{1, s}^{H}, \\tilde{Z}_{2, s}^{H}\\right) d s+\\tilde{K}_{t, T}^{H}-\\tilde{K}_{u}^{H}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\tilde{Z}_{1, s}^{H} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\tilde{Z}_{2, s}^{H} d W_{2, s} \\\\\n\\tilde{R}_{u}^{H} \\geq \\zeta_{u}+Y_{u}, \\quad \\int_{t}^{T}\\left(\\tilde{R}_{t}^{H}-\\left(\\zeta_{r}+Y_{r}\\right)\\right) d \\tilde{K}_{r}^{H}=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFinally, we take $\\operatorname{essinf}_{H(T, \\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}$, and, following the arguments of [33, Theorem 7.17], get that\n\n$$\n\\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\zeta}:=\\underset{H(T, \\cdot) \\in \\mathcal{H}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{R}_{u}^{H}=\\underset{H \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\prime}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\tilde{R}_{t}^{H}=\\underset{H \\in \\mathcal{H}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} R_{t}^{t, H}=\\underset{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}_{t, T}}{\\operatorname{essinf}} \\rho_{t, T}\\left(\\int_{t}^{T} h_{s}^{\\tau} d S_{s}-\\zeta_{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nhas the representation given in the statement of the theorem. This concludes the proof.\nRemark 3.6. We want to stress that the term $\\zeta+Y, \\zeta_{u}+Y_{u}=\\zeta_{u}+\\bar{\\rho}_{u, T}(0)$, appearing as reflection boundary has a clear economic interpretation: One has to adapt the naive exercise boundary $\\zeta$ by adding the (hedged) risk of the zero contract. Equivalently, as $\\zeta_{u}+\\bar{\\rho}_{u, T}(0)=\\bar{\\rho}_{u, T}\\left(-\\zeta_{u}\\right)$, one has to take the risk of the payment at the time of the exercise into account, however allowing risk mitigation through trading until maturity.\n\nAnalogously, but much easier, we can derive a RBSDE representation for the buyer's indifference price.\nTheorem 3.7. The buyer's indifference price (B) can be represented as\n\n$$\nP_{t}^{\\text {buy }}=\\tilde{R}_{t}^{\\xi}-\\tilde{R}_{t}^{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(\\tilde{R}^{\\zeta}, \\bar{Z}_{1}, \\bar{Z}_{2}, \\tilde{K}, Y, \\bar{Z}_{1}, \\bar{Z}_{2}\\right)$ is the unique solution to the BSDE-R-BSDE\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\zeta}=Y_{T}+\\int_{u}^{T}\\left(g^{*}\\left(-\\lambda_{s},-\\bar{Z}_{2, s}\\right)-\\lambda_{s} \\tilde{Z}_{1, s}\\right) d s+\\tilde{K}_{T}-\\tilde{K}_{u}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\tilde{Z}_{1, s} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{2, s} d W_{2, s} \\\\\nY_{u}=0+\\int_{u}^{T}\\left(g^{*}\\left(-\\lambda_{s},-\\bar{Z}_{2, s}\\right)-\\lambda_{s} \\bar{Z}_{1, s}\\right) d s-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{1, s} d W_{1, s}-\\int_{u}^{T} \\bar{Z}_{2, s} d W_{2, s} \\\\\n\\tilde{R}_{u}^{\\zeta} \\geq \\zeta_{u}+Y_{u} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad \\int_{t}^{T}\\left(\\tilde{R}_{t}^{\\zeta}-\\left(\\zeta_{r}+Y_{r}\\right)\\right) d \\tilde{K}_{r}^{H}=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwith $\\zeta=\\xi$ resp. $\\zeta=0$.\n\nProof.

The current paper explains how this can be done for American-style claims using residual risk after hedging as indifference price mechanism, a choice that is driven by both, the availability of a comprehensive mathematical framework (risk measures and BSDEs) as well as the prevalence of risk measures in industrial practice (as compared to utility-based concepts).\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is twofold: On the one hand we provide a general and detailed setup for risk-indifference pricing of American style contingent claims; on the other hand we show how in the case of market incompleteness due to stochastic volatility, the risk-indifference price can be expressed through BSDE-R-BSDEs, backward stochastic differential equations in which the reflection boundary is given itself by a backward stochastic differential equation, reflecting the risk of the position between exercise and maturity. As an add-on, we show how the arising BSDE-R-BSDEs can be solved numerically using deep learning methods and illustrate this on a specific example.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "## References\n\n[1] Beatrice Acciaio and Irina Penner.

We provide a\ngeneral definition of risk-indifference prices for buyers and sellers in\ncontinuous time, in a setting where buyer and seller have potentially different\ninformation, and show that these definitions are consistent with no-arbitrage\nprinciples. Specifying to stochastic volatility models, we characterize\nindifference prices via solutions of Backward Stochastic Differential Equations\nreflected at Backward Stochastic Differential Equations and show that this\ncharacterization provides a basis for the implementation of numerical methods\nusing deep learning.", "updated": "2024-08-26T20:35:27Z", "published": "2024-08-26T20:35:27Z"}
