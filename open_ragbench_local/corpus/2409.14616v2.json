However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBFbased controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discretetime nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-R\u00e9nyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of ICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing performance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both fixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios across safety and performance metrics.

      "text": "## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nSafety-critical optimal control is one of the fundamental challenges in robotics, e.g., robots need to navigate safely around obstacles while optimizing various criteria such as energy consumption. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed as a tool to encode safety for nonlinear systems and applied to high-level planning and multi-agent systems [1]-[9]. High Order CBFs extend this concept to systems with constraints of higher relative degree with respect to the system dynamics [10]-[13]. However, a significant challenge lies in finding valid CBFs under input constraints [14]. Functions that do not provide persistent safety and feasibility guarantees are often referred to as candidate CBFs [15].\n\nResearch in this field has taken three main directions. The first focuses on synthesizing CBFs directly [15]-[18], while the second learns CBFs through function approximation [19]-[24]. Another stream of research concentrates on tuning\n\n[^0]the class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters of CBFs. Many existing works verify and optimize CBF parameters offline and fix them during deployment [14], [25], [26]. However, these fixed parameters may lead to overly conservative motions in new or changing environments. While several works introduce adaptive CBFs [27]-[30], they address dynamics model uncertainty rather than safety and performance.\n\nRecent efforts in the third category have focused on adapting CBFs' class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters online [31]. Some approaches [32], [33] optimize decay rates of CBF constraints to guarantee point-wise feasibility, but fall short of guaranteeing safety. More recently, learning-based methods have become increasingly popular. However, their safety guarantees rely on unrealistic assumptions such as unbounded control inputs [34] or perfect learned models [35], [36].\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose a learning-based framework for online adaptation of CBF class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters in input-constrained systems. We leverage a probabilistic ensemble neural network (PENN) to predict the safety and performance characteristics of potential parameter configurations while considering both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The parameters are dynamically adapted based on the current system state and nearby environmental configurations, simultaneously ensuring safety and optimizing performance for navigation tasks. We quantify epistemic uncertainty, which originates from insufficient training data, using Jensen-R\u00e9nyi Divergence, discarding predictions with low confidence. To account for aleatoric uncertainty, arising from sources such as data ambiguity and measurement noise, we model predicted outputs as distributions. We then employ distributionally robust Conditional Value at Risk to assess the risk associated with these predictions.\n\nWe highlight the key contributions of this paper, which differentiate our approach from existing methods:\n\n- We introduce a formal definition of discrete-time Input Constrained CBFs (ICCBFs), specifically parameterized by class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions.\n- We propose a verification process for using a PENN model to predict the class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions of interest, ensuring robustness to both types of uncertainties.\n- We develop an online adaptive MPC-ICCBF framework under input constraints, dynamically adapting class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions to simultaneously ensure safety and optimize performance.",

The function $f: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is assumed to be locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to both $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{t}$.\nDefinition 1 (Discrete-Time CBF [37]). Let $\\mathcal{S}=\\{\\boldsymbol{x} \\in$ $\\mathcal{X} \\mid h(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\geq 0\\}$, where $h: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function. The function $h$ is a discrete-time CBF for System (1) if there exists a class $\\mathcal{K}$ function $\\alpha(\\cdot)$ satisfying $\\alpha(z)<z$ for all $z>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha\\left(h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\right)\\right) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{X}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t}\\right)=h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}\\right)-h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\right)$.\nLemma 1.

The proof can be found in [38, Theorem 1].\n\nThe discrete-time CBF condition ensures that the system state remains within the safe set $\\mathcal{S}$ for all future time steps, provided that the initial state lies within $\\mathcal{S}$.\nRemark 1. The class $\\mathcal{K}$ function $\\alpha$ can be chosen as a linear function with coefficient $\\gamma \\in(0,1)$.

      "text": "## A. Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions\n\nThe concept of CBFs has been generalized to HOCBFs in both continuous-time [11] and discrete time [39] settings, which can be used for constraints of high relative degree. ICCBFs [14] further generalize HOCBFs, allowing for constraints of higher relative degrees and non-uniform relative degrees for control inputs.\n\nMore importantly, the ICCBF structure explicitly addresses the problem of generating CBFs under input constraints, i.e., $\\mathcal{U} \\neq \\mathbb{R}^{m}$. Concretely, suppose that the safe set $\\mathcal{S}$ defined by $h$ cannot be rendered forward invariant by any feedback control input $\\boldsymbol{u} \\in K_{\\mathrm{cbf}}(\\boldsymbol{x})$, since there exist some states where it requires $\\boldsymbol{u} \\notin \\mathcal{U}$ to render safe.\n\nUsing the same function $h$ in Definition 1, we define a series of functions $b_{i}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, i=0, \\ldots, r$, as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) & :=h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\right) \\\\\nb_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) & :=\\inf _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta b_{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha_{0}\\left(b_{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\nb_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) & :=\\inf _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta b_{r-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha_{r-1}\\left(b_{r-1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\left\\{\\alpha_{0}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{r}\\right\\}$ is a set of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions with $\\alpha_{i}:[0, a) \\rightarrow[0, \\infty)$ satisfying $\\alpha_{i}(z)<z$ for $i=0, \\ldots, r$ and all $z>0$, and $\\Delta b_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)=b_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)-b_{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)$. We also define a series of sets $\\mathcal{C}_{i}$ associated with these functions as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{C}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) & :=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{X}: b_{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) \\geq 0\\right\\}=\\mathcal{S} \\\\\n\\mathcal{C}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) & :=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{X}: b_{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) \\geq 0\\right\\} \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathcal{C}_{r}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) & :=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{X}: b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) \\geq 0\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDefinition 2 (Inner Safe Set). A non-empty closed set $\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ is an inner safe set for System (1) defined as [14]:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}):=\\bigcap_{i=0}^{r} \\mathcal{C}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\n$$\n\nand it is dependent on the class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\nDefinition 3 (Discrete-Time ICCBF). The function $b_{r}$ is a discrete-time ICCBF on $\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ for System (1) if there exist class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\left\\{\\alpha_{0}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{r}\\right\\}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha_{r}\\left(b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall \\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})\n$$\n\nNote, the definition does not require condition (6) to hold for $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{r}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$, instead, for a subset $\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{r}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$.\nRemark 2. One can observe that the validity of the ICCBF function $b_{r}$ in satisfying condition (6) depends on the design of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor notational simplicity, we denote the ICCBF constraint function as:\n\n$$\n\\psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right):=\\Delta b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)+\\alpha_{r}\\left(b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nLemma 2. Given the input constrained discrete-time system (1), if $b_{r}$ is a discrete-time ICCBF, then any control input $\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in K_{\\mathrm{icbf}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)$, with $K_{\\mathrm{icbf}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right):=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}\\right.$ : $\\left.\\psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) \\geq 0\\right\\}$, renders the set $\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}$ forward invariant. The proof is similar to [14, Theorem 1].\n\nRemark 3. We can solve the following optimization problem:\n\n$$\n\\zeta^{*}=\\operatorname{minimize}_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \\sup _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha_{r}\\left(b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nBy the definition, $b_{r}$ is an ICCBF if and only if the optimization problem has a feasible solution $\\zeta^{*} \\geq 0$. However, this can only be used to invalidate $b_{r}$ as a valid ICCBF. The search over integers $r$ and class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ to find valid ICCBFs can be complicated, similar to the challenge of finding Lyapunov functions in general.",

      "text": "## B. Problem Setup\n\nIn the original ICCBF approach, which is common in many CBF applications, the objective is to identify a fixed set of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ that make the function $b_{r}$ a valid ICCBF for all states in the inner safe set $\\mathcal{C}^{*}$. However, this approach presents two main challenges: a) it is difficult\n\nto find such a set, and b) it can be overly conservative, potentially restricting the system's performance.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose an online adaptive approach that seeks to find a set of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions that make the ICCBF candidate function $b_{r}$ to be locally valid (to be formally defined in this section) at each control iteration, based on the current state and the surrounding environment. This method eliminates the need to exhaustively search over all possible class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and validate (8) with the corresponding set $\\mathcal{C}^{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$. Moreover, it allows the ICCBF to be dynamically tailored to the specific conditions the system encounters in real time.\n\nConsider a navigation problem for a nonlinear system in the form of (1) in a static environment $\\mathcal{W}$ containing information about a set of obstacles $\\mathcal{O}$.

Safety Loss Density Function\n\nIn this work, we assume a robot modeled as a dynamic unicycle with state $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\\left[x_{t}, y_{t}, \\theta_{t}, v_{t}\\right]^{\\top}$, where $x_{t}$ and $y_{t}$ represent the position, $\\theta_{t}$ is the heading angle, and $v_{t}$ is the linear velocity, and the control inputs $\\boldsymbol{u}_{t}=\\left[a_{t}, \\omega_{t}\\right]^{\\top}$ are the acceleration and the angular velocity, respectively.\n\nIn collision avoidance scenarios in robot navigation, the distances to the obstacles are not the sole factor of safety.\n\nThe safety hard constraint for obstacle collision avoidance can be simply encoded as the signed distance function:\n\n$$\nh\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\right)=\\left(x_{t}-x_{\\text {obs }}\\right)^{2}+\\left(y_{t}-y_{\\text {obs }}\\right)^{2}-\\left(l_{\\text {robot }}+l_{\\text {obs }}\\right)^{2} \\geq 0\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{\\text {obs }}$ and $y_{\\text {obs }}$ are the coordinates of the obstacle. The terms $l_{\\text {robot }}$ and $l_{\\text {obs }}$ represent the radii of the robot and the obstacle, respectively. It is obvious that a controller with a hard constraint like (16) cannot ensure safety from all initial conditions. The ICCBF constraint value in (9d) is a useful metric to measure the safety margin with respect to the current robot state $\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ and the system dynamics (1). However, the rate of change of the original hard constraint $h$ in a discrete-time setting is computed via the time difference of subsequent value, it does not directly encode the direction of the robot's motion. Therefore, inspired by [43], we introduce a safety loss density function that incorporates both spatial state and directional information to provide a more comprehensive measure of collision risk.\n\nLet $\\Phi: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a positive semi-definite density function that describes the safety loss of a particular robot state $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and control input $\\boldsymbol{u}$ :\n\n$$\n\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{u}):=\\max _{j} \\frac{\\lambda_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{u})}{\\beta_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}) d\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}\\right)^{2}+1}\n$$\n\nwhere $d\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}\\right):=\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{z}-\\boldsymbol{z}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}-l_{\\text {robot }}-l_{\\text {obs }}$, and $\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are the spatial location of the robot and the $j$-th among $N$ obstacles.\n$\\lambda_{j}: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ determines the peak height of the density function, and it is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{u}):=\\lambda_{1} e^{-\\lambda_{2} \\psi_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{u} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{u} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha})$ is the ICCBF constraint value (9d) for the $j$-th nearby obstacle. We use $r=1$ to construct the ICCBF candidate given that the function $h$ has relative degrees of 2 for both control inputs. $\\lambda_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ determines the nominal peak height, and $\\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ defines the risk decay rate.\n$\\beta_{j}: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ influences the dissipation rate of the density function based on the directional motion of the robot:\n\n$$\n\\beta_{j}(\\boldsymbol{x}):=\\beta_{1} e^{\\beta_{2}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\Delta \\theta_{j}\\right)+1\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta \\theta_{j}$ is the angle between the robot's motion direction and the vector pointing from the robot to the $j$-th obstacle. $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are the parameters similar to (18).\n\nBy defining (17)-(19), we can measure the collision risk based on the robot state.",

Training Data Generation - Offline Sampling\n\nTo train a prediction model that can infer the safety and performance of the MPC-ICCBF controller based on the state of the robot and the choice of the class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions, we collect a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ by generating robot trajectory $\\mathcal{P}_{0}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} ; \\boldsymbol{x}_{0}, \\mathcal{E}_{0}, \\pi_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\right)$ as in (10) offline, similar to [25].\n\nWe uniformly sample the initial state of the robot $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}=$ $\\left[x_{0}, y_{0}, \\theta_{0}, v_{0}\\right]^{\\top}$ and the positions of $N$ obstacles, while at least one obstacle is placed in the path towards the fixed goal location, requiring the robot to actively avoid it.

      "text": "## D. Uncertainty-Aware Class $\\mathcal{K}$. Functions Verification\n\nNow we propose the solution for Problem 1 by considering both types of uncertainties.\n\n1) Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification: We evaluate the confidence of the prediction by measuring epistemic uncertainty. We employ Jensen-R\u00e9nyi Divergence (JRD) with quadratic R\u00e9nyi entropy [47], which has a closed-form expression of the divergence of a GMM [46], [48]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nD(X ; \\mathfrak{E}) & =-\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{B^{2}} \\sum_{b, c}^{B} \\mathfrak{D}_{(b, c)}\\right)+\\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b}^{B} \\log \\left[\\mathfrak{D}_{(b, b)}\\right] \\\\\n\\mathfrak{D}_{(b, c)} & :=\\frac{1}{|\\mathfrak{D}|^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{\\top} \\mathfrak{V}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\mathfrak{V}:=\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{b}}+\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{c}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}:=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{b}}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{c}}$. If the JRD $D(X)$ of the prediction of a given input $X$ is greater than the predefined threshold $D_{\\text {thr }}$, it is deemed to be out-of-distribution.\n2) Distributionally Robust Risk Assessment: We then evaluate the risk of the predicted risk level $\\hat{\\phi} \\in \\hat{Y}$, which follows a GMM distribution due to aleatoric uncertainty. To this end, we first establish the connection between the predicted risk level and the local validity of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions. The condition (11) can be extended as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\zeta & =\\operatorname*{\\operatorname*{\\operatorname*{\\operatorname*{\\operatorname*{\\operatorname*}}}}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \\sup _{\\boldsymbol{u}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{U}}\\left[\\Delta b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right]+\\alpha_{r}\\left(b_{r}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\geq \\min _{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \\psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right) \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy further transforming this condition (25) and using the definition of safety loss density function $\\Phi$ (17) and risk level $\\phi=\\max _{t \\in\\left[0, T_{\\max }\\right]} \\Phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t}\\right)$, we can derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\phi=\\max _{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \\max _{j} \\frac{\\lambda_{1} e^{-\\lambda_{2} \\psi\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{t} ; \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\right)}}{\\beta_{1} e^{\\beta_{2}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\Delta \\theta_{j}\\right)+1\\right)} d\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}\\right)^{2}+1} \\leq \\\\\n& \\max _{\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} \\in \\mathcal{P}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha})} \\max _{j} \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\beta_{1} d\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}, \\boldsymbol{z}_{j}\\right)^{2}+1} \\leq \\bar{\\phi}:=\\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\beta_{1} d_{\\min }^{2}+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $d_{\\min }$ is the closest allowable distance to obstacles, considering the robot's physical dimensions and a safety buffer. Therefore, if the risk level satisfies condition (26), i.e., $\\phi \\leq \\bar{\\phi}$, then condition (11) holds, indicating that the class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions are locally valid.\n\nGiven that the predicted risk level $\\hat{\\phi}$ follows a GMM distribution due to ensemble predictions and an analytical solution for its Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) exists, we employ the distributionally robust CVaR as a risk metric. For notational simplicity, we slightly abuse the notation in this section by treating the risk level $\\phi$ as the output vector $Y$. For $\\hat{\\phi} \\sim \\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)$, we define the Value at Risk (VaR) as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{VaR}_{\\epsilon}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi}):=\\inf \\left\\{\\nu \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\operatorname{Prob}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi}>\\nu) \\leq \\epsilon\\right\\}\n$$\n\nVaR represents the potential risk level with the allowable probability $\\epsilon$. We then define the CVaR:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{CVaR}_{\\epsilon}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi}):=\\inf \\left\\{\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\eta+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}\\left[(\\hat{\\phi}-\\eta)^{+}\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $(\\cdot)^{+}:=\\max \\{\\cdot, 0\\}$. CVaR is interpreted as the expected value over VaR, and it adheres to a group of axioms crucial for rational risk assessment [49].\n\nFinally, we compute distributionally robust CVaR by treating the ensemble set of distributions $\\mathfrak{E}$ as the ambiguity set [50], [51]:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sup _{\\mathbf{E}_{b} \\in \\mathfrak{E}} & \\operatorname{CVaR}_{\\epsilon}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi}) \\leq \\bar{\\phi} \\Rightarrow \\sup _{\\mathbf{E}_{b} \\in \\mathfrak{E}} \\operatorname{VaR}_{\\epsilon}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi}) \\leq \\bar{\\phi} \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow \\inf _{\\mathbf{E}_{b} \\in \\mathfrak{E}} \\operatorname{Prob}^{\\mathbf{E}_{b}(X)}(\\bar{\\phi} \\leq \\bar{\\phi}) \\geq 1-\\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy (30), the constraint $\\bar{\\phi} \\leq \\bar{\\phi}$ is deemed as distributionally robust with the probability of $1-\\epsilon$.\n\nBy evaluating these two uncertainties, (22) and (29), we can ensure that the prediction from the PENN model is both confident and satisfies the local validity condition (11).",

These candidates form a batch of inputs $\\mathbf{X}=$ $\\left\\{X^{(k)}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{K}$ for the PENN model $\\mathbf{F}$. The model then predicts GMM distributions of the risk level and the deadlock time for each input. To identify locally valid class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions $\\mathfrak{A}_{\\text {valid }}$, the algorithm filters these predictions based on two criteria as described in Sec.

This minimizes the chance of overly restrictive CBF constraints impeding navigation [52]. These parameters are then updated in the MPC-ICCBF (9) problem to compute the control input $\\boldsymbol{u}_{t}$. By repeating this process at each time step, it continuously refines the ICCBF parameters based on the current state and the predictions from the PENN model, thereby optimizing performance while maintaining safety.\nRemark 4.

      "text": "## B. Online Adaptive MPC-ICCBF\n\nWe compare the performance of our method with four different approaches: MPC-ICCBF using 1) \"Low\" ( $\\gamma_{0}=$ $\\gamma_{1}=0.01$ ) and 2) \"High\" ( $\\gamma_{0}=\\gamma_{1}=0.2$ ) fixed class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters, 3) Optimal-decay CBF-QP [32] that can optimize class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions online (abbreviated as \"Opt. QP\"), and 4) \"Optimal-decay MPC-CBF\" [33] where it incorporates the same optimization technique as [32] within the MPC structure (abbreviated as \"Opt. MPC\"). For 3) and 4), we optimize both $\\gamma_{0}$ and $\\gamma_{1}$ and penalize them in the cost function. For our method, we empirically set the adaptation range as $\\gamma_{0}, \\gamma_{1} \\in(0.01,0.2)$. As demonstrated in [14], when the relative degree of the constraint function $h$ with respect to the control input matches the order to which the ICCBF is constructed, the ICCBF trivially reduces to an HOCBF in continuous time. Therefore, we adopt a discretetime HOCBF implementation in our experiments.\n\nTABLE I: Performance comparison of five approaches across two environments. Metrics include collision rate, goal-reaching rate, and average reach time. Environment \\#1 corresponds to Fig. 1, and environment \\#2 to Fig. 2.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nWe test these approaches in two different environments. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 illustrate the trajectories generated by each method. To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our method, we further conduct 108 navigation trials with uniformly varied initial states $\\boldsymbol{x}_{0}$ in both environments. We evaluate three metrics: collision rate with obstacles, goal-reaching rate, and average reach time when the robot successfully reaches the goal (see Table I).\n\nThe conservative approach, using \"Low\" ICCBF parameters, is significantly affected by the initial nearby obstacle due to the ICCBF constraints. In some cases, the high initial velocities $v_{0} \\in \\boldsymbol{x}_{0}$ result in states that fall outside the inner safe set defined by fixed class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions, leading to collisions. The aggressive approach with \"High\" ICCBF parameters becomes infeasible in early iterations and eventually collides with obstacles. While \"Opt. QP\" shows fewer collisions, it is prone to deadlock. \"Opt. MPC\" avoids infeasibility but still results in collisions, as it only guarantees the pointwise feasibility of the solution rather than persistent safety. In contrast, our proposed method actively refines the class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters online based on the PENN model's predictions. It successfully reaches the goal without collisions or deadlocks, achieving the highest goal-reaching rate in both scenarios and demonstrating its ability to optimize performance while ensuring safety.\n\nWe also conducted hardware experiments comparing the five methods. These experiments, along with more detailed analysis, can be found in our accompanying video.",

      "text": "## VI. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we present an online class $\\mathcal{K}$ function parameters adaptation approach in discrete-time ICCBFs. To this end, we first introduce the concept of locally valid class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions, which ensure forward invariance for a smaller subset of the inner safe set. By leveraging a PENN model with a novel two-step verification process that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, our method can dynamically refine the ICCBF parameters to ensure safety and optimize MPC performance. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the compared baselines in collision avoidance and goal-reaching rates across various scenarios. Future work may focus on enhancing multi-obstacle handling through graph neural network feature encoding, which could improve scalability to varying numbers of obstacles. Also, extending our method to higherdimensional systems, such as quadrotors, is another area of interest.",

  "abstract": "Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring\nsafety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee\npersistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in\nsystems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually\ntuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori.\nThe performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed\nparameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety\nviolations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based\noptimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF\n(ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a\nprobabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk\nmetrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both\nepistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification\nprocess using Jensen-Renyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional\nValue at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of\nICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing\nperformance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both\nfixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios\nacross safety and performance metrics.",
