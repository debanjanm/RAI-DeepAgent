The models are designed to account for both partial repayments and the short repayment durations typical in microfinance, focusing on estimating the probability of transitions between two or three repayment states, including delinquency. Social variables, such as religious and cultural factors, were found to play a statistically significant role in influencing repayment behavior, highlighting the impact of societal dynamics on financial outcomes. We explored both time-independent and time-dependent frailty models to capture unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of social factors in delinquency but suggest limited predictive gains from incorporating frailties into multistate models.\n\n\nKey words and phrases: OR in developing countries; Credit scoring; Microfinance; Multi-state models; Frailty modelling", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nMicro-lending, which involves providing small loans to low-income individuals, is a revolutionary concept introduced by Muhammad Yunus (Yunus, 1998). This lending approach has had a profoundly positive impact on society through financial inclusion (Ledgerwood, 1998), leading to its widespread replication in developing countries. It has been praised by philanthropists, the media, and is often mentioned as a groundbreaking innovation in the effort to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (Armend\u00e1riz and Morduch, 2010). As noted by Hameed (2012) and Kapila et al. (2016), microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been pioneers in disbursing micro-loans, enabling millions of individuals worldwide, particularly women, to access financial services that would otherwise be out of reach. MFIs have also challenged traditional banking norms by demonstrating that low-income individuals, even without formal credit histories or collateral, can be creditworthy borrowers. The strategy employed by most MFIs relies on peer pressure, joint liability among borrowers, and the ability to re-apply for future loans, contingent on good repayment, as detailed in the work of Armend\u00e1riz and Morduch (2010).\n\nAckah and Asiamah (2016) confirms that despite central banks in many countries monitoring the performance of their microfinance institutions and ensuring the safety of customer deposits, significant issues remain that expose lenders to higher levels of credit risk compared to standard banks. The first challenge is deciding which borrowers to extend loans to. This is the primary issue for most microfinance institutions, as the majority of their customers lack a credit score, social security number, or stable income. These factors complicate the work of credit officers, who must assess many loan applications on a case-by-case basis, requiring significant resources and time to reach a decision.\n\nThe second challenge is determining how well customers will be able to repay their loans after approval. This directly affects the proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs), the profitability of these institutions, and the composition of their portfolios.\n\nMany authors have reported on the impact of microfinance on the socio-economic status of customers. However, to our knowledge, there is no scientific study that explains the influence of local and social variables-such as religion, festive seasons, and school breaks, etc.-on customers' repayment behavior in relation to microloans. Identifying and quantifying the impacts of these variables is crucial. In developing countries, particularly in Africa, these factors, along with social capital (i.e., group/community capital), play a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities, as noted by Kuada (2009), Mafukata et al. (2015), and Leora Klapper (2023). Overlooking these effects may miss important insights that could enhance the understanding of loan repayment dynamics in such institutions.\n\nThese issues raise several important questions: Can we predict the likelihood of an account becoming delinquent months in advance? Can we develop a robust model to help microfinance institutions make faster decisions regarding the creditworthiness of customers with an acceptable level of accuracy? Do social factors, such as religion and traditional festivities, have a statistically significant effect on customers' repayment behavior? Considering social aspects is crucial,\n\nas they are integral to the daily lives of many customers in developing countries (Tomalin et al., 2019; Azeez et al., 2024; Kanagaretnam et al., 2015). Additionally, do unobserved effects (Duchateau and Janssen, 2008) have a statistically significant impact on the repayment behavior of an account? These are some of the questions we address in this work.\n\nTo explore these issues, we reviewed the available literature on credit risk modeling, which is extensive, especially within the context of the traditional banking system. Numerous studies have been conducted to model the behavior of consumer loan accounts.\n\nIn Sigrist and Hirnschall (2019), the authors introduce the Grabit model, which combines gradient tree boosting with the Tobit model to predict loan defaults on an imbalanced dataset. Their findings demonstrate that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art binary classification methods.\n\nMedina-Olivares et al. (2023) develop discrete-time joint models for credit risk modeling and compare their performance to standard survival models. They emphasize the distinction between time-varying covariates (TVCs) and the survival process by jointly estimating the parameters associated with the time-to-event process and those related to the TVC processes. By extending the joint model to include an autoregressive term, they improve the model's predictive performance (measured by the Area Under the ROC Curve), in terms of both discrimination and calibration, compared to models without the autoregressive term and standard survival models.\n\nIn Liu et al. (2024), a Machine Learning (ML) approach is proposed for imbalanced classification and data augmentation. The authors develop a semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation model, called STANF, to address challenges associated with single neural network-based models and non-transfer learning methods. They compare the predictive performance of STANF against methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Random Forests (RF), and Transfer Neural Networks (TNT). Using the F1 score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) as performance metrics, their experimental results demonstrate that STANF outperforms these methods.\n\nWhile these studies have significantly contributed to the literature on credit risk, they primarily focus on binary classification frameworks.\n\nTo tackle issues of competing risks, Dirick et al. (2022) propose a mixture cure model that considers early repayment and default as competing events, while treating matured loans as an unsusceptible group. To account for unobserved heterogeneity-such as varying levels of risk tolerance among customers that are not captured in the data-the authors incorporate frailties. They develop a novel hierarchical expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. Their simulations reveal that failing to account for heterogeneity when it is present can lead to misleading conclusions about the effects of parameters related to the timing of certain events.\n\nIn Leow and Crook (2014), intensity models were used to estimate the transition probabilities in a non-homogeneous Markov and discrete time setting (approximation of continuous time). By leveraging semi-parametric assumptions and extending the traditional Cox model (Cox, 1972), they estimate relevant intensities in a multistate setting and devise a method to predict the landing state $j$ of an account at time $t$, given that this account is in state $h$ at time $t-1$. However, they faced the challenge in consistently predicting the correct landing state, as their method tend to be biased towards transition types with higher occurrence counts.\n\nIn the binomial case, one can usually estimate a cut-off point (using the predicted probabilities for one transition-type) to determine whether an event has occurred or not with tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the $F_{1}$ score (Grandini et al., 2020), or the Matthews correlation coefficient (Chicco and Jurman, 2023). However, in a multistate setting, where predicting the next state involves more than two possible landing states, this task becomes more complex as the highest estimated probability (in the case of a competing risks (Beyersmann et al., 2011) for example) does not necessarily indicate the correct landing state. Therefore, one must find an optimal cut-off point or decision rule to determine the next landing state.\n\nIn contrast, Djeundje and Crook (2018) take a different approach intensity models by estimating transition probabilities directly in a multistate using the logit link function. They account for the underlying effects of the duration of repayments on the probabilities of transition in the form of a parametric baseline function using cubic B-spline bases. Additionally, the model is extended to include shared frailties (Wienke, 2010) among accounts experiencing the same transition type. Furthermore, they propose a method for predicting the next state on which we build up. In this study, we introduce\n\nan alternative method to predict the next landing state in a multi-state setting and compare its performance to the aforementioned method.\n\nThis paper contributes to the literature in three ways:\n\n- First, we analyse the impact of social variables (observed through tradition, cultural norms, and geographical locations) on the microloan repayments/delinquencies process in the context of developing countries. In particular, it is the first time variables such as \"Eid\" and \"Long vacation\" are used to model dynamic loan repayment behaviors.\n- Second, we investigate the inclusion of time-dependent frailties into the model to assess the impact and significance of unobserved heterogeneity.\n- Third, we compare and discuss the performance of various model specifications (including machine learning methods) in predicting delinquencies, using different performance metrics.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we describe the methodologies used in our analysis. Section 3 presents the performance of the models and analyses of the parameter estimates. In Section 4, we discuss the results of our predictions. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary of the results, insights, and suggestions for future work.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODELS AND METHODOLOGIES \n\nIn this section, we introduce our definition of delinquency and describe the methodologies used to model the behaviour of accounts during the repayment of their loans.\n2.1. Description of data. The data for these models was sourced from a microfinance institution in Ghana. After preprocessing to remove inconsistencies and incomplete records, 1,716 accounts with full transaction histories were retained. The loans, spanning from April 2018 to November 2018, had repayment periods of less than 8 months, with repayments made either monthly or weekly. Females made up about $87 \\%$ of the account holders. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, sourced from the Ghana Statistical Service, were lagged and incorporated into the modeling process.\n2.2. Definition of delinquency. Our empirical analysis of the datasets revealed that most delinquent accounts tend to make partial repayments ${ }^{1}$ throughout the loan duration. Therefore, examining their cumulative repayments ${ }^{2}$ can provide additional insights into their creditworthiness, complementing our analysis of accounts delinquency.\n\nMoreover, in developing countries, microfinance institutions are generally willing to accept partial repayments due to the various challenges their customers may face (Liu et al., 2023; Gueyie et al., 2013). Partial repayments are often viewed more positively by microfinance institutions than missed payments, as they demonstrate a commitment to repaying the loan and can be seen as a sign of good faith from the account holder. Hence, we define two type of delinquency:\n(1) Two-state delinquency (the two-state model) : An account is labeled as delinquent at time $t$ if the cumulative amount repaid by this account at time $t$ is less than $82 \\%{ }^{3}$ of the cumulated agreed amount to repay at such time $t$. In this situation, we shall consider a two-states model.\n(2) Three-state delinquency (the multistate model): we define 3 states which represent the level of delinquency ${ }^{4}$ of account $i$. Let $A_{i}(t)$ be the amount account $i$ has to repay at a given time $t^{5}$, and $k_{i}(t)$ to be the amount repaid at time $t$ by this account, then\n\n- Account $i$ is in state 3 if $0 \\leq k_{i}(t)<0.5 A(t)$\n- Account $i$ is in state 2 if $0.5 A(t) \\leq k_{i}(t) \\leq 0.9 A(t)$\n- Account $i$ is in state 1 if $k_{i}(t)>0.9 A(t)$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Partial repayment refers to repaying only a portion of the agreed amount at a specific time $t$. This behavior is common in microfinance within developing regions, as these institutions prefer receiving multiple partial repayments over no payments at all. Conversely, this behavior is atypical in the standard banking industry and in developed countries.\n    ${ }^{2}$ Cumulative repayment refers to the total amount repaid over time. For example, if account $i$ is to repay $\u00a3 100$ monthly over nine months and repays an amount $x_{0}$ each month, the cumulative repaid amount by the seventh month is $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} x_{0}$.\n    ${ }^{3}$ This is the percentage of the total amount (principal + interest) agreed to be repaid by all accounts that would enable the company to break even at the end of the year.\n    ${ }^{4}$ The partition of delinquency in this model has been selected to try and capture different levels of repayments behaviour for the accounts and does not originate from the lender. Therefore, the thresholds may be modified/adapted to fit various scenarios/decisions.\n    ${ }^{5} A_{i}(t)$ is usually set at the beginning of the contract as the interest paid is a flat interest rate, however this can be adjusted during the repayment on a case by case basis.\n\nThese two types of delinquencies are illustrated in figure 2.1 and figure 2.2.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2.1. Two-state model\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2.2. Three-state (multistate model)\n\nAs we will see in the subsequent sections, we develop separate models for each of these two types of delinquency. In particular, for the cumulative type of delinquency, we use a two-state model, whereas for the non-cumulative type of delinquency, we use a Three-state model instead.\n\nOne specific aspect of our models is that they do not include a firm default (or absorbing) state, reflecting the flexibility in microfinance repayments. In practice, accounts may even continue repaying few months/weeks beyond the original loan maturity date due to various circumstances ${ }^{6}$. Additionally, our focus is on modeling microloan repayments behaviors over a short duration (less than a year), as opposed to long term loans that span several years. This approach allows us to better capture the nuances of repayment patterns in microfinance. Our choice of reference time is the duration of repayments instead of calendar time (see for example (Therneau and Grambsch, 2013; Dirick et al., 2017) for similar approach) as this helps reset the initial time of all repayments to the same time point and simplifies the modeling process.\n\nTo model the transition between delinquency states for microloans, we build on the framework in Djeundje and Crook (2018), who developed models to analyze transitions in a portfolio of credit card loans. Their approach provides a good starting point for modeling delinquency transitions in microloans at account level.\n2.3. The fixed effects models. In this section, we first present the fixed effects framework, which is used to models the delinquency of accounts without taking in consideration the possible presence of unobserved variability in repayments.\n\nLet us consider a portfolio of loan accounts in a financial company where each account $i$ is associated with the stochastic process $\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=\\left\\{y_{i, h j}(t), t \\geq 0\\right\\}_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}}$, where $\\mathcal{S}=\\{(h, j), h \\neq j\\}$ is the state space, and\n\n$$\ny_{i, h j}(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\text { if account } i \\text { in state } j \\text { at time } t \\mid \\text { account } i \\text { was in state } h \\text { at time } t-1 \\\\\n0 \\text { if account } i \\text { in state } h \\text { at time } t \\mid \\text { account } i \\text { was in state } h \\text { at time } t-1\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nFor cases where an account $i$ makes a transition $h \\rightarrow j^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime} \\notin\\{h, j\\}$, we assume the process is interval-censored and non-informative (Zhang and Sun, 2010; Diggle, 2002). Hence, the time dependent transition probability is\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{i, h j}(t)=1\\right)=q_{i, h j}(t) \\\\\n\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{i, h j}(t)=0\\right)=1-q_{i, h j}(t)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nThese probabilities are influenced by numerous factors, including both time-independent factors and those that vary over time. To express the dependence of these probabilities on the underlying risk factors, (Djeundje and Crook, 2018) used a logistic form to capture the baseline patterns via B-splines.\n\nIn this work, we explore different formulations for the dependence of probabilities on risk factors, including the logistic model (Bishop and Nasrabadi, 2006) as well other machine learning methods such as the Random forest (Breiman, 2001), KTBoost (Sigrist, 2021). As we shall see in Section 4, these alternative machine learning approaches tend to outperform the logistic form used in Djeundje and Crook (2018).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ As mentioned earlier, social factors such as festivities, periods when parents pay school fees, etc. may be considered locally by microfinance institution as reasons to extend the repayment duration of a loan for instance or agree to partial repayments.\n\nThe logit-link (LLink) function. We estimate the transition probabilities $q_{i, h j}(t)$ using the logit function\n\n$$\nq_{i, h j}(t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}^{\\mathrm{T}} X_{i, h j}(t)\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}$ is a vector of fixed-effect coefficients to be estimated, $\\alpha_{h j, t}$ is a discrete function of time(Singer and Willett, 1993; Allison, 1982) ${ }^{7}$ of time defined a for $t \\in\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, \\tau_{\\max }\\right\\}$, where $\\tau_{\\max }$ is the maximum duration of repayments (in months) observed in the data. Now define $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}=\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{h j, t}\\right)=\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}\\right)\\right)_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}}$, where $\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{h j, t}\\right)$ is the collection of vectors $\\gamma_{h j, t}$, and write the penalized log-likelihood function as\n\n$$\nl\\left(\\gamma_{h j}\\right)=C \\sum_{t \\in T \\subset \\mathbb{N}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}_{h j}(t)} y_{i, h j}(t) \\log \\left(q_{i, h j}(t)\\right)+\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right) \\log \\left(1-q_{i, h j}(t)\\right)+r\\left(\\gamma_{h j, t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $q_{i, h j}(t)$ is given in (2.2), $C>0^{8}$ is a constant representing the inverse of regularization strength ${ }^{9}, \\mathcal{R}_{h j}(t)$ is the risk set just before time $t$, i.e. the set of accounts at risk of transitioning from state $h$ at time $t-1$ to state $j$ at time $t$, $r\\left(\\gamma_{h j, t}\\right)$ is the penalty function\n\n$$\nr\\left(\\gamma_{h j, t}\\right)=\\frac{1-\\rho}{2}\\left\\|\\gamma_{h j, t}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}+\\rho\\left\\|\\gamma_{h j, t}\\right\\|_{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ controls the strength of regularization between the $\\ell_{1}$ regularization term $\\|w\\|_{1}$ and $\\ell_{2}$ regularization term $\\|w\\|_{2}^{2}$. This penalized version of the likelihood coped better in handling some of the singularities encountered during the optimization with the standard likelihood function. The other fixed effect models ${ }^{10}$ (i.e. Random forest (RF), Kernel and Tree Boosting (KTBoost)) are described in Appendix A.2.\n2.4. The frailties models. We present below the framework for the models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.\n2.4.1. LLink model with time-independent frailties. To account for unobserved heterogeneity among observations in the model, we expand the probabilities shown in Section 2.3 to include both fixed covariates and frailties as follows :\n\n$$\nq_{i, h j}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}^{\\mathrm{T}} X_{i, h j}(t)+u_{i, h j}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}$ and $\\alpha_{h j, t}$ are defined as earlier, $\\boldsymbol{u}_{i}=\\left(u_{i, h j}\\right)_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}}$ is the frailty vector associated to account $i$. We assume $\\boldsymbol{u}_{i}$ and $\\boldsymbol{u}_{j}$ are independent processes for account $i \\neq$ account $j$. For transition-types $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ such that $\\boldsymbol{u}_{i}=\\left(u_{i, 12}, u_{i, 21}\\right)$, we also assume that $u_{i, 12}$ and $u_{i, 21}$ are independent. Additionally, we assume shared frailties (Wienke, 2010) among event times of the same transition-type ${ }^{11}$.\n\nTo estimate these the full vector of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}, \\phi_{h j}\\right)\\right)_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}}$ (see Appendix A. 1 for more details about the estimation of $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ ), we consider the joint likelihood contribution of an account $i$ as\n\n$$\nL_{\\left(Y_{i, h j}(\\cdot), U_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=L_{Y_{i, h j}(\\cdot) \\mid U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\times g_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nL_{Y_{i, h j}(\\cdot) \\mid U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\prod_{\\substack{i \\in T \\subset \\mathbb{N} \\\\ i \\in \\mathcal{R}_{h j}(t)}} q_{i, h j}(t)^{y_{i}, h j(t)}\\left(1-q_{i, h j}(t)\\right)^{\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right)}\n$$\n\nand $g_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}):=g_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ is the univariate normal density with mean 0 and variance $\\phi_{h j}$ (Hougaard and Hougaard (2000); Djeundje and Crook (2018)), i.e.\n\n$$\ng_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u_{i, h j}^{\\mathrm{T}}}{\\phi_{h j}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\left(2 \\pi \\phi_{h j}\\right)}}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ A spline formulation was explored but got discarded as the piecewise formulation of the baseline provided a more stable solution. This may be due to the fact that the piecewise formulation is more flexible and accurate, especially over the shorter repayments duration of these loans.\n    ${ }^{8}$ The value of $C, \\rho$ are usually selected through parameter tuning and cross-validation (Raschka, 2018; Ghajogh and Crowley, 2019).\n    ${ }^{9}$ It is helpful to utilize some form of regularization as it helps to improve numerical stability even when the model is not over-parametrised (ShalevShwartz and Ben-David, 2014; Nguyen and Raff, 2018).\n    ${ }^{10}$ Each of the algorithms in the fixed effects models can either be coded from scratch or adapted, for instance modifying existing algorithms in Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), to align the corresponding objective function, accounting for at-risk accounts at each transition-type $(h, j)$ and at each the discrete repayment time. We use this approach as it is straight forward to implement.\n    ${ }^{11}$ Meaning that the frailties $u_{i, h j}$ follow the same distribution for each $(h, j)$ with $h \\neq j$, but the event times for different accounts experiencing the same transition-type are conditionally independent given the frailty.\n\nThe contribution to the complete joint data likelihood from account $i$ provided as:\n\n$$\nL_{i}=L_{\\left(Y_{i}, U_{i}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\prod_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\prod_{\\substack{t \\in T \\subset \\mathcal{H} \\\\ i \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} L_{\\left(Y_{i, h j}(t), U_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\prod_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}} g_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\prod_{\\substack{t \\in T \\subset \\mathcal{H} \\\\ i \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} L_{Y_{i, h j}(t) \\mid U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\n$$\n\nwith $L_{\\left(Y_{i, h j}(t) \\mid U_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}):=q_{i, h j}(t)^{y_{i}, h j(t)}\\left(1-q_{i, h j}(t)\\right)^{\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right)}$.\n\nThe complete data joint log-likelihood ${ }^{12} L(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=L(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u})$ is then given as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\prod_{i} L_{i} & =\\prod_{i} \\prod_{\\left(h, j\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}} g_{U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\prod_{\\substack{t \\in T \\subset \\mathcal{H} \\\\\ni \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} L_{Y_{i, h j}(t) \\mid U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\\\\n& =\\prod_{i}\\left\\{\\prod_{\\left(h, j\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u_{i, h j}^{T}}{\\phi_{h j}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\left(2 \\pi \\phi_{h j}\\right)}}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\prod_{\\left(h, j\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\prod_{\\substack{t \\in T \\subset \\mathcal{H} \\\\\ni \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} L_{Y_{i, h j}(t) \\mid U_{i, h j}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\prod_{i} g_{U_{i}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) L_{\\left(Y_{i} \\mid U_{i}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\\\\n& =\\prod_{i} g_{U_{i}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi}) L_{\\left(Y_{i} \\mid U_{i}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ is a diagonal matrix such the diagonal elements are the corresponding variances $\\phi_{h j}$ of the frailties $U_{i, h j}$, and the off-diagonal elements are 0 , thus $g_{U_{i}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ can be written as the multivariate normal density ${ }^{13}$\n\n$$\ng_{U_{i}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{u}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{u}_{i}\\right)}{\\sqrt{(2 \\pi)^{r}|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}|}}\n$$\n\nwhere $|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}|$ is the determinant of $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$, the mean of the distribution is the $\\boldsymbol{0}$ vector, and $r$ is the number of frailties variances to estimate. Writing the likelihood as a product of likelihoods of individual accounts is common in literature (Kim, Choi, and Emery, 2013; Duchateau and Janssen, 2008). This approach is particularly useful when one wishes to compute the contribution of a specific account to the overall likelihood (2.8). The full data log-likelihood is then given as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nl(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u})=\\log (L(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}) & =\\sum_{i} \\log \\left(g_{U_{i}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\right)+\\left\\{\\sum_{\\left(h, j\\right) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{\\substack{t \\in T \\subset \\mathcal{H} \\\\\ni \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} y_{i, h j}(t) \\log \\left(q_{i, h j}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right) \\log \\left(1-q_{i, h j}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)\\right)\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, we would need to integrate out the random effect $\\boldsymbol{u}$ from (2.10), that is find\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}=-\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}}[l(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u})]\n$$\n\nHowever, the integral of such expression is not available in closed form, so we rely on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approximation (McLachlan and Krishnan, 2007; Levine and Casella, 2001), where we use the trapezoid rule (Atkinson, 1991) to deal with the expectation step ${ }^{14}$. In the E-step of the EM, we integrate out the random effects $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and in the M-step, we maximize the relevant objective function with the help of popular optimization modules in Python (Virtanen et al., 2020b) to extract the optimal parameters.\n2.4.2. LLink model with time-dependent frailties. In the previous section, we focused on time-homogeneous frailties. However, in practice, the structure of the unobserved heterogeneity can evolve over time (Abrams et al., 2018). Here, we examine two different structures for $u_{i, h j}$ :\n\n- First, we explore time-dependent frailties in the form of a piecewise function as follows:\n\n$$\nu_{i, h j}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in\\{1,2,3\\}} u_{i, h j, k} \\mathbb{1}_{\\left\\{\\tau_{k-1}<t \\leq \\tau_{k}\\right\\}}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ Here, we consider the most general case where all parameters from all transition-types are estimated in one model; the case of the estimation of such parameters by transition-type is discussed in Remark A.1.2.\n    ${ }^{13}$ The advantage of considering a multinomial distribution where the covariance matrix is diagonal is that the likelihood to estimate the parameters factorizes as a product of likelihoods for each transition type and improve identifiability of the mixture model (Yakowitz and Spragins, 1968).\n    ${ }^{14}$ The details of computations are presented in Appendix A.1.\n\nwhere $k \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, we choose $\\tau_{0}=0, \\tau_{1}=3$ (third month of repayment), $\\tau_{2}=5$ (i.e. fifth month of repayment), $\\tau_{3}=\\tau_{\\max } 15-16$. We also assume that\n\n$$\nU_{i, h j, k} \\sim N\\left(0, \\phi_{h j, k}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{h j, k}$ is the variance of the frailties for transition-type $(h, j)$ such that $\\tau_{k-1}<t \\leq \\tau_{k}, k=1,2,3$. This formulation enables us to compute the conditional expectation with respect to the time-dependent frailties as follows :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}(t) \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\boldsymbol{k}}}\\left[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\right)\\right]= & \\sum_{k \\in\\{1,2,3\\}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}(\\boldsymbol{t}) \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k} \\sim \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}}\\left[l(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}(t))\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{1}}\\left[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{1}\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{2} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{2}}\\left[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{2} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{2}\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{3} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{3}}\\left[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{3} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{3}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}=\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{h j}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}, \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{h j, k}\\right)\\right)_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}}$ and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}}\\left[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{k}\\right)\\right]= & \\sum_{t} \\sum_{\\substack{t_{k-1}=t \\leq t_{k} \\\\\ni \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} y_{i, h j}(t) \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}}\\left[\\log \\left(q_{i, h j, k}^{\\text {piece }}(t)\\right)\\right]+\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right) \\\\\n& \\times \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}}\\left[\\log \\left(1-q_{i, h j, k}^{\\text {piece }}(t)\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{k} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{k}}\\left[\\log \\left(g_{U_{i, h j, k}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nq_{i, h j, k}^{\\text {piece }}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}^{T} X_{i, h j}(t)+u_{i, h j, k}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\ng_{U_{i, h j, k}}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u_{i, h j, k}^{T}}{\\phi_{h j, k}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\phi_{h j, k}}}\n$$\n\nIn this case, we estimate the transition and time-dependent parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{h j, t}=\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}, \\phi_{h j, t}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\phi_{h j, t}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\phi_{h j, 1} \\text { if } t \\leq \\tau_{1} \\\\\n\\phi_{h j, 2} \\text { if } \\tau_{1}<t \\leq \\tau_{2} \\\\\n\\phi_{h j, 3} \\text { if } \\tau_{2}<t \\leq \\tau_{3}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{h j, t}$ takes constant values in specific time intervals as shown above. The parameter estimates are obtained using a modification of the EM algorithm presented in Appendix A.1.\n\n- Second, we introduce two distinct frailty components: $a_{i, h j}$, representing a time-varying frailty component, and $b_{i, h j}$ which captures the baseline frailty. These two components are jointly modeled as follows:\n\n$$\n\\binom{a_{i, h j}}{b_{i, h j}} \\sim N\\left(\\mathbf{0},\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\varphi_{h j} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\phi_{h j}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{h j}$ and $\\phi_{h j}$ denote the variances of the time-dependent frailty term $a_{i, h j}$ and the baseline term $b_{i, h j}$, respectively. The total frailty $u_{i, h j}(t)$ is modeled as a linear function of time:\n\n$$\nu_{i, h j}(t)=a_{i, h j} t+b_{i, h j}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i, h j}$ controls the time-dependent variation, while $b_{i, h j}$ provides the baseline frailty. Finally, the time- and transition-dependent transition probability is expressed as:\n\n$$\nq_{i, h j}^{\\text {line }}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t):=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left(-\\left(\\alpha_{h j, t}+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{h j}^{T} X_{i, h j}(t)+u_{i, h j}(t)\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ Segmenting the frailties as such enable us to monitor the potential change in the frailties variance throughout the duration of repayments, that is, at the beginning of repayments, in the middle of repayments, and at towards the end of repayments.\n    ${ }^{16}$ The maximum loan repayment duration observed is 7 months so $\\tau_{\\max }=7$.\n\nwhere $\\alpha_{h j, t}$ and $\\beta_{h j}$ are defined in previous sections. In this case, the condition expectation of the log-likelihood is given as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}_{U(t) \\mid \\xi_{t}}[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\right)] & =\\log \\left(L\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t}\\right) \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{t}\\left(\\sum_{(h, j) \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{\\substack{t \\in I \\cup D: \\\\\ni \\in \\Re_{h j}(t)}} y_{i, h j}(t) \\mathbb{E}_{U(t) \\mid \\xi_{t}}\\left[\\log \\left(q_{i, h j}^{\\text {line }}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)\\right)\\right]\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\left(1-y_{i, h j}(t)\\right) \\mathbb{E}_{U(t) \\mid \\xi_{t}}\\left[\\log \\left(1-q_{i, h j}^{\\text {line }}(\\boldsymbol{u}, t)\\right)\\right]+\\mathbb{E}_{U(t) \\mid \\xi_{t}}\\left[\\log \\left(g_{\\left(A_{i, h j}, B_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\right)\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{U(t) \\mid \\xi_{t}}\\left[\\log \\left(g_{\\left(A_{i, h j}, B_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\right)\\right]=\\mathbb{E}_{\\left(A_{i, h j}, B_{i, h j}\\right) \\mid \\xi_{t}}\\left[\\log \\left(g_{\\left(A_{i, h j}, B_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nand since the frailties are uncorrelated, we have\n\n$$\ng_{\\left(A_{i, h j}, B_{i, h j}\\right)}(\\boldsymbol{\\xi})=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u_{i, h j}^{2}}{\\varphi_{h j}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\varphi_{h j}}} \\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{b_{i, h j}^{2}}{\\varphi_{h j}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\phi_{h j}}}\n$$\n\nTo obtain the optimal parameters $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{t}$ in both the cases where $u_{i, h j}(t)$ is a piecewise function and in the case where it is a linear equation, we need to optimize the conditional expectation (see Appendix (A.1.1) for more details)\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}_{t}=-\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}(\\boldsymbol{t}) \\mid \\xi_{t}}[l\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{t} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}(t)\\right)]\n$$\n\n2.4.3. Bootstrapped analysis of parameters in the frailties models. To assess the statistical significance of the estimated parameters, we constructed empirical bootstrap confidence intervals (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) for the parameters based on 30 bootstrap resamples of the training data. These intervals were then used to evaluate the statistical significance of the parameters of interest. We conducted a limited number of bootstrap resamples due to the considerable time required for the optimization algorithm to process each resample ${ }^{17}$. The statistical significance of the parameters for both the time-dependent frailties models and the time-independent frailties models is reported in table 3, 4, and 5.", "tables": {}, "images":

{"section_id": 3, "text": "# 3. Performance of the models and analyses of the parameter estimates \n\nWe present the statistical significance of the parameters in the log-likelihood (LLink) models with fixed effects, timeindependent frailties, and time-dependent frailties. To the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has previously investigated the impact of social variables on repayment behavior in the microfinance framework.\n\nEarly exploration of different functional forms for the baseline function $\\alpha_{h j, t}$ led us to leave it unspecified. This approach provided a better fit to the data compared to other forms, such as cubic B-splines (Unser et al., 1993; Perperoglou et al., 2019), or assuming a constant baselines ${ }^{18}$. We believe the success of this choice is attributable to the short duration of repayments in microfinance, typically less than a year. Furthermore, we present the goodness of fit for each model using aggregated monthly residuals.\n3.1. Baseline in the LLink model. The use of a piecewise function to estimate $\\alpha_{h j, t}$ in the logit link model offers an intuitive method to analyze and compare the risk of each transition type at specific months. This approach leverages the discrete nature and relatively short duration of repayments in microfinance settings. This interpretation ${ }^{19}$ is particularly useful when comparing transitions from the same initial state, as illustrated in figure 3.2.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ Specifically, it took approximately 4 days and 3 hours to compute the bootstrap estimates for the parameters of the logit link (LLink) models, both with time-dependent and time-independent frailties, using this number of resamples. The optimization was carried out on an Apple Mac Mini with the following specifications: M2 Pro Chip, 32 GB unified memory, 12-core CPU, and 19-core GPU, utilizing the parallel computing capabilities of the machine.\n    ${ }^{18}$ It is important to note, however, that using a larger dataset would likely offer a more robust comparison of these methods.\n    ${ }^{19}$ It is important to note that interpreting the baseline coefficients alone is equivalent to setting the other coefficients in the model to zero so this ought to be kept in mind while before taking decisions.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3.1. Baselines under the two-state model\n\nWe observe that the baseline risk of making a transition from state 2 to state 1 is 0 at the first month of repayment. This is because all customers start their first repayments from state 1 and hence the model correctly estimate $\\alpha_{21,1}=0^{20}$.\n\nWe also observe that the risk of transitioning from state 2 to state 1 (indicating good cumulated repayments) is higher at the second and third months, while the risk of delinquency increases and remains higher (i.e. $\\alpha_{12, t}>\\alpha_{21, t}$ ) after the third month.\n\nIn the Three-state model, which reflects a more dynamic setting where repayments are not cumulative, we observe a clear tendency for transition-types associated with delinquency to become more prevalent as time progresses. This framework allows us not only to compare transitions originating from the same state but also to track how the duration of loan repayments influences delinquency patterns. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 3.2, the estimated transition parameter $\\hat{\\alpha}_{11, t}$ is greater than $\\hat{\\alpha}_{13, t}{ }^{2 t}$ in the first month of repayment, indicating that customers are more likely to make timely repayments. By the second month, the two functions converge, suggesting that delinquencies may begin to outnumber successful repayments, and this trend intensifies over time.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3.2. Baselines under the Three-state model\n3.2. Goodness of fit of models. In this section, we look at how well the models fit the data by computing monthly aggregated residuals, leveraging once again the discrete nature of the repayments process.\n\nRemark 3.2.1. After evaluating predictions in the two-state model, using both time-dependent and time-independent LLink frailty models, we occasionally observed improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the fixed-effect LLink models (see Section 4.1 for details). However, on average, the frailty models underperformed in predictive accuracy compared to other fixed-effect models, such as the KTBoost and the Random Forest. As a result, we opted to rely on the fixed-effect models for predictions in the multistate setting.\n\nTo assess how well the models fit the data, we follow (Djeundje and Crook, 2018) and compute the monthly aggregated deviance residuals, $D_{h j}(t)$ for transitions from state $h$ to $j$ as follows\n\n$$\nD_{h j}(t)=\\operatorname{sign}\\left(O_{h j}(t)-E_{h j}(t)\\right)\\left(2\\left(O_{h j}(t) \\log \\left(\\frac{O_{h j}(t)}{E_{h j}(t)}\\right)+\\left(N_{h j}(t)-O_{h j}(t)\\right) \\log \\left(\\frac{N_{h j}(t)-O_{h j}(t)}{N_{h j}(t)-E_{h j}(t)}\\right)\\right)\\right)^{0.5}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ This pattern is similarly observed at the repayment time (in the Three-state model) where $\\alpha_{21,1}=\\alpha_{23,1}=\\alpha_{31,1}=\\alpha_{32,1}=0$.\n    ${ }^{21}$ The rationale for constructing models $(1,1)$ and $(1,3)$, rather than $(1,2)$ and $(1,3)$, in the Three-state case is that the estimated probabilities of transitioning from an initial state $h$ to state 3 are generally more stable than those to state 2 using the data we worked with. This is because there are significantly more transitions to state 1 and state 3, making these estimates more stable.\n\nwhere $N_{h j}(t)=\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{h j}(t)\\right|$ is the number of accounts at risk of transition just before time $t, O_{h j}(t)$ being the observed number of transitions from state $h$ at time $t-1$ to state $j$ at time $t$, and $E_{h j}(t)=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}_{h j}(t)} \\hat{q}_{i, h j}(t)$. We can observe in figure 3.3 that the logit link (LLink) model regression tends fit the data well in many cases ${ }^{22}$.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3.3. Aggregated monthly deviance residuals for Two-state model\nThe goodness of fit for the two-state model indicates that nearly all aggregated residuals fall within the range $[-2,2]$, with no discernible trends. This suggests that all models fit the data relatively well.\n\nIn the Three-state model, we observe no particular trend in the residuals except in model $(2,3)$ where the residuals tend to take a quadratic form, and in model $(3,1)$ towards the end of repayments, where the residuals indicate that the model seems to underestimate recoveries from bad repayments. A similar issue is observed in model $(3,3)$ during the last month of repayments. A parameter tuning exercise for each model, as well as selecting the optimal parameters per model, is likely to significantly improve the fit of these models.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3.4. Aggregated monthly deviance residuals for Three-state model\n3.3. Statistical significance of parameters. One of the objectives of this work is to investigate the impact of some social factors on loan delinquency in microfinance. To achieve this, we considered two key social factors:\n(1) Eid celebration: This factor encompasses various periods during the year when Muslims observe fasting and festivities.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{22}$ We would like to emphasize, however, that because we looked at comparing models with the same set of variables, no parameter tuning has been implemented; therefore the fit of all models may improve significantly when this done.\n\n(2) Long vacation: This refers to the time of the year when students are on long school break, and parents prepare for the upcoming academic year.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1. Parameter significance in the Two-state model with fixed-effects covariates\n3.3.1. LLink model with fixed effects (two-state model). Table 1 indicates that the impact of the social variables in both models (highlighted in blue) is significant, with negative estimates (except the estimate of \"Long vacation\" for model $(2,1)$ ). This implies that, all other covariates being constant, accounts have a lower risk of experiencing a delinquency (i.e. moving from state 1 to state 2 ) during the celebration of Eid and during long vacations. This can be justified by the fact that in developing economies, during long vacations, parents do not have to pay school fees and other related expenses, and children tend to assist parents in the market thus reducing the financial burdens. On the other hand, accounts are more likely to transition from state 2 to state 1 during long vacation, indicating that customers are more likely repay during this period. Furthermore, the negative estimate of from \"Eid\" indicates that customer are also less likely to experience transitions of type $(2,1)$. This does no contradict the interpretation of the transition $(1,2)$ for this covariate, as the average probability of an account making a $(1,2)$ transition is still less than that of making a $(2,1)$ (i.e. $\\frac{1}{1+e^{1.365266}}<\\frac{1}{1+e^{0.062508}}$ ). The likelihood of better repayments during Eid could be attributed to the fact that customers are more disciplined with their spending during this period, as they spend less money on items, or activities not allowed during the festivities.\n\nFrom table 1, we also observe that being in a group ${ }^{24}$ is more likely to increase the risk of delinquency, contrary to popular beliefs. This result may be specific to this institution and may serve as a warning to pay closer attention to accounts with group loans. On the other hand, the group covariate is not statistically significant for transition $(2,1)$.\n\nThe two macroeconomic variables used are significant (except for the foreign exchange covariate for model $(2,1)$ ). Accounts held by female customers are, on average, less likely to be delinquent compared to those held by male customers, and the age grouping (constructed based on Silinskas et al. (2021)) appears to play no significant role in the models. Indicators for past delinquencies and good behavior are highly significant, supporting the claim that past behaviors influence future repayments in our setting. Another important factor that seems to reduce delinquency are monthly repayments.\n\nRegarding the \"married\" covariate, we see that, on average, married individuals are more likely to repay compared to other marital status groups, providing insight into which accounts may repay better.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{23}$ In our work, gender is represented as either male or female, as provided in the dataset.\n    ${ }^{24}$ This refers to the covariate \"Group loan\", which indicates whether a loan was taken as a group (of many accounts) or not.\n\n3.3.2. LLink model with fixed effects (Three-state model). Below we present the Three-state table of Logit link with fixed effect.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable 2. Parameter significance in the Three-state model with fixed-effects covariates\n\nWe observe once again that social factors (highlighted in blue) and the indicator of group repayment (highlighted in green) are statistically significant. This suggests that incorporating social and local factors, as well as a group repayment indicator, when building credit risk models for financial inclusion, can enhance our understanding of account-level delinquency. These findings underscore the importance of considering socio-economic variables to improve the accuracy and relevance of credit risk assessments.\n3.3.3. Three-state LLink model with (time-independent) frailties. Here we present the Three-state LLink model with time-independent frailties.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nTable 3. Statistical significance of parameters in the Three-state model with time-independent frailty\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{35}$ Count of number of medium delinquency (repaid between 50\\%) and $90 \\%$ of amount - Check definition of Three-state model in Section 2\n    ${ }^{36}$ Count of number of bad delinquency (nothing repaid)\n    ${ }^{37}$ Consumer Price index (lagged)\n    ${ }^{38}$ Foreign Exchange Rate (lagged)\n\nThe table shows that out of the six transition-dependent frailty models, only two frailty parameters are statistically significant-specifically, the frailty variances for model $(2,1)$ and $(2,3)$. This suggests that unobserved effects have significant impacts on transitions from state 2 . Moreover, we notice that social variables are only significant in transitions from state 1 and state 3. In contrast, the group loan indicator, as well as several covariates that were significant in the fixed-effects models, are no longer significant in these models.\n\nThe statistical significance of the frailty parameters indicates the presence of unobserved heterogeneity affecting the transition-specific models, suggesting that there are latent factors that influence certain transition types. Further investigation into these latent factors may help enhance model completeness and interpretability.\n3.3.4. Three-state LLink model with (time-dependent) frailties: Case when frailty is a linear equation. We assume here that the frailty is a given as a linear function of time.\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nTable 4. Parameter significance in the Three-state model with the frailty following a linear time-dependent structure\n\nIn the case where the frailty is modeled as a linear equation, we observe that the frailty parameters $\\phi_{21}, \\varphi_{21}$ in model $(2,1)$ are the only statistically significant frailty components across all models. Additionally, none of the social variables are statistically significant, and many of the covariates that were significant in the fixed-effects models are no longer significant in these models. The lack of statistical significance for most covariates suggests that the linear frailty model may not effectively capture the unobserved heterogeneity present in the data.\n3.3.5. Three-state LLink model with (time-dependent) frailties: Case when frailty is a piecewise function. We assume here that the frailty is given by a piecewise function of time.\n\n![table_4](table_4)\n\nTable 5. Parameter significance in the Three-state model with time-dependent piecewise frailty\n\nAll frailty parameters are significant during the period $\\tau_{0}<t \\leq \\tau_{1}$. The group loan indicator is statistically significant in some models, whereas the social variables are not in any of the models. This suggests that the inclusion of frailties may capture much of the heterogeneity that would otherwise be attributed to social factors. Age group covariates are now statistically significant in most models, with the exception of model $(2,1)$. Additionally, the statistical significance of frailty parameters diminishes over time: all frailties estimates are significant for $\\tau_{0}<t \\leq \\tau_{1}$, two frailty parameters remain significant for $\\tau_{1}<t \\leq \\tau_{2}$, and none are significant for $\\tau_{2}<t \\leq \\tau_{\\max }$. This indicates that unobserved heterogeneity has a larger impact on repayments behavior early in the repayment period, but its influence decreases as time progresses.\n\nThese findings confirm the presence of unobserved heterogeneity in repayment patterns, as evidenced by the statistical significance of frailty parameters in many instances. While the effects of frailties may not be captured perfectly\u2014potentially due to assumptions about their prior distribution\u2014these results underscore the substantial influence frailties have on the models ${ }^{29}$.\n\nDespite revealing the role of unobserved heterogeneity at the transition-type level, we did not observe clear improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the L-Link model (see Section 4.1). As a result, we rely on the fixed-effect parameters for predicting events in the multistate case.\n3.4. Accuracy of prediction. In this section, we first clarify the derivation of competing transition probabilities in the Three-state model. We then discuss two methods for predicting future landing states at the individual account level over both short and longer duration.\n3.4.1. Competing risks in multistate model. Under our Three-state delinquency model, the probabilities shown in (2.1) represent non-competing transition probabilities, in the sense that they ignore the competing nature of multiple transitions originating from the same state. Under mild conditions (Dickson et al., 2019), the underlying competing transition probabilities, which we denote by $\\hat{q}_{i, h j}$, can be computed as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{q}_{i, h j}(t)=\\hat{q}_{i, h j}(t)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\substack{k \\neq j \\\\ (h, k) \\in S}} \\hat{q}_{i, h k}(t)+\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{\\substack{k \\neq j \\neq r \\neq \\\\\n(h, k) \\in S}} \\hat{q}_{i, h k}(t) \\hat{q}_{i, h r}(t)\\right)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ This impact is particularly noticeable in parameters such as age categories in model $(2,1)$, which become significant in the piecewise models with the inclusion of frailties, whereas they were not in the fixed-effects model.\n\nSuch competing transition probabilities can be used to construct the transition probability matrix, $\\tilde{P}_{1}(t)$. Hence, the cumulative probability between two time points $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$, which we denote by $\\tilde{P}_{1}\\left(t_{1}, t_{2}\\right),\\left(t_{1}<t_{2}\\right)$, can be computed as:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{P}_{i}\\left(t_{1}, t_{2}\\right)=\\prod_{t=t_{1}+1}^{t_{2}} \\tilde{P}_{i}(t)\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can then extract the vector\n\n$$\nv_{i}\\left(t_{2}\\right)=\\left(\\mathbb{1}_{\\{h=1\\}}\\left(t_{1}\\right), \\mathbb{1}_{\\{h=2\\}}\\left(t_{1}\\right), \\mathbb{1}_{\\{h=3\\}}\\left(t_{1}\\right)\\right) \\tilde{P}_{i}\\left(t_{1}, t_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich represents the vector of probabilities that an account $i$ in an initial state $h$ at time $t_{1}$ lands in a state $j \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ at time $t_{2}$, and where $\\mathbb{1}_{\\{h=i\\}}\\left(t_{1}\\right)$ indicates the initial state of account $i$ at time $t_{1}$.\n3.4.2. Optimized Matthews Correlation Coefficient (OMCC). In this section, we propose a new approach, the OMCC, to predict the next landing state -from underlying transition probabilities $\\tilde{q}_{i, h j}$ estimated- in a multistate setting. The OMCC method is based on the Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC - See for details Chicco and Jurman (2023); Chicco et al. (2021)), and builds on the approach developed in Djeundje and Crook (2018), which we abbreviate as D\\&C to estimate the optimal vector of cut-off points to predict the next state.\n\nFirst, we provide an overview of the latter approach. Let us consider an account $i$ in state $h$ at time $t_{1}$. Let $\\tilde{q}_{i, h 1}, \\tilde{q}_{i, h 2}, \\tilde{q}_{i, h 3}$ represent the predicted competing probabilities that the account will land in state $1,2,3$, respectively, at time $t_{2}$. The authors predict this borrower to be in state $j$ base on the discrepancy measure\n\n$$\n\\tilde{q}_{i, h j}-\\tilde{c}_{h j}=\\max \\left\\{\\tilde{q}_{i, h 1}-\\tilde{c}_{h 1}, \\tilde{q}_{i, h 2}-\\tilde{c}_{h 2}, \\tilde{q}_{i, h 3}-\\tilde{c}_{h 3}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(\\tilde{c}_{h 1}, \\tilde{c}_{h 2}, \\tilde{c}_{h 3}\\right)$ is the optimal vector of cut-off points estimated from the likelihood function\n\n$$\nf_{h}(\\boldsymbol{a})=\\frac{1}{N_{h}\\left(t_{1}\\right)} \\sum_{i\\left\\{\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{1}\\right)=h\\right.}\\left\\{\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2} \\mid \\boldsymbol{a}\\right)=\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\n$N_{h}\\left(t_{1}\\right)$ is the number of accounts in state $h$ at time $t_{1}, \\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2} \\mid \\boldsymbol{a}\\right)$ represents the next state predicted based on some initial vector of cut-off points $\\boldsymbol{a}=\\left(a_{h 1}, a_{h 2}, a_{h 3}\\right)$, and $\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2}\\right)$ is the true state observed at time $t_{2}$.\n\nThe method we propose utilizes the discrepancy measure (3.4) to determine the next landing state but replaces the likelihood function (See (Yilmaz and Demirhan, 2023) for more details) with the multistate version of the MCC function (3.7). Let $h, h_{k} \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and denote by $\\mathbb{1}_{\\left(h, h_{k}\\right)}$ the indicator of transitions from a fixed initial state $h$ to $h_{k}$. Given a fixed initial state $h \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, we define the count of transition type $\\left(h, h_{k}\\right)$ predicted to be transition type $\\left(h, h_{m}\\right)$ as\n\n$$\nn_{h_{k} h_{m}}:=n_{\\left(\\left(h, h_{k}\\right),\\left(h, h_{m}\\right)\\right)}=\\sum_{i\\left\\{\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{1}\\right)=h\\right.}\\left\\{\\delta_{\\left\\{\\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2}\\right) \\mid \\boldsymbol{a}\\right\\}}=h_{m}, \\delta_{i}\\left(t_{2}\\right)=h_{k}\\right\\}}, \\quad h_{k}, h_{m} \\in\\{1,2,3\\}\n$$\n\nThe above can be summarized in the following confusion matrix\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\nTable 6. Confusion table to setup OMCC\n\nThe elements on the diagonal (except $n_{h}$, which is the total number of accounts at risk of transition from state $h$ ) represent the correct number of predictions for transition-types $(h, 1),(h, 2)$, and $(h, 3)$ respectively. The off-diagonal elements represent misclassified transition-types, $n_{\\cdot h_{i}}$ are the total number of predictions of type $\\left(\\cdot, h_{i}\\right)$, and $n_{h_{i}}$ are the total number of predictions of type $\\left(h_{i}, \\cdot\\right)$. From here, we define the likelihood function to estimate the optimal cut-off\n\npoints $\\left(\\hat{c}_{h 1}, \\hat{c}_{h 2}, \\hat{c}_{h 3}\\right)$ as the multiclass multiclass $M C C_{h}$ function ${ }^{30}$\n\n$$\nM C C_{h}(\\boldsymbol{a})=M C C_{h}\\left(a_{h 1}, a_{h 2}, a_{h 3}\\right)=\\frac{n_{h} \\sum_{i}^{\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{h}\\right|} n_{h_{i} h_{i}}-\\sum_{i}^{\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{h}\\right|} n_{h_{i}} \\cdot n_{\\cdot h_{i}}}{\\sqrt{\\left(n_{h}^{2}-\\sum_{i}^{\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{h}\\right|} n_{h_{i}}^{2}\\right)\\left(n_{h}^{2}-\\sum_{i}^{\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{h}\\right|} n_{\\cdot h_{i}}^{2}\\right)}}\n$$\n\nwhere $h$ is a fixed initial sate at time $t_{1}$, and $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{h}\\right|$ is the number of unique initial states in the model.

Predictions\n\nIn this section, we first present the accuracy of predictions from all models in the two-state case.\n4.1. Predictions in the Two-state model. The probability of experiencing a transition-type $(h, j)$ at given time $t$ can be computed using the estimated parameters from each transition-dependent model. In binary classification problems, it is often essential to determine a cut-off point to accurately identify the next state. To achieve this, we rely on ROC analysis (Hoo et al., 2017) for the two-states case. For comparison, we assessed the predictive accuracy of each model within the two-state framework. The performance of these models was assessed over two time periods: from $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$, and from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$, with the results in the following tables.\n\nUnder the ROC method, we obtain optimal cut-off points, which then enable us to construct the following tables:\n\nTable 7. Accuracy model $(1,2)$ from $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$\n\n![table_6](table_6)\n\nTable 8. Accuracy model $(2,1)$ from $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$\n\n![table_7](table_7)\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{30}$ The advantage of searching for an optimal cut-off points using the MCC is that it generates a high quality score only if the prediction correctly classified a high percentage of negative data samples and a high percentage of positive data samples, with any class balance or imbalance.\n\nTable 9. Accuracy model $(1,2)$ from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$\n\n![table_8](table_8)\n\nTable 10. Accuracy model $(2,1)$ from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$\n\n![table_9](table_9)\n\nWe can observe that for $t_{1}=1$ and $t_{2}=2$, the models predict well but the accuracy decreases in the case of $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4^{35}$. The reduction in accuracy is expected because predicting further into the future introduces more uncertainty, causing probabilities to mix through the cumulative matrix and reducing the overall prediction accuracy. However, on average, predictions to the delinquency state (i.e. state 2) are more accurate compared to predictions from the delinquent state to the good state.\n\nAs shown in table 3, table 4, and table 5, both the time-independent and time-dependent frailty models produced frailty variance estimates that were statistically significant in many cases, in particular when the frailties are piecewise functions of time. However, as shown in above tables, the prediction accuracy of these models were not consistently better than that of the fixed-effects LLink models. In fact, the frailty models often underperformed compared to other fixed-effects models, such as the Kernel and Tree Boosting (KTBoost) model and the Random Forest (RF). For these reasons, we stick to predicting probabilities in the multistate using only one of the fixed effects models (i.e. the $\\mathrm{RF}^{36}$ ).\n4.2. Predictions in multistate model. Using the methods presented in Section 3.4.2, we predict ${ }^{37}$ the next landing state at time $t_{2}$ from a state $h$ at an initial time $t_{1}$, and further compare the OMCC to D\\&C. The accuracy of each method (including their extensions through the discrepancy measure (3.9)) is displayed in table 11 and table 12. These tables further show the accuracy from an initial state $h^{38}$ to a specific set of states. When looking at the accuracy of prediction from $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$, the results of both approaches are exactly similar (i.e. MCC versus ${ }^{39} \\mathrm{D} \\& \\mathrm{C}$, and OMCC+sd. versus $\\mathrm{D} \\& \\mathrm{C}+\\mathrm{sd}$.) except from state 2 , where the accuracy from OMCC+sd. is slightly bigger than all other approaches.\n\nWhen $t_{1}=2$ and $t_{2}=4$ (i.e. table 12), the difference in results from both methods become more pronounced. The OMCC (and OMCC+sd.) have in general a higher accuracy when predicting delinquent states, while D\\&C and D\\&C+sd. have a slightly higher average accuracy when predicting to state 1 as well as to all states.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ Mean accuracy based on 500 bootstraps of $u_{i, h j} \\sim N\\left(0, \\phi_{h j}\\right), 500$ bootstraps of $u_{i, h j, k} \\sim\\left(0, \\phi_{h j, k}\\right)$ for $k \\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, and 500 bootstraps of $\\left(a_{i, h j}, b_{i, h j}\\right) \\sim\\left(\\mathbf{0},\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\varphi_{h j} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\phi_{h j}\\end{array}\\right)\\right)$ for the the cases of time-independent frailties, piecewise time-dependent frailties, and the case where fraity is a linear function of time, respectively.\n    ${ }^{32} \\mathrm{ti}=$ time independent\n    ${ }^{33} \\mathrm{td}-\\mathrm{L}=$ time dependent - line\n    ${ }^{34} \\mathrm{td}-\\mathrm{P}=$ time dependent - piecewise\n    ${ }^{35}$ Additionally, when focusing on model $(2,1)$ from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$, we can see the accuracy of the RF model and the LLink models are higher than that of $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$. This is because these models predict transitions from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=3$ more accurately, thereby improving the overall prediction accuracy from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$.\n    ${ }^{36}$ The RF was selected as it was able to predict on average well from $t_{1}=1$ to $t_{2}=2$, and from $t_{1}=2$ to $t_{2}=4$ - i.e over a longer duration.\n    ${ }^{37}$ The training and test sets represent $80 \\%$ and $20 \\%$ of the full data, respectively.\n    ${ }^{38}$ i.e. The average accuracy of predictions over all possible transitions from an initial state $h$\n    ${ }^{39}$ versus $=$ compared to\n\nTable 11.

A bootstrap study of the performance of OMCC and D\\&C. In this section, we compare the prediction accuracy of the OMCC and D\\&C using 50 bootstrap resamples, drawn with replacement from the full set of accounts. For each resample, we divide the data into a training set ( $80 \\%$ of unique accounts) and a test set ( $20 \\%$ of unique accounts), and evaluate the prediction accuracy of each method.\n\nThe average accuracy over all resamples shows that the OMCC method achieves slightly higher accuracy when predicting delinquent states (i.e. state 2 and state 3) compared to the D\\&C method. This supports findings in the literature that highlight the good discriminating power of the MCC, as it does not overly weight the class with the highest occurrences during optimization, making it a viable alternative to standard industry methods (Chicco and Jurman, 2023; Chicco et al., 2021). On the other hand, in the case of predicting recovery from delinquency, the D\\&C method performs slightly better on average. Additionally, D\\&C has the highest overall accuracy on average.\n\nTable 13. Prediction accuracy performance per method for $t_{1}=1$ and $t_{2}=2$\n\n![table_12](table_12)\n\nTable 14.

CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK \n\nMicrofinance institutions play an important role in developing countries by providing essential financial services to low-income individuals and entities typically excluded from traditional banking services. This paper discusses models for the analysis of repayment behaviors of microloans. Various model structures are considered, some of them involving the use of frailty parameters to capture unobserved heterogeneity in the data. Additionally, machine learning substitutes to some models' components are considered and implemented.\n\nApplying these models to a recent dataset of microloans in Ghana, we have been able to highlight the significant importance of social factors such as \"Eid celebration\" and \"Long vacation\" to the understanding of microloan repayments at account level. This is the first time that the impact of such factors on the loan delinquency process is being assessed, especially in the context of developing economies. Additionally, we found that the frailty parameters used to capture unobserved heterogeneity were statistically significant in many cases, particularly in the time-dependent piecewise frailty models. As part of this work, we also constructed a performance metric (OMCC) and used it alongside an existing metric (D\\&C) to assess the predictive performance of different model structures. Our results highlight how both metrics complement each other and can be used as effective risk management tools.\n\nThe work in this paper can be extended in several ways. One immediate area of interest is exploring microloan repayment behaviors at the group level, given the prevalence of group lending in microfinance in developing countries. Key questions to investigate include determining the optimal group compositions and sizes to minimize delinquencies and establish fairer interest rates. Addressing these issues would enhance decision-making processes and help reduce the burden of high-interest rates on borrowers.\n\nAcknowledgment.

Additionally, given the small size of our event data, estimating parameters separately for each transition type is likely to yield more stable estimates than combining them into a single, comprehensive log-likelihood scheme.\n\nThe convergence of this algorithm results in a classifier $(D, \\Theta),\\left.\\Theta=\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_{k}\\right)\\right)_{k}$, where $\\hat{\\theta}_{k}$ is the optimal split based on each covariate.\n\nA random forest is therefore a collection of tree classifiers $\\left\\{\\left(D^{(r)}, \\Theta_{r}\\right)\\right\\}_{r \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, where $\\left\\{\\Theta_{r}\\right\\}$ are independently and identically distributed random vectors and $D^{(r)}$ is data which is sampled with replacement from the training set. A majority voting is then implemented to classify input based on the most voted class.\n\nKernel and Tree Boosting. The KTboost model, developed by (Sigrist, 2021), is a boosting algorithm combining Kernel boosting and tree boosting to form the ensemble of optimal based learners to minimize the empirical risk. At each boosting iteration, the algorithm chooses either to add a regression tree or a penalized Reproducing Hilbert Kernel Space (RKHS - also known as ridge regression (Gretton, 2013)) regression function to the collection of base learners (Freund et al., 1996) used in the optimization. The advantage of such approach is the flexibility of choosing between the 2 outputs thus improving the fitting of the model while dealing with different type of regularities such as discontinuities in the case of regression trees and smoothness in the case of the RKHS. In the case of boosting, the objective is to find a minimizer $F: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ of the empirical risk function $R(F)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\arg \\min _{F(\\cdot) \\in \\Omega_{\\mathcal{S}}}(R(F))=\\arg \\min _{F(\\cdot) \\in \\Omega_{\\mathcal{S}}} \\sum_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}_{h_{j}}(t)} L\\left(y_{i}, F\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{R}_{h_{j}}(t)$ is defined as in the previous section, $L(Y, X)$ is a loss function selected based on the problem at hand, that is, a binary classification, regression, multi class classification, etc, (see for example (Wang et al., 2020)), $\\Omega_{\\mathcal{S}}$ is the span of $\\mathcal{S}$ of a set of base learners $\\mathcal{S}=\\left\\{f_{j}: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}$. The minimizer $F^{*}$ is is found in a sequential way by updating\n\n$$\nF_{m}(x)=F_{m-1}(x)+f_{m}(x), f_{m} \\in \\mathcal{S}, m=1, \\ldots, M\n$$\n\nsuch that\n\n$$\nf_{m}=\\arg \\min _{f \\in \\mathcal{S}} R\\left(F_{m-1}+f\\right)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand RKHS assume a a positive definite kernel function $K: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}: \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. In this case, there exists a RKHS $\\mathcal{H}$ such that $\\mathrm{K}(\\cdot, x)$ belongs to $\\mathcal{H} \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and the inner product $f(x)=\\langle f, K(\\cdot, X)\\rangle \\forall f \\in \\mathcal{H}$. The objective is to minimize a function of the form\n\n$$\n\\arg \\min _{f \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\sum_{i \\in I \\subset \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}_{h_{j}}(t)}\\left(y_{i}-f\\left(x_{i}\\right)\\right)^{2}+\\lambda\\|f\\|_{\\mathcal{H}}^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda \\geq 0$ is a regularization parameter.\n\nKTBoost (combining regression and Tree boosting).

The KTBoost algorithm then selects either the Tree function or the RKHS function such that the addition to the collection of base learners results in a lower risk.\nA.2.1. The trapezoid rule. The trapezoid rule (Atkinson, 1991) is a widely used numerical technique for approximating definite integrals by dividing the integration range into small subintervals and estimating the area under the curve using trapezoids. Although commonly applied to single-variable integrals, the method can be naturally extended to handle multivariable integrals. To validate our approach, we introduce the method in detail and present a benchmark study to assess its performance and accuracy in the integration process.\n\nA.2.2. The trapezoid rule in 1D. Let $\\left\\{x_{k}\\right\\}$ be a partition of the finite interval $[a, b]$ such that $a=x_{0}<x_{1}<\\cdots<x_{N-1}<$ $x_{N}=b$, and $\\Delta x=\\Delta x_{n}=\\frac{b-a}{N}$ (i.e. we assume a uniform grid spacing). The definite integral in of $f(x)$ can then be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\mathrm{d} x \\simeq \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\\left(f\\left(x_{0}\\right)+2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f\\left(x_{i}\\right)+f\\left(x_{N}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of subintervals.\nA.2.3. The trapezoid rule in 2D. Let consider $\\left\\{x_{k}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{y_{k}\\right\\}$ be the partitions of the finite intervals $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$ respectively. The integral of $f(x, y)$ over the rectangular region $[a, b] \\times[c, d]$ (Press, 2007) can be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} \\int_{c}^{d} f(x, y) \\mathrm{d} y \\mathrm{~d} x \\simeq \\frac{\\Delta x \\Delta y}{4}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{N_{x}} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_{y}} w_{i, j} f\\left(x_{i}, x_{j}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n- $\\Delta_{x}=\\frac{b-a}{N_{x}}, \\Delta_{y}=\\frac{d-c}{N_{y}}$,\n- $N_{x}$ and $N_{y}$ are the number of subintervals along the $x$-axis and $y$-axis.\n- $w_{i, j}=1 / 4$ for the four corner points: i.e. $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right),\\left(x_{0}, y_{N_{x}}\\right),\\left(x_{N_{x}}, y_{0}\\right),\\left(x_{N_{x}}, y_{N_{y}}\\right)$.\n- $w_{i, j}=1 / 2$ for points on the edges : these are boundary points that are not corners, i.e., $x_{i}$ with $i=1,2, \\ldots, N_{x}-1$ along $y_{0}$ and $y_{N}$, and $y_{j}$ with $j=1,2, \\ldots, N_{y}-1$ along $x_{0}$ and $x_{N}$.\n- $w_{i, j}=1$ for interior points: these are points neither on the boundary nor corners, i.e. points which satisfy $1 \\leq i \\leq N_{x}-1$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq N_{y}-1$.\nIn our work, we opt for the trapezoid rule due to its computational efficiency. Although adaptive quadrature methods generally offer higher accuracy by adjusting to the local behavior of the integrand, they are significantly slower, particularly in scenarios where integrals need to be re-evaluated multiple times for convergence, such as in our optimization process. The trapezoid rule, being much faster, is therefore a better choice despite its comparatively lower accuracy.\n\nTo validate this choice, we provide benchmarking results that compare the performance of the trapezoid rule (Prentice et al., 1978) against adaptive quadrature (Virtanen et al., 2020a) in both 1D and 2D integration scenarios using the accuracy measure ${ }^{44} 100 \\times \\frac{\\left|I_{T}-I_{Q}\\right|}{I_{Q}}$, where $I_{T}$ and $I_{Q}$ are integral values using the trapezoid rule and an adaptive quadrature method (see for more details quad, dblquad, nquad from Scientific Python (Virtanen et al., 2020a)), respectively. More specifically,\n\n- In the case of the time-independent frailty models, we compute the integral $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{U}_{h j} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{\\text {fixed }}}\\left\\{t \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{\\text {fixed }} \\mid \\boldsymbol{y}, \\boldsymbol{u}_{h j}\\right\\}\\right\\}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}^{\\text {fixed }}$ is a vector of fixed parameters ${ }^{45}$. The following table shows the comparison about both methods in this case\n\n![table_14](table_14)\n\nTable 15.

Table 16 shows the comparison about both methods in the piecewise case\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{44}$ This helps to compare the accuracy of the trapezoid integration value $I_{T}$ in terms of absolute value of the Bias relative to the value of the adaptive quadrature integration value $I_{Q}$.\n    45 . The parameters are fixed so that we can easily compare the two integration outputs from the methods\n\n![table_15](table_15)\n\nTable 16.

The models are designed to account\nfor both partial repayments and the short repayment durations typical in\nmicrofinance, focusing on estimating the probability of transitions between two\nor three repayment states, including delinquency. Social variables, such as\nreligious and cultural factors, were found to play a statistically significant\nrole in influencing repayment behavior, highlighting the impact of societal\ndynamics on financial outcomes. We explored both time-independent and\ntime-dependent frailty models to capture unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the\nfindings emphasize the importance of social factors in delinquency but suggest\nlimited predictive gains from incorporating frailties into multistate models.", "updated": "2024-10-17T00:05:17Z", "published": "2024-10-17T00:05:17Z"}
