Introduction and main THEOREM\n\nIntroduction. The subrank, border subrank, and asymptotic subrank play central roles in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (value of a tensor [Str87]) and quantum information theory (asymptotic structure of the capacity of a quantum channel [Wat18]).\n\nA central problem in computer science is to study the complexity of matrix multiplication, which is governed by a constant called the exponent of matrix multiplication. This is denoted by $\\omega$ and defined as the infimum over $\\tau$ such that the $n \\times n$ matrices may be multiplied using $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{\\tau}\\right)$ arithmetic operations. It is known that $2 \\leq \\omega \\leq 3$ and Strassen's original algorithm [Str69] shows that $\\omega \\leq \\log _{2}(7)<2.81$. Since then, several approaches have been developed to find an upper bound on $\\omega$ or even show that $\\omega$ is 2 . The most effective upper bound method found so far is the laser method, which was first introduced by Strassen [Str87]. A key idea is to find an intermediate tensor $T$ which has low asymptotic rank (low cost) and is \"close to\" being a matrix multiplication tensor (high value). The tensor rank measures the \"cost\" of a tensor and the subrank measures the \"value\" of a tensor.\n\nIt is natural to study how well any sufficiently general tensor $T \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ performs on these criteria. For rank and border rank, this is well known: rank and border rank of such a $T$ are the same and equal to the maximal border rank, namely, $\\left\\lceil\\frac{n^{3}}{3 n-2}\\right\\rceil$ [Lic85] (except for $n=3$, where the border-rank-4 tensors form a hypersurface of degree 9 defined by Strassen's equation [LO13, Str83]).\n\nOnly much more recently has the subrank of any sufficiently general tensor been determined: in [DMZ24], this is shown to be in the (small) interval\n\n$$\n[3\\lfloor\\sqrt{n / 3+1 / 4}-1 / 2\\rfloor,\\lfloor\\sqrt{3 n-2}\\rfloor]\n$$\n\nThe upper bound in this interval was conjectured to be the correct value for the generic subrank, and indeed, this conjecture was proved in [P\u0160S24].\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    BB and FR are supported by Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project grants 200021191981 and 200021-227864, and JD is partially supported by those grants and partially supported by Vici grant 639.033.514 from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). CC is supported by NSF grant AF-2203618.\n\nIn particular, the generic subrank is $\\Theta\\left(n^{1 / 2}\\right)$, which improves the previous upper bound $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2 / 3}\\right)$ by B\u00fcrgisser [B\u00fc97] and Strassen [STR91].\n\nFor the border subrank, so far very little was known, other than that the border subrank of a sufficiently general tensor in $\\mathbb{C}^{n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is bounded above by $n-1$; see the invariant-theoretic argument due to Fulvio Gesmundo in [Cha24]. The goal of this paper is to dramatically improve the upper bound on the generic border subrank to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{1 / 2}\\right)$, matching the growth rate $\\Theta\\left(n^{1 / 2}\\right)$ for the generic subrank from [DMZ24]. Furthermore, combining our result with the results from [DMZ24], we will establish that the generic subrank and the generic border subrank do not coincide for $n \\gg 0$.\n(Border) subrank. Throughout, we fix an integer $d \\geq 2$ and work over an arbitrary algebraically closed field $K$. Let $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{d}$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces. The subrank of a tensor $T \\in V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ is the maximal $r$ for which there exist linear maps $\\varphi_{i}: V_{i} \\rightarrow K^{r}, i=1, \\ldots, d$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\varphi_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\varphi_{d}\\right) T=I_{r}:=\\sum_{i=1}^{r} e_{i}^{\\otimes d} \\in\\left(K^{r}\\right)^{\\otimes d}\n$$\n\nHere $e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{r}$ is the standard basis of $K^{r}$, and $I_{r}$ is called the $r$-th unit tensor. For $d=3$, the subrank of $T$ was introduced in theoretical computer science by Strassen [Str87] as a measure of the value of $T$-it measures how many independent scalar multiplications can be linearly embedded in the bilinear map $V_{1}^{*} \\times V_{2}^{*} \\rightarrow V_{3}$ encoded by $T$.\n\nThe border subrank of $T$ is the maximal $r$ for which $I_{r}$ lies in the (Zariski) closure of the set\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\left(\\varphi_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\varphi_{d}\\right) T \\mid \\varphi_{i} \\in \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(V_{i}, K^{r}\\right), i=1, \\ldots, d\\right\\}\n$$\n\nClearly, the border subrank of $T$ is at least the subrank of $T$. When $d=2$, equality holds, and both notions agree with the matrix rank of $T$. Another immediate observation is that the border subrank of $T$ is at most the rank of $T$ when regarded as a linear map $\\bigotimes_{j \\neq i} V_{i}^{*} \\rightarrow V_{i}$, for any $i \\in[d]:=\\{1, \\ldots, d\\}$, and hence at most $\\min _{i} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$.\n\nGeneric subrank. The locus of tensors of subrank precisely $r$ in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ is a constructible set, and hence there exists a unique $r$ for which this locus is dense. This $r$ is called the generic subrank of tensors in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ and is denoted $Q\\left(n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{d}\\right)$ where $n_{i}=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(V_{i}\\right), i=1, \\ldots, d$. It was proved in [DMZ24] that $Q(n, n, \\ldots, n)=\\Theta\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. First, and for general $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{d}$, they upper bound the dimension of the subrank $\\geq r$ locus by estimating the rank of the derivative of a natural morphism parameterising the locus of tensors of subrank $\\geq r$ (this locus is irreducible). This yields $Q(n, n, \\ldots, n)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$. The lower bound involves a clever construction showing that the rank estimate is essentially tight. For $d=3$, the results are even sharper and imply that $Q(n, n, n) / \\sqrt{3 n} \\rightarrow 1$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$; compare (1). Very recently, using the techniques of [DMZ24] and a very careful analysis of said derivative, the exact generic subrank of $n_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times n_{d}$-tensors was determined in [P\u0160S24].\n\nGeneric border subrank. The goal of this paper is to establish an upper bound on the generic border subrank. We first show that this notion is well-defined. To\n\nthis end, let $X_{r}, X_{\\geq r}, X_{<r} \\subseteq V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ be the loci of tensors of border subrank precisely $r$, at least $r$, and strictly less than $r$, respectively.\n\nProposition 1. For any $d, r, V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{d}$, the set $X_{r} \\subseteq V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ of tensors of border subrank precisely $r$ is a constructible set. Therefore, the same holds for the sets $X_{<r}$ and $X_{\\geq r}$.\n\nBy the proposition, there is a unique $r$ for which $X_{r}$ is dense, and this $X_{r}$ contains a Zariski open, dense subset of $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$. This $r$ is called the generic border subrank of tensors in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$.\n\nTheorem 2 (Main Theorem). The generic border subrank of tensors in $\\left(K^{n}\\right)^{\\otimes d}$ is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nThe Main Theorem follows from the following theorem for general dimensions.\nTheorem 3. Let $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{d}$ be vector spaces of dimensions $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{d}$, respectively, and let $r$ be a nonnegative integer. Set $s:=\\lfloor r / d\\rfloor$. Then the locus $X_{\\geq r}$ of tensors of border subrank $\\geq r$ has dimension at most\n\n$$\nn_{1} \\cdots n_{d}-s^{d}+\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2 s\\left(n_{i}-s\\right)+r\\left(1+d(r-1)+\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(n_{i}-r\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nTogether with the results from [DMZ24], the Main Theorem implies that the growth rates of the generic border subrank and of the generic subrank are both equal to $\\Theta\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$. However, their precise values are not equal:\nTheorem 4. The generic border subrank of tensors in $\\left(K^{n}\\right)^{\\otimes 3}$ is at least $\\lfloor\\sqrt{4 n}\\rfloor-3$, and hence, for $n$ sufficiently large, strictly greater than the generic subrank.\n\nProof sketch. First, we establish Proposition 1 in $\\S 2$. Next, there exist tensors in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ of border subrank $\\geq r$ if and only if $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(V_{i}\\right) \\geq r$ for all $i$. Then, choosing linear embeddings $K^{r} \\rightarrow V_{i}$ for all $i$, we may regard $I_{r}$ as a tensor in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$. The border subrank of a tensor $T$ is $\\geq r$ if and only if $I_{r}$ lies in the orbit closure of $T$ under the group $G:=\\prod_{i=1}^{d} \\mathrm{GL}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$.\n\nNow it is well known that if a reductive algebraic group $H$ acts on an affine variety $Z, p, q \\in Z$ satisfy $q \\in \\overline{H \\cdot p}$, and the $H$-orbit of $q$ is closed, then there exists an algebraic group homomorphism (one-parameter subgroup) $\\lambda$ from the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}$ over $K$ to $H$ such that $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot p \\in H \\cdot q$-this is the celebrated Hilbert-Mumford criterion; see, e.g., [Kem78, Theorem 1.4]. Unfortunately, the criterion does not directly apply in our setting, since the orbit of $I_{r}$ under the group $G$ is not closed. Indeed, $\\overline{G \\cdot I_{r}}$ is the set of tensors of ordinary border rank $\\leq r$, and this contains many tensors not in $G \\cdot I_{r}$ and even tensors of ordinary rank $>r$. So if $T$ has border subrank $r$, it is not clear whether there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\\lambda$ where $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot T$ is contained in $G \\cdot I_{r}$.\n\nHowever, not all is lost: in $\\S 3$, using the Cartan-Iwahori-Matsumoto decomposition in loop groups, we prove a generalisation of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion (Proposition 6) that does apply when $H \\cdot q$ is not closed. In $\\S 5$ we specialise this generalised criterion to the setting where $Z=V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ and $H=G$ and $q=I_{r}$. We show that we can cover the locus of tensors of border subrank $\\geq r$ with countably many constructible subsets, each corresponding to a tuple of integer exponents of $t$ in a suitable one-parameter subgroup, and for each of these subsets, we show that its dimension is at most the formula from Theorem 3.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2. CONSTRUCTIBILITY \n\nWe start by showing that the loci $X_{<r}, X_{r}, X_{\\geq r}$ of tensors of border subrank $<r, r$, and $\\geq r$, respectively, are constructible.\n\nProof of Proposition 1. We show that $X_{<r}$ is constructible for all $r$. This implies the other statements, since $X_{\\geq r}$ is the complement of $X_{<r}$ and $X_{r}$ is the difference $X_{<r+1} \\backslash X_{<r}$. If $r>\\operatorname{dim}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ for some $i$, then $X_{<r}$ is all of $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ and we are done. So assume that all $V_{i}$ have dimension $\\geq r$ and regard $I_{r}$ as a tensor in $V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$.\n\nBy standard results in elimination theory (see, e.g., [Dub90]), there exists an integer $D$ such that for all $T \\in V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}$ the ideal $J_{T} \\subseteq K\\left[V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}\\right]$ of polynomials that vanish identically on $\\{g T \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is generated by polynomials of degree $\\leq D$. The border subrank of $T$ is at least $r$ if and only if all polynomials in the degree- $\\leq D$ part $\\left(J_{T}\\right)_{\\leq D}$ of $J_{T}$ vanish on $I_{r}$. Conversely, the border subrank is $<r$ if and only if\n\n$$\n\\exists f \\in K\\left[V^{\\otimes d}\\right]_{\\leq D}:\\left(f\\left(I_{r}\\right) \\neq 0\\right) \\wedge(\\forall g \\in G: f(g T)=0)\n$$\n\nBy quantifier elimination (Chevalley's theorem), the locus $X_{<r}$ of $T$ satisfying the formula above is constructible; here we use that $f$ runs over a finite-dimensional space.\n\nNote that, unlike the parameterisation used in [DMZ24] that implies that the locus of tensors of subrank $\\geq r$ is constructible, the proof above gives no information about the dimension of that locus. Such a bound for border subrank is established in the subsequent sections.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "## 3. The Cartan-Iwahori-Matsumoto decomposition\n\nWe recall a classical result from [IM65]. For more along these lines, we refer to [AHHL21] and the references there. Let $K((t))$ denote the field of Laurent series in the variable $t$ with coefficients in $K$, and $K[[t]]$ its subring of formal power series. For any (commutative, unital) $K$-algebra $R$ and any affine scheme $X$ over $K$, the set $X(R)$ denotes the set of $R$-valued points of $X$, i.e., the set of $K$ algebra homomorphisms $K[X] \\rightarrow R$. In particular, if $G$ is an affine algebraic group over $K$, then $G(K[[t]])$ is a subgroup of the (formal) loop group $G(K((t)))$. For instance, $\\mathrm{GL}_{n}(K[[t]])$ is the group of all $n \\times n$-matrices with entries in $K[[t]]$ whose determinant is a unit in $K[[t]]$, i.e., a formal power series with nonzero constant term. The following theorem follows from [IM65, Corollary 2.17].\n\nTheorem 5. Let $G$ be a connected, reductive group over $K$ and let $D$ be a maximal torus in $G$. Then for any $g=g(t) \\in G(K((t)))$ there exist $h_{1}(t), h_{2}(t) \\in G(K[[t]])$ and a one-parameter subgroup $\\lambda: \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\rightarrow D$ such that\n\n$$\ng(t)=h_{1}(t) \\lambda(t) h_{2}(t)^{-1}\n$$\n\nHere $\\lambda(t)$ is regarded as a point in $D(K((t))) \\subseteq G(K((t)))$ as follows: the pullback of $\\lambda$ is an algebra homomorphism $K[D] \\rightarrow K\\left[\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right]=K\\left[t, t^{-1}\\right] \\subseteq K((t))$. For our application to border subrank we only need the special case of the propositions for (products of) $\\mathrm{GL}_{n}$. In that case, there is the following well-known easy proof of this decomposition (see [Muk03, Lemma 7.7]):\n\nProof. Since the matrix entries of $g(t)$ are Laurent series, we can choose an $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$ so that the entries of $t^{a} g(t)$ are formal power series, i.e., elements of $K[[t]]$. Then apply the Smith normal form algorithm to $t^{a} g(t)$ to decompose it as above-here we use that $K[[t]]$ is a principal ideal domain all of whose ideals are of the form $\\left(t^{b}\\right)$ for $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. Finally, multiply the middle factor by $t^{-a}$ to get the corresponding decomposition for $g(t)$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 4.

It is essential for our application to border subrank that left and right involve the same one-parameter subgroup. The proof that follows is inspired by the proof of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion in [MFK93, Chapter 2, \u00a71], but we are not aware of a previous occurrence of Proposition 6 in the literature.\n\nProof. The variety $Z$ can be embedded as a closed, $G$-stable subvariety of a finitedimensional vector space $V$ on which $G$ acts linearly. So we may assume that $Z=V$ is a representation of $G$.\n\nAs $q \\in \\overline{G \\cdot p}$, by standard facts in algebraic geometry, there exists $g(t) \\in$ $G(K((t)))$ such that $g(t) \\cdot p$ lies in $K[[t]] \\otimes V$ and reduces to $q$ when we set $t$ to zero. We write this as $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} g(t) \\cdot p=q$.

The elements $h_{2}(t) \\cdot v_{1}, \\ldots, h_{2}(t) \\cdot v_{n}$ form a free $K[[t]]$-basis of $K[[t]] \\otimes V$ and we can write the vector $p$ as a linear combination in this basis:\n\n$$\np=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{i}(t) h_{2}(t) \\cdot v_{i} \\text { for certain } \\xi_{i}(t) \\in K[[t]]\n$$\n\nSo we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_{2}(t) \\mu(t) h_{2}(t)^{-1} \\cdot p & =h_{2}(t) \\mu(t) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{i}(t) \\cdot v_{i}=h_{2}(t) \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{i}(t) t^{a_{i}} v_{i} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t^{a_{i}} \\xi_{i}(t) h_{2}(t) \\cdot v_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this expression converges for $t \\rightarrow 0$, we conclude that if $a_{i} \\leq 0$, then $\\xi_{i} \\in K[[t]]$ is divisible by $t^{-a_{i}}$. For these $i$, we define $\\eta_{i}(t)=t^{a_{i}} \\xi_{i}(t) \\in K[[t]]$.

Proof of the main THEOREM \n\nWe analyse the locus $X_{\\geq r}$ of tensors of border subrank $\\geq r$. By Proposition 1, this is constructible and hence has a well-defined dimension. We will cover this locus by countably many constructible subsets, for each of which we can upper bound the dimension by some number $N$. These constructible subsets are defined over $K$, and their $L$-points in fact cover $X_{\\geq r}(L)$ for any field extension $L \\supseteq K$. For $L$ uncountable, $X_{\\geq r}(L)$ cannot be covered by countably many constructible subsets of dimension strictly smaller than $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(X_{\\geq r}\\right)$.

By Proposition 6 applied to $G:=\\prod_{i=1}^{d} \\mathrm{GL}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $Z:=V$, there exists an element $S \\in G \\cdot I_{r}$ and a one-parameter subgroup $\\lambda: \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\rightarrow G$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot T=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(t) \\cdot S=: S_{0}\n$$\n\nand in particular both limits exist.\nFor every $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ we define the weight space\n\n$$\nV_{a}(\\lambda):=\\left\\{v \\in V \\mid \\forall t \\in \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}: \\lambda(t) \\cdot v=t^{a} v\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe write $V_{>0}(\\lambda):=\\bigoplus_{a>0} V_{a}(\\lambda)$ and define $V_{\\geq 0}(\\lambda), V_{<0}(\\lambda), V_{\\leq 0}(\\lambda)$ in a similar manner. We then have $T \\in V_{\\geq 0}(\\lambda), S \\in V_{\\leq 0}(\\lambda)$, and the components $T_{0}, S_{0}$ of $T, S$ in $V_{0}(\\lambda)$ are equal. We will derive an upper bound on $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(X_{\\geq r}\\right)$ by counting parameters in $K$ needed to determine the components $S_{0}=T_{0}$ and $T_{>0}$.\n\nTo formalise this count, fix integers\n\n$$\na_{i 1} \\leq a_{i 2} \\leq \\cdots \\leq a_{i n_{i}}, \\quad i=1, \\ldots, d\n$$\n\nand consider the incidence variety\n\n$$\nY=Y\\left(\\left(a_{i j}\\right)_{i, j}\\right):=\\left\\{(\\lambda, S, T) \\mid S \\in G \\cdot I_{r} \\text { and } \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(t) \\cdot S=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot T\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda=\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{d}\\right)$ runs over the one-parameter subgroups into $G$ such that $\\lambda_{i}: \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GL}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ has weights $a_{i j}, j=1, \\ldots, n_{i}$ on $V_{i}$.\n(To be precise, one can take the open subvariety of $\\prod_{i=1}^{d} \\mathbb{P}\\left(V_{i}\\right)^{n_{i}}$ consisting of $d$-tuples in which the $i$-th entry is a projective basis of $\\mathbb{P}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ as the variety parameterising such $\\lambda$, even if this is an over-parameterisation in case $a_{i j}=a_{i l}$ holds for some $i$ and some $j \\neq l$.)\n\nBy the discussion above, $X_{\\geq r}$ is contained in the union, over all countably many choices of the tuple of integers $a_{i j}$, of the image of $Y$ under projection onto the third component.\n\nLemma 10. Set $s:=\\lfloor r / d\\rfloor$. The number of parameters in $K$ needed to determine $T_{>0}$, i.e., the dimension of the image of the map\n\n$$\nY \\rightarrow V, \\quad(\\lambda, S, T) \\mapsto T_{>0} \\text { (the component of } T \\text { in } V_{>0}(\\lambda))\n$$\n\nis at most\n\n$$\nn_{1} \\cdots n_{d}-s^{d}+\\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2 s\\left(n_{i}-s\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the proof we will use the slice rank of $S$ : the minimal sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\operatorname{dim}\\left(U_{i}\\right)$ where the $U_{i}$ are subspaces of $V_{i}$ satisfying\n\n$$\nS \\in \\sum_{i=1}^{d} V_{1} \\otimes \\ldots V_{i-1} \\otimes U_{i} \\otimes V_{i+1} \\otimes \\ldots V_{d}\n$$\n\nFor more about the slice rank see [TS16]. We will use that $I_{r}$, and hence $S$, has slice rank $r$; see [TS16, Example 5].\n\nProof. Consider $(\\lambda, S, T) \\in Y$ and let $v_{i 1}, \\ldots, v_{i n_{i}}$ be an eigenbasis for the $i$-th component $\\lambda_{i}: \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{GL}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ of $\\lambda$, so that\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{i}(t) \\cdot v_{i j}=t^{a_{i j}} v_{i j}, \\quad t \\in \\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n\nNow $V_{\\leq 0}=V_{\\leq 0}(\\lambda)$ is the space spanned by all tensors\n\n$$\nv_{1 j_{1}} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes v_{d j_{d}} \\text { with } a_{1 j_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{d j_{d}} \\leq 0\n$$\n\nLet $P \\subseteq\\left[n_{1}\\right] \\times \\cdots \\times\\left[n_{d}\\right]$ be the set of tuples $\\left(j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{d}\\right)$ with this property. Since the $a_{i j}$ increase weakly with $j, P$ is downward closed.\n\nNow if for all $\\left(j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{d}\\right) \\in P$ there exists an $i \\in[d]$ with $j_{i}<s$, then $P$ can be covered by $d \\cdot(s-1)<r$ slices of the form $\\left[n_{1}\\right] \\times \\cdots \\times\\left[n_{i-1}\\right] \\times\\{j\\} \\times\\left[n_{i+1}\\right] \\times \\cdots \\times\\left[n_{d}\\right]$ where $j=1, \\ldots, s-1$, and hence any linear combination of the tensors in (3) has slice rank $<r$. This contradicts the fact that $S \\in V_{\\leq 0}$, lying in the orbit of $I_{r}$, has slice rank $r$. Thus $P$ contains a tuple $\\left(j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{d}\\right)$ with all $j_{i} \\geq s$. Since $P$ is downward closed, it then contains the hypercube $[s]^{d}$.\n\nLet $U_{i}, W_{i} \\subseteq V_{i}$ be the spaces spanned by $v_{i 1}, \\ldots, v_{i s}$ and $v_{i, s+1}, \\ldots, v_{i n_{i}}$, respectively, so that $V_{i}=U_{i} \\oplus W_{i}$. Then we find that $U_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes U_{d} \\subseteq V_{\\leq 0}$ and hence\n\n$$\nT_{>0} \\in V_{>0} \\subseteq \\sum_{i=1}^{d} V_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{i-1} \\otimes W_{i} \\otimes V_{i+1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V_{d}\n$$\n\nThe right-hand side is a space of dimension $n_{1} \\cdots n_{d}-s^{d}$.\nFurthermore, $U_{i}$ (respectively, $W_{i}$ ) is a point in the Grassmannian of $s$-dimensional (respectively, $\\left(n_{i}-s\\right)$-dimensional) subspaces in $V_{i}$. Each of these Grassmannians has dimension $s\\left(n_{i}-s\\right)$. Adding these dimensions for $i=1, \\ldots, d$ to the upper bound $n_{1} \\cdots n_{d}-s^{d}$ on the dimension of $V_{>0}$ gives the lemma.\n\nLemma 11. The number of parameters in $K$ needed to determine $S_{0}=T_{0}$, i.e., the dimension of the image of the map\n\n$$\nY \\rightarrow V, \\quad(\\lambda, S, T) \\mapsto S_{0}\n$$\n\nis at most\n\n$$\nr\\left(1+d(r-1)+\\sum_{i=1}^{d}\\left(n_{i}-r\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Consider $(\\lambda, S, T) \\in Y$, so that $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(t) \\cdot S=S_{0}$ exists. Define\n\n$$\nQ=Q(\\lambda):=\\left\\{g \\in G \\mid \\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(t) g \\lambda(t)^{-1} \\text { exists in } G\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThis is a parabolic subgroup of $G$ (see [MFK93, page 55]), and for any $g \\in Q$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left(g \\lambda(t) g^{-1}\\right) \\cdot S=g \\cdot\\left(\\lambda(t) g^{-1} \\lambda(t)^{-1}\\right) \\cdot(\\lambda(t) \\cdot S) \\rightarrow\\left(g g_{0}\\right) \\cdot S_{0}, \\quad(t \\rightarrow \\infty)\n$$\n\nfor some $g_{0} \\in G$.\nFix a basis $e_{i 1}, \\ldots, e_{i n_{i}}$ of $V_{i}$ such that\n\n$$\nS=I_{r}=\\sum_{i=1}^{r} e_{1 i} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes e_{d i}\n$$\n\nand let $B$ be the Borel subgroup of $G$ consisting of $d$-tuples of upper triangular matrices relative to these bases. Any two parabolic subgroups intersect in at least a maximal torus (see, e.g., [Bor91, Corollary 14.13]), hence some maximal torus $D$ of $G$ is contained in $Q \\cap B$. Any two maximal tori in $Q$ are conjugate (see, e.g., [Bor91, Corollar 11.3]), and therefore there exists a $g \\in Q$ such that $\\mu:=g \\lambda g^{-1}$ maps $\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ into $D \\subseteq B$. By the previous paragraph, $S_{0}^{\\prime}:=\\lim _{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mu(t) \\cdot S$ lies in the $G$-orbit of $S_{0}$.\n\nNow let $U_{i}$ be the subspace of $V_{i}$ spanned by $e_{i 1}, \\ldots, e_{i r}$. Since the components of $\\mu$ are upper-triangular, the space $U_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes U_{d}$ is preserved by $\\mu$. Hence $S_{0}^{\\prime}$ also lies in this space, and it is evidently contained in the orbit closure of the unit tensor $I_{r}$ under $\\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\mathrm{GL}\\left(U_{i}\\right)$.\n\nSince $S_{0}$ lies in the $G$-orbit of $S_{0}^{\\prime}$, there also exist $r$-dimensional subspaces $W_{i} \\subseteq$ $V_{i}$ such that $S_{0}$ lies in $W_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes W_{d}$ and is contained in the orbit closure of a unit tensor in $W_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes W_{d}$. Each $W_{i}$ is a point in a Grassmannian of dimension $r\\left(n_{i}-r\\right)$, and the orbit closure of the unit tensor in $W_{1} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes W_{d}$ has dimension $r(1+d(r-1))$ : indeed, $I_{r}$ uniquely decomposes as a sum of $r$ tensors in the cone over the Segre product of the $\\mathbb{P}\\left(W_{i}\\right)$. Thus $S_{0}$ sweeps out a variety of dimension at most\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{d} r\\left(n_{i}-r\\right)+r(1+d(r-1))\n$$\n\nas desired.\nProof of Theorem 3. It suffices to show that the image of the morphism $\\pi: Y \\rightarrow$ $V,(\\lambda, S, T) \\mapsto T$ has at most the dimension in Theorem 3. This morphism factorises via the map\n\n$$\nY \\rightarrow V \\times V, \\quad(\\lambda, S, T) \\mapsto\\left(S_{0}, T_{>0}\\right)\n$$\n\nand the addition map $V \\times V \\rightarrow V$. So an upper bound on the dimension of $\\operatorname{im}(\\pi)$ is given by adding the dimensions from Lemmas 11 and 10. This yields the upper bound in the theorem.\n\nProof of Theorem 2. Set $n_{i}=n$ and $r=s \\cdot d$ in Theorem 3 (with $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$ ). Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(X_{\\geq r}\\right) & \\leq n^{d}-s^{d}+2 s d(n-s)+r(d(n-r)+1+d(r-1)) \\\\\n& =n^{d}-s^{d}+2 s d(n-s)+r(d(n-1)+1) \\\\\n& =n^{d}-(r / d)^{d}+r(2(n-r / d)+d(n-1)+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAny such multiple $r$ of $d$ for which $X_{\\geq r}$ is dense, i.e., has dimension $n^{d}$, must therefore satisfy\n\n$$\n(r / d)^{d} \\leq r(2(n-r / d)+1+d(n-1))\n$$\n\nso that\n\n$$\n\\frac{r^{d-1}}{d^{d}} \\leq 2(n-r / d)+1+d(n-1) \\leq n(2+d)\n$$\n\nThis shows that $r=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, as desired.\nRemark 12. In [DMZ24], it is proved that the subrank is not additive on direct sums of tensors of order $d>2$. The wonderfully simple argument is as follows: let $\\Omega$ be the subset of $V^{\\otimes d}$ where the subrank is generic. By their work, this subrank is $O\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$, where $n:=\\operatorname{dim}(V)$. Since $\\Omega$ is constructible and dense, it contains a dense open subset of $V^{\\otimes d}$. Now let $I_{n}$ be a unit tensor in $V^{\\otimes d}$ of (the maximal) subrank $n$. Then $I_{n}-\\Omega$ also contains a dense open subset, and hence intersects $\\Omega$. So we find $S, T \\in V^{\\otimes d}$, both of subrank $O\\left(n^{1 /(d-1)}\\right)$, that satisfy $S+T=I_{n}$. But $S+T$ can be obtained from $S \\oplus T \\in(V \\oplus V)^{\\otimes d}$ by applying the linear map $\\left(\\operatorname{id}_{V}+\\operatorname{id}_{V}\\right)^{\\otimes d}$, so $S \\oplus T$ has subrank at least $n$. For $n \\gg 0$, this implies that subrank is not additive on direct sums. The same argument, now using Proposition 1 for constructibility and Theorem 2 for the dimension bound, shows that border subrank is not additive, either.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 6. A LOWER BOUND FOR $d=3$ \n\nProof of Theorem 4. We fix an integer $r \\leq\\lfloor\\sqrt{4 n}\\rfloor-3$ and show that the locus $X_{\\geq r}$ of tensors in $K^{n} \\otimes K^{n} \\otimes K^{n}$ is dense. To this end, we choose integers $a_{i j}, i \\in$ $[3], j \\in[n]$ as follows:\n\n$$\na_{i j}:= \\begin{cases}2^{j} & \\text { for } i=1,2 \\\\ -2^{r-j+2} & \\text { for } i=3 \\text { and } j \\leq r ; \\text { and } \\\\ 0 & \\text { for } i=3 \\text { and } j>r\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNote that for each $i, a_{i j}$ is weakly increasing in $j$.

Note that $S$ is a unit tensor of subrank $r$. For any tensor $T$ that agrees with $S$ on the positions labelled by $P$-a condition we will write as $\\left.T\\right|_{P}=\\left.S\\right|_{P}$-we have $\\lim _{t \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda(t) \\cdot T=S$, so that the border subrank of $T$ is at least $r$.\n\nNow, much like in [DMZ24], we argue that the morphism\n$\\Psi: \\mathrm{GL}_{n} \\times \\mathrm{GL}_{n} \\times\\left\\{\\left.T: T\\right|_{P}=\\left.S\\right|_{P}\\right\\} \\rightarrow K^{n} \\otimes K^{n} \\otimes K^{n}, \\quad\\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, T\\right) \\mapsto\\left(g_{1}, g_{2}, \\mathrm{id}\\right) \\cdot T$ is dominant. This, then, implies that the tensors of border subrank at least $r$ are dense in $K^{n} \\otimes K^{n} \\otimes K^{n}$. To show that $\\Psi$ is dominant, we compute the derivative of $\\Psi$ at $p:=($ id, id, $\\bar{T})$ for a $\\bar{T}$ to be chosen carefully below. The tangent space at $\\bar{T}$ to $\\left\\{\\left.T: T\\right|_{P}=\\left.S\\right|_{P}\\right\\}$ is precisely the space $V_{>0}$ spanned by the tensors $e_{j} \\otimes e_{k} \\otimes e_{l}$ with $a_{1 j}+a_{2 k}+a_{3 l}>0$, and $d_{p} \\Psi$ restricted to $V_{>0}$ is the inclusion $V_{>0} \\rightarrow\\left(K^{n}\\right)^{\\otimes 3}$. So it suffices to show that the restriction of $d_{p} \\Psi$ to $\\mathfrak{g l}_{n} \\times \\mathfrak{g l}_{n}$ projects surjectively onto $V_{\\leq 0}$, the space spanned by the tensors $e_{j} \\otimes e_{k} \\otimes e_{l}$ with $(j, k, l) \\in P$.

The pyramid $P$ in red and orange for $r=4$, and the support of the additional full-rank matrices in $\\tilde{T}$ in green.\n\nthan all of $\\mathfrak{g l}_{n}$, we will only use upper triangular matrices. Let $E_{a b}$ be the $n \\times n$ matrix with zeros everywhere except for a 1 on position $(a, b)$. Then $\\left(d_{p} \\Psi\\right)\\left(E_{a b}, 0\\right)$ is the tensor obtained by putting a copy of the $b$ th $j$-slice in the position where $j=a$ and zeroes elsewhere. We only care about the positions in the pyramid $P$, i.e., about $\\left.\\left(d_{p} \\Psi\\right)\\left(E_{a b}, 0\\right)\\right|_{P}$. Similarly in the $k$-direction.\n\nIn the layers with $l=r-s$ with $r>s$ and $s \\geq 0$ even, we put any fullrank $(s+1) \\times(s+1)$ matrix $A_{s}$ in $\\tilde{T}$ far enough in front of $P$, say in positions $\\left[j_{s}, j_{s}+s\\right] \\times[1, s+1] \\times\\{l\\}$, so that multiplying this matrix with linear combinations of the matrices $E_{a b}$ with $a \\leq s+1$ and $b \\in\\left[j_{s}, j_{s}+s\\right]$ yields all possible matrices in $P$ in layer $l$. We take these such that the intervals $\\left[j_{s}, j_{s}+s\\right]$ are all disjoint.\n\nSimilarly, in the layers with $l=r-s$ with $r>s$ and $s \\geq 1$ odd, we put a full-rank $(s+1) \\times(s+1)$-matrix far enough to the right of $P$. See Figure 2. In all positions outside $P$ and outside these matrices, we choose the entries of $\\tilde{T}$ to be 0 . This ensures that $\\Psi$ is dominant, as desired.\n\nAssume $r$ is even.

FURTHER QUESTIONS \n\n(1) In [Cha24], a lower bound on the dimension of the locus $X_{n}=X_{\\geq n}$ of maximal border subrank tensors is determined for $d=3$ :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(X_{n}\\right) \\geq\\left(2 n^{3}+3 n^{2}-2 n-3\\right) / 3\n$$\n\nAssuming that $n$ is a multiple of 3 , Theorem 3 yields the following upper bound:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{dim}\\left(X_{n}\\right) & \\leq n^{3}-(n / 3)^{3}+6(n / 3)(n-(n / 3))+n(1+3(n-1)) \\\\\n& =\\frac{26}{27} n^{3}+\\frac{13}{3} n^{2}-2 n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt would be interesting to find out what is the correct coefficient of $n^{3}$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n(2) In [DMZ24], the asymptotic behaviour of the generic subrank for tensors of order three is determined almost exactly. Can this be done of the generic border subrank, as well?\n\n(3) One can define the Hilbert-Mumford subrank of $T$ as the maximal $r$ such that there exists a one-parameter subgroup $\\lambda$ into $G$ such that $\\lambda(t) \\cdot T \\rightarrow I_{r}$ for $t \\rightarrow 0$. This lies between the subrank of $T$ and the border subrank of $T$. It can be strictly larger than the subrank of $T$; this follows, for instance, from [Cha24]: the locus of maximal Hilbert-Mumford subrank has dimension $\\Theta\\left(n^{3}\\right)$ for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, whereas the orbit of $I_{n}$ has dimension $\\Theta\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. But can the border subrank of $T$ be strictly larger than the Hilbert-Mumford subrank?", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# REFERENCES \n\n[AHHL21] Jarod Alper, Jochen Heinloth, and Daniel Halpern-Leistner.

In our proof, we use\na generalisation of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion that we believe will be of\nindependent interest.", "updated": "2025-04-11T12:17:14Z", "published": "2024-02-16T13:25:49Z"}
