We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration-exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean-variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.\n\n\nKeywords.

Continuous RL problems are important because: 1) many if not most practical problems are naturally continuous in time (and in space), such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, video game play and high frequency trading; 2) while one can discretize time upfront and turn a continuous-time problem into a discrete-time MDP, it has been known, indeed shown experimentally e.g., Munos (2006), Tallec et al. (2019) and Park et al. (2021), that this approach is very sensitive to time discretization and performs poorly with small time steps; 3) there are more analytical tools available for the continuous setting that\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    *Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.

This strand of research starts with Wang et al. (2020) that introduces a mathematical formulation to capture the essence of RL - the exploration-exploitation tradeoff - in the continuous setting, followed by a \"trilogy\" (Jia and Zhou 2022a,b, 2023) that develops intertwining theories on policy evaluation, policy gradient and $q$-learning respectively. The common underpinning of the entire theory is the martingale property of certain stochastic processes, the enforcement of which naturally leads to various temporal difference algorithms to train and learn $q$-functions, value functions and optimal (stochastic) policies. The research is characterized by carrying out all the analysis in the continuous setting, and discretizing time only at the final, implementation stage for approximating the integrated rewards and the temporal difference. The theory has been adapted and extended in different directions; see e.g. Reisinger and Zhang (2021), Guo et al. (2022), Dai et al. (2023), as well as employed for applications; see e.g. Wang and Zhou (2020), Huang et al. (2022), Gao et al. (2022), Wang et al. (2023), and Wu and Li (2024).\n\nThe study so far has been predominantly on pure diffusion processes, namely the state processes are governed by controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a drift part and a diffusion one. While it is reasonable to model the underlying data generating processes as diffusions within a short period of time, sudden and drastic changes can and do happen over time. An example is a stock price process: while it is approximately a diffusion over a sufficiently short period, it may respond dramatically to a surprisingly good or bad earning report. Other examples include neuron dynamics (Giraudo and Sacerdote 1997), stochastic resonance (Gammaitoni et al. 1998) and climate data (Goswami et al. 2018). It is therefore natural and necessary to extend the continuous RL theory and algorithms to the case when jumps are present. This is particularly important for decision makings in financial markets, where it has been well recognized that using jumps to capture large sudden movements provides a more realistic way to model market dynamics; see the discussions in Chapter 1 of Cont and Tankov (2004). The financial modeling literature with jumps dates back to the seminal work of Merton (1976), who extends the classical Black-Scholes model by introducing a compound Poisson process with normally distributed jumps in the log returns. Since then alternative jump size distributions have been proposed in e.g. Kou (2002) and Cai and Kou (2011). Empirical success of jump-diffusion models have been documented for many asset classes; see Bates (1991), Andersen et al. (2002), and A\u00eft-Sahalia et al. (2012) for stocks and stock indices, Bates (1996) for exchange rates, Das (2002) for interest rates, and Li and Linetsky (2014) for commodities, among many others.\n\nThis paper makes two major contributions. The first is mathematical in terms of setting up the suitable exploratory formulation and proving the well-posedness of the resulting exploratory SDE, which form the foundation of the RL theory for jump-diffusions. Wang et al. (2020) apply the classical stochastic relaxed control to model the exploration or randomization prevalent in RL, and derive an exploratory state equation that dictates the dynamics of the \"average\" of infinitely many state processes generated by repeatedly sampling from the same exploratory, stochastic policy. The drift and variance coefficients of the exploratory SDE are the means of those coefficients against the given stochastic policy (which is a probability distribution) respectively. The derivation therein is based on a law of large number argument to the first two moments of the diffusion process. That argument fails for jump-diffusions which are not uniquely determined by the first\n\ntwo moments. We overcome this difficulty by analyzing instead the infinitesimal generator of the sample state process, from which we identify the dynamics of the exploratory state process. Inspired by Kushner (2000) who studies relaxed control for jump-diffusions, we formulate the exploratory SDE by extending the original Poisson random measures for jumps to capture the effect of random exploration. It should be noted that, like almost all the earlier works on relaxed control, Kushner (2000) is motivated by answering the theoretical question of whether an optimal control exists, as randomization convexifies the universe of control strategies. In comparison, our formulation is guided by the practical motivation of exploration for learning. There is also another subtle but important difference. We consider stochastic feedback policies while Kushner (2000) does not. This in turn creates technical issues in studying the well-posedness of the exploratory SDE in our framework.\n\nThe second main contribution is several implications regarding the impact of jumps on RL algorithm design. Thanks to the established exploratory formulation, we can define the Hamiltonian that, compared with the pure diffusion counterpart, has to include an additional term corresponding to the jumps. The resulting HJB equation - called the exploratory HJB - is now a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) instead of a PDE due to that additional term. However, when expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian, the exploratory HJB equation has exactly the same form as that in the diffusion case. This leads to several completely identical statements of important results, including the optimality of the Gibbs exploration, definition of a $q$-function, and martingale characterizations of value functions and $q$-functions. Here by \"identical\" we mean in terms of the Hamiltonian; in other words, these statements differ between diffusions and jump-diffusions entirely because the Hamiltonian is defined differently (which also causes some differences in the proofs of the results concerned). Most important of all, in the resulting RL algorithms, the Hamiltonian (or equivalently the $q$-function) can be computed using temporal difference of the value function by virtue of the It\u00f4 lemma; as a result the algorithms are completely identical no matter whether or not there are jumps. This has a significant practical implication: we can just use the same RL algorithms without the need of checking in advance whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. It is significant for the following reason. In practice, data are always observed or sampled at discrete times, no matter how frequent they arrive. Thus we encounter successive discontinuities along the sample trajectory even when the data actually come from a diffusion process. There are some criteria that can be used to check whether the underlying process is a diffusion or a jump-diffusion, e.g. A\u00eft-Sahalia et al. (2012), Wang and Zheng (2022). But these methods typically require data with very high frequency to be effective, which may not always be available. In addition, noises must be properly handled for them to work.\n\nEven though we can apply the same RL algorithms irrespective of the presence of jumps, the parametrization of the policy and value function may still depend on it, if we try to exploit certain special structure of the problem instead of using general neural networks for parameterization. Indeed, we give an example in which the optimal exploratory policy is Gaussian when there are no jumps, whereas an optimal policy either does not exist or becomes non-Gaussian when there are jumps. However, in the mean-variance portfolio selection we present as a concrete application, the optimal Gibbs exploration measure again reduces to Gaussian and the value function is quadratic as in Wang and Zhou (2020), both owing to the inherent linear-quadratic (LQ) structure of the problem. Hence in this particular case jumps do not even affect the parametrization of the policy and value function/ $q$-function for learning.\n\nWe also consider mean-variance hedging of options as another application. This is a non-LQ\n\nproblem and hence more difficult to solve than mean-variance portfolio selection. The meanvariance hedging problem has been studied in various early works, such as Schweizer (1996, 2001) and Lim (2005). Here, we introduce the entropy-regularized mean-variance hedging objective for an asset following a jump-diffusion and derive analytical representations for the optimal stochastic policy, which is again Gaussian, as well as the optimal value function. We use these representations to devise an actor-critic algorithm to learn the optimal hedging policy from data.\n\nWe compare our work with four recent related papers. (1) Bender and Thuan (2023) consider the continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection problem with exploration under a jump-diffusion setting. Our paper differs from theirs in several aspects. First, they consider a specific application problem while we study RL for general controlled jump-diffusions. Second, they obtain the SDE for the exploratory state by taking limit of the discrete-time exploratory dynamics, whereas our approach first derives the form of the infinitesimal generator of the sample state process and then infers the exploratory SDE from it. It is unclear how their approach works when dealing with general control problems. Finally, they do not consider how to develop RL algorithms based on their solution of the exploratory mean-variance portfolio selection, which we do in this paper. (2) Guo et al. (2023) consider continuous-time RL for linear-convex models with jumps. The scope and motivation are different from ours: They focus on the Lipschitz stability of feedback controls for this special class of control problems where the diffusion and jump terms are not controlled, and propose a least-square model-based algorithm and obtain sublinear regret guarantees in the episodic setting. By contrast, we consider RL for general jump-diffusions and develop model-free algorithms without considering regret bounds. (3) Denkert et al. (2024) aim to unify certain types of stochastic control problems by considering the so-called randomized control formulation which leads to the same optimal value functions as those of the original problems. They develop a policy gradient representation and actor-critic algorithms for RL. The randomized control formulation is fundamentally different from the framework we are considering: therein the control is applied at a set of random time points generated by a random point process instead of at every time point as in our framework. (4) Bo et al. (2024) develop $q$-learning for jump-diffusions by using Tsallis' entropy for regularization instead of Shannon's entropy considered in our paper and in Jia and Zhou (2022b, 2023). ${ }^{1}$ While this entropy presents an interesting alternative for developing RL algorithms, it may make the exploratory control problem less tractable to solve and lead to policy distributions that are inefficient to sample for exploration in certain applications.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the problem formulation. In Section 3, we present the theory of $q$-learning for jump-diffusions, followed by the discussion of $q$-learning algorithms in Section 4. In Section 5, we apply the general theory and algorithms to a mean-variance portfolio selection problem, and discuss the impact of jumps. Section 6 presents the application to a mean-variance option hedging problem. Finally, Section 7 concludes.

Denote the jump of $L$ at time $t$ by $\\Delta L_{t}=L_{t}-L_{t-}$, and let $\\mathbf{B}_{0}$ be the collection of Borel sets of $\\mathbb{R}$ whose closure does not contain 0 . The Poisson random measure (or jump measure) of $L$ is defined as\n\n$$\nN(t, B)=\\sum_{s: 0<s \\leq t} 1_{B}\\left(\\Delta L_{s}\\right), B \\in \\mathbf{B}_{0}\n$$\n\nwhich gives the number of jumps up to time $t$ with jump size in a Borel set $B$ away from 0 . The L\u00e9vy measure $\\nu$ of $L$ is defined by $\\nu(B)=\\mathbb{E}[N(1, B)]$ for $B \\in \\mathbf{B}_{0}$, which shows the expected number of jumps in $B$ in unit time, and $\\nu(B)$ is finite. For any $B \\in \\mathbf{B}_{0},\\{N(t, B): t \\geq 0\\}$ is a Poisson process with intensity given by $\\nu(B)$. The differential forms of these two measures are written as $N(d t, d z)$ and $\\nu(d z)$, respectively. If $\\nu$ is absolutely continuous, we write $\\nu(d z)=\\nu(z) d z$ by using the same letter for the measure and its density function. The L\u00e9vy measure $\\nu$ must satisfy the integrability condition\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\min \\left\\{z^{2}, 1\\right\\} \\nu(d z)<\\infty\n$$\n\nHowever, it is not necessarily a finite measure on $\\mathbb{R} /\\{0\\}$ but always a $\\sigma$-finite measure. The L\u00e9vy process $L$ is said to have jumps of finite (infinite activity) if $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\nu(d z)<\\infty(=\\infty)$. The number of jumps on any finite time interval is finite in the former case but infinite in the latter. For any Borel set $B$ with its closure including $0, \\nu(B)$ is finite in the finite activity case but infinite otherwise. Finally, the compensated Poisson random measure is defined as $\\widetilde{N}(d t, d z)=N(d t, d z)-\\nu(d z) d t$. For any $B \\in \\mathbf{B}_{0}$, the process $\\{\\widetilde{N}(t, B): t \\geq 0\\}$ is a martingale.\n\nThroughout the paper, we use the following notations. By convention, all vectors are column vectors unless otherwise specified. We use $\\mathbb{R}^{k}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{k \\times \\ell}$ to denote the space of $k$-dimensional vectors and $k \\times \\ell$ matrices, respectively. For matrix $A$, we use $A^{\\top}$ for its transpose, $|A|$ for its Euclidean/Frobenius norm, and write $A^{2}:=A A^{\\top}$. Given two matrices $A$ and $B$ of the same size, we denote by $A \\circ B$ the inner product between $A$ and $B$, which is given by $\\operatorname{tr}\\left(A B^{\\top}\\right)$. For a positive semidefinite matrix $A$, we write $\\sqrt{A}=U D^{1 / 2} V^{\\top}$, where $A=U D V^{\\top}$ is its singular value decomposition with $U, V$ as two orthogonal matrices and $D$ as a diagonal matrix, and $D^{1 / 2}$ is the diagonal matrix whose entries are the square root of those of $D$. We use $f=f(\\cdot)$ to denote the function $f$, and $f(x)$ to denote the function value of $f$ at $x$. We use both $f_{x}, f_{x x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}$ for the firs and second (partial) derivatives of a function $f$ with respect to $x$. We write the minimum of two values $a$ and $b$ as $a \\wedge b$. The notation $\\mathcal{U}(B)$ denotes the uniform distribution over set $B$ while $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ refers to the Gaussian distribution with mean vector $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.1 Classical stochastic control of jump-diffusions \n\nConsider a filtered probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F},\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\right\\}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ satisfying the usual hypothesis.

Applying this policy to (2), we get for $s \\in[0, T]$,\n\n$$\nd X_{s}^{\\mathbf{a}}=b\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}, \\mathbf{a}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\right)\\right) d s+\\sigma\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}, \\mathbf{a}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\right)\\right) d W_{s}+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{\\ell}} \\gamma\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}, \\mathbf{a}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\right), z\\right) \\widetilde{N}(d s, d z)\n$$\n\nAssuming the solution to the above SDE uniquely exists, we say the action process $a^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=\\left\\{a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=\\right.$ $\\mathbf{a}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\right): t \\leq s \\leq T\\}$ to be generated from $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. Note that $a^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$ depends on the specific sample $\\mathbf{a} \\sim \\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, which we omit to write out for notational simplicity. In the following, we will also write $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\cdot \\mid t, x)$ as $\\pi_{t, x}(\\cdot)$.\n\nWe need to enlarge the original filtered probability space to include the additional randomness from sampling actions. Following Jia and Zhou (2022b, 2023), we assume that the probability space is rich enough to support independent copies of an $n$-dimensional random vector uniformly distributed over $[0,1]^{n}$, where $n$ is the dimension of the control space. These copies are also independent of $W$ and $L_{1}, \\cdots, L_{\\ell}$. Let $\\mathcal{G}_{s}$ be the new sigma-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$ and the copies of the uniform random vector up to time $s$. The new filtered probability space is $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F},\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{t}\\right\\}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$, where $\\overline{\\mathbb{P}}$ is the product extension from $\\mathbb{P}$ and they coincide when restricted to $\\mathcal{F}_{T}$.\n\nFix a stochastic feedback policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ and an initial time-state pair $(t, x)$. An action process $a^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=\\left\\{a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}: t \\leq s \\leq T\\right\\}$ generated from $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ is an $\\mathcal{G}_{s}$-progressively measurable process that is also predictable. Consider the sample state process $X^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=\\left\\{X_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}: t \\leq s \\leq T\\right\\}$ that follows the SDE\n\n$$\nd X_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=b\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right) d s+\\sigma\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right) d W_{s}+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{\\ell}} \\gamma\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, z\\right) \\widetilde{N}(d s, d z), \\quad s \\in[t, T]\n$$\n\nOnce again, bear in mind that the above equation depends on a specific sample $\\mathbf{a} \\sim \\boldsymbol{\\pi}$; so there are in fact infinitely many similar equations, each corresponding to a sample of $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$.\n\nTo encourage exploration, we add an entropy regularizer to the running reward, leading to\n\n$$\nJ(t, x ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi})=\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\int_{t}^{T} e^{-\\beta(s-t)}\\left(r\\left(s, X_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)-\\theta \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\left(a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\mid s, X_{s-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right) d s+e^{-\\beta(T-t)} h\\left(X_{T}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}$ is the expectation conditioned on $X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=x$, taken with respect to the randomness in the Brownian motion, the Poisson random measures, and the action randomization. Here $\\theta>0$ is the temperature parameter that controls the level of exploration. The function $J(\\cdot, \\cdot ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi})$ is called the value function of the policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. The goal of RL is to find the policy that maximizes the value function among admissible policies that are to be specified in Definition 1 below.\n\nFor theoretical analysis, we consider the exploratory dynamics of $X^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$, which represent the key averaged characteristics of the sample state process over infinitely many randomized actions. In the case of diffusions, Wang et al. (2020) derive such exploratory dynamics by applying a law of large number argument to the first two moments of the diffusion process. Their approach, however, cannot be applied to jump-diffusions. Here, we get around by studying the infinitesimal generator of the sample state process, from which we will identify the dynamics of the exploratory state process.\n\nTo this end, let $f \\in C_{0}^{1,2}([0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d})$, which is continuously differentiable in $t$ and twice continuously differentiable in $x$ with compact support, and we need to analyze $\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathrm{P}}\\left[f\\left(t+s, X_{t+s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right]-f(t, x)}{s}$. Fixing $(t, x)$, consider the $\\operatorname{SDE}(9)$ starting from $X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}=x$ with $N$ independent copies $\\mathbf{a}_{1}, \\cdots, \\mathbf{a}_{N}$ of $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. Let $s>0$ be very small and assume the corresponding actions $a_{1}, \\cdots, a_{N}$ are fixed from $t$ to $t+s$. Denote by $X_{t+s}^{a_{i}}$ the value of the state process corresponding to $\\mathbf{a}_{i}$ at $t+s$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[f\\left(t+s, X_{t+s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right]-f(t, x)}{s} \\\\\n= & \\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[f\\left(t+s, X_{t+s}^{a_{i}}\\right)\\right]-f(t, x)}{s} \\\\\n= & \\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[f\\left(t+s, X_{t+s}^{a_{i}}\\right)\\right]-f(t, x)}{s} \\\\\n= & \\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}(t, x)+b\\left(t, x, a_{i}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^{2}\\left(t, x, a_{i}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(t, x)\\right) \\\\\n+ & \\lim _{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, a_{i}, z\\right)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, a_{i}, z\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nUsing the law of large number, we obtain\n\n$$\n(11)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}(t, x)+\\tilde{b}\\left(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{t, x}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)+\\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{t, x}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(t, x)\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\tilde{b}\\left(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{t, x}\\right):=\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} b(t, x, a) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a, \\quad \\tilde{\\sigma}\\left(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{t, x}\\right):=\\left(\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\sigma^{2}(t, x, a) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nThese \"exploratory\" drift and diffusion coefficients are consistent with those in Wang et al. (2020). It is tempting to think the exploratory jump coefficient $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is similarly the average of $\\gamma$ with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$; but unfortunately it is generally not true. This in turn is one of the main distinctive features in studying RL for jump-diffusions.\n\nWe approach the problem by analyzing the integrals in (12). Using the second-order Taylor expansion, the boundedness of $\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(t, x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and condition (iii) of Assumption 1, we obtain that for fixed $(t, x)$ and each $k$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z)\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq C \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z)\\right|^{2} \\nu_{k}(d z) \\leq C\\left(1+|x|^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor some constant $C>0$, which is independent of $a$. It follows that\n\n$$\n(12)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a\n$$\n\nCombining (13) and (15), the infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}^{\\pi}$ of the sample state process is given by the probability weighted average of the generator $\\mathcal{L}^{a}$ of the classical controlled jump-diffusion, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\pi} f(t, x)=\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\mathcal{L}^{a} f(t, x) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a\n$$\n\nNext, we reformulate the integrals in (15) to convert them to the same form as (5), from which we can infer the SDE for the exploratory state process.\n\nRecall that the Poisson random measure $N_{k}(d t, d z)$ with intensity measure $d t \\nu_{k}(d z)(k=$ $1, \\cdots, \\ell)$ is defined over the product space $[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}$. We can also interpret $N_{k}$ as a counting measure associated with a random configuration of points $\\left(T_{i}, Y_{i}\\right) \\in[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}$ (Cont and Tankov 2004, Section 2.6.3), i.e.,\n\n$$\nN_{k}=\\sum_{i \\geq 1} \\delta_{\\left(T_{i}, Y_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{x}$ is the Dirac measure with mass one at point $x, T_{i}$ is the arrival time of the $i$ th jump of the L\u00e9vy process $L_{k}$, and $Y_{i}=L_{k}\\left(T_{i}\\right)-L_{k}\\left(T_{i}-\\right)$ is the size of this jump. We can interpret $Y_{i}$ as the mark of the $i$ th event.\n\nAt $T_{i}$, the size of the jump in the controlled state $X$ under policy $\\pi$ is given by $\\gamma\\left(T_{i}, X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}, a_{T_{i}}^{\\pi}, Y_{i}\\right)$, where $X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}$ is the state right before the jump occurs and $a_{T_{i}}^{\\pi}$ is the action generated from the feedback policy $\\pi$. When the policy $\\pi$ is deterministic, the generated action is determined by $\\left(T_{i}, X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}\\right)$ and thus the size of the jump in $X^{\\pi}$ is a function of $\\left(T_{i}, X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}, Y_{i}\\right)$. By contrast, when $\\pi$ becomes stochastic, an additional random noise is introduced at $T_{i}$ that determines the generated action together with $\\left(T_{i}, X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}\\right)$. Consequently, the size of the jump in $X^{\\pi}$ is a function of $\\left(T_{i}, X_{T_{i-}}^{\\pi}, Y_{i}\\right)$ plus the random noise for exploration at $T_{i}$.\n\nThis motivates us to construct new Poisson random measures on an extended space to capture the effect of random noise on jumps for stochastic policies. Specifically, for each $k=1, \\cdots, \\ell$, we construct a new Poisson random measure, denoted by $N_{k}^{\\prime}(d t, d z, d u)$, on the product space $[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times[0,1]^{n}$, with its intensity measure given by $d t \\nu_{k}(d z) d u$. Here, $u$ is the realized value of the $n$-dimensional random vector $U$ that follows $\\mathcal{U}\\left([0,1]^{n}\\right)$, which is the random noise introduced in the probability space for exploration. The new Poisson random measure $N_{k}^{\\prime}$ is also a counting measure associated with a random configuration of points $\\left(T_{i}, Y_{i}, U_{i}\\right) \\in[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times[0,1]^{n}$ :\n\n$$\nN_{k}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i \\geq 1} \\delta_{\\left(T_{i}, Y_{i}, U_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $T_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ are the same as above, and $U_{i}$ is the $\\mathcal{U}\\left([0,1]^{n}\\right)$ random vector that generates random exploration at $T_{i}$. Hence, the $i$ th event is marked by both $Y_{i}$ and $U_{i}$ under $N_{k}^{\\prime}$. We let $N^{\\prime}(d t, d z, d u)=\\left(N_{1}^{\\prime}\\left(d t, d z_{1}, d u\\right), \\cdots, N_{\\ell}^{\\prime}\\left(d t, d z_{\\ell}, d u\\right)\\right)^{\\top}$.\n\nIn general, for any $n$-dimensional random vector $\\xi$ that follows distribution $\\pi$, we can find a measurable function $G^{\\pi}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\xi=G^{\\pi}(U)$, where $U \\sim \\mathcal{U}\\left([0,1]^{n}\\right)$. As an example, consider $\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, A A^{\\top}\\right)$. We can represent it as $\\xi=\\mu+A \\Phi^{-1}(U)$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the univariate standard normal distribution and $\\Phi^{-1}(U)$ is a vector obtained by applying $\\Phi^{-1}$ to each component of $U$.\n\nFor the stochastic feedback policy $\\pi_{t, x}$, using $a=G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u)$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}(t, x, a, z) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z) \\pi(a \\mid t, x) d a\n$$\n\n$$\n=\\int_{\\mathbb{R} \\times[0,1]^{n}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u), z\\right)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u), z\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z) d u\n$$\n\nIt follows that the infinitesimal generator of the sample state process can be written as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{L}^{\\pi} f(t, x)=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}(t, x)+\\tilde{b}\\left(s, x, \\pi_{t, x}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)+\\frac{1}{2} \\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(s, x, \\pi_{t, x}\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}(t, x) \\\\\n& +\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{\\mathbb{R} \\times[0,1]^{n}}\\left(f\\left(t, x+\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u), z\\right)\\right)-f(t, x)-\\gamma_{k}\\left(t, x, G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u), z\\right) \\circ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu_{k}(d z) d u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nComparing (17) with (5) in terms of the integral part that characterizes the behavior of jumps, we observe that the new measure $\\nu_{k}(d z) d u$ replaces the L\u00e9vy measure $\\nu_{k}(d z)$ and integration is done over an extended space to capture the effect of random exploration on jumps. The jump coefficient function that generates the jump size in the controlled state process $X$ given the L\u00e9vy jump with size $z$ and control variable $a$ is still the same. However, in (17) the control $a$ is generated from $u$ as $G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u)$, where $u$ is the realized value of the random noise introduced for exploration. In the following, we will also write $G^{\\pi_{t, x}}(u)$ as $G^{\\pi}(t, x, u)$ whenever using the latter simplifies notations.\n\nBased on (17), we see that the exploratory state should be the solution to the following L\u00e9vy SDE:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd X_{s}^{\\pi}= & \\tilde{b}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}, \\pi\\left(\\cdot \\mid s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right) d s+\\tilde{\\sigma}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}, \\pi\\left(\\cdot \\mid s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right) d W_{s} \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\mathbb{R} \\times[0,1]^{n}} \\gamma\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}, G^{\\pi}\\left(s, X_{s-}^{\\pi}, u\\right), z\\right) \\tilde{X}^{\\prime}(d s, d z, d u), X_{t}^{\\pi}=x, s \\in[t, T]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich we call the exploratory L\u00e9vy SDE. The solution process, if exists, is denoted by $\\tilde{X}^{\\pi}$ and called the exploratory (state) process. As we explain below, this process informs us the behavior of the key characteristics of the sample state process after averaging over infinitely many actions sampled from the stochastic policy $\\pi$.\n\nIn general, the sample state process $X^{\\pi}$ defined by (9) is a semimartingale, as it is the sum of three processes: the drift process that has finite variation (the first term in (9)), the continuous (local) martingale driven by the Brownian motion (the second term in (9)), and the discontinuous (local) martingale driven by the compensated Poisson random measure (the third term in (9)). Any semimartingale is fully determined by three characteristics: the drift, the quadratic variation of the continuous local martingale, and the compensator of the random measure associated with the process's jumps (the compensator gives the jump intensity); see Jacod and Shiryaev (2013) for detailed discussions of semimartingales and their characteristics.\n\nFor the sample state process, given that $X_{s-}^{\\pi}=x$ and the action sampled from $\\pi_{s, x}$ is $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$, the characteristics over an infinitesimally small time interval $[s, s+d s]$ are given by the triplet $\\left(b(s, x, a) d s, \\sigma^{2}(s, x, a) d s, \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\gamma_{k}(s, x, a, z) \\nu_{k}(d z) d s\\right)$.\n\nNow consider the exploratory state process $\\tilde{X}^{\\pi}$, which is also a semimartingale by (18). Its characteristics over an infinitesimally small time interval $[s, s+d s]$ with $\\tilde{X}_{s-}^{\\pi}=x$ are given by the triplet $\\left(\\tilde{b}\\left(s, x, \\pi_{s, x}\\right) d s, \\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(s, x, \\pi_{s, x}\\right) d s, \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{[0,1]^{n}} \\gamma_{k}\\left(s, x, G^{\\pi}(s, x, u), z\\right) d u \\cdot \\nu_{k}(d z) d s\\right)$, where the third characteristic is obtained by calculating $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\gamma_{k}\\left(s, x, G^{\\pi}(s, x, u), z\\right) N_{k}(d s, d z, d u)\\right]$\n\nfor L\u00e9vy jumps with size from $[z, z+d z]$. Using (14), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tilde{b}\\left(s, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{s, x}\\right) d s=\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} b(s, x, a) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid s, x) d a d s, \\quad \\tilde{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(s, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{s, x}\\right) d s=\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\sigma^{2}(s, x, a) \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid s, x) d a d s \\\\\n& \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{[0,1]^{n}} \\gamma_{k}(s, x, G(s, x, u), z) d u \\cdot \\nu_{k}(d z) d s=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\gamma_{k}(s, x, a, z) \\nu_{k}(d z) d s \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid s, x) d a\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the semimartingale characteristics of the exploratory state process are the averages of those of the sample state process over action randomization.\n\nRemark 1. In general, there may be other ways to formulate the exploratory SDE in the jumpdiffusion case as we may be able to obtain alternative representations for the infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{L}^{\\pi}$ based on (16). However, the law of the exploratory state would not change because its generator stays the same.\n\nA technical yet foundational question is the well-posedness (i.e. existence and uniqueness of solution) of the exploratory SDE (18), which we address below. For that we first specify the class of admissible strategies, which is the same as that considered in Jia and Zhou (2023) for pure diffusions.\n\nDefinition 1. A policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}=\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\cdot \\mid \\cdot, \\cdot)$ is called admissible, if\n(i) $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\cdot \\mid t, x) \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{A})$, supp $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(\\cdot \\mid t, x)=\\mathcal{A}$ for every $(t, x) \\in[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x):(t, x, a) \\in$ $[0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is measurable;\n(ii) $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x)$ is continuous in $(t, x)$, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x)-\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\left(a \\mid t^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| d a \\rightarrow 0$ as $\\left(t^{\\prime}, x^{\\prime}\\right) \\rightarrow(t, x)$. Furthermore, for any $K>0$, there is a constant $C_{K}>0$ independent of $(t, a)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x)-\\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\left(a \\mid t, x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| d a \\leq C_{K}\\left|x-x^{\\prime}\\right|, \\forall x, x^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}_{K}^{d}\n$$\n\n(iii) $\\forall(t, x), \\int_{\\mathcal{A}}|\\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x)| \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a \\leq C\\left(1+|x|^{p}\\right)$ for some $p \\geq 2$ and $C$ is a positive constant; for any $q \\geq 1, \\int_{\\mathcal{A}}|a|^{q} \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a \\leq C_{q}\\left(1+|x|^{p}\\right)$ for some $p \\geq 2$ and $C_{q}$ is a positive constant that can depend on $q$.\n\nNext, we establish the well-posedness of (18) under any admissible policy. The result of the next lemma regarding $\\tilde{b}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is provided in the proof of Lemma 2 in Jia and Zhou (2022b), which uses property (ii) of admissibility.\n\nLemma 1.

We need to distinguish two cases, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the $q$-function can be computed and integrated explicitly.\n\nWe first discuss the case when the normalizing constant in the Gibbs measure can be computed explicitly. We denote by $J^{\\psi}$ and $q^{\\phi}$ the parameterized function approximators for the optimal value function and optimal $q$-function, respectively. In view of Theorem 4, these approximators are chosen to satisfy\n\n$$\nJ^{\\psi}(T, x)=h(x), \\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta} q^{\\phi}(t, x, a)\\right) d a=1\n$$\n\nWe can then update $(\\psi, \\phi)$ by enforcing the martingale condition discussed in Theorem 4 and applying the techniques developed in Jia and Zhou (2022a). This procedure has been discussed in details in Section 4.1 of Jia and Zhou (2023), and hence we omit the details. For reader's convenience, we\n\npresent Algorithms 1 and 2, which summarize the offline and online $q$-learning algorithms respectively. Such algorithms are based on the so-called martingale orthogonality condition in Jia and Zhou (2022a), where the typical choices of test functions in these algorithms are $\\xi_{t}=\\frac{\\partial J^{\\psi}}{\\partial \\phi}\\left(t, X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}\\right)$, and $\\zeta_{t}=\\frac{\\partial q^{\\phi}}{\\partial \\phi}\\left(t, X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}, a_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}\\right)$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}$ is the policy generated by $q^{\\phi}$. Note that these two algorithms are identical to Algorithms 2 and 3 in Jia and Zhou (2023).\n\nWhen the normalizing constant in the Gibbs measure is not available, we take the same approach as in Jia and Zhou (2023) to develop learning algorithms. Specifically, we consider $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}(\\cdot \\mid t, x)\\right\\}_{\\phi \\in \\Phi}$, which is a family of density functions of some tractable distributions, e.g. multivariate normal distributions. Starting from a stochastic policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}$ in this family, we update the policy by considering the optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\phi^{\\prime} \\in \\Phi} \\mathrm{KL}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi^{\\prime}}(\\cdot \\mid t, x) \\mid \\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta} q(t, x, \\cdot ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi})\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nSpecifically, using gradient descent, we can update $\\phi$ as in Jia and Zhou (2023), by\n\n$$\n\\phi \\leftarrow \\phi-\\theta \\alpha_{\\phi} d t\\left[\\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}\\left(a_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}} \\mid t, X_{t-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\theta} q\\left(t, X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}, a_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}\\right)\\right] \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}\\left(a_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}} \\mid t, X_{t-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the above updating rule, we need only the values of the $q$-function along the trajectory - the \"data\" $-\\left\\{\\left(t, X_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}, a_{t}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}}\\right) ; 0 \\leq t \\leq T\\right\\}$, instead of its full functional form. These values can be learned through the \"temporal difference\" of the value function along the data.

This important insight, concluded only after a rigorous theoretical analysis, shows that the continuous-time RL algorithms are robust to the presence of jumps and essentially model-free, at least for the MV portfolio selection problem.\n\nFollowing Jia and Zhou (2023), we parametrize the value function as\n\n$$\nJ^{\\psi}(t, x ; \\omega)=(x-\\omega)^{2} e^{-\\psi_{3}(T-t)}+\\psi_{2}\\left(t^{2}-T^{2}\\right)+\\psi_{1}(t-T)-(\\omega-z)^{2}\n$$\n\nand the $q$-function as\n\n$$\nq^{\\phi}(t, x, a ; w)=-\\frac{e^{-\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{3}(T-t)}}{2}\\left(a+\\phi_{1}(x-w)\\right)^{2}-\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\left[\\log 2 \\pi \\theta+\\phi_{2}+\\phi_{3}(T-t)\\right]\n$$\n\nLet $\\psi=\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\psi_{2}, \\psi_{3}\\right)^{\\top}$ and $\\phi=\\left(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\phi_{3}\\right)^{\\top}$. The policy associated with the parametric $q$-function is $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}(\\cdot \\mid t, x ; w)=\\mathcal{N}\\left(-\\phi_{1}(x-w), \\theta e^{\\phi_{2}+\\phi_{3}(T-t)}\\right)$. In addition to $\\psi$ and $\\phi$, we learn the Lagrange multiplier $\\omega$ in the same way as in Jia and Zhou (2023) by the stochastic approximation algorithm that updates $\\omega$ with a learning rate after a fixed number of iterations.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 15, "text": "# 5.3 Simulation study \n\nWe assess the effect of jumps on the convergence behavior of our algorithms via a simulation study. We use the same basic setting as in Jia and Zhou (2023): $x_{0}=1, z=1.4, T=1$ year, $\\Delta t=1 / 252$ years (corresponding to one trading day), and a chosen temperature parameter $\\theta=0.1$. We consider two market simulators: one is given by the Black-Scholes (BS) model and the other is Merton's jump-diffusion (MJD) model in which the L\u00e9vy density is a scaled Gaussian density, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\nu(z)=\\lambda \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\delta^{2}}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{(z-m)^{2}}{2 \\delta^{2}}\\right), \\lambda>0, \\delta>0, m \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the arrival rate of the Poisson jumps. The Gaussian assumption is a common choice in the finance literature for modeling the jump-size distribution (see e.g. Merton 1976, Bates 1991, Das 2002), partly due to its tractability for statistical estimation and partly because heavy-tailed distributions may not be easily identified from real data when the number of jumps is limited (see Heyde and Kou 2004).\n\nUnder the latter model, we have\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{J}^{2}=\\lambda\\left[\\exp \\left(2 m+2 \\delta^{2}\\right)-2 \\exp \\left(m+\\frac{1}{2} \\delta^{2}\\right)+1\\right]\n$$\n\nTo mimic the real market, we set the parameters of these two simulators by estimating them from the daily data of the S\\&P 500 index using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Our estimation data cover a long period from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2023. In Table 1, we summarize the estimated parameter values (used for the simulators) and the corresponding value of $\\phi_{1}^{*}$ in the optimal policy. Note that although we use a stochastic policy to interact with the environment during training to update the policy parameters, for actual execution of portfolio selection we apply a deterministic policy which is the mean part of the optimal stochastic policy after it has been learned. So it is off-policy learning here. The advantage of doing so among others is to reduce the variance of the final wealth; see Huang et al. (2022) for a discussion on this approach. As a result, here we only display the values for $\\phi_{1}^{*}$ in these two environments and use them as benchmarks to check the convergence of our algorithm (see Figure 1).\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: Parameters used in the two simulators. The column \"Optimal\" reports the values of $\\phi_{1}$ in the optimal policies calculated using the respective simulators.\n\nFor offline learning, the Lagrange multiplier $\\omega$ is updated after every $m=10$ iterations, and the parameter vectors $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ are initialized as zero vectors. The learning rates are set to be $\\alpha_{w}=0.05, \\alpha_{\\psi}=0.001$, and $\\alpha_{\\phi}=0.1$ with decay rate $l(j)=j^{-0.51}$, where $j$ is the iteration index. In each iteration, we generate 32 independent $T$-year trajectories to update the parameters. We train the model for $N=20000$ iterations.\n\nWe also consider online learning with $\\Delta t$ equal to one trading day. We select a batch size of 128 trading days and update the parameters after this number of observations coming in. We\n\nset $m=1$ for updating $\\omega$ and initialize $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ as zero vectors. The learning rates are set as $\\alpha_{w}=0.01, \\alpha_{\\psi}=0.001$, and $\\alpha_{\\phi}=0.05$ with decay rate $l(j)=j^{-0.51}$. Some of the rates are notably smaller under online learning because now we update with fewer observations and thus must be more cautious. The model is again trained for $N=20000$ iterations.\n\nFigure 1 plots the convergence behavior of offline and online learning under both simulators or market environments (one with jumps and one without). The algorithms have converged after a sufficient number of iterations, whether jumps are present or not. This demonstrates that convergence of the offline and online $q$-learning algorithms proposed in Jia and Zhou (2023) under the diffusion setting is robust to the presence of jumps for mean-variance portfolio selection. However, jumps in the environment can introduce more variability in the convergence process as seen from the plots.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Convergence of the offline and online

{"section_id": 16, "text": "# 5.4 Effects of jumps \n\nThe theoretical analysis so far in this section shows that, for the mean-variance problem, one does not need to know in advance whether or not the stock prices have jumps in order to carry out the RL task, because the optimal stochastic policy is Gaussian and the corresponding value function and $q$-function have the same structures for parameterization irrespective of the presence of jumps.\n\nHowever, we stress that this is rather an exception than a rule. Here we give a counterexample.\nConsider a modification of the mean-variance problem where the controlled system dynamics is\n\n$$\nd X_{t}^{a}=a_{t} \\sigma \\rho d t+a_{t} \\sigma d B_{t}+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\gamma\\left(a_{t}, z\\right) \\widetilde{N}(d t, d z)\n$$\n\nwith\n\n$$\n\\gamma(a, z)=a^{2}\n$$\n\nand the exploratory objective is\n\n$$\nJ^{*}(t, x ; w)=\\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\left(X_{T}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}-w\\right)^{2}+\\theta \\int_{t}^{T} \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\left(a_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\mid s, X_{s-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right) d s\\right]-(\\omega-z)^{2}\n$$\n\nNote that this is not a mean-variance portfolio selection problem because (45) does not correspond to a self-financed wealth equation with a reasonably modelled stock price process.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH\\left(t, x, a, v_{x}, v_{x x}, v\\right)= & a \\sigma \\rho v_{x}(t, x)+\\frac{1}{2} a^{2} \\sigma^{2} v_{x x}(t, x) \\\\\n& +\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(v\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-v(t, x)-a^{2} \\cdot v_{x}(t, x)\\right) \\nu(d z)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf an optimal stochastic policy exists, then it must be\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}(a \\mid t, x) \\propto \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\theta} H\\left(t, x, a, J_{x}^{*}, J_{x x}^{*}, J^{*}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nWe show by contradiction that the optimal stochastic policy can not be Gaussian in this case. Note that if there is no optimal stochastic policy, then it would already demonstrate that jumps matter because the optimal stochastic policy for the case of no jumps exists and is Gaussian.\n\nRemark 4. The existence of optimal stochastic policy in (48) is equivalent to the integrability of the quantity $\\exp \\left(\\frac{1}{\\theta} H\\left(t, x, a, J_{x}^{*}, J_{x x}^{*}, J^{*}\\right)\\right)$ over $a \\in \\mathcal{A}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$. This integrability depends on the tail behavior of the Hamiltonian and, in particular, the behavior of $J^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)$ when $a^{2}$ is large.\n\nSuppose the optimal stochastic policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}(\\cdot \\mid t, x)$ is Gaussian for all $(t, x)$, implying that the Hamiltonian $H\\left(t, x, a, J_{x}^{*}, J_{x x}^{*}, J^{*}\\right)$ is a quadratic function of $a$. It then follows from (47) that there exist functions $h_{1}(t, x)$ and $h_{2}(t, x)$ such that\n\n$$\nJ^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-J^{*}(t, x)-a^{2} J_{x}^{*}(t, x)=a^{2} \\cdot h_{1}(t, x)+a \\cdot h_{2}(t, x), \\quad \\text { for all }(t, x, a)\n$$\n\nWe do not put a term independent of $a$ on the right-hand side because the left-hand side is zero when $a=0$. Taking derivative with respect to $a$, we obtain\n\n$$\nJ_{x}^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right) \\cdot 2 a-2 a J_{x}^{*}(t, x)=2 a \\cdot h_{1}(t, x)+h_{2}(t, x), \\quad \\text { for all }(t, x, a)\n$$\n\nSetting $a=0$, we get $h_{2}=0$. It follows that\n\n$$\na \\cdot\\left[J_{x}^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-J_{x}^{*}(t, x)-h_{1}(t, x)\\right]=0 \\quad \\text { for all }(t, x, a)\n$$\n\nHence we have $h_{1}(t, x)=J_{x}^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-J_{x}^{*}(t, x)$ for any $a \\neq 0$. Sending $a$ to zero yields $h_{1}(t, x)=0$ for all $(t, x)$. Therefore, we obtain from (49) that\n\n$$\nJ^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-J^{*}(t, x)-a^{2} J_{x}^{*}(t, x)=0, \\quad \\text { for all }(t, x, a)\n$$\n\nTaking derivative in $a$ in the above we have\n\n$$\nJ_{x}^{*}\\left(t, x+a^{2}\\right)-J_{x}^{*}(t, x)=0, \\quad \\text { for all }(t, x, a)\n$$\n\nThus $J_{x}^{*}$ is constant in $x$ or $J^{*}$ is affine in $x$, leading to $J^{*}(t, x)=g_{1}(t) x+g_{2}(t)$ for some functions $g_{1}(t)$ and $g_{2}(t)$. The resulting Hamiltonian becomes\n\n$$\nH\\left(t, x, a, J_{x}^{*}, J_{x x}^{*}, J^{*}\\right)=a \\sigma \\rho g_{1}(t)\n$$\n\nThis is linear in $a \\in \\mathcal{A}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$ and hence the integral $\\int_{\\mathcal{A}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\theta} H\\left(t, x, a, J_{x}^{*}, J_{x x}^{*}, J^{*}\\right)\\right) d a$ does not exist. It follows that $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}(\\cdot \\mid t, x)$ does not exist, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we have shown that under (46), the optimal stochastic policy either does not exist or is not Gaussian when it exists.\n\nRemark 5. The argument above works for $\\gamma(a, z)=a^{m}$ for any $m>1$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 17, "text": "# 6 Application: Mean-Variance Hedging of Options \n\nThe MV portfolio selection problem considered in Section 5 is an LQ problem. In this section, we present another application that is non-LQ. Consider an option seller who needs to hedge a short position in a European-style option that expires at time $T$. The option is written on a risky asset whose price process $S$ is described by the SDE (33) with condition (36) satisfied. At the terminal time $T$, the seller pays $G\\left(S_{T}\\right)$ to the option holder. We assume that the seller's hedging activity will not affect the risky asset price.\n\nTo hedge the random payoff, the seller constructs a portfolio consisting of the underlying risky asset and cash. We consider discounted quantities in the problem: the discounted risky asset price $\\hat{S}_{t}:=e^{-r_{f} t} S_{t}$ and discounted payoff $\\hat{G}\\left(\\hat{S}_{T}\\right):=e^{-r_{f} T} G\\left(S_{T}\\right)$, where $r_{f}$ is again the constant risk-free interest rate. As an example, for a put option with strike price $\\mathcal{K}, G\\left(S_{T}\\right)=\\left(\\mathcal{K}-S_{T}\\right)^{+}$ $\\left(x^{+}:=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$ ), and $\\hat{G}\\left(\\hat{S}_{T}\\right)=\\left(\\tilde{\\mathcal{K}}-\\hat{S}_{T}\\right)^{+}$, where $\\tilde{\\mathcal{K}}:=e^{-r_{f} T} \\mathcal{K}$. Here $\\hat{S}$ follows the SDE\n\n$$\nd \\hat{S}_{t}=\\hat{S}_{t-}\\left[\\rho \\sigma d t+\\sigma d W_{t}+\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\exp (z)-1) \\widetilde{N}(d t, d z)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is defined in (35).\nWe denote the discounted dollar value in the risky asset and the discounted value of the hedging portfolio at time $t$ by $a_{t}$ and $X_{t}$, respectively. As in the MV portfolio selection problem, $a_{t}$ is the control variable and $X$ follows the SDE (34). The seller seeks a hedging policy to minimize the deviation from the terminal payoff. A popular formulation is mean-variance hedging (also known as quadratic hedging), which considers the objective\n\n$$\n\\min _{a} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_{T}^{a}-\\hat{G}\\left(\\hat{S}_{T}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that this expectation is taken under the real-world probability measure, rather than under any martingale measure for option pricing. An advantage of this formulation is that relevant data are observable in real world (but not necessarily in a risk-neutral world). Although objective (50) looks similar to that of the MV portfolio selection problem, the target the hedging portfolio tries to meet is now random instead of constant. Furthermore, the payoff is generally nonlinear in $\\hat{S}_{T}$. Thus, MV hedging is not an LQ problem.

It is also obvious to see that $V(t, S, x)$ given by (53) has quadratic growth in $S$ and $x$. Therefore, by Lemma 5, we have the following conclusion.\n\nProposition 3. For the MV hedging problem (50), the optimal value function $J^{*}(t, S, x)=V(t, S, x)$ and the optimal stochastic policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}=\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{c}$ under the assumptions that $\\sigma>0$ and $\\tilde{G}(S)$ is Lipschitz continuous in $S$.\n\nThe mean part of $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}, \\mathcal{M}^{*}(t, S, x)$, comprises three terms. The quantity $h_{S}(t, S)$ is the delta of the option and hence $S h_{S}(t, S)$ gives the dollar amount of the risky asset as required by delta hedging, which is used to hedge continuous price movements. The integral term shows the dollar amount of the risky asset that should be held to hedge discontinuous changes. The two hedges are combined using weights $\\sigma^{2} /\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{J}^{2}\\right)$ and $1 /\\left(\\sigma^{2}+\\sigma_{J}^{2}\\right)$. The last term reflects the adjustment that needs to be made due to the discrepancy between the hedging portfolio value and option price. It is easy to show that $\\mathcal{M}^{*}(t, S, x)$ is the optimal deterministic policy of problem (50).\n\nThe variance of $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}$ is the same as that in the MV portfolio selection problem (c.f. (43)), which decreases as $t$ approaches the terminal time $T$.

We follow the form of the optimal stochastic policy given in (62) to parametrize our policy. To obtain a parsimonious parametrization, we introduce $\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}, \\phi_{3}, \\phi_{4}, \\phi_{5}$, which respectively represent the agent's understanding - relative to her learning - of drift $\\mu$, volatility $\\sigma$, jump arrival rate $\\lambda$, mean $m$ and standard deviation $\\delta$ of the jump size of the risky asset. We emphasize that in our learning algorithm these parameters are not estimated by any statistical method (and hence they do not necessarily correspond to the true dynamics of the risky asset); rather they will be updated based on the hedging experiences (via exploration and exploitation) from the real environment. To implement (62), we also need two dependent parameters $\\phi_{6}$ and $\\phi_{7}$ that are calculated by\n\n$$\n\\phi_{6}=\\frac{\\phi_{1}-r_{f}}{\\phi_{2}}, \\phi_{7}=\\sqrt{\\phi_{3}\\left[\\exp \\left(2 \\phi_{4}+2 \\phi_{5}^{2}\\right)-2 \\exp \\left(\\phi_{4}+\\frac{1}{2} \\phi_{5}^{2}\\right)+1\\right]}\n$$\n\nThese two parameters show the agent's understanding of $\\rho$ and $\\sigma_{J}$, and they will be updated in the learning process by the above equations with the update of the independent parameters $\\phi_{1}$ to $\\phi_{5}$.

For the mean part, we calculate the option price and its delta by plugging $\\phi$\n\ninto (64) and (65), with the results denoted by $\\hat{h}^{\\phi}(t, S)$ and $\\hat{h}_{S}^{\\phi}(t, S)$ respectively, and approximate the integral by Gauss-Hermite (G-H) quadrature, which yields\n$\\mathcal{M}^{\\phi}(t, S, x)=\\frac{\\phi_{2}^{2} S \\hat{h}_{S}^{\\phi}(t, S)+\\frac{\\phi_{3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} w_{q}\\left(\\exp \\left(z_{q}\\right)-1\\right)\\left(\\hat{h}^{\\phi}\\left(t, S \\exp \\left(z_{q}\\right)\\right)-\\hat{h}^{\\phi}(t, S)\\right)-\\phi_{2} \\phi_{6}\\left(x-\\hat{h}^{\\phi}(t, S)\\right)}{\\phi_{2}^{2}+\\phi_{7}^{2}}$,\nwhere $z_{q}=\\phi_{4}+\\phi_{5} u_{q}$ and $\\left\\{\\left(w_{q}, u_{q}\\right), q=1, \\cdots, Q\\right\\}$ are the weights and abscissa of the $Q$-point G-H rule that are predetermined and independent of $\\phi$. For the variance part, we use $\\phi$ in (57) to obtain $f^{\\phi}(t)$. Thus, our parametrized policy is given by\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}(\\cdot \\mid t, S, x) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\cdot \\mid \\mathcal{M}^{\\phi}(t, S, x), \\frac{\\theta}{2\\left(\\phi_{2}^{2}+\\phi_{7}^{2}\\right) f^{\\phi}(t)}\\right)\n$$\n\nCritic parametrization.

We choose Gaussian process for our problem because it is able to generate flexible shapes and can often achieve a reasonably good fit with a moderate amount of data.\n\nActor-critic learning. Consider a time grid $\\left\\{t_{k}\\right\\}_{k=0}^{K}$ with $t_{0}=0, t_{K}=T$, and time step $\\Delta t$. In an iteration, we start with a given policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}$ and use it to collect $M$ episodes from the environment, where the $m$-th episode is given by $\\left\\{\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}^{(m)}, X_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}, a_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right)\\right\\}_{k=0}^{K}$. We then perform two steps.\n\nIn the critic step, the main task is to learn $g_{e}^{\\psi}\\left(t_{k}, S\\right)$ as a function of $S$ for each $t_{k}$. The stochastic representation (61) shows that $g_{e}$ can be viewed as the value function of a stream of rewards that depend on time and the risky asset price; so the task is a policy evaluation problem. We first obtain the running reward path in every episode, where the integral involving the L\u00e9vy measure is again calculated by the $Q$-point G-H rule. Specifically, the reward at time $t_{k}$ for $k=0, \\cdots, K-1$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R_{t_{k}}^{g}:=f^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}\\right)\\left[\\phi_{2}^{2} \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}^{g}\\left(\\hat{h}_{S}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}\\right)\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\phi_{3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} w_{q}\\left(\\hat{h}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}} \\exp \\left(z_{q}\\right)\\right)-\\hat{h}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right] \\Delta t \\\\\n& -\\frac{f^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}\\right)}{\\phi_{2}^{2}+\\phi_{7}^{2}}\\left[\\phi_{2}^{2} \\hat{S}_{t_{k}} \\hat{h}_{S}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}\\right)+\\frac{\\phi_{3}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} w_{q}\\left(\\exp \\left(z_{q}\\right)-1\\right)\\left(\\hat{h}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}} \\exp \\left(z_{q}\\right)\\right)-\\hat{h}^{\\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\hat{S}_{t_{k}}\\right)\\right)\\right]^{2} \\Delta t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the risky asset price path $\\left\\{\\left(\\hat{S}_{t_{k}}\\right)\\right\\}_{k=0}^{K-1}$ is collected from the real environment. We stress again that the above calculation uses the agent's parameters $\\phi$ and does not involve any parameters of the true dynamics. We then fit a Gaussian process to the sample of the cumulative rewards $\\left\\{\\sum_{\\ell=k}^{K-1} R_{t_{\\ell}}^{g,(m)}\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}$ to estimate $g_{e}^{\\psi}\\left(t_{k}, S\\right)$. Figure 2 illustrates the fit at three time points with the radial basis kernel. The Gaussian process is able to provide a good fit to the shape of $g_{e}(t, S)$ as a function of $S$ for each given $t$.\n\nIn the actor step, we update the policy parameter $\\phi_{i}$ for $i=1, \\cdots, 5$ by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{i} \\leftarrow & \\phi_{i}-\\frac{\\alpha_{\\phi_{i}}}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\left[\\theta \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}\\left(\\dot{a}_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)} \\mid t_{k}, \\dot{S}_{t_{k}}^{(m)}, X_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right) \\Delta t\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+J^{\\psi, \\phi}\\left(t_{k+1}, \\dot{S}_{t_{k+1}}^{(m)}, X_{t_{k+1}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right)-J^{\\psi, \\phi}\\left(t_{k}, \\dot{S}_{t_{k}}^{(m)}, X_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right)-\\beta J^{\\psi, \\phi}\\left(t_{k}, X_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right) \\Delta t\\right] \\\\\n& \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi_{i}} \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi}\\left(\\dot{a}_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)} \\mid t_{k}, \\dot{S}_{t_{k}}^{(m)}, X_{t_{k}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{\\phi},(m)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis update essentially follows from (32); the difference is that we do batch processing and update the parameters only after observing all the episodes in a batch.

We assume the environment is described by an MJD model with its true parameters shown in the upper row of Table 2. ${ }^{2}$ We consider hedging a 4-month put option with strike price $\\mathcal{K}=100$ because short-term options with maturity of a few months are typically traded much more actively than longer-term options. We assume the risk-free rate is zero.\n\nWe use 20 quadrature points for the G-H rule in our implementation, which suffices for high accuracy. In each iteration, we sample $M=32$ episodes from the environment simulated by the MJD model. The learning rates are chosen to be $\\alpha_{\\phi_{1}}=5 \\mathrm{e}-3, \\alpha_{\\phi_{2}}=2 \\mathrm{e}-5, \\alpha_{\\phi_{3}}=15, \\alpha_{\\phi_{4}}=1 \\mathrm{e}-6$, $\\alpha_{\\phi_{5}}=1 \\mathrm{e}-6$, while the temperature parameter $\\theta=0.1$. We keep the learning rates constant in the first 30 iterations and then they decay at rate $l(j)=j^{-0.5}$, where $j$ is the iteration index.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ These values are chosen close to the estimates obtained from the market data of S\\&P 500 in Table 1 to make the MJD model better resemble the reality in the simulation study.\n\nBefore our actor-critic learning, we sample a 15-year path from the MJD model as data for MLE and obtain estimates of the parameters shown in Table 2. MLE estimates all the parameters quite well except the drift $\\mu$, where the estimate is more than twice the true value. ${ }^{3}$ We then use these estimates as initial values of $\\phi_{1}$ to $\\phi_{5}$ for learning. Figure 3 clearly shows that our RL algorithm is able to converge near the true values. In particular, the estimate of $\\mu$ eventually moves closely around the true level despite being distant to it initially.\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nTable 2: Parameters of the true MJD model and MLE

{"section_id": 21, "text": "# 6.4 Empirical study \n\nIn the empirical study we consider hedging a European put option written on the S\\&P 500 index. This type of option is popular in the financial market as a tool for investors to protect their high beta investment. We obtain daily observations of the index from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2023 , and split them into two periods: the training period (the first 20 years) and the test period (the last 4 years). The test period includes the U.S. stock market meltdown at the onset of the pandemic, the 2022 bear period, and various bull periods.\n\nWe use the MLE estimates from the first 20 years of observations to initialize $\\phi_{1}$ to $\\phi_{5}$ for learning. To sample an episode from the environment for training our RL algorithm, we bootstrap index returns from the training period. Similarly, we bootstrap index returns from the test period to generate index price paths to test the learned policy. We use the 20 -point G-H rule with $M=32$ episodes in each training iteration. The learning rates are set as $\\alpha_{\\phi_{1}}=5 \\mathrm{e}-3, \\alpha_{\\phi_{2}}=5 \\mathrm{e}-4, \\alpha_{\\phi_{3}}=50$, $\\alpha_{\\phi_{4}}=5 \\mathrm{e}-6, \\alpha_{\\phi_{5}}=1 \\mathrm{e}-5$ with the same learning rate decay schedule as in the simulation study. We set the temperature parameter $\\theta=0.1$.\n\nWe consider four maturities ranging from 1 to 4 months for the put option. For a standard S\\&P500 index option traded on CBOE, in practice its strike is quoted in points commensurate with the scale of the index level and converted to dollar amount by a multiplier of 100 . That is,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ This is expected due to the well-known mean-blur problem, as 15 years of data are significantly insufficient to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of the mean using statistical methods.\n\nthe dollar strike $\\mathcal{K}=100 \\mathcal{K}_{p}$, where $\\mathcal{K}_{p}$ is the strike in points. ${ }^{4}$ Let $S_{t}$ be the index level at time $t$ converted to dollars by the multiplier of 100 . We sample $S_{0}$ uniformly from the range $[0.7 \\mathcal{K}, 1.3 \\mathcal{K}]$ to generate training and test episodes. This allows us to include scenarios where the option is deep out of money or in the money. We train our algorithm for 100 iterations and then test it on 5000 index price episodes. Finally, although we use a stochastic policy to interact with the environment for learning/updating the parameters during training, in the test stage we apply a deterministic policy which is the mean of the learned stochastic policy. This can reduce the variance of the final hedging error.\n\nTo measure the test performance, we consider the mean squared hedging error (denominated in squared dollars) divided by $\\mathcal{K}_{p}^{2}$. This effectively normalizes the contract's scale; so we can just set $\\mathcal{K}_{p}=1$ in our implementation. The test result can be interpreted as the average mean squared hedging error in squared dollars for every point of strike price.\n\nWe compare the performances of the policy learned by our RL algorithm and the one obtained by plugging the MLE estimates from the training period data to (63). Both policies are tested on the same index price episodes. We check the statistical significance of the difference in the squared hedging errors of the two policies by applying the t-test. Table 3 reports the mean squared hedging error for each policy as well as the p-value of the t-test. Not surprisingly, the hedging error of each policy increases as the maturity becomes longer due to greater uncertainty in the problem. In every case, the RL policy achieves notable reduction in the hedging error compared with the MLE-based policy. The p-value further shows the outperformance of the former is statistically significant.\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\nTable 3: Mean squared hedging errors of the two policies in the empirical test with their standard errors shown in parenthesis", "tables": {"table_2": "| Maturity | RL policy | MLE policy | p-value |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 month | $0.3513(0.034)$ | $0.4006(0.043)$ | $3.2 \\mathrm{e}-7$ |\n| 2 months | $0.5668(0.029)$ | $0.6796(0.050)$ | $1.2 \\mathrm{e}-5$ |\n| 3 months | $0.8283(0.031)$ | $1.0080(0.060)$ | $1.6 \\mathrm{e}-5$ |\n| 4 months | $0.8649(0.047)$ | $1.1544(0.068)$ | $4.2 \\mathrm{e}-13$ |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 22, "text": "# 7 Conclusions \n\nFluctuations in data or time series coming from nonlinear, complex dynamic systems are characterized by two types: slow changes and sudden jumps, the latter occurring much rarely than the former. Hence jump-diffusions capture the key structural characteristics of many data generating processes in areas such as physics, astrophysics, earth science, engineering, finance, and medicine. As a result, RL for jump-diffusions is important both theoretically and practically. This paper endeavors to lay a theoretical foundation for the study. A key insight from this research is that temporal-difference algorithms designed for diffusions can work seamlessly for jump-diffusions. However, unless using general neural networks, policy parameterization does need to respond to the presence of jumps if one is to take advantage of any special structure of an underlying problem.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ For example, for an at-the-money option contract where the current index is 5000 points, we have $\\mathcal{K}_{p}=5000$.

Thus, (71) is a square-integrable martingale with mean zero.\n\nFor (72), we can use the same arguments as in the finite activity case by observing $\\int_{|z|>1} \\nu_{k}(d z)<$ $\\infty$ to show that each of the two processes in (72) is a square-integrable martingale with mean zero.\n\nCombining the results above, setting $t^{\\prime}=T$, and taking expectation, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\S}\\left[e^{-\\beta\\left(T \\wedge \\tau_{n}\\right)} \\phi\\left(\\tilde{X}_{T \\wedge \\tau_{n}}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right]-e^{-\\beta t} \\phi(t, x)=\\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\S}\\left[\\int_{t}^{T \\wedge \\tau_{n}} e^{-\\beta s}\\left(\\mathcal{L}^{\\pi} \\phi\\left(s, \\tilde{X}_{s-}^{\\pi}\\right)-\\beta \\phi\\left(s, \\tilde{X}_{s-}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right) d s\\right]\n$$\n\nAs $\\phi(s, x)$ satisfies Eq.

(23) that the term on the right-hand side of (73) is dominated by $C\\left(1+\\sup _{t \\leq s \\leq T}\\left|\\tilde{X}_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\\right|^{p}\\right)$ for some $p \\geq 2$, which has finite expectation from the moment estimate (19). Therefore, sending $n$ to infinity in (73) and applying the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain $\\phi(t, x)=J(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi})$.\n\nProof of Lemma 5. We first maximize the integral in (24). Applying (Jia and Zhou 2023, Lemma 13), we deduce that $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}$ given by (25) is the unique maximizer. Next, we show that $\\psi(t, x)$ is the optimal value function.\n\nOn one hand, given any admissible stochastic policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Pi}$, from (24) we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi(t, x)}{\\partial t}+\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\left\\{H\\left(t, x, a, \\psi_{x}, \\psi_{x x}, \\psi\\right)-\\theta \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x)\\right\\} \\boldsymbol{\\pi}(a \\mid t, x) d a-\\beta \\psi(t, x) \\leq 0\n$$\n\nUsing similar arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4, we obtain $J(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}) \\leq \\psi(t, x)$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Pi}$. Thus, $J^{*}(t, x) \\leq \\psi(t, x)$.\n\nOn the other hand, Eq. (24) becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\psi(t, x)}{\\partial t}+\\int_{\\mathcal{A}}\\left\\{H\\left(t, x, a, \\psi_{x}, \\psi_{x x}, \\psi\\right)-\\theta \\log \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}(a)\\right\\} \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}(a) d a-\\beta \\psi(t, x)=0\n$$\n\nwith $\\psi(T, x)=h(x)$. By Lemma 4, we obtain that $J\\left(t, x, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}\\right)=\\psi(t, x)$. It follows that $J^{*}(t, x) \\geq$ $\\psi(t, x)$.\n\nCombining these results, we conclude that $J^{*}(t, x)=\\psi(t, x)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{*}$ is the optimal stochastic policy.\n\nProof of Theorem 2. Consider part (i). Applying It\u00f4's formula to the value function of policy $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ over the sample state process defined by (9) and using the definition of $q$-function, we obtain that for $0 \\leq t<s \\leq T$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& e^{-\\beta s} J\\left(s, X_{s}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)-e^{-\\beta t} J(t, x ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi})+\\int_{t}^{s} e^{-\\beta \\tau}\\left[r\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right] d \\tau \\\\\n& =\\int_{t}^{s} e^{-\\beta \\tau}\\left[q\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}\\right)\\right] d \\tau+\\int_{t}^{s} e^{-\\beta \\tau} J_{x}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right) \\circ \\sigma\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\pi}, a_{\\tau}^{\\pi}\\right) d W_{\\tau} \\\\\n& \\quad+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell} \\int_{t}^{s} e^{-\\beta \\tau} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left(J\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}+\\gamma_{k}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, z\\right)\\right)-J\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)\\right) \\widehat{N}_{k}(d \\tau, d z)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSuppose $\\hat{q}(t, x, a)=q(t, x, a ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi})$ for all $(t, x, a)$. Hence the first term on the right-hand side of (74) is zero. We verify the following two conditions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\S}\\left[\\int_{t}^{T} e^{-2 \\beta \\tau}\\left|J_{x}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right) \\circ \\sigma\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\pi}, a_{\\tau}^{\\pi}\\right)\\right|^{2} d \\tau\\right]<\\infty \\\\\n& \\mathbb{E}_{t, x}^{\\S}\\left[\\int_{t}^{T} e^{-2 \\beta \\tau} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left|J\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}+\\gamma_{k}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, z\\right) ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)-J\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\nu_{k}(d z) d \\tau\\right]<\\infty\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEq. (75) follows from Assumption 1-(iii), the polynomial growth of $J_{x}$ in $x$, and the moment estimate (20).

It follows that the second and third processes on the right-hand side of (74) are $\\left(\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{s}\\right\\}_{s \\geq 0}, \\overline{\\mathbb{P}}\\right)$-martingales and thus we have the martingale property of the process given by (26).\n\nConversely, if (26) is a $\\left(\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{s}\\right\\}_{s \\geq 0}, \\overline{\\mathbb{P}}\\right)$-martingale, we see from (74) that the process\n\n$$\n\\int_{t}^{s} e^{-\\beta \\tau}\\left[q\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi}\\right)-\\hat{q}\\left(\\tau, X_{\\tau-}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}, a_{\\tau}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}\\right)\\right] d \\tau\n$$\n\nis also a $\\left(\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{s}\\right\\}_{s \\geq 0}, \\overline{\\mathbb{P}}\\right)$-martingale. Furthermore, it has continuous sample paths and finite variation and thus is equal to zero $\\overline{\\mathbb{P}}$-almost surely. We can then follow the argument in the proof of Theorem 6 in Jia and Zhou (2023) to show that $\\hat{q}(t, x, a)=q(t, x, a ; \\boldsymbol{\\pi})$ for all $(t, x, a)$. There is only one step in their proof that we need to modify due to the presence of jumps.\n\nSpecifically, consider the sample state process $X^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$ starting from some time-state-action $\\left(t^{*}, x^{*}, a^{*}\\right)$. Fix $\\delta>0$ and define\n\n$$\nT_{\\delta}=\\inf \\left\\{t^{\\prime} \\geq t^{*}:\\left|X_{t^{\\prime}}^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}-x^{*}\\right|>\\delta\\right\\} \\wedge\\left(t^{*}+\\delta\\right)\n$$\n\nIn the pure diffusion case, Jia and Zhou (2023) uses the continuity of the sample paths of $X^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$ to argue that $T_{\\delta}>t^{*}, \\overline{\\mathbb{P}}$-almost surely. This result still holds with presence of jumps, because the L\u00e9vy processes that drive our controlled state $X^{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$ are stochastic continuous, i.e., the probability of having a jump at the fixed time $t^{*}$ is zero.\n\nTo prove parts (ii) and (iii), we can apply the arguments used in proving part (i) together with those arguments from the proof of Theorem 6 in Jia and Zhou (2023). The details are omitted.\n\nProof of Lemma 6. (1) Consider the function $h^{\\prime}(t, S)$ defined by the RHS of (59). Proposition 12.1 in Cont and Tankov (2004) shows that $h^{\\prime} \\in C^{1,2}\\left([0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right) \\cap C\\left([0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$and it satisfies\n\nthe PIDE (55). Furthermore, $h^{\\prime}(t, S)$ is Lipschitz continuous in $S$. The Lipschitz continuity of function $\\hat{G}$ also implies $\\left|\\hat{G}\\left(\\hat{S}_{T}\\right)\\right| \\leq C\\left(1+\\hat{S}_{T}\\right)$ for some constant $C>0$. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\left|h^{\\prime}(t, S)\\right| \\leq C\\left(1+\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\hat{S}_{T} \\mid \\hat{S}_{t}=S\\right]\\right) \\leq C(1+S)\n$$\n\nwhere we used the martingale property of $\\hat{S}$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Feynman-Kac Theorem (see Zhu et al. (2015)) implies uniqueness of classical solutions satisfying the linear growth condition.\n(2) To study the PIDE (56), we consider the function $g^{\\prime}(t, S)$ defined by the RHS of (60). Under the assumption of Lemma 6, the arguments of Proposition 12.1 in Cont and Tankov (2004) can be used to show that $g^{\\prime} \\in C^{1,2}\\left([0, T) \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right) \\cap C\\left([0, T] \\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}\\right)$and it satisfies the PIDE (56). The Lipschits continuity of $h(t, S)$ in $S$ implies that $h_{S}(t, S)$ is bounded and $|h(t, S \\exp (z))-h(t, S)| \\leq$ $C(\\exp (z)-1)$. We also have $\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\sup _{t \\leq s \\leq T} \\hat{S}_{s}^{2} \\mid \\hat{S}_{t}=S\\right] \\leq C\\left(1+S^{2}\\right)$ (Kunita (2004), Theorem 3.2). Combining these results, we see that $g^{\\prime}(t, S)$ shows quadratic growth in $S$. Again the Feynman-Kac Theorem implies uniqueness of classical solutions satisfying the quadratic growth condition.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}], "id": "2405.16449v3", "authors": ["Xuefeng Gao", "Lingfei Li", "Xun Yu Zhou"], "categories": ["cs.LG", "math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "abstract": "We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control\nin which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes.
