      "text": "#### Abstract\n\nThis is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models that assumed the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\sim 0.7$.\n\n\nKey Words: dark energy, cosmological parameters, cosmological constant",

      "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nUntil 1998, most theories describing the structure of the Universe focused on its expansion rate, its density, and standard general relativity. They rarely considered a cosmological constant or any form of \"dark energy.\" ${ }^{1}$ This exclusion of the cosmological constant was justified because there was no direct evidence for its existence, and some theoretical predictions found \"the Cosmological Constant is probably zero.\" ${ }^{2}$ In fact, during the mid-1990's, research teams calibrating Type Ia supernovae were primarily concerned with determining the Hubble constant and the deceleration of the Universe's expansion, not with investigating any cosmological constant. ${ }^{3}$\n\nIn the early 1990's, remarkable progress was made in obtaining precise measurements of various properties of the Universe. These properties included its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, its large-scale structure (including dark matter), the large-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and the \"horizon problem\". These measurements were conducted by different teams, independently of each other and without the influence of existing theories, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. Some theorists observed that these independent observations were mutually inconsistent, which led to the exploration of solutions involving a cosmological constant.\n\nHowever, the cosmological constant has a complex and controversial history. Einstein initially introduced it into his general relativity field equations to prevent the prediction that the Universe's mass would cause space to contract over time due to gravity. However, Vesto Slipher's longexposure photographic spectra (taking more than 24 hours) revealed that most \"spiral nebulae\" exhibited redshifts, indicating that they were moving away from us at speeds exceeding $300 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} .^{4}$\n\nSeeing these measurements, Lema\u00eetre brilliantly noted a linear relation between distance and redshift, and he rejected the concept of a static universe. ${ }^{5}$ He proceeded to use general relativity to derive a theory of an expanding Universe having constant mass, where recession velocities would be proportional to distance. Recognition for this discovery came 89 years later when the International Astronomical Union renamed the proportional relationship the \"Hubble-Lema\u00eetre Law\". Revisiting and correcting historical narratives provide valuable insights into the development of scientific theories. Similarly, this paper offers a suggestion that diverse observations can be assembled by thoughtful theorists to offer insight about heretofore undetected components of the Universe.\n\nLema\u00eetre strongly advocated for the cosmology community to retain the cosmological constant. ${ }^{6}$ His Ph.D. thesis included a mathematical analysis demonstrating that the most general mathematical formulation of Einstein's field equations required inclusion of a cosmological constant. ${ }^{7}$ He quickly realized that the expansion of the Universe implied a microscopic origin - a \"primeval atom\", later termed the \"big bang.\" ${ }^{8}$\n\nThis insight led him to explore the time-dependent expansion history of the Universe. He noted that a slow expansion followed by acceleration rendered the universe old enough to form stars and galaxies, while satisfying the current expansion rate defined by the Hubble constant. ${ }^{9}$ His quantitative analyses of cosmological evolution, predictions of a cosmic microwave background and galaxy evolution, and the need for temporal self-consistency, including measured ages of meteorites from radioactive Uranium, remain brilliant and relevant. ${ }^{10}$ Lema\u00eetre understood that his computed expansion age of the Universe was too young to provide time to form galaxies, but was ameliorated by invoking a cosmological constant. Lema\u00eetre's issue of temporal self-consistency in the expansion history of the Universe is the conceptual essence of the research reviewed here. Nonetheless, although the possibility of a non-zero cosmological constant was sometimes included in theory, it was not supported by empirical evidence and indeed Einstein himself discounted it as ad hoc.\n\nAbandoning the cosmological constant, most astronomers spent 70 years attentive to two key properties of the Universe, the rate of its expansion, $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$, and the deceleration of that expansion due to the mutual gravitational pull of its galaxies. They also made extensive measurements of the overall\n\nmass density to determine whether the Universe would eventually recollapse due to gravity or continue expanding forever. These measurements led to the discovery of dark matter, which was detectable through various methods, including from rotation curves of galaxies, the velocities of galaxies bound within clusters, gravitational lensing around galaxy clusters, and x-ray emissions from hot gas in clusters. ${ }^{11}$ In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky first proposed the existence of dark matter after observing that the Coma Cluster's galaxies moved too fast for their visible mass to account for the gravitational pull holding them together. Vera Rubin and Kent Ford provided further evidence in the late 1970s by measuring the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, finding that stars at the edges orbited at unexpectedly high speeds, implying the presence of unseen mass.\n\nBy the early 1990's, measurements indicated that the combined density of dark and ordinary matter was only $10 \\%$ to $20 \\%$ of the amount needed to cause the Universe to recollapse, corresponding to a matter density parameter $\\left(\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}\\right)$ of 0.1 to 0.2 . The modern value of $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is now known to be $\\sim 0.3$, but even the earlier value of 0.1 to 0.2 already suggested that our Universe has insufficient mass on its own to make it \"flat\", meaning it lacks enough mass to halt its expansion.\n\nBy 1990, three major conflicts emerged for a Universe composed only of cold dark matter (CDM) and a small amount of ordinary matter. First, the measured ages of the oldest stars, ranging from 13 to 16 billion years, were older than the calculated expansion time since the Big Bang, which was about 10.5 billion years - an impossibility (described below). This age discrepancy was evident by 1993 and worsened by 1995 due to new measurements of stellar ages and a Hubble constant of $\\mathrm{H}_{0} \\approx 77 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ $\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ by 1995. The implied expansion age of the Universe, calculated without a cosmological constant, was 10.8 billion years, making it younger than the oldest stars, clearly an absurd result.\n\nSecond, simulations of galaxy formation and of the large-scale structure of the Universe struggled to reproduce the observed large-scale structure and were often able to achieve a good fit by introducing a cosmological constant, as described below. ${ }^{12}$ One challenge was simulating the gravitational collapse of the primordial mass clumps into the filamentary structure observed within only 10.5 billion years. ${ }^{13}$\n\nThird, a challenge arose in explaining the near uniformity of both the CMB and large-scale structure of the Universe in all directions, known as the \"horizon problem\". Opposite regions of the Universe are not in causal contact, meaning they cannot exchange information or equilibrate, yet they are remarkably similar. A proposed theoretical solution came from Alexei Starobinskii, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Andy Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt, who developed the concept of post-Big Bang \"inflation.\" ${ }^{14}$ This idea suggests that a rapid expansion in the early Universe allowed for prior causal connections within the observable Universe. These models predicted that the Universe should be nearly \"flat\". However, the measured mass density at the time was (and is today) too low to cause a flat geometry by itself.\n\nThese multiple conflicts motivated reconsideration of the cosmological constant. ${ }^{15}$ For example, Turner published that the current measurements, \"...point to a best-fit model with the following parameters: $\\Omega_{\\text {baryon }} \\approx 0.03, \\Omega_{\\text {dark matter }} \\approx 0.17, \\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\approx 0.8$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{0} \\approx 70 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{sec} /$ Megaparsec, which improves significantly the concordance with observations.\" ${ }^{16}$ Krauss and Turner wrote, \"Unless at least two of the fundamental observations described here are incorrect a cosmological constant is\n\nrequired by the data.\" ${ }^{17}$ These papers offered compelling reasons to invoke a cosmological constant in the early 1990's, well before the supernova results.\n\nThe following sections present the evidence in succession. The next section presents a quick summary of the relevant general relativity that governs the expansion rate. The following section presents the newly obtained measurements of the Universe by 1995. The next section reviews the remarkable papers that describe the tension that resulted from the new measurements, motivating inclusion of a cosmological constant. The next sections present the statistical probability, by 1995, that a significant cosmological constant was favored, even when employing modern properties of the Universe.",

The Friedmann Equation and Expansion with Time \n\nTo review, Einstein's field equations combined with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric lead directly to the Friedmann Equation, which was also derived by Lema\u00eetre. ${ }^{18}$ This equation provides an expression for the expansion of the Universe over time ${ }^{19}$ :\n\n$$\nH^{2}=\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{8 \\pi G}{3} \\rho_{M}-k / a^{2}+\\Lambda / 3\n$$\n\nHere $H$ represents the Hubble \"constant\", which is actually a function of time.

The parameter $k$ represents the curvature of space, with $k$ equal to 0 indicating a flat Universe. Finally, $\\Lambda$ is Einstein's cosmological constant, measured in SI units of meters ${ }^{-2}$.\n\nCommonly, one encapsulates the key components of the Universe as,\n\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}+\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=\\Omega_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ represent the fractions of the total mass-energy density of the Universe contributed by mass and \"dark energy\", respectively, normalized to a flat Universe where $\\Omega_{\\text {tot }}=1$. A value of $\\Omega_{\\text {tot }}$ less than 1 indicates an open Universe, while a value greater than 1 indicates a closed geometry. By 1993, observational constraints suggested that $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$ was 0.1 to 0.3 (see the following section), and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ was generally assumed to be zero or ignored, leading to an estimate of $\\Omega_{\\text {tot }} \\approx 0.2$.

Additionally, other observables were measured to test the validity of a matter-only Universe that was decelerating. These observables included $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$, the density of the Universe, the ages of the oldest known stars, the large-scale structure of the Universe, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, as summarized in the section below.",

      "text": "## The Hubble Constant\n\nBy 1992, the Hubble constant was measured independently using various standard candles. The main challenge in each method was accurately calibrating distances using luminous markers located many megaparsecs away. Redshifts were clearly determined through spectroscopic measurements of wavelength shifts of spectral lines. Jacoby et al. employed seven different distance indicators to galaxies, including the \"standard candle\" luminosities of planetary nebulae in galaxies within the Virgo and Coma clusters. ${ }^{23}$ Their findings showed that the seven distance indicators yielded an average Hubble constant of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=80 \\pm 11$ and $73 \\pm 11 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, depending on the weighting scheme.\n\nVan den Bergh offered another comprehensive analysis of the Hubble constant measurements, incorporating corrections for systematic errors in distance measurements to the Virgo and Coma clusters, resulting in $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=76 \\pm 9 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} .{ }^{24}$ Van den Bergh noted the tension, \"The observed value of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ differs at the 3 -sigma level from that predicted by theories of stellar evolution in conjunction with canonical models of the Universe with $\\Omega=1$ and $\\Lambda=0 .{ }^{\\prime 25}$ ( By $\\Omega$ he meant matter only.) This 3-sigma discrepancy between the age of stars and the Universe's expansion age served as an early warning against assuming $\\Lambda=0$. Freedman et al. and Kennicutt et al. made brilliant use of the Hubble Space Telescope within their \"Key Project\" to observe the pulsations of Cepheid variable stars as standard candles in distant galaxies, providing a preliminary value of the Hubble constant, $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=80 \\pm 17 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} .{ }^{26}$\n\nIn summary, by 1995 three comprehensive papers reported four values for $H_{0}$ of 80, 73, 76, and $80 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, resulting in a simple average of $77 \\pm 11 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with a conservative uncertainty derived from all diverse measurements.\n\nThe Friedmann equation for a Universe with $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=77 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}} \\sim 0.2$ (see the next section) but with no cosmological constant yields an expansion age of the Universe of 10.7 Gyr. In contrast, the age of the oldest stars known in 1995 was 12 to 16 Gyr (see the following two sections). The tension was emerging.\n\nFor completeness, Allan Sandage and collaborators wrote a series of more than 15 papers between 1970 and 2006, reporting measurements of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ mostly in the range, 45 to $62 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. However, by the mid-1990's the measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope, referenced above, showed that the new distance calibration was superior.\n\nThe most recent measurements of the Hubble constant are $73.0 \\pm 1.0 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1},{ }^{27} 73.29 \\pm 0.90$ $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{1},{ }^{28} 71.76 \\pm 1.19$ and $73.22 \\pm 1.28,{ }^{29}$ and $69 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}{ }^{30}$ The straight average of these is $72.0 \\pm 2$. This value implies an expansion age of 11.0 Gyr, assuming no cosmological constant. Looking ahead, this expansion age calculated with a modern Hubble constant is less than the smallest likely age of the oldest stars known in 1995, 12 Gyr, indicating an inconsistency.",

Orbital rotation curves (Rubin et al. 1978; Rubin 1983; Rubin 1993) provided accurate mass measurements for the inner $\\sim 15$ kiloparecs of galaxies. ${ }^{31}$\n\nAdditionally, the velocity dispersion of galaxies within clusters and our infall velocity towards the Virgo cluster helped determine the total mass density on spatial scales up to 200 kpc from galaxies, resulting in a value of $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.2$ to $0.3 .{ }^{32}$ This value was in agreement with mass measurements on smaller spatial scales. ${ }^{33}$\n\nAdditional mass measurements on Mpc scales came from the x-rays emitted by the milliondegree gas in rich galaxy clusters.

At the same time, on larger angular scales, the Universe appeared uniform in all directions, also requiring explanation.\n\nIn a remarkable convergence of related data, new observations were made of the isotropy and superimposed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Uson and Wilkinson measured a stringent upper limit on the root-mean-square temperature fluctuations at a small angular scale of 4 arcminutes, finding a fractional fluctuation of less than $2.1 \\times 10^{-5}$ against the 2.7 K background temperature of the CMB. ${ }^{45}$ These CMB measurements placed an upper limit on the magnitude of the initial fluctuations that would later form galaxies and large-scale structures.\n\nIn 1994, the COBE experiment measured large-angular-scale $\\left(10^{\\circ}\\right)$ fluctuations in the CMB, further supporting the presence of $10^{-5}$ fractional temperature fluctuations. ${ }^{46}$ These spatial fluctuations in the CMB constrained the amplitude of the density fluctuations that eventually grew into the large-scale structures observed in the CfA survey, allowing simulations to check the consistency of cosmological models.\n\nThese CMB measurements also confirmed the coherence of the Universe on horizon scales as early as 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The fact that CMB radiation from opposite directions, just now reaching Earth, has the same temperature ( 2.7 K ) suggests there was no opportunity for temperature equilibration, raising two significant challenges for cosmological models: explaining the fluctuation seeds of large-scale structure and addressing the horizon problem, which seems to defy causality. This led to the critical question of whether cold dark matter (along with small amounts of baryonic matter) was sufficient to account for these observations without invoking a cosmological constant. ${ }^{47}$\n\nDavis et al. did not include a cosmological constant at all in simulating large scale structure and associated velocity fields. ${ }^{48}$ Bahcall and Fan considered a cosmological constant in their simulations of large-scale structure, but found no significant difference in the simulated structure between two cases of an open Universe and one flat due to the inclusion of $\\Lambda .{ }^{49}$\n\nThe high spatial-resolution ( 0.5 deg ) COBE results that revealed the amplitude and angular scale of the fluctuations would not be available until after $\\sim 2000$.

The well-known \"horizon problem\" is related to flatness. The Universe appears isotropic on large scales at redshifts greater than 1.0, even though regions in opposite directions are not in causal contact with each other.

(1991) \n\nEfstathiou, Sutherland, and Maddox argued that a cosmological constant was needed to explain the power in large scale structures. ${ }^{62}$ The abstract is worth repeating here, to provide historical accuracy and to set the initial status for the change during the next five years:\n\nWe argue here that the successes of the [Cold Dark Matter (CDM)] theory can be retained and the new observations accommodated in a spatially flat cosmology in which as much as $80 \\%$ of the critical density is provided by a positive cosmological constant, which is dynamically equivalent to endowing the vacuum with a non-zero energy density. In such a universe, expansion was dominated by CDM until a recent epoch, but is now governed by the cosmological constant. As well as explaining large-scale structure, a cosmological constant can account for the lack of fluctuations in the microwave background and the large number of certain kinds of objects found at high redshift. ${ }^{63}$\n\nThis statement from Efstathiou et al. contains insightful reasoning and is extraordinarily prescient about the self-consistency accomplished by invoking a cosmological constant. It is difficult to imagine a more accurate rendering of the modern view.\n\nLahav et al., summarize the reasons a cosmological constant may solve multiple issues of cosmology including the discrepancy between the age of the oldest stars and the Hubble expansion rate, consistency between the measured low mass density and both inflation and flatness, the number counts of galaxies at redshifts $>1$, and difficulties of cold dark matter alone in explaining the large-scale structure observed. ${ }^{64}$ After treating the dynamical growth of structure that fails with a matter-only flat Universe, Lahav, et al., conclude,\n\nAn alternative is to assume that all the matter in the Universe is baryonic, but to add a cosmological constant in order to save inflation (i.e. zero curvature), so $\\ldots \\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}+\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=1 .{ }^{65}$",

Their Section 2 is titled \"Why a Cosmological Constant Seems Inevitable\" in which they summarize,\n\nFor physicists, then, the cosmological constant problem is this: There are independent contributions to the vacuum energy density from the virtual fluctuations of each field, from the potential energy of each field, and possibly from a bare cosmological constant itself. Each of these contributions should be much larger than the observational bound; yet, in the real world they seem to combine to be zero to an uncanny degree of accuracy. Most particle theorists take this situation as an indication that new, unknown physics must play a decisive role. ${ }^{67}$\n\nTheir Section 4.2 centers on the comparison of the ages of the oldest stars in globular clusters and the expansion age of the Universe from the Hubble constant for different cosmological models. They state,\n\nDespite these formidable difficulties, observational and theoretical, the consensus of expert opinion concerning the ages of the oldest globular cluster stars is impressive. All seem to agree that the best-fit ages are 15-18 Gyr or more.\" ${ }^{68}$\n\nWe now know this age is too high by $\\sim 3$ Gyr, and this statement does not contain citations but depends on \"expert opinion\", leaving open the question of which \"experts\" were consulted. Still, it is an accurate report. Realizing the Hubble constant near $80 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ corresponds to a much younger expansion age $\\sim 10.5$ Gyr, they reconsider, stating,\none wishes to know the lower limit on these oldest stellar ages; unfortunately, it is not a matter of formal errors but rather of informed judgments of how far various effects and uncertainties can be pushed. The range of expert opinion clusters around 12-14 Gyr, whether based on consideration of many clusters (Sandage \\& Cacciari 1990, Rood 1990) or the few best studied cases such as 47 Tuc and M92 (VandenBerg et al. 1990, Pagel 1990). ${ }^{69}$\n\nTheir description of uncertainties about systematic errors in the stellar ages, concluding the oldest stars could be as young as 12 Gyr old, still leaves an inconsistency with a simple $\\Lambda=0$ expansion age of $10.5 \\mathrm{Gyr}\\left(\\right.$ for $\\mathrm{H}_{0} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $\\left.\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}} \\approx 0.2\\right){ }^{70}$\n\nThey adopt $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.1$ and $\\Lambda=0$, thereby stating that $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ must be less than $76 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ to be consistent with the age of the oldest stars around 12 Gyr. They declare no major tension in the two age determinations for the case $\\Lambda=0$, stating, \"is there really any problem at the moment?\"71 They quote past low values of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ near $50 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ from Sandage and others, so low that, \"a value of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ small enough to avoid any age concordance problems, even in an $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.1$ and $\\Lambda=0$ model, is not yet excluded\" ${ }^{72}$ Later they state, \"an open model consisting entirely of baryons with $\\Lambda=0$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$ $=0.1$ is by no means strongly excluded.\" ${ }^{73}$ Thus, Carroll et al. remained comfortable with not invoking a cosmological constant.\n\nIn retrospect, by the time Carroll, et al., was formally published in 1992, progress had already occurred in the observations, showing $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$ to be twice as large, $0.2-0.3$, and also showing the Hubble constant to be 68 to $90 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{Mpc}$ as described above. So, the answer to the Carroll et al.'s question in 1992, \"is there really any problem at the moment?\" was \"no, but wait two or three years.\"",

      "text": "## 5. The Probability Prior to 1998 that $\\Lambda=0$\n\nBefore 1998, the prevailing view largely disregarded the cosmological constant. However, the handful of papers reviewed in the previous section insightfully assembled the latest measurements of the Universe, exposing internal inconsistencies with that prevailing view. Those new measurements, along with their associated uncertainties, directly projected to different values of $\\Lambda$, including the probability that $\\Lambda=0$.\n\nThe previous sections of this paper summarize the newly measured ages of the oldest globular clusters by Chaboyer, et al., VandenBerg, Bolte, and Stetson, and by Bolte and Hogan. ${ }^{94}$ These studies accounted for uncertainties in the input stellar physics, such as opacities, nuclear cross sections, and convection. Chaboyer et al.'s Monte Carlo trials indicated a $95 \\%$ probability that the oldest globular clusters were older than 12.1 Gyr. ${ }^{95}$ The other studies agreed, estimating the oldest stars' ages at $15.8 \\pm 2.1 \\mathrm{Gyr}$, with an approximate $2-\\sigma$ lower limit of 11.6 Gyr .\n\nA one-tailed probability estimate is appropriate here, as only the lowest possible age is relevant. Using the lower stellar age estimate of 11.6 Gyr (which leans towards compatibility with $\\Lambda=0$ ), there is about a $2.5 \\%$ probability that the oldest globular clusters are younger than 11.6 Gyr. (Modern measurements place their age at 12.5 Gyr - see next section.) Given that stars require about 0.4 Gyr to form after the Big Bang (from the highest known galaxy redshifts of 14, from the James Web Space Telescope), there was roughly a $2.5 \\%$ chance that the Universe was younger than 12 Gyr. The ages of the oldest white dwarfs (described here previously) were in agreement. Therefore, in 1996, the measured ages of the oldest stars suggested only a $\\sim 2.5 \\%$ probability that the Universe was less than 12 Gyr old.\n\nTo use contemporaneous values for the early 1990s, the most distant galaxies known had a redshift of 4.9. ${ }^{96}$ That implies they formed 1.1 Gyr after the Big Bang. Adding that larger duration, 1.1 Gyr, to the age of the earliest stars implies a $2.5 \\%$ probability that the Universe is less than 12.5 Gyr old, i.e. even older. Indeed, modern estimates of the Universe's age are near 13.8 Gyr (see next section).\n\nImportantly, this requirement from the oldest stars that the Universe must be older than 12 Gyr can be compared to the calculated expansion-age of the Universe assuming $\\Lambda=0$. In 1996, the measured parameters were $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=80 \\pm 11 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.25 \\pm 0.1$ (e.g., Bahcall, Fan, and Cen). ${ }^{97}$ Assuming $\\Lambda=0$, the resulting expansion age of the Universe is 10.1 Gyr , which is obviously inconsistent with the age, 12 Gyr , from the oldest globular clusters. To address this conflict, one could adopt the 1$\\sigma$ lower limit of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=69 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. This gives an expansion age of 11.7 Gyr - still in conflict with the 2- $\\sigma$ lowest possible age of the Universe of 12 Gyr from stars. This indicates a formal $2.5 \\%$ probability that $\\Lambda=0$ was correct, as of the mid-1990s.\n\nThe tension between the highest possible expansion age of 11.7 Gyr (with $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=69, \\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.25$, and $\\Lambda=$ 0 ) and the 2- $\\sigma$ lower-end age of the Universe $\\sim 12 \\mathrm{Gyr}$, based on the oldest stars, indicates a low probability of consistency. Adopting modern values of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=72, \\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.3$, while keeping $\\Lambda=0$, increases the implied expansion age to 11.0 Gyr - still lower than the age of the Universe from globular clusters of $\\sim 12$ Gyr.\n\nThis point deserves emphasis. Using the improved mass density measurements by Bahcall, Fan and Cen of $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.3 \\pm 0.1$, which agrees with the modern value, and using a modern Hubble constant of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=$ $72 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, leads to an expansion age of the Universe of 11.0 Gyr assuming $\\Lambda=0 .{ }^{98}$ This expansion age is inconsistent with the lower bound of 12 Gyr derived from the oldest stars, reinforcing the low probability of about $2.5 \\%$ of $\\Lambda=0$ being correct.\n\nIn summary, considering the uncertainties in the measurements, any proposition that $\\Lambda=0$ carried a probability of less than $2.5 \\%$ in 1996. This low probability holds true whether one adopts the nominal measurements from 1996 for the Hubble constant and mass density or instead adopts adjusted measurements, given their uncertainties, to purposely attempt to accommodate $\\Lambda=0$. The calculated expansion age, the time since the big bang given the observed expansion rate and assuming $\\Lambda=0$, is simply too young to accommodate the older age of the oldest stars. The likelihood of achieving consistency across all measurements with $\\Lambda=0$ was no more than a few percent in 1996.\n\nIt is common to hear astronomers dismiss the ages of the oldest stars, claiming the uncertainties were too large to take seriously. However, this overlooks the fact that globular cluster ages were 2- $\\sigma$ to 3- $\\sigma$ larger (i.e., several billion years older) than the expansion age of $\\sim 10.5$ Gyr if one simply assumed $\\Lambda=0$. The discrepancy was large. Similarly, the missing neutrino problem from the Sun was often dismissed as merely due to poor stellar interior models. However, both issues rely on the same underlying stellar interior physics. ${ }^{99}$ Ignoring the ages of the oldest stars is reminiscent of those who dismissed the Standard Solar Model, which was also vindicated with the discovery of neutrino oscillations.\n\nThe $2.5 \\%$ probability that $\\Lambda=0$ was correct around 1996 should be adjusted downward below $2.5 \\%$, as it doesn't account for other indications that $\\Lambda=0$ was problematic. Theoretical considerations of the horizon problem and early inflation pointed to a flat Universe with $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\sim 0.7$ as described previously here. Also, simulations of the growth of large-scale structure successfully matched observations by employing both $\\Lambda=0$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} \\sim 0.7$, showing equal probability. Only a prior bias would favor any value. Considering these factors, by 1996 the probability of $\\Lambda=0$ was likely less than $2.5 \\%$.\n\nThe pre-1998 specific prediction of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$ by Krauss \\& Turner and by Ostriker \\& Steinhardt cannot be dismissed as a stroke of casino luck. ${ }^{100}$ Imagine them at a roulette table, where the spinning wheel is marked with many possible values of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, with a green \"Zero\" occupying up a big slice of the wheel. They pushed their chips on $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$. When the ball finally settled, not only were they right about $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ being non-zero, but they also predicted its value.\n\nIndependently the low probability for $\\Lambda=0$ was published by others. Bagla, Padmanabhan, and Narlikar in 1996 support this low probability in their conclusions, \"Even allowing for errors on both fronts, the conclusion today is inescapable that the standard big bang models without the cosmological constant are effectively ruled out.\" ${ }^{101}$ Similarly, leaning on the need for inflation, Turner and White write, \"This dilemma can be resolved if a smooth component contributes the remaining energy density ( $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{X}}=1$ $\\left.\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}\\right)$.\"102 Kennicutt, Freedman, and Mould wrote in 1995, \"if the uncertainties attached to these $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ and age values prove to be conservative, then no combination of the parameters is consistent with a $\\Lambda=0$ cosmology.\" ${ }^{103}$ The low probability that $\\Lambda$ was simply zero was appreciated prior to 1996.",

Chaboyer et al. showed that these adjustments significantly reduced the estimated ages of globular clusters. ${ }^{104}$ They noted, \"Hipparcos parallax measurements suggest a large systematic shift of approximately 0.2 mag compared to earlier estimates. This has the effect of reducing the mean age of the oldest globular clusters by almost 3 Gyr. ${ }^{105}$ They further stated, \"Our best estimate for the mean age of the oldest globular clusters is now $11.5 \\pm 1.3$ Gyr.\"106\n\nVandenBerg et al. provided absolute ages and uncertainties for 55 globular clusters (GCs) using Hubble Space Telescope photometry and isochrones to fit the main-sequence turn-off. ${ }^{107}$ They found that the oldest GCs have ages of $13 \\pm 1.5 \\mathrm{Gyr}$ (see their Figure 33).\n\nMore accurate, modern age determinations are based on even more precise GAIA-based parallaxes and improved stellar interior physics. Thompson et al. determined that 47 Tuc has an age of $12.0 \\pm 0.5 \\mathrm{Gyr} .{ }^{108}$ Massari, Koppelman, and Helmi found that the most metal-poor globular clusters have ages of $12.5 \\pm 0.6$ Gyr (see their Figures 1 and 4). ${ }^{109}$\n\nDon VandenBerg used the horizontal branch of clusters, particularly in the rest-frame near IR, finding that using horizontal branch photometry instead of the main-sequence turn-off yields nearly the same ages for the oldest globular clusters, ranging from 11.8 to 12.8 Gyr. Thus, the oldest globular clusters have ages of $\\sim 12.3 \\pm 0.6$ Gyr. The oldest galaxies known now (from the James Web Space Telescope) have a redshift of 14 , implying stars formed 0.3 Gyr after the Big Bang. Adding $\\sim 0.3$ Gyr for the minimum time to form globular clusters after the Big Bang, the revised age of the Universe, based on globular clusters alone, is at least $12.7 \\pm 0.6$ Gyr. In comparison, for $\\Lambda=0$ and modern values of $\\mathrm{H}_{0}=70$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.3$ (which are not significantly different from those in 1996), the calculated expansion age of the Universe is only 11.3 Gyr.\n\nModern ages of globular clusters imply the age of the Universe is at least 12.7 Gyr, which still exceeds the expansion age of 11.3 Gyr if $\\Lambda=0$. This demonstrates that the pre-1998 papers that indicated a nonzero cosmological constant were grounded in both sound logic and adequately accurate measurements, not contradicted by modern measurements. It's remarkable that the (painstakingly obtained) observations available in 1996-before the use of supernovae and $0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{CMB}$ anisotropy measurements-already strongly argued against $\\Lambda=0$, even when compared with today's more precise values.\n\nClearly, a flat Universe composed of mass only was ruled out. Chaboyer et al. state, \"First and foremost, this result suggests that the long-standing conflict between the Hubble and GC age estimates for a flat matter-dominated universe is now resolved for a realistic range of Hubble constants.\"110 Indeed, a flat, matter-dominated Universe was ruled out. But an open, matter-dominated Universe was also unlikely, as the expansion age was too short compared to the globular cluster ages.\n\nTurner and White explicitly noted that models with a cosmological constant were favored, stating, \"Though $\\Lambda$ CDM is the 'best fit' CDM model the theoretical motivation is weak\", referring to the required tiny vacuum energy. ${ }^{111}$ Turner and White also note evidence against $\\Lambda$ CDM from the magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram of Type Ia supernovae, as Perlmutter et al. reported $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.06^{+0.28}{ }_{-0.34}{ }^{112}$",

It was only in 2000, with the measurement of the 0.5 -degree angular scale of the CMB by COBE and other CMB experiments, that the flat Universe was empirically supported.",

      "text": "# 7. CONCLUSIONS \n\nBetween 1990 and 1995, observational evidence for a significant cosmological constant, now known as \"dark energy,\" emerged and strengthened, and it arrived several years before the powerful supernova evidence in 1998. By 1995, new measurements-including the Hubble constant, matter density, ages of the oldest stars, large-scale structure, small CMB fluctuations, and inflationary predictions of a flat Universe-created significant tension for models that simply assumed $\\Lambda=0$.\n\nThis review includes a formal calculation of the probability that the Universe contains no dark energy $(\\Lambda=0)$ based on the measurements available in 1995. The discrepancy between the age of the Universe from globular clusters and the computed expansion history left the probability of $\\Lambda=0$ at less than $2.5 \\%$. Additionally, simulations of large-scale structure and arguments for a flat Universe further reduced this likelihood.\n\nFive papers (and several others cited herein) clearly stated the value of invoking a non-zero cosmological constant:\n\n- Efstathiou et al. and Lahav et al. noted clearly that the age discrepancy and the formation of large-scale structure could be self-consistently explained by invoking a cosmological constant. ${ }^{115}$\n- Krisciunas stated, \"Sensible values of $\\mathrm{T}_{0}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{0}$ point to a positive value for the cosmological constant.\" ${ }^{116}$\n- Krauss and Turner emphasized, \"unless at least two of the fundamental observations described here are incorrect, a cosmological constant is required by the data.\" ${ }^{117}$\n- Ostriker and Steinhardt stated, \"a large cosmological constant appears to be favoured.\"118\n\nSeveral other papers published between 1985 and 1997, notably those by Bahcall et al. and Bagla, Padmanabhan, and Narlikar, describe the growing viability of models with a nonzero cosmological constant. ${ }^{119}$\n\nIt is remarkable that such a profound and mysterious phenomenon as dark energy could be inferred through the meticulous work of hundreds of scientists across various subfields, using\n\ndifferent instruments, and making measurements at the cutting edge of modern technology. Between 1991 and 1995, the combination of this vast array of data-including the assessments of both random and systematic uncertainties-and standard general relativity, applied on scales of billions of light-years, led to a self-consistent model that pointed to the existence of dark energy.\n\nSurprisingly, many of these forward-looking papers from this period are not widely cited, and none are currently mentioned in Wikipedia entries on the cosmological constant. This lack of recognition for the early discovery of dark energy could be due to several factors. The cosmological constant itself had a chequered history, and even today the physics community struggles to explain it through virtual quantum fluctuations. Additionally, the rapidity of the improvement of various measurements in the early 1990s may have contributed to the hesitance in acknowledging these early findings. Intellectual inertia also may have played a role, as the scientific community is often slow to abandon paradigms. ${ }^{120}$\n\nInterestingly, the supernova papers by Perlmutter, Goldhaber, Pennypacker, and Goobar in the 1990s rarely mentioned $\\Lambda$ until May 1995, which was published one month after Krauss and Turner. ${ }^{121}$ This timing raises the question of whether papers (and personal discussions) about the evidence for $\\Lambda$ may have emboldened the two Type Ia supernova groups to reconsider $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe credibility of dark energy gained from Type Ia supernova observations was bolstered by the direct and visually understandable nature of the measurements. ${ }^{122}$ These brilliant observations provided clear evidence of accelerating expansion, with distances at higher redshifts being greater than expected, making the interpretation straightforward. In contrast, the earlier arguments for dark energy before 1998 required a more nuanced understanding of the new data and the magnitude of the errors involved.\n\nThe work of M. Turner, L. Krauss, G. Efstathiou, O. Lahav, L. Kofman, N. Bahcall, B. Roukema, Y.Yoshii, K. Krisciunas, S. Carroll, W. Press, E. Turner, J. Ostriker, P. Steinhardt, J. Bagla, T.Padmanabhan, J.V. Narlikar, and others revealed inconsistencies between the impressive new observations and the standard model of an expanding Universe. Credit must go to the countless observational astronomers who worked tirelessly to accurately measure the Hubble constant, mass density, large-scale structure, stellar ages, and CMB anisotropy.\n\nThis collective effort did more than reveal \"tension\"; in hindsight, it showed that the probability of $\\Lambda=0$ was only a few percent. They achieved a concordance of all observational constraints only by invoking a significant positive value for $\\Lambda$. The theorists and observers identified a \"best-fit model\" with $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.3-0.4$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.6-0.7$-a model that has not only endured but has also been strengthened over time. This community of dedicated scientists demonstrated the extraordinary power of the modern scientific method on a grand scale.",

  "abstract": "This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the\nexistence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery\nmade with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from\nnewly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the\nHubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale\nstructure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These\nmeasurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was\nzero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before\n1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate.\nStatistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological\nconstant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models\nidentified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.",
