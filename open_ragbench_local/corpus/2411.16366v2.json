Understanding and studying this connection has the potential to provide valuable insights on improved algorithms for complex Bayesian inference and sampling tasks arising in a wide range of fields in the data science, engineering and machine learning. Specifically, the key connection to sequential Bayesian estimation is via the so-called replicator-mutator partial differential equations [Kim24; Hof85], describing the time evolution of a large population of individuals with certain traits or attributes due to mutation and reproduction (or selection). Broadly speaking, sequential Bayesian estimation procedures bear striking similarity to the way species respond to evolutionary pressure moderated by a fitness landscape. The correspondence is as follows:\n\n- states or parameters $\\leftrightarrow$ traits\n- prior distribution $\\leftrightarrow$ current population\n- prediction (in the case of filtering or hidden markov models) $\\leftrightarrow$ mutation\n- likelihood function $\\leftrightarrow$ fitness landscape governing selection or birth-death\n\nThis connection has been discussed most notably in [Mor97; Sha09; Har09b; Aky17; Cz\u00e9+22], primarily in the context of discrete time and discrete trait space problems. Some of the earliest connections between discrete time particle based Bayesian updating and genetic mutation-selection models seem to have been in e.g. [Mor97; Mor04; DG05]. [Sha09] raised awareness to the similarity to replicator equations specifically; they show how Bayesian updating corresponds to one step of a discrete-time and continuous-trait replicator equation without mutation. Around the same time, a similar point was made in [Har09b]. This connection to replicator equations with mutation was further extended to the setting of sequential in time inference with hidden Markov models (also known as sequential filtering, discrete time data assimilation)) in [Aky17; Cz\u00e9+22]. They showed that discrete time replicator-mutator dynamics consists of a sequence of (discrete in time) alternating mutation and updating steps, as in sequential filtering. The PhD thesis [Zha17] draws some interesting connections to optimisation and interacting particle approaches to sequential filtering, e.g. the Feedback Particle Filter [Yan+12; Lau+15]. In this manuscript we focus on making this connection precise in the continuous time and continuous trait space case, which to the best of our knowledge appears to be missing in the literature. More recently, there has been interest in incorporating replicator or \"birth-death\" dynamics into sampling algorithms for optimisation and inversion tasks, see e.g. [LLN19; LSW23; Che+24a].", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "### 1.1 Replicator-mutator equations\n\nThe replicator-mutator equation is a broad class of dynamical systems modelling the response of a distribution of traits to evolutionary adaptation to an external fitness landscape. Early influential work in establishing these models can be attributed to [CK70; Aki79; SS83]; this equation is also sometimes referred to as the \"Crow-Kimura\" equation. These models are popular in the mathematical evolution, biology, game theory and ecology literature, primarily in modelling the discrete-time evolution of a distribution of discrete-valued traits such as gene loci [KM14; KNP18; MHK14]. Their continuous time counterparts are typically the focus of analysis where their stability and geometric properties have been established for various fitness functionals, see e.g. [CS09; Cha+20].\n\nOur focus is on the continuous trait space setting which has received comparatively less attention, with the exception of [Kim65; CHR06; Gil+17; Vla20]. The continuous-time continuous-trait replicator-mutator partial differential equation (PDE) is given by\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}(x)=\\underbrace{\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}(x)}_{\\text {mutation }}+\\underbrace{\\rho_{t}(x)}_{\\text {replication }}(\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\rho_{t}}[f_{t}(x, z)]-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}[f_{t}]}_{\\text {replication }})$,\nwhere $\\rho_{t}(x) \\geq 0$ denotes the probability density function describing the distribution of traits $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in the population. The mutation term is typically modelled after a diffusion process, where $\\mathcal{L}^{*}$ is the adjoint generator of a diffusion process, e.g., $\\mathcal{L}^{*}=-\\Delta$ for Brownian dynamics. If $\\mathcal{L}^{*}=0$, i.e., no mutation exists, we call this the (pure) replicator equation. The (potentialy non-local \\& time-dependent) selection or fitness function is denoted by $f_{t}(x, z)$ and the net birth-death rate for a given trait $x$ at time $t$ is given by $\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim \\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}(x, z)\\right]$, where the subscript indicates that the expectation is taken over the $z$ variable only. The expectation here is used to model \"mean-field\" type interactions within the population that affect an individual's fitness. A simplified form of the replicator-mutator often appearing in the literature [TLK96; AC14; AC17] is the local PDE\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}(x)+\\rho_{t}(x)\\left(f_{t}(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the non-local fitness function in (1.1) has been replaced by a fitness function that no longer depends on the current distribution of traits, only on the value of the trait itself. An ubiquitous example that is connected to least squares estimation is the quadratic fitness, $f_{t}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|H x-y_{t}\\right\\| \\frac{2}{5}$. Such a selection function penalises traits $x$ that have a large misfit to the (potentially) time varying data $y_{t}$ via a mapping $H$ and preconditioned with a covariance matrix $\\Xi$. From an evolutionary biology perspective, $y_{t}$ may play the role of an \"optimal feature\" at time $t$ that is best adapted to the current environment and $x_{t}$ the trait that generates this physical feature in an individual.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 1.2 Sequential Bayesian inference or stochastic filtering \n\nSequential Bayesian inference in continuous time (also stochastic filtering or non-linear filtering) is most often formulated in the following form. Consider Euclidean spaces $X=\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $Y=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, covariance matrices $\\Sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}, \\Xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, sufficiently regular mapping $g: X \\rightarrow X$ and $h: X \\rightarrow Y$, and the following signal-observation pair,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd X_{t} & =g\\left(X_{t}\\right) d t+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t} ; \\quad(\\text { signal }) \\\\\nd Z_{t} & =h\\left(X_{t}\\right) d t+\\Xi^{1 / 2} d B_{t} \\quad(\\text { observation })\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe goal of stochastic filtering is to reconstruct the signal $X_{t}$ by means of the noisy observation path $\\left\\{Z_{s}\\right\\}_{s \\leq t}$. Since $X_{t}$ cannot be uniquely identified from this data, the correct object to study is the conditional density of the hidden state $X_{t}$ at time $t$, given the observation filtration $\\mathcal{Z}_{t}:=\\sigma\\left(Z_{s}: s \\leq t\\right)$, which we denote by $p_{t}(x)$. Throughout the article we will assume all distributions have densities with respect to the lebesgue measure. It is known that $p_{t}$ evolves in time according to the Kushner-Stratonovich equation,\n\n$$\nd p_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} p_{t}(x)+p_{t}(x)\\left(h(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[h]\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1}\\left(d Z_{t}(\\omega)-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[h] d t\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is used to denote a fixed realisation and $\\mathcal{L}^{*}$ denotes the adjoint of the infinitesimal generator of (1.3) (i.e. the Kolmogorov forward operator),\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{*} p_{t}(x)=-\\nabla \\cdot\\left(p_{t}(x) g(x)\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\Sigma \\nabla p_{t}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nA direct comparison of terms between (1.5) and (1.2) hints at a possible connection between these two PDEs, although (1.2) is a PDE driven by a finite dimensional \"rough\" path (in that it is not differentiable in time) whereas the fitness function $f_{t}(x)$ in (1.2) does not obviously coincide with such a term. As we will demonstrate in Section 3, one way to establish this connection is to consider a piecewise linear approximation to the observation path, $Z_{t}^{d}$, and the corresponding evolution PDE of the conditional distribution of $X_{t}$ given\n\nthe approximate data path $\\left\\{Z_{s}^{d}\\right\\}_{s \\leq t}$.\nAs solving (1.5) is generally infeasible whenever $m, n$ is large, a popular numerical approach is to construct interacting diffusion processes whose law coincides with the solution of (1.5). A notable example here is the ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter [Eve03; Eve94; BD23],\n\n$$\nd \\bar{X}_{t}=g\\left(X_{t}\\right) d t+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}+\\mathcal{Q}_{t} \\Xi^{-1}\\left(d Z_{t}-h\\left(\\bar{X}_{t}\\right) d t+\\sqrt{2} \\Xi^{1 / 2} d W_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{Q}_{t}$ denotes the cross-covariance between $\\bar{X}_{t}$ and $h\\left(\\bar{X}_{t}\\right)$. This approximate filter is implemented with a set of $N$ diffusion processes with $\\mathcal{Q}_{t}$ replaced by its empirical $N$-particle version, so that the empirical distribution from the $N$ particles approximates $p_{t}$. In practice, it is often necessary to adopt heuristic strategies such as covariance inflation and localisation to account for finite sample size effects and model errors [And07; DSH20; HW05; MH00; BMP18; BD23; Sch+22]. We will demonstrate in Section 4 that the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation (1.1) with a particular fitness function is directly related to covariance inflated ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering. Our main contributions are summarised next.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 1.3 Main contributions \n\nOur first main contribution is in rigorously connecting replicator-mutator equations to stochastic filtering. In doing so, we obtain a connection to continuous time Bayesian inversion with static data as a special case, which we describe in Section 2. We additionally investigate gradient flow aspects of this particular replicator-mutator with a non-local fitness function in Lemma 2.1, where results for related forms have appeared recently [Che+24b; MM24; WN24; LLN19; LSW23; BSM25; ZM24].\n\nMore specifically, consider a particular Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation with non-local fitness function,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}^{d}(x) & =\\underbrace{\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}^{d}}_{\\text {mutation }}+\\underbrace{\\rho_{t}(x)\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim \\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}(x, z)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}\\right]\\right)}_{\\text {replication }} \\\\\nf_{t}(x, z) & :=-\\frac{r}{2}\\left\\|h(x)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}+s\\left\\langle h(x)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}, h(z)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\rangle_{\\Xi}, \\quad r>0, s<r \\\\\n\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}^{d} & :=-\\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\rho_{t}^{d}(x) g(x)\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\Sigma \\nabla \\rho_{t}^{d}(x)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the mutation term corresponds to evolution under the signal process (1.3) and $Z_{t}^{d}$ corresponds to a piecewise smooth approximation of an observation path generated by (1.4) (further details in Section 3). A form of the non-local fitness function $f_{t}(x, z)$ with $H=I, r=1, \\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}=0$ appears in the evolutionary biology literature (see e.g. [CHR06]). In that context, the fitness function takes into account both a given trait's fitness on its own, but also beneficial or adversary effects of the group fitness through the $s\\left\\langle H x-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}, H z-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\rangle_{\\Xi}$ term. More specifically,\n\n- $s=r$ : the fitness function takes the form $f_{t}(x)=\\|H x-H m\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}$ and traits $x$ with the property $H x=H m$ are most fit. Here \"conformity\" or \"collaboration\" (in the sense of being close to the population's feature average) is prioritised entirely over fit to the data term.\n- $s \\in(0, r)$ corresponds to a fitness function with a trade-off between maximising data utility and conformity, respectively.\n- $s<0$ corresponds to a fitness function that benefits from diversity or non-conformity: individual fitness can be improved by moving slightly from the population mean, even at the cost of increasing the misfit term.\n\nAs will be demonstrated in Sections 3 and 4.1, the local fitness function (with $s=0$ ) has an interpretation as a time dependent log-likelihood function. The non-local form $(s \\neq 0)$ can, in the linear-Gaussian setting, be directly related an ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter with both additive (e.g. [HW05]) and multiplicative [BD23] covariance inflation. Our main result is Theorem 3.1, which we restate here informally,\n\nTheorem. (Informal Theorem 3.1:) Limiting process of $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ Consider a time discretisation of the interval $[0, T]$ with step size $\\delta_{d}$ such that $d \\times \\delta_{d}=T$. Denote by $\\left\\{Z_{t}^{d}\\right\\}_{0<t \\leq T}$ a piecewise linear approximation with step size $\\delta_{d}$ of an observation path generated by (1.4). Finally, let $\\mu_{t}^{d} \\propto \\rho_{t}^{d}$ denote the unnormalised form of $\\rho_{t}^{d}$ satisfying $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$. Then under some conditions,\n\n$$\n\\mu_{t}^{d} \\rightarrow q_{t} \\quad \\text { as } \\quad d \\rightarrow \\infty, \\forall t \\in[0, T]\n$$\n\nwhere $q_{t}$ satisfies the modified Zakai equation,\n\n$$\nd q_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} q_{t}(x)-\\frac{s}{2} h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} h(x) q_{t}(x)+(r-s) q_{t}(x) h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nwith $\\mathcal{L}^{*}$ is as defined in $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$.\nThe required conditions and specific mode of convergence are detailed in Section 3. This theorem allows us to bridge between a piecewise smooth replicator-mutator PDE and a \"generalised\" form of the fundamental equation of stochastic filtering which is a (stochastic)-PDE. Additionally, for the special case $r=1, s=0$, $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ then corresponds to a replicator-mutator PDE with local fitness function $f_{t}(x)$,\n\n$$\nf_{t}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\|h(x)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}\n$$\n\nand the corresponding limiting process is given by the classical Zakai equation from non-linear filtering,\n\n$$\nd q_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} q_{t}(x)+q_{t}(x) h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nInterpretations of the limiting process $(\\mathbf{Z K})$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ for $r>0, s \\neq 0$ are investigated further in Section 4 in the context of linear-Gaussian filtering. It is evident that the solution of $(\\mathbf{Z K})$ for $s \\neq 0, r \\neq 1$ no longer coincides with the filtering density. Our final set of contributions (as summarised in the below table) gives an inference-based interpretation of the following non-local replicator-mutator equation,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}^{d}(x) & =\\underbrace{\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}^{d}}_{\\text {mutation }}+\\underbrace{\\rho_{t}(x)\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim \\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}(x, z)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}\\right]\\right)}_{\\text {replication }} \\\\\nf_{t}(x, z) & :=-\\frac{r}{2}\\left\\|H x-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}+s\\left\\langle H x-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}, H z-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\rangle_{\\Xi}, \\quad r>0, s<r \\\\\n\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}^{d} & :=-\\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\rho_{t}^{d}(x) G x+\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\Sigma \\nabla \\rho_{t}^{d}(x)\\right)\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{t}^{d}$ is a piecewise linear approximation as described before, but for an observation path generated by (1.3)-(1.4) with $g(x):=G x, G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ and $h(x):=H x, H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$. In particular, when $s=0$ but $r$ is any arbitrary positive value, $\\left(\\mathbf{L G}-\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ describes the probability density evolution of multiplicative covariance inflated ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering (4.14). The non-local form (i.e. with $s \\neq 0$ ) can be seen as form of inflated ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering involving both additive and multiplicative covariance inflation, as detailed in Section 4.1. The key (and important difference) to standard implementations of inflation is in the specification of the weighting matrix $T$, see discussion below lemma 4.1 in section 4.1.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nFinally, In section 4.2 we further investigate the performance of $\\left(\\mathbf{L G}-\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ with various $r, s$ values for linear-Gaussian filtering in the presence of model misspecification due to an unknown bias term in the signal dynamics. It is demonstrated both analytically (section 4.2.1, Lemma 4.6) and numerically (section 4.2.2) that there are infinitely many $(r, s)$ pairs minimising the time asymptotic mean squared error (MSE). Most importantly, we show in Lemma 4.7 that there is a unique $(r, s)$ pair that simultaneously minimises asymptotic MSE and gives rise to an asymptotic covariance that equals MSE (as is achieved with the Kalman-Bucy filter in the perfect model setting). We give exact expressions for this unique $(r, s)$ pair in the scalar setting in terms of the system parameters, demonstrating that in most cases this corresponds to the non-local form of $\\left(\\mathbf{L G}-\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ with $s \\neq 0$. It remains to be seen if such a non-local fitness function has similar benefits for misspecified filtering in the non-linear case; we leave a detailed analysis of this to future work. We hope that the connections established in this paper spur further exchanges between the field of evolutionary dynamics and sequential learning and inference.", "tables": {"table_0": "| Replicator-Mutator | Filtering | Equivalence result (as <br> $d \\rightarrow \\infty$ ) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $\\left(\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ with $r=1, s=0$ | Zakai equation (1.7) | Theorem 3.1 |\n| $\\left(\\mathbf{L G}-\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ with $r>0, s=0$ | Multiplicative covariance <br> inflated linear-Gaussian EnKBF <br> (4.14) | Lemma 4.1 |\n| $\\left(\\mathbf{L G}-\\mathbf{C K}_{d}\\right)$ with $r>0, s \\neq 0$ | Additive + Multiplicative <br> covariance inflated <br> linear-Gaussian EnKBF | Lemma 4.1 |"}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# 1.4 Notation \n\nWe define some notation that will be used throughout the manuscript.\nSet $X=\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ the trait space, $H: X \\rightarrow Y$ be a mapping, and $Y=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n$m=$ dimension of state/trait space\n$n=$ dimension of observation/fitness space\n$\\|x\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}=x^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} x$\n$\\dot{m}_{t}$ is used to denote $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} m_{t}}{\\mathrm{~d} t}$ for any vector $m_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ depending only on $t$.\n$\\partial_{t} p_{t}(x)$ is used to denote $\\frac{\\partial p_{t}(x)}{\\partial t}$ for $\\rho_{t}(x):[0, \\infty) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n$\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[f]=\\int f(x) \\rho_{t}(x) d x$ and where necessary, we specify the variable in the subscript to indicate the variable to which the integration operation applies, i.e. $\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim \\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}(x, z)\\right]=\\int f_{t}(x, z) \\rho_{t}(z) d z$.\n$f_{t}(x, z): \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the non-local fitness landscape at time $t$ (omission of the $t$ subscript is used to indicate a time-independent fitness landscape).

Inversion [EHN96] refers to the task of inferring an unknown parameter $x \\in X=\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ from a noisy measurement $y \\in Y=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of form\n\n$$\ny=h(x)+\\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $H: X \\rightarrow Y$ is the so-called forward operator and $\\varepsilon$ is measurement noise, commonly assumed to be zero-mean Gaussian, $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Xi)$. The operator $H$ is analogous to the observation operator $h(x)$ in the filtering setting. Unfavorable properties of the operator and the noise makes a naive inversion procedure ill-defined, so additional regularisation of the inversion procedure is necessary. The Bayesian approach to inversion ([Stu10]) requires a prior distribution $q_{0}$ of the unknown parameter $x$ and produces the Bayesian posterior measure $\\nu^{y}$ via\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\nu^{y}}{\\mathrm{~d} \\nu_{0}}(x) \\propto \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\|h(x)-y\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis inversion procedure constitutes a one-step method from the prior $\\nu_{0}$ to the posterior $\\nu^{y}$. In the following, we assume that all measures have a Lebesgue density, which we denote $p_{0}$ and $p^{y}$. A commonly adopted prior $p_{0}$ is the multivariate Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}\\left(m_{0}, C_{0}\\right)$.\n\nWhen $m, n$ are large and the prior and posterior are significantly \"different\" it can be advantageous to gradually transform the prior to the posterior, either over a finite or infinite time horizon. When this is done over a finite time interval, this procedure is known as tempering or annealing in the sequential monte carlo literature [GM98; Nea01; CCK24] and also the homotopy approach to Bayesian inversion (e.g. [Rei11; Bl\u00f6+22; CST20]). More specifically, this approach modifies the single step from prior $\\mu_{0}$ to posterior $\\mu^{y}$ into a smooth transition by introducing a pseudotime $t \\in[0,1]$, and intermediate measures with density $p_{t}$ via\n\n$$\np_{t}(x) \\propto \\exp \\left(-\\frac{t}{2}\\|h(x)-y\\|_{\\mathbb{E}}^{2}\\right) \\cdot p_{0}(x)\n$$\n\nsuch that $p_{1}=p^{y}$. As outlined in e.g. [PR23] it can be seen that a family of probability densities defined via $p_{t}(x) \\propto \\exp (t f(x)) p_{0}(x)$ is the solution of the infinite-dimensional system of ODEs\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} p_{t}(x)}{\\mathrm{d} t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{~d} t}\\left(\\frac{\\exp (t f(x)) p_{0}(x)}{\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[f]}\\right)=\\left(f(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[f]\\right) p_{t}(x)\n$$\n\nThis is identical to the pure replicator equation, i.e., the replicator-mutator equation without any mutation, with the fitness function being the log-likelihood,\n\n$$\nf(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\|h(x)-y\\|_{\\mathbb{E}}^{2}\n$$\n\nIn the simplest setting, $y$ is a time-independent feature, which then means that the fitness function is also static. From a sampling point of view, it is then possible to construct both deterministic and stochastic schemes which have the replicator equation as their density evolution equation. To do so, we switch to the so-called Eulerian perspective on this problem, as presented e.g. in [Rei11]. The goal is to construct a vector field $(t, x) \\mapsto v(t, x)$ such that the family of diffeomorphisms $T_{t}: X \\rightarrow X$ with $T_{t}\\left(x_{0}\\right):=x(t)$ on trait space defined by solutions of the ODE\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t)=v(t, x(t)), x(0)=x_{0}\n$$\n\nsmoothly pushes forward the initial population distribution to the distribution at a later time via\n\n$$\n\\left(T_{t}\\right)_{\\#} p_{0}=p_{t}\n$$\n\nThe advantage of this perspective is that if we were able to find such a vector field $v$, then we can approximate the solution of (2.3) by sampling $J$ particles $\\left\\{x_{0}^{(i)}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{J} \\sim p_{0}$, evolve them according to (2.4), and the resulting ensemble $\\left\\{x^{(i)}(t)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{J}$ then constitutes valid samples from $p_{t}$. [Vil21, Theorem 5.34] states that such a velocity field $v$ satisfies the continuity equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} p_{t}(x)=-\\nabla_{x} \\cdot\\left(v(t, x) p_{t}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, comparing the right hand sides of (2.3) and (2.6) means that the vector field needs to be a solution of the Poisson equation\n\n$$\n-\\nabla_{x} \\cdot\\left(v(t, x) p_{t}(x)\\right)=\\left(f(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[f]\\right) p_{t}(x)\n$$\n\nwhich leads us back to the familiar pure replicator dynamics. It is worthwhile noting that this equation also arises in the construction of interacting particle filtering algorithms, where the fitness function is timedependent due to the time-varying data term [CX10; Lau+15; PRS21]. Finally, it is possible to include a mutation or \"exploration term\" to aid in generating samples when $m$ is large (i.e. the underlying trait space is high dimensional), and is even necessary for particle-based implementations of the above (e.g. [Mor97; DDJ06; MD14; Che+24a; LLN19; LSW23; ZTM19]). In this setting, one arrives at a connection to the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation, albeit with a static (time independent) fitness functional.\n\nIn the remainder of this section we discuss some geometric properties of the replicator equation, showing that the continuous trait-space replicator equation follows a gradient flow of the mean fitness energy functional with respect to the Fisher-Rao metric. This extends the well-known result that the discrete trait space\n\nreplicator equation is a gradient flow with respect to the Shahshahani metric (i.e. the finite dimensional version of the Fisher-Rao metric), see for example Theorem 7.8.3 in [HS98], [FA95] (for the entropy rather than fitness functional), [Har09a], [CS09] and [Cha+21] (in the case of two traits/species) or [Bae21] and [BP16] (including some interesting remarks about speed and acceleration in this metric) and [RK20; RK18] for a control-theoretic perspective. There is comparatively much less work on gradient flow interpretations for continuous trait spaces, which we now focus on.\n\nWe start by reminding ourselves of the basics of information geometry. We define $\\mathcal{P}$ as the manifold of absolutely continuous probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Every $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ will be identified with its (Lebesgue) density $p(x)$. At a $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ such that $p(x)>0$ everywhere, the tangent space of $\\mathcal{P}$ is given by $\\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}=\\{\\sigma \\in$ $\\left.C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right): \\int \\sigma(x) \\mathrm{d} x=0\\right\\}$. If $p$ has support $\\operatorname{supp}(p) \\subsetneq \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then the tangent space is $\\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{\\sigma \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right.$ : $\\left.\\sigma|_{\\operatorname{supp}(p)^{C}}=0, \\int \\sigma(x) \\mathrm{d} x=0\\right\\}$. The associated cotangent space is given by $\\mathcal{T}_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{\\phi \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)\\right\\} / \\sim$, where the equivalence relation $\\sim$ is defined as $\\phi_{1} \\sim \\phi_{2}$ if and only if $\\left.\\left(\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{2}\\right)\\right|_{\\operatorname{supp}(p)} \\equiv$ const. The dual pairing between $\\phi \\in \\mathcal{T}_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P}$ and $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}$ is then canonically defined as $\\langle\\sigma, \\phi\\rangle=\\int \\sigma(x) \\phi(x) \\mathrm{d} x$. The Rao-Fisher metric on the tangent space is given by $g_{p}\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)=\\int \\frac{\\sigma_{1}(x)}{p(x)} \\frac{\\sigma_{2}(x)}{p(x)} \\mathrm{d} p(x)$. This still makes sense on the boundary, i.e. if $p(x)=0$ for some $x$, because then $\\sigma(x)=0$ for $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}$ and we interpret the resulting expression $\\frac{0}{0}=0$. The metric defines an invertible metric tensor $G(p): \\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P}$ via $g_{p}\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)=\\left\\langle\\sigma_{1}, G(p) \\mid \\sigma_{2}\\right\\rangle$ (or equivalently, $\\left.G(p)[\\sigma]=g_{p}(\\cdot, \\sigma)\\right)$, which in this case is given explicitly by\n\n$$\n(G(p)[\\sigma])(x)= \\begin{cases}\\frac{\\sigma(x)}{p(x)} & \\text { if } p(x)>0 \\\\ 0 & \\text { else }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhich is consistent since $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}$ is required to vanish on the set $\\operatorname{supp}(p)^{C}$, anyway. In fact, any map identical to $G(p)$ up to a global constant on $\\operatorname{supp}(p)$, and with arbitrary values on $\\operatorname{supp}(p)^{C}$, would give a valid representative due to the quotient structure on $\\mathcal{T}_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe identity $g_{p}\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{2}\\right)=\\left\\langle\\sigma_{1}, G(p) \\mid \\sigma_{2}\\right\\rangle$ then holds true since\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\sigma_{1}, G(p)\\left[\\sigma_{2}\\right]\\right\\rangle=\\int \\sigma_{1}(x) G(p)\\left[\\sigma_{2}\\right](x) \\mathrm{d} x=\\int \\sigma_{1}(x) \\frac{\\sigma_{2}(x)}{p(x)} \\mathrm{d} x=\\int \\frac{\\sigma_{1}(x)}{p(x)} \\frac{\\sigma_{2}(x)}{p(x)} \\mathrm{d} p(x)\n$$\n\nThe metric tensor associated to the Fisher-Rao metric has inverse $G(p)^{-1}: \\mathcal{T}_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}_{p} \\mathcal{P}$\n\n$$\n\\left(G(p)^{-1}[\\phi]\\right)(x)=\\left(\\phi(x)-\\int \\phi(y) \\mathrm{d} p(y)\\right) p(x)\n$$\n\nwhich is well-defined since $G(p)\\left[G(p)^{-1}[\\phi]\\right]=\\phi-\\int \\phi(y) \\mathrm{d} p(y) \\sim \\phi$. We now recall some facts on gradient flows. Let $\\mathcal{P}$ denote a linear space; then the time evolution of $p_{t} \\in \\mathcal{P}$ is a gradient flow if it can be written as\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} p_{t}=-\\mathcal{K}\\left(p_{t}\\right) \\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}\\left(p_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an energy functional, $\\mathcal{F}^{\\prime}: \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow T_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P}$ is the Frechet derivative and $\\mathcal{K}(p): T_{p}^{*} \\mathcal{P} \\rightarrow T_{p} \\mathcal{P}$ is a linear operator characterising the dissipation mechanism (loosely, giving meaning to how quickly $\\mathcal{F}$ increases/decreases). In this context we are most interested in the case where $\\mathcal{K}$ is related to the metric tensor: The dissipation mechanism $\\mathcal{K}(p)$ is then taken to be $\\mathcal{G}(p)^{-1}$. We are now ready to state our main result of this section, the proof of which can be found in section 5.1.\n\nLemma 2.1. The pure replicator equation (1.1) with $\\mathcal{L}^{\\star}=0$ and with frequency dependent but timeindependent fitness $f_{t}(x, z)=f(x, z)$ performs a gradient flow of the average fitness functional $\\mathcal{F}(p)$ : $\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(p)=-\\frac{1}{2} \\iint f(x, z) p(z) p(x) d z d x\n$$\n\nwith respect to the Fisher-Rao metric.\n\nSimilar results for frequency-dependent fitness functionals that are closely related to but not special cases of (2.8) have recently appeared in the sampling and machine learning literature (e.g. for the Kullback-leilber divergence [Che+24b; MM24; WN24; LLN19; LSW23]). More specifically, LLN19 shows that a dynamical system similar to the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation is a gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric. Around the same time as this work, ZM24 provided an extensive rigorous study of kernelised Fisher-Rao gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and [BSM25] proposed MMD flows in the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry. The corresponding $\\mathrm{MMD}^{2}$ functional evaluated on kernel mean embeddings of the current and target distribution can be seen as a special case of the non-local functional (2.8).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 3 Time varying Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator and Stochastic filtering \n\nRecall the stochastic filtering problem as described in section 1.2 and that the main quantity of interest in filtering is the conditional density $p_{t}(x)$. The unnormalised density $q_{t}$ evolves according to the Zakai equation\n\n$$\nd q_{t}=\\mathcal{L}^{*} q_{t}(x)+q_{t} h(x)^{T} \\Xi^{-1} d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nwhich can be equivalently expressed in Stratonovich form as (see e.g. HKX02, PRS21)\n\n$$\nd q_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} q_{t}(x)-\\frac{1}{2} h(x)^{T} \\Xi^{-1} h(x) q_{t}(x)+q_{t}(x) h(x)^{T} \\Xi^{-1} \\circ d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nIn order to connect to discrete measurement processes more commonly encountered in practice, as well as to the Crow-Kimura equation replicator-mutator equation, consider a piecewise smooth observation process. The piecewise smooth approach to approximating rough signals has a long history in robust filtering Cri+13 and has been well-studied more generally by the so-called Wong-Zakai style theorems and in the context of rough path theory KM16; Pat24. In this section, we will consider a very specific form of piecewise smooth approximation using piecewise linear interpolations of Brownian noise. More precisely, consider a partition of the time interval $[0, T], 0<t_{1}<t_{2} \\cdots<t_{d}=T$ with time-step $t_{i+1}-t_{i}=\\delta_{d}$ for all $i$ and such that $\\delta_{d} \\rightarrow 0$ as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$ (i.e. $\\delta_{d}=\\frac{T}{d}$ ). Define the piecewise linear approximation to a Brownian path as\n\n$$\nB_{i}^{d}=B_{t_{i}}+\\frac{t-t_{i}}{\\delta_{d}}\\left(B_{t_{i+1}}-B_{t_{i}}\\right), \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich is piecewise differentiable with time derivative\n\n$$\n\\frac{d B_{t}^{d}}{d t}=\\frac{1}{\\delta_{d}}\\left(B_{t_{i+1}}-B_{t_{i}}\\right), \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen a piecewise smooth version of (1.4) can be constructed, for all $i=1,2, \\ldots d$ at\n\n$$\n\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}=h\\left(x_{t_{i}}^{*}\\right)+\\Xi^{1 / 2} \\frac{d B_{t}^{d}}{d t}, \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere the notation $x_{t}^{*}$ is used to denote the true hidden state trajectory or reference trajectory that generates the observed measurement. This form allows us to connect more easily to observation models more commonly encountered in practice, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny_{t}(x):=\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}=h\\left(x_{t}\\right)+\\epsilon_{t}, \\quad \\epsilon_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, R)\n$$\n\nand as we will see in the remainder of the section, to also build a bridge between the replicator-mutator equation and the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. It is worth noting that we consider a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation noise term only, rather than a smooth approximation of the entire observation trajectory as is done more traditionally in the stochastic filtering literature HKX02; CX10. Specifically, HKX02 consider the following approximation\n\n$$\nZ_{t}^{\\mathrm{II}}=Z_{t_{i}}=\\frac{Z_{t_{i+1}}-Z_{t_{i}}}{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}\\left(t-t_{i}\\right), \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_{t}$ is a fixed realisation of (1.4) and $Z_{t}^{\\Pi}$ denotes the corresponding piecewise approximation. This then yields (assuming $t_{i+1}-t_{i}=\\delta_{d}$ ),\n\n$$\n\\frac{d Z_{t}^{\\Pi}}{d t}=\\frac{Z_{t_{i+1}}-Z_{t_{i}}}{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}=\\frac{1}{\\delta_{d}} \\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}} d Z_{s}=\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}} h\\left(x_{s}^{*}\\right) d s+\\frac{d B_{t}^{d}}{d t}, \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{i}, t_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nso that the observation involves a time integrated version of the hidden state, $\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}} h\\left(x_{s}^{*}\\right) d s$ rather than $h\\left(x_{t_{i}}^{*}\\right)$ as in (3.3), which may be more practically relevant particularly when the time between observations is large. This distinction is primarily for comparison to measurement models encountered in practice, both approximate forms can be shown to have valid limiting forms.\n\nIn regards to the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation, for the remainder of this section, we focus on the following time-varying quadratic fitness landscape with $s<r, r>0$,\n\n$$\nf_{t}(x, z)=-\\frac{r}{2}\\left\\|h(x)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}+s\\left\\langle h(x)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}, h(z)-\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right\\rangle_{\\Xi}\n$$\n\nand time-varying optimal feature $\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}$ given by (3.3). Notice that with the definition of $\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}$ in (3.3), $f_{t}(x, z)$ is a piecewise constant in time functional in $x$. In the remainder of this section, we will establish equivalence (in a sense to be made precise), between the the C-K replicator-mutator with (3.4) and a modified form of the Zakai equation. For the special case of $r=1, s=0$ in (3.4), we will see that C-K replicator-mutator converges to the standard Zakai equation (3.1) as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$. The following reformulation of the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation with (3.4) will be a useful aid. Its proof can be found in section 5.2.\n\nLemma 3.1. Consider the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}(x)=-\\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\rho_{t}(x) g(x)\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla \\cdot\\left(\\Sigma \\rho_{t}(x)\\right)+\\rho_{t}(x)\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim \\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}(x, z)\\right]-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[f_{t}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nwith fitness landscape given by (3.4). This equation can be expressed in the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\rho_{t}(x)+(r & -s)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} h(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[h^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} h\\right]\\right)+\\left(h(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}[h]\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} \\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right) \\rho_{t}(x) \\\\\n& -\\frac{s}{2}\\left(\\left\\|h(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}[h]\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}\\left[\\left\\|h(x)-\\mathbb{E}_{\\rho_{t}}[h]\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}\\right]\\right) \\rho_{t}(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}^{*}$ denotes the adjoint of the generator of the diffusion process (1.3). Additionally, the unnormalised form is given by\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mu_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} \\mu_{t}(x)+\\left(-\\frac{r}{2} h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} h(x)+(r-s) h(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} \\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right) \\mu_{t}(x)\n$$\n\nBefore presenting the main theorem of this section, consider the following simple motivating example to demonstrate why as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$, the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator with fitness landscape (3.4) converges to a pde driven by Stratonovich rather than Ito noise. It should be noted that although the pde is driven by Stratonovich noise, it can be transformed to an Ito version from which the familiar Kushner-Stratonovich equation can be recovered (for $r=1, s=0$ ).\n\nExample 3.2. Simplified one dimensional replicator-mutator. Consider the 1d linear-Gaussian filtering problem with trivial signal dynamics, i.e. $g(x)=0, \\Sigma=0, h(x)=H x, \\Xi=1$. In this case, the unnormalised Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation (3.7) with $r=1, s=0$ takes the form,\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mu_{t}^{d}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}(H x)^{2} \\mu_{t}^{d}(x)+\\mu_{t}^{d}(x) H x \\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\n$$\n\nThe Zakai equation (unnormalised filtering pde) (3.1) has the following (Stratonovich) representation,\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} q_{t}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}(H x)^{2} q_{t}(x)+q_{t}(x) H x \\circ d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nTo help demonstrate why the limit of the smooth approximated noise in (3.8) must indeed be of Stratonovich type, consider the following pde driven by finite dimensional Ito noise,\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\rho_{t}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}(H x)^{2} \\rho_{t}(x)+\\rho_{t}(x) H x d Z_{t}\n$$\n\nThe following numerical experiment demonstrates empirically the convergence of (3.8) to (3.9) rather than (3.10). A sequence of smooth observations over $[0, T]$ with step size $\\delta_{d}$ is generated as\n\n$$\nB_{t}^{d}=B_{t_{n}}+\\left(\\frac{t-t_{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_{n}}\\right)\\left(B_{t_{n+1}}-B_{t_{n}}\\right), \\quad t \\in\\left[t_{n}, t_{n+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $B_{t}$ corresponds to a Brownian motion so that $\\left(B_{t_{n+1}}-B_{t_{n}}\\right) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\delta_{d}\\right)$. The obs increment $\\frac{d X_{t}^{d}}{d t}$ is then defined as in (3.3). With the approximation (3.11), $\\frac{d X_{t}^{d}}{d t}$ is constant in the time interval $\\left[t_{n}, t_{n+1}\\right)$ for every $n=0,1,2, \\ldots$, and to emphasise the lack of dependence on $t$, we denote it by a random variable $\\xi_{n}$ where\n\n$$\n\\xi_{n} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(H x_{0}^{*}, \\frac{1}{\\delta_{d}}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor some fixed $x_{0}^{*}$ denoting the true hidden state at time 0 . By interpreting (3.8) as a linear pde of the form\n\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\mu_{t}^{d}(x)=A_{t}(x) \\mu_{t}^{d}(x)\n$$\n\nwith piecewise smooth in time coefficient $A_{t}(x):=-\\frac{1}{2}(H x)^{2}+H x \\xi_{n}$ for $t \\in\\left[t_{n}, t_{n+1}\\right)$, it can be discretised via the usual euler scheme over $[0, T]$ with time step $\\Delta$ and $t_{i+1}-t_{i}=\\Delta t<\\delta_{d}$ for all $i=0,1,2 \\ldots$ Let $\\tilde{\\mu}_{i}(x)$ denote the approximation to $\\mu_{t}^{d}(x)$ at $t=t_{i}$,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{i+1}(x)=\\tilde{\\mu}_{i}(x)+\\Delta t A_{i}(x) \\tilde{\\mu}_{i}(x)\n$$\n\nwith $A_{i}(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}(H x)^{2}+H x \\xi_{n_{i}}$ for $n_{i}$ such that $t_{i} \\in\\left[t_{n_{i}}, t_{n_{i}+1}\\right)$. Similarly, (3.9) and (3.10) can be simulated with Euler-Maruyama schemes with the same time step $\\Delta t$. There the observation path is a solution of $d Z_{t}=H x_{0}^{*} d t+d B_{t}$, simulated at a fine time interval. Figure 3.1 shows the results for a single time instant. Importantly, the Crow-Kimura replicator equation (3.6) (cyan line) coincides closely with (3.9) (black line) (up to normalisation), while the Ito version (3.10) (pink line) is significantly different.\n\nThe following theorem establishes the convergence of the replicator-mutator equation (in the form (3.6), as identified in Lemma 3.1) to a \"generalised\" form of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation from non-linear filtering as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$. Convergence is studied via the unnormalised equations as this greatly simplifies the analysis but still yields the overall conclusion relating filtering and replicator-mutator equations due to the one to one correspondence between the unnormalised and normalised equations. Convergence to the standard filtering equations for the specific choice $r=1, s=0$; the benefits of the generalised form (ie. when $s \\neq$ $0, r \\neq 1$ ) will be further explored in the context of misspecified filtering in Section 4. The proof of Theorem 3.1 borrows many elements from the proof of Theorem 3.1 in HKX02] and makes use of the representation formulae developed in Kun82. We extend their work to consider unbounded observation drifts $h$ (where they had assumed uniform boundedness) and to the case of multivariate rather than scalar valued observations $Z_{t}$. Due to the representation formula used here, we do not need to rely on strong convergence of piecewise smooth approximations with unbounded diffusion coefficients as developed in e.g. Pat24 (this aspect is discussed more specifically in the proof below). The price paid is that we focus on pointwise convergence of the density functions, rather than stronger $L^{p}$ convergence, i.e. (i.e. $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\|\\mu_{t}^{d}-q_{t}(x)\\right\\|_{p}^{p}\\right] \\rightarrow 0$ as $d \\rightarrow \\infty$ where $\\|f\\|_{p}^{p}:=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}}|f(x)|^{p} d x$. The weaker mode of convergence is still useful, particularly given that it allows us to relax restrictive assumptions on $h$ which previously did not even cover the linear-Gaussian setting. The proof of the following theorem can be found in section 5.3 .\n\nTheorem 3.1. Assume that $g(x): \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $h(x): \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are $C^{2}$, globally Lipschitz continuous functions satisfying linear growth conditions, i.e. there exists a constant $C>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\|h(x)-h(y)\\|+\\|g(x)-g(y)\\| & \\leq C\\|x-y\\|, \\quad x, y, \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\\\\n\\|h(x)\\|+\\|g(x)\\| & \\leq C(1+\\|x\\|), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3.1: Snapshot in time for the above filtering problem with $H=2, m_{0}=0, P_{0}=0.3, x_{0}^{*}=5, \\Xi=1$ and the smooth observations are constructed with $\\delta_{d}=500 \\Delta t$. Clearly the Ito interpretation (pink line) is not the correct limit for the Crow-Kimura with smooth approximation. The correct Stratonovich interpretation (black line) aligns closely with the Crow-Kimura with smooth obs (cyan line).

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# 4 Replicator-mutator equations \\& filtering with misspecified models: the Linear-Gaussian case \n\nWe now focus on the linear-Gaussian setting to demonstrate both analytically and numerically the benefits of the non-local replicator-mutator model for inference in the presence of model misspecification. Throughout\n\nthis section, we use the terminology local and non-local replicator-mutator equation to refer to (3.6) with $s=0, r>0$ and $s \\neq 0, r>0$, respectively. The terminology is motivated by the fact that the case $s \\neq 0$ introduces a non-local or interaction-type term into the fitness function. Before detailing the main insights, we first present the fundamental equations in the linear-Gaussian setting and establish some useful findings on mean-field interacting particle systems corresponding to (3.6). Firstly, consider the (normalised) linearGaussian Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation in the limit $\\delta_{d} \\rightarrow 0$ as derived in Theorem 3.1 i.e. the normalised form of (3.13) with $h(x)=H x, H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}, g(x)=G x, G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}, p_{0}=\\mathcal{N}\\left(x ; m_{0}, C_{0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd p_{t}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} p_{t}(x) d t- & (r-s) p_{t}(x)\\left(H x-H m_{t}\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} H m_{t} d t+(r-s) p_{t}(x)\\left(H x-H m_{t}\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} d Z_{t} \\\\\n& -\\frac{s}{2} p_{t}(x)\\left(\\left\\|H x-H m_{t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}\\left[\\left\\|H x-H m_{t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}\\right]\\right) d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe form with $\\delta_{d}>0$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd p_{t}^{d}(x)=\\mathcal{L}^{*} p_{t}^{d}(x) d t+(r-s) p_{t}^{d}(x)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x^{\\top} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} H x-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}^{d}}\\left[x^{\\top} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} H x\\right]\\right)+\\left(H x-H m_{t}\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} \\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}\\right) \\\\\n\\left.-\\frac{s}{2} p_{t}^{d}(x)\\left(\\left\\|H x-H m_{t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}^{d}}\\left[\\left\\|H x-H m_{t}\\right\\|_{\\Xi}^{2}\\right]\\right) d t\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $m_{t}:=\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[x]$ and $C_{t}=\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}\\left[x x^{\\top}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}[x] \\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}}\\left[x^{\\top}\\right]$ for the mean and covariance respectively. It can be shown straightforwardly (see e.g. [PW24]) that the evolution of the mean and covariance of the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation (4.1) is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd m_{t} & =G m_{t} d t+(r-s) K_{t}\\left(d Z_{t}-H m_{t} d t\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{d C_{t}}{d t} & =G C_{t}+C_{t} G^{\\top}+\\Sigma-r C_{t} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} H C_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{t}$ denotes the continuous time Kalman gain matrix, given by\n\n$$\nK_{t}:=C_{t} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1}\n$$\n\nand also that the mean equation for the case $\\delta_{d}>0$, i.e. (4.2) is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{d m}{d t}=G m_{t}+(r-s) K_{t}\\left(\\frac{d Z_{t}^{d}}{d t}-H m_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nand the covariance equation coincides with (4.4). Notice that (4.3) \\& (4.4) coincide with the familiar KalmanBucy filter equations for $r=1, s=0$. Also, while both $s$ and $r$ affect the evolution of the mean, only $r$ affects the evolution of the covariance. This aspect will be discussed further in the context of misspecified filtering in section 4.2. We discuss connections between the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equations and covariance inflated ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering in the next section. A nudging type filter similar to (4.3)-(4.4) in the Linear-Gaussian case has appeared at around the same time as this work (see section 3.5 of $[$ Gon +24$])$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# 4.1 Replicator-mutator \\& covariance inflated Kalman-Bucy filtering \n\nThough the replicator-mutator equations describe the macroscopic evolution of traits in a population, it is possible to derive microscopic or interacting particle based systems whose dynamics in the limit of infinite population sizes is described by (4.1) and (4.2). Such mean-field processes arise in interacting particle implementations of Kalman Bucy filtering (the so-called ensemble Kalman-Bucy methods, in both the stochastic form [Lee20; HM97] and deterministic forms [BR12; Tag+17; BD23]), given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& d \\bar{X}_{t}=G \\bar{X}_{t}+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}+K_{t}\\left(d Z_{t}-H \\bar{X}_{t} d t+\\sqrt{2} \\Xi^{1 / 2} d \\bar{B}_{t}\\right) \\quad \\text { (stochastic enKBf) } \\\\\n& d \\bar{X}_{t}=G \\bar{X}_{t} d t+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}+K_{t}\\left(d Z_{t}-H\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}_{t}+m_{t}}{2}\\right) d t\\right) \\quad \\text { (deterministic enKBf) }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{B}$ is a Wiener process independent of $W, B$. The variable $\\bar{X}_{t}$ is a random variable representing the trait at time $t$ of an infinitely large population of individuals. These are interacting processes due to the presence of $C_{t}$ in the driving equations. It is well-known that the conditional probability density of $\\bar{X}_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{Z}_{t}$ (denoting the frequency of traits in the population) for both (4.7) and (4.8) is a solution of (4.1) with $r=1, s=0$. These processes are fundamental in the field of particle based sequential Bayesian inference as they are more computationally efficient to simulate than discretising the corresponding PDEs. The next lemma establishes mean-field processes more generally for (4.1) and (4.2) with $r>0, s<r$. The proof of the lemma can be found in section 5.4 .\n\nLemma 4.1. Consider the multivariate linear-Gaussian setting, $g(x):=G x, h(x):=H x$ and a mean-field SDE of the form\n\n$$\nd \\bar{X}_{t}=\\underbrace{G \\bar{X}_{t}+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}}_{\\text {mutation }}+\\underbrace{d I_{t}}_{\\text {observation update }}\n$$\n\nwith $\\bar{X}_{0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(x ; m_{0}, C_{0}\\right)$ and the stochastic observation update term\n\n$$\nd I_{t}=-\\frac{s}{2} K_{t} H\\left(\\bar{X}_{t}-m_{t}\\right) d t+\\underbrace{(r-s) K_{t}\\left(d Z_{t}-H \\bar{X}_{t} d t+\\left(\\frac{2}{r-s} \\Xi\\right)^{1 / 2} d \\bar{B}_{t}\\right)}_{\\text {Stochastic Kalman Innovation }}\n$$\n\nor the deterministic observation update term\n\n$$\nd I_{t}=\\left(\\frac{r}{2}-s\\right) K_{t} H\\left(\\bar{X}_{t}-m_{t}\\right) d t+\\underbrace{(r-s) K_{t}\\left(d Z_{t}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(H \\bar{X}_{t}+H m_{t}\\right) d t\\right)}_{\\text {Deterministic Kalman Innovation }}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{B}$ is a scalar Wiener process independent of $W, B$. The time evolution of the conditional density of $\\bar{X}_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{Z}_{t}$ for (4.9) with either (4.10) or (4.11) observation update terms is given by the limiting non-local replicator-mutator equation or modified Kushner equation (4.1).

Covariance inflation is an important heuristic tool used to improve numerical stability of the ensemble Kalman filter when the number of particles is low [BMP18; BD19] and also to account for model errors. There are two widely used forms of covariance inflation, the first being multiplicative covariance inflation, see e.g. [BMP18; BD23] which when applied to continuous time stochastic ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering takes the form\n\n$$\nd \\bar{X}_{t}=G \\bar{X}_{t}+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}+\\left(C_{t}+\\epsilon T\\right) H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1}\\left(d Z_{t}-H \\bar{X}_{t} d t+\\Xi^{1 / 2} d \\bar{B}_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon>0$ is a tuning parameter and $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ is a reference matrix guiding the inflation (most commonly, $T=C_{t}$ ). A similar mean field ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter with the second form of inflation, so-called additive inflation in the spirit of [HW05] (see (7) in their paper), takes the form\n\n$$\nd \\bar{X}_{t}=G \\bar{X}_{t}+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}+\\epsilon T\\left(\\bar{X}_{t}-m_{t}\\right) d t+C_{t} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1}\\left(d Z_{t}-H \\bar{X}_{t} d t+\\Xi^{1 / 2} d \\bar{B}_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon, T$ are as previously defined although most commonly $T=I$ is adopted in this form. Such inflation terms can similarly be applied to the deterministic ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (4.8). It follows directly from Lemma 4.1 that choosing $r=1+\\epsilon, s=0$ in (4.1) yields the multiplicative covariance inflated stochastic enKBf (4.14) with $T=C_{t}$. Likewise, choosing $s=-2 \\epsilon, r=1-2 \\epsilon$ yields the additive covariance inflation stochastic enKBf (4.15) with $T=K_{t} H$. Connections similarly hold for the deterministic versions and also with piecewise smooth observations. This implies that for an arbitrary choice of $r>0, s<r$, the Crow-Kimura replicator-mutator equation (and its limiting form) with non-local fitness function involves a combination of additive and multiplicative inflation. We explore this observation in more detail in the next section.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 11, "text": "# 4.2 Case study: non-local replicator-mutator vs inflation for misspecified model filtering \n\nIt is known empirically in the data assimilation literature that a combined used of additive and multiplicative inflation improves filtering estimates in the presence of model and finite-sample effects errors than using either additive or multiplicative inflation alone [Sch+22]. This section focuses on proving this empirical observation for the case of linear-Gaussian filtering in the presence of a constant bias term.\n\nIt is well known that the Kalman-Bucy filter is the minimum variance unbiased estimator of $X_{t}, t>0$. This property also extends to the non-local replicator mutator equation when the system is perfectly known (see Lemma A.5). However, from inspection of (4.4) and also from Lemma 4.1, it is clear that the minimum variance property is destroyed unless $r=1$.\n\nWe now turn out attention to analysing the performance of the replicator-mutator equation for a filtering problem with misspecified signal dynamics. This section focuses on the $\\delta_{d} \\rightarrow 0$ form of the replicator-mutator, (4.1), although the conclusions of this section are expected to similarly hold for $\\delta_{d}>0$. The misspecified model filtering problem is as follows. Consider the following linear-gaussian problem where the hidden state $X_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ evolves according to\n\n$$\nd X_{t}=G X_{t} d t+b d t+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}\n$$\n\nwith $X_{0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(m_{0}, P_{0}\\right)$ and $b$ a constant vector. The hidden dynamics is known imperfectly and that the assumed model for the trait is instead\n\n$$\nd X_{t}=G X_{t} d t+\\Sigma^{1 / 2} d W_{t}\n$$\n\n(i.e. (4.16) with $b=0$ ), and the observation process is as in (1.4). The replicator-mutator equation (4.2) is no longer expected to produce unbiased estimates due to the presence of the $b$ term. The tracking error at time $t$ is denoted by $\\varepsilon_{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{t}:=m_{t}-x_{t}^{*}\n$$\n\nwhere $m_{t}:=\\int x p_{t}(x) d x$ and $p_{t}(x)$ is the solution of (4.1) and $x_{t}^{*}$ the solution of (4.16) that generated the observation path, also known as the reference trajectory or true hidden state. Denote also by $P_{t}$ the error covariance matrix,\n\n$$\nP_{t}:=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\varepsilon_{t}-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\right]\\right)\\left(\\varepsilon_{t}-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\right]\\right)^{T}\\right]\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\tilde{P}_{t}:=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t} \\varepsilon_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote well that $P_{t}$ is now distinct from $C_{t}$, the posterior/filtering covariance or covariance of the replicatormutator equations. Recall that in the perfect knowledge Kalman Bucy filtering setting (i.e. $b=0$ ), since $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\right]=0$, we have that $C_{t}=\\tilde{P}_{t}=P_{t}$. When $b \\neq 0$, even a standard Kalman-Bucy filter no longer produces an unbiased estimates of the hidden state, so that $\\tilde{P}_{t} \\neq P_{t}$ and also, $C_{t} \\neq P_{t}$.

Note that in the case of Kalman filtering, assumption 4.2 is also sufficient to ensure $\\alpha\\left(A_{\\infty}\\right)<0$ when $s=0$ (see e.g. [BD23]). When $s \\neq 0$, the presence of the $(r-s)$ term in (4.21) no longer guarantees this, therefore we rely on the following additional assumption.\n\nAssumption 4.3. For $A_{t}$ as defined in (4.21), the parameters $r, s$ are chosen such that $\\alpha\\left(A_{\\infty}\\right)<0$ where $\\alpha(A)$ is the spectral abscissa of an $\\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ matrix $A$, i.e. $\\max _{i}\\left\\{\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right)\\right\\}$ where $\\lambda_{i}$ is the $i$ th eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nAdditionally, they are specified such that $\\alpha\\left(A_{\\infty}(r, s)+A_{\\infty}(r, s)^{\\top}\\right)<0$, i.e. the largest eigenvalue of $A_{\\infty}+A_{\\infty}^{\\top}$ is strictly negative.\n\nThe following lemma characterises the time evolution of bias, variance and mean squared error. As expected, the error variance $P_{t}$ evolves independently of the unknown term $b$. The proof of the lemma can be found in section 5.5\nLemma 4.4. Assume the system properties described by (4.16) for the true hidden state, (4.17) for the assumed hidden state and (1.4) for the observation model. Given $r, s$ such that $r<s, r>0$, we have the following evolution equations for the error covariance $P_{t}$ and expected squared error $\\bar{P}_{t}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d P_{t}}{d t}=\\left(G-(r-s) K_{t} H\\right) P_{t}+P_{t}\\left(G-(r-s) K_{t} H\\right)^{\\top}+\\Sigma+(r-s)^{2} K_{t} \\Xi K_{t}^{\\top} \\\\\n& \\frac{d \\bar{P}_{t}}{d t}=\\left(G-(r-s) K_{t} H\\right) \\bar{P}_{t}+\\bar{P}_{t}\\left(G-(r-s) K_{t} H\\right)^{\\top}+\\Sigma+(r-s)^{2} K_{t} \\Xi K_{t}^{\\top}-\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\right] b^{\\top}-b \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}^{\\top}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{t}$ is the continuous time Kalman gain matrix as defined in (4.5). For the special case $s=0, r=1$, it holds that $P_{t}=C_{t}, \\forall t>0$ if $P_{0}=C_{0}$ where $C_{t}$ is the solution of the covariance equation of the replicatormutator.\n\nFurthermore, for any p.d. $C_{0}$, the evolution of the mean squared error $E_{t}$ satisfies the following inequality\n\n$$\n\\frac{d E_{t}}{d t} \\leq \\alpha\\left(A_{t}(r, s)+A_{t}(r, s)^{\\top}\\right) E_{t}-2 \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varepsilon_{t}\\right] b^{\\top}\\right]+\\operatorname{Tr}[\\Sigma]+(r-s)^{2} \\alpha\\left(H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} H\\right)\\left\\|C_{t}\\right\\|_{F}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{t}$ is defined in (4.21) and $\\alpha(A)$ denotes the largest eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nTo obtain further insights on optimal choices of $r, s$, we consider a simplified setting where $C_{0}=C_{\\infty}$ (i.e. where the covariance is initialised at the steady state covariance matrix in (4.4)). This setting is still rich enough to provide insights on the role of $r, s$ in the non-local replicator-mutator, particularly as we are primarily interested in the time asymptotic behaviour of mean squared error. The following lemma gives explicit representations of the time asymptotic squared bias $\\nu_{\\infty}$ and mean squared error $E_{\\infty}$ in terms of the system parameters.

We expect many of the qualitative insights from the remaining lemmas to hold in the multivariate setting. The next lemma gives explicit expressions for the optimal $r, s$ minimising time asymptotic MSE entirely in terms of the system parameters; firstly an expression for $s$ for any given $r$ (4.33) and then for $r$ for given $s$ (see (4.36) - (4.37)). The proof of this lemma can be found in section 5.7.\n\nLemma 4.6. Optimal $r, s$ minimising MSE. Adopt the same conditions as in Lemma 4.5 and assume further that $m=n=1$ (scalar setting). Given a fixed $r>0$, the optimal value of $s$ minimising $E_{\\infty}$ is given by\n\n$$\ns^{o p t}=\\frac{r\\left(A_{\\infty}^{*}+\\sqrt{G^{2}+r H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\\right)}{G+\\sqrt{G^{2}+r H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{\\infty}^{*}$ denotes the optimal value of $A_{\\infty}$ as defined in (4.21), which has an explicit representation in terms of the system parameters,\n\n$$\nA_{\\infty}^{*}:= \\begin{cases}\\left(-\\frac{q}{2}+\\sqrt{\\tau}\\right)^{1 / 3}+\\left(-\\frac{q}{2}-\\sqrt{\\tau}\\right)^{1 / 3}, & \\tau>0 \\\\ 2 \\sqrt{-\\frac{p}{3}} \\cos \\left[\\frac{1}{3} \\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3 q}{2 p} \\sqrt{\\frac{-3}{p}}\\right)-\\frac{4 \\pi}{3}\\right], & \\tau<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nand $\\tau:=\\frac{q^{2}}{4}+\\frac{p^{2}}{27}$ with $p:=-\\left(H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma+G^{2}\\right)$ and $q:=4 b^{2} H^{2} \\Xi^{-1}$. Furthermore, the admissible values of $s$ guaranteeing $A_{\\infty}<0$ satisfy\n\n$$\ns<\\min \\left(r, \\frac{\\sqrt{G^{2}+r H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}}{G+\\sqrt{G^{2}+r H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}} r\\right)\n$$\n\nConversely, given a fixed $s$, there may be either one or two corresponding optimal $r$ values minimising $E_{\\infty}$. Specifically, given a fixed $s \\geq s^{u}$ where $s^{u}:=\\frac{\\left(|G|-G)\\left(A_{\\infty}^{*}+G\\right)}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}$, there is a unique optimal $r$ value given by\n\n$$\nr^{o p t}=\\frac{1}{4 H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}+\\sqrt{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}+4\\left(G A_{\\infty}^{*}+s H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma\\right)}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{G^{2}}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, if $G-2|G| \\geq A_{\\infty}^{*}$ then given an $s$ such that $s^{l}<s<s^{u}$ where $s^{l}:=-\\frac{\\left(G+A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}}{4 H^{2} \\Xi \\Sigma}$, there are two optimal $r$ values given by\n\n$$\nr^{o p t}=\\frac{1}{4 H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}+4\\left(G A_{\\infty}^{*}+s H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma\\right)}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{G^{2}}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\n$$\n\nImportantly, the above lemma shows that there are infinitely many $(r, s)$ pairs satisfying some minimal conditions that minimise MSE $E_{\\infty}$, although the covariance $C_{\\infty}$ will differ due to its explicit dependence on $r$ (see (5.22)). Notably, these estimates hold true regardless of the stability characteristics of the hidden state and observation dynamics. Additionally, it holds that for $s \\in\\left(s^{l}, s^{u}\\right)$ where $s^{l}, s^{u}$ are as defined in the above lemma, there exists two possible $r$ values for a given $s$ that will yield the minimal asymptotic mean square error (4.37). This is particularly beneficial in terms of allowing for a realistic $C_{\\infty}$, as will be explored further in the following lemma. Before stating the lemma, we note that larger values of $r$ give rise to smaller $C_{\\infty}$. From an inference perspective, smaller $C_{\\infty}$ indicates greater confidence in the estimator, which can be problematic especially when $C_{\\infty}$ is smaller than the minimum covariance achievable in the perfect model setting. To analyse this phenomenon further, define\n\n$$\n\\hat{C}_{\\infty}:=\\frac{G+\\sqrt{G^{2}+H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is the steady state covariance coinciding with the Kalman-Bucy filter (the optimal filter) in the case of perfect knowledge, (i.e. $r=1, s=0, b=0$ ). Any choice of $r$ for which $C_{\\infty}<\\hat{C}_{\\infty}$ should be avoided when there is model misspecification, as we cannot expect to be more confident than when we have no misspecification. Recall that in the perfect knowledge setting, we have that $\\hat{P}_{\\infty}=\\hat{C}_{\\infty}$, in other words, the asymptotic covariance from the Kalman-Bucy filter coincides with the mean squared error. The following lemma establishes a relationship between $r, s$ that ensures the specific pair satisfies $C_{\\infty}=\\hat{P}_{\\infty}$ in the misspecified model setting where $b \\neq 0$. Its proof can be found in section 5.8 .\nLemma 4.7. Adopt the same conditions as in Lemma 4.6. Then the following results hold:\n\n1.

In particular, (4.41) demonstrates that when $G>0$ (unstable dynamics) the optimal $r$ minimising MSE for the multiplicative covariance inflated ensemble Kalman method typically yields a covariance $C_{\\infty}<\\hat{C}_{\\infty}$, i.e. it is over-confident. Adopting $s \\neq 0$ is thus crucial to obtain more representative $C_{\\infty}$. Equivalently, combining additive and multiplicative covariance inflation along with a judicious choice of tuning parameters is necessary to minimise MSE while maintaining realistic uncertainty quantification.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 13, "text": "# 4.2.2 Numerical experiments \n\nThe following experiment aims to provide further insights on the role of $s, r$ in (3.5) with fitness landscape $f_{t}(x, z)$ given by (3.4) for the misspecified model setting from the previous section (which we repeat here for convenience).

Notice that in both systems, the hidden state evolves according to unstable dynamics and the Crow-Kimura replicator mutator is capable of tracking an unstable signal as $A_{t}<0$. We restrict the time domain to one where machine precision doesn't become an issue. We adopt $\\delta_{d}=10^{-3}$ and use a simulation time step of $10^{-4}$ to construct the true hidden state as well as to discretise the mean and covariance equation (4.3) and (4.4) using forward euler.

They show that in both systems, the analytic expressions in (4.33) and for the smallest optimal $s$ value, $s^{l}$ match quite closely. The existence of two optimal $r$ values for every given $s^{l}<s<s^{u}$ is also confirmed numerically (this is more visible for system 1 than in system 2 where $s^{l}=-0.047$ and in both cases, $s^{u} \\approx 0$ ).

This allows us to construct a filter/replicator-mutator dynamic for which the covariance of the estimate coincides with the actual mean squared error, as one obtains from the regular Kalman-Bucy filter in the perfect model setting. Figure 4.3 shows the variation in asymptotic covariance $C_{\\infty}$ for different $r$ values, obtained from (5.22). Notice here that in the multiplicative covariance inflation case $s=0$, the asymptotic covariance for the corresponding optimal $r_{0}^{\\text {opt }}$ is $\\left(\\hat{C}_{\\infty}=0.05\\right)$, which is considerably smaller than the covariance in the perfect model setting $\\left(\\hat{C}_{\\infty}=0.31\\right)$, indicating overconfidence in the estimation (as also obtained in Lemma 4.7). The non-local replicator-mutator on the other hand allows to obtain estimates that simultaneously minimise MSE and provide a realistic representation of uncertainty. More specifically, the choice $r=0.13$ (which coincides with $s^{\\text {opt }}=-1.18$ ) yields a $C_{\\infty}$ which coincides with $E_{\\infty}$, so that the covariance produced by the estimation algorithm provides us with useful uncertainty quantification. In particular, it represents an increase in uncertainty over the perfect knowledge case (pink line), which should be reflected given the unknown bias in the system.\n\nFinally, Figure 4.4 examines the optimal $r, s$ values minimising $E_{\\infty}$ (4.33) (blue line) and ensuring $C_{\\infty}=E_{\\infty}$, (4.39) in Lemma 4.7 ( cyan line). The intersection of these two lines indicates the single optimal $r, s$ pair that simultaneously achieves both. Somewhat counter-intuitively, this pair does not always correspond to the smaller of the two possible $r$ values for the given $s$ value (see Figure 4.4 where in system 1 the smaller $r$ yields $C_{\\infty}=E_{\\infty}$ whereas the opposite is true for system 2 ). In fact, for system 2 , the optimal $s^{\\text {opt }}$ has two corresponding optimal $r$ values that minimise $E_{\\infty}$ only, $r^{\\text {opt }}=27.9$ or 0.13 . The former $r$ value corresponds closely to the optimal $r$ for $s=0$ (pure multiplicative inflation) for which one obtains over-confident $C_{\\infty}$. However, the opposite is true for system 2 , where the optimal $r, s$ where $C_{\\infty}=E_{\\infty}$ is relatively close to that of the pure multiplicative covariance inflation case. We leave a study of specific system characteristics that would benefit most from the non-local replicator-mutator approach to future work.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4.3: Demonstration of more realistic/representative covariances that can be obtained with the nonlocal replicator mutator, i.e. with $s \\neq 0$. Left plot indicates system 1, right plot indicates system 2. The red solid line indicates $C_{\\infty}$ vs $r$ using (5.22). The blue horizontal dashed line indicates the analytic $E_{\\infty}^{\\text {opt }}$, i.e. the minimum asymptotic MSE obtained by using $r^{\\text {opt }}, s^{\\text {opt }}$ in (4.30), the pink horizontal dashed line indicates $C_{\\infty}$ for $r=1$ (i.e. $\\hat{C}_{\\infty}$ as defined in (4.38), the covariance in the perfect model case). Finally, the black dashed line indicates $C_{\\infty}$ for $\\left(s=0, r_{0}^{\\text {opt }}\\right)$, i.e. the optimal $r$ for multiplicative covariance inflation.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4.4: Plot of optimal $(r, s)$ values for system 1 (left plot) and system 2 (right plot). The blue line indicates the $(r, s)$ pairs minimising mse only, obtained from (4.33) and the cyan line indicates the $(r, s)$ pairs such that $C_{\\infty}=E_{\\infty}$, obtained from (4.39). The point of intersection of the two lines indicates the $(r, s)$ pair that achieves both. The red square indicates the optimal $r$ value corresponding to the multiplicative covariance inflation case $(s=0)$. The blue squares indicate the possible $r$ values corresponding to the optimal $s$ in terms of $E_{\\infty}$. In system 1, multiplicative covariance inflation leads to overconfident estimates ( $C_{\\infty}$ too small), whereas in system 2, it is not so far off from the optimal choice of $s=-0.0135, r=0.99$.", "tables": {"table_1": "| Parameter | System 1 $(\\tau>0)$ | System 2 $(\\tau<0)$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $G$ | 0.5 | 2.5 |\n| $H$ | 8.5 | 2.9 |\n| $\\Sigma$ | 0.8 | 18 |\n| $\\Xi$ |

The proof below is inspired by the proof of Theorem 3.1 in HKX02 except for the following important extensions: 1) we no longer assume $h$ is uniformly bounded; 2) $h$ is no longer a scalar valued function but may be vector valued; 3) we make use of the forward stochastic FeynmanKac style representation formula in Kun82 rather than the backward formula. Existence and uniqueness of density valued solutions to the zakai equation in $L^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\right)$ with $g, h$ unbounded has been studied by a number\n\nof authors [BBH83; BKK95], building on extensive works in the unbounded case (see e.g. the excellent summary in [BC09]).\n\nStep 1. Use (stochastic) Feynman-Kac type formulae to obtain a probabilistic representation of solutions to the Zakai equation and replicator-mutator equation, as given in Theorem A.1. Specifically, we make use of the formulae developed in [Kun82; Kun81] as was done in [HKX02] although we rely on the forward rather than backward representation formulae.

Generally, it is not possible to bound exponential moments in terms of polynomial moments, as the exponential term grows faster. The crucial point of this lemma is in a careful specification of the factor in the exponential (c.f. $L$ in Lemma A.4) which acts to \"dampen\" the growth relative to the growth of the raw moments. We have using the shorthand notation $\\tilde{L}:=\\frac{r_{1} r_{2} p_{r}}{2}$,\n\n$$\nI_{10}(x) \\leq \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\exp \\left(\\tilde{L} \\int_{0}^{t} \\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} \\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right) d u\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{h}_{u}(y):=h(y)+h\\left(x_{u}^{*}\\right)$. Furthermore,\n\n$$\n\\tilde{h}_{u}(x)^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1} \\tilde{h}_{u}(x)=\\left|\\Xi^{-1 / 2} \\tilde{h}_{u}(x)\\right|^{2} \\leq \\lambda_{\\Xi}^{2}\\left|\\tilde{h}_{u}(x)\\right|^{2}, \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\Xi}$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $\\Xi^{1 / 2}$. Combining, we have letting $L=\\tilde{L} \\lambda_{\\Xi}^{2}$,\n\n$$\nI_{10}(x) \\leq \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\exp \\left(L \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|\\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right)\\right|^{2} d u\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nLet $Y_{t}(x):=\\int_{0}^{t}\\left|\\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right)\\right|^{2} d u$. Clearly this is a non-decreasing (and adapted) process, so that we may apply lemma A.4. In particular,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[Y_{t}(x)-Y_{\\tau}(x)\\right]=\\int_{\\tau}^{t} \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left|\\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] d u \\leq t C\\left(1+\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[|x|^{2}\\right]\\right)=: K(t), \\quad \\forall \\tau \\in[0, t)\n$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant depending on the growth properties of $h$ and for the last inequality, we have used that since $g, h$ satisfy lipschitz and linear growth assumptions,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left|\\tilde{h}_{u}\\left(\\xi_{u}(x)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] \\leq C\\left(1+\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left|\\xi_{u}(x)\\right|^{2}\\right]\\right) \\leq C\\left(1+\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[|x|^{2}\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nTherefore by Lemma A.4, whenever\n\n$$\n\\frac{r_{1} r_{2}(r-s) p \\lambda_{S}^{2}}{2}<\\frac{1}{K(t)}\n$$\n\nwhere $K(t)$ is a constant depending on time, the second moment of the initial density $f(x)$ and the linear growth constant of $h$, we have\n\n$$\nI_{10}(x) \\leq \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\exp \\left(L \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|\\tilde{h}_{s}\\left(\\xi_{s}(x)\\right)\\right|^{2} d s\\right)\\right]<\\frac{1}{1-L K(t)}\n$$\n\nNotice that condition (5.9) can be satisfied whenver $r, s$ are chosen such that $(r-s)$ is small enough. As will be seen in Section 4.2, this is at least possible in the linear-Gaussian setting whilst maintaining optimality (in the mean squared error sense) even in the case of a misspecified model. Finally, we have\n\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[I_{8}(x)^{r_{1}}\\right]\\right)^{1 / r_{2}} \\leq(1-L K(t))^{-\\frac{1}{r_{2}}}\n$$\n\nThe term involving $I_{9}(x)$ can be analysed in much the same way as for $I_{8}(x)$, with the only difference being that the stochastic integral.

The nature of the roots can be characterised in the usual way via the discriminant $\\tau$, i.e. when $\\tau>0$, (5.24) has one real root and two complex roots, whilst when $\\tau<0$, it has three real roots. We deal with these two cases below separately.\n\nCase 1: $\\tau>0$. First we show that the real root here is strictly negative. From inspection, we have that $g(0)>0$. Also, (5.24) always has two real extremal (turning) points, one of which is strictly negative and the other is strictly positive, since $g^{\\prime}\\left(A_{\\infty}\\right)=3 A_{\\infty}^{2}+p=0$ implies the extremal points occur at $A_{\\infty}= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-p}{3}}$. Furthermore, $g^{\\prime}(0)=p<0$. Combining these properties implies that (5.24) has one negative real root when $\\tau>0$. When $\\tau>0$, we can use Cardano's formula to obtain an expression for the real root,\n\n$$\nA_{\\infty}^{*}=\\left(-\\frac{q}{2}+\\sqrt{\\tau}\\right)^{1 / 3}+\\left(-\\frac{q}{2}-\\sqrt{\\tau}\\right)^{1 / 3}\n$$\n\nfrom which we then obtain (4.34), and substituting the expression for $A_{\\infty}^{*}$ into (4.31) and re-arranging yields (4.33). It can be verified straightforwardly that this this is indeed a minimum since $\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\tilde{P}_{\\infty}}{\\partial A_{\\infty}^{*}}\\left(A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)>0$.\n\nCase 2: $\\tau<0$. In this case, (5.24) has three real roots due to the usual condition on the discriminant. First we characterise the signs of the roots. We have directly from (5.24) that $g(0)>0$. Also, (5.24) always has two real extremal (turning) points, one of which is strictly negative and the other is strictly positive, since $g^{\\prime}\\left(A_{\\infty}\\right)=3 A_{\\infty}^{2}+p=0$ implies the extremal points occur at $A_{\\infty}= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-p}{3}}$. Furthermore, $g^{\\prime}(0)=p<0$. Combining these properties implies that (5.24) has two positive real roots and one negative real root when $\\tau<0$.\n\nWhen $\\tau<0$, the following trigonometric formula holds for the characterisation of the three real roots, $A_{\\infty}^{k}, k=0,1,2$\n\n$$\nA_{\\infty}^{k}=2 \\sqrt{-\\frac{p}{3}} \\cos \\left[\\frac{1}{3} \\cos ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3 q}{2 p} \\sqrt{\\frac{-3}{p}}\\right)-\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3}\\right] \\quad \\text { for } k=0,1,2\n$$\n\nTo determine the negative root, first notice that $-\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3}<\\frac{1}{3} \\cos ^{-1}(y)-\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3}<-\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3}+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ for all $-1<y<1$. Furthermore, $\\cos (\\theta)<0$ for all $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{2}<\\theta<-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and it holds that for $\\theta:=\\frac{1}{3} \\cos ^{-1}(y)-\\frac{2 \\pi k}{3}$ and $k=2$, $-\\frac{4}{3} \\pi<\\theta<-\\pi$, so that $\\cos (\\theta)<0$ for $k=2$. This yields the remaining case in (4.34).\n\nFor the remaining claims, we work with the following change of variable\n\n$$\ny:=\\sqrt{G^{2}+r H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}\n$$\n\nwhich when substituted into (4.33) with $r=\\frac{y^{2}-G^{2}}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}$ yields\n\n$$\ns^{\\mathrm{opt}}(y)=\\frac{1}{H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma}(y-G)\\left(A_{\\infty}^{*}+y\\right)\n$$\n\nWe may now characterise the admissible values of $s$ for a fixed $r$.

The minimiser of $s^{\\text {opt }}(y)$ wrt $y$, which we donne by $y^{*}$, can be found straightforwardly by solving $\\frac{d s^{\\text {opt }}(y)}{d y}=0$, giving\n\n$$\ny^{*}=\\frac{G-A_{\\infty}^{*}}{2}\n$$\n\nwhich implies that for any $r>0$,\n\n$$\ns^{\\mathrm{opt}} \\geq-\\frac{\\left(G+A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}}{4 H^{2} \\Xi \\Sigma}=: s^{l}\n$$\n\nsince $y$ is monotonically related to $r$ (notice also that $s^{l}$ is independent of $r$ ). Note however that by definition, $y>|G|$ since $r>0$. Therefore the lower bound on admissible $s$ values corresponds to $s^{l}$ if $G-2|G|<A_{\\infty}^{*}$, otherwise it corresponds to $s^{\\text {opt }}(y=|G|)$, which we denote by $s^{u}$ in the lemma.\n\nFinally, we can obtain expressions for $r^{\\text {opt }}$ for a given $s$ satisfying the aforementioned constraints by a straightforward rearrangement of (5.28),\n\n$$\ny^{2}+\\left(A_{\\infty}^{*}-G\\right) y-G A_{\\infty}^{*}-s H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma=0\n$$\n\nyielding\n\n$$\ny=\\frac{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}+4\\left(G A_{\\infty}^{*}+s H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma\\right)}}{2}\n$$\n\nNote that $s^{\\text {opt }}(y)$ is a convex quadratic in $y$, with roots $y=G$ and $y=-A_{\\infty}^{*}$ and minimum attained at $y=y^{*}$ as defined in (5.27). Also, it holds that $y>|G|$ which follows directly from the definition (5.25) and that $r>0$. Therefore, whenever $y^{*}<|G|$, there is a unique admissible $y$ value for any given $s$ satisfying the aforementioned constraints. More specifically, this value is given by\n\n$$\ny=\\frac{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)+\\sqrt{\\left(G-A_{\\infty}^{*}\\right)^{2}+4\\left(G A_{\\infty}^{*}+s H^{2} \\Xi^{-1} \\Sigma\\right)}}{2}\n$$\n\nFinally, whenever $y^{*} \\geq|G|$, there are two admissible $y$ values for any given $s^{l}<s<s^{\\text {opt }}(y=|G|)$, and a unique $y$ value for $s>s^{\\text {opt }}(y=|G|)$ given by (5.31).

Inspired by a non-local fitness functional presented in the mathematical biology literature [CHR06], we extended this connection to obtain a \"modified\" Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This equation was shown to beneficial for filtering with misspecified models and a specific choice of parameters in the fitness functional was shown to coincide with covariance inflated Kalman Bucy filtering, in the linear-Gaussian setting. Additionally, we considered the misspecified model filtering problem, with linear-Gaussian dynamics and where the misspecification arises through an unknown constant bias in the signal dynamics. We proved that through a judicious choice of parameters in the fitness functional, mean squared error and uncertainty quantification (through the covariance) could be improved via this modified Kushner-Stratonovich equation. Estimation is improved over traditional covariance inflation techniques, as well as over the standard filtering setup (assuming perfect model knowledge).\n\nThere are several avenues for further work, most notably, the analysis on misspecified models in Section 4 has primarily focused on the scalar setting which has simplified the analysis. In future works, the multivariate setting, as well as extensions to nonlinear dynamics should be explored.

Continuity of solutions of SDEs Let $g, \\sigma$ be lipschitz continuous functions satisfying linear growth conditions.

Consider the signal-observation pair (1.3)-(1.4) with $g(x)=G x, h(x)=H x$ and Gaussian initial conditions. If $m_{0}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{0}\\right]$ then the generalised Kalman-Bucy filter with $s<r, r>0$ is unbiased, i.e. $\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{t}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{t}\\right], t>0$.\n\nProof. Begin with the mean equation from the generalised Kalman-Bucy filter\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_{t} & =m_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} G m_{u} d u+(r-s) \\int_{0}^{t} K_{u} d Z_{u}-(r-s) \\int_{0}^{t} K_{u} H m_{u} d u \\\\\n& =m_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} G m_{u} d u+(r-s) \\int_{0}^{t} K_{u} H\\left(X_{u}^{*}-m_{u}\\right) d u+(r-s) \\int_{0}^{t} K_{u} \\Xi^{1 / 2} d B_{u}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{t}:=C_{t} H^{\\top} \\Xi^{-1}$ corresponds to the Kalman gain at time $t$ and we have substituted in the form of the observations in the second equality. Then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{t}\\right]=m_{0}+\\int_{0}^{t} G \\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{u}\\right] d u+(r-s) \\int_{0}^{t} K_{u} H\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{u}^{*}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{u}\\right]\\right) d u\n$$\n\nAlso recall that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{t}^{*}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{0}^{*}\\right]+\\int_{0}^{t} G \\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{u}^{*}\\right] d u\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{t}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{t}^{*}\\right]=m_{0}-\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{0}^{*}\\right]+\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(G-(r-s) K_{s} H\\right)\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{s}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{s}^{*}\\right]\\right) d s\n$$\n\nwhich corresponds to an ODE of the form $\\dot{y}_{t}=A_{t} y_{t}$ with $y_{t}:=\\mathbb{E}\\left[m_{t}\\right]-\\mathbb{E}\\left[X_{t}^{*}\\right]$, which has solutions $y_{t}=$ $0, t>0$ whenever $y_{0}=0$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 25, "text": "# References \n\n[AC14] Matthieu Alfaro and R\u00e9mi Carles. \"Explicit solutions for replicator-mutator equations: extinction vs. acceleration\". en.

This manuscript describes new research in which this precise\nconnection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we\nfocus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich\nequation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of\nparticular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation\npath from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to\nconverge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation.\nThis smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between\nnonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally,\ngradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of\nreplicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the\nmisspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further\nresearch into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology\nand to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.", "updated": "2025-03-12T18:12:39Z", "published": "2024-11-25T13:20:25Z"}
