Affinely invariant rerandomization has the \"Equal Percent Variance Reducing\" (EPVR) property. When dealing with covariates of varying importance and/or mixed types, the conditionally EPVR property is often more desired. We discuss a general class of conditionally affinely invariant rerandomization methods and obtain their conditionally EPVR property. In addition, we set up a decision-theoretical framework to evaluate balance criteria for rerandomization. Popular rerandomization methods, such as the covariate balance table check, are found to be inadmissible. We suggest an admissible complete class of conditionally affinely invariant balance criteria, which can be applied to experimental designs involving tiers of covariates, stratification, and multiple treatment arms.\n\n\nKeywords: Randomized experiments; ellipsoidal distribution; statistical decision theory", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the \"gold standard\" for studying causal relationships, yet can be expensive to implement. Tukey (1993) describes the \"platinum standard\" for RCTs, where probability statements, such as statistical significance, depend only on exactly how the trial was conducted. Extensive covariates are now commonly available at the design stages of RCTs. According to a survey by Bruhn \\& McKenzie (2009), researchers tend to rerandomize when imbalance in covariates across treatments occurs but the exact rerandomization procedures are generally not described in detail. Any subsequent analysis that ignores the design stage does not adhere to Tukey's \"platinum standard\".\n\nMorgan \\& Rubin (MR, 2012) formalize rerandomization by specifying a balance criterion before treatment assignment, accepting a randomized assignment only after the criterion is met, and then analyzing results using randomization-based methods appropriate to that design. The results of rerandomization procedures are transparent and ensure the validity of Fisher's randomization test (Fisher 1935). MR focus on rerandomization methods with affinely invariant balance criteria. Using symmetry arguments, rerandomization based on the Mahalanobis distance is shown to be \"Equal Percent Variance Reducing\" (EPVR).\n\nAffine invariance can be relaxed to apply to tiers of covariates (Morgan \\& Rubin 2015, e.g.), special discrete covariates (Wang et al. 2021, Johansson \\& Schultzberg 2022, e.g.), and factorial designs (e.g. Branson et al. 2016, Li et al. 2020). A general theory for such designs\n\nis our first major topic. Parallel to Rubin \\& Thomas (1992), we make extensions to the affinely invariant balance criteria and obtain the conditionally EPVR property with respect to the limiting covariate distribution assumed to be conditionally ellipsoidally symmetric. This assumption can be satisfied by applying the finite population central limit theorem in each scenario.\n\nIn contrast, other researchers seek optimally balanced designs (e.g., Bertsimas et al. 2015, Kallus 2018). However, the sets of optimally balanced assignments are too restrictive to allow valid randomization-based inference (Johansson et al. 2021) and can cause imbalances of unobserved covariates (Harshaw et al. 2024). Therefore, it's necessary to keep a minimal acceptance probability so that meaningful randomization-based inference can be drawn. Inspired by the statistical decision theory (Wald 1949), we give formal definitions of admissibility and complete class for stochastic criteria, and characterize them with sufficient and necessary conditions. \"Unified\" and \"intersection\" methods, as defined in Section 4, are two common ways of building balance criteria. Despite their popularity, many \"intersection\" balance criteria, including the covariate balance table check (see e.g. Zhao \\& Ding 2024), are found to be inadmissible. We suggest an admissible complete class of conditionally affinely invariant balance criteria, which is found to dominate existing methods for multiple balancing targets.\n\nWe organize the rest materials as follows. Section 2 reviews affinely invariant rerandomization methods. Section 3 motivates the idea conditionally affinely invariant reran-\n\ndomization methods and studies their basic properties. Section 4 characterizes admissible/inadmissible balance criteria and compares \"unified\" methods with \"intersection\" methods. Section 5 studies the admissible complete class of conditionally affinely invariant balance criteria. Section 6 illustrates our theory using a real dataset from Blattman et al. (2017). Section 7 makes further discussion and concludes.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# 2 A Review of Affinely Invariant Rerandomization \n\nLet's firstly consider a randomized experiment with two treatment levels over $n$ units. Let $\\boldsymbol{W}$ denote the treatment allocation vector of dimension $n$, whose $i$-th value $W_{i}$ equals 1 if unit $i(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)$ is treated and equals 0 if not. Under complete randomization, a treatment allocation is randomly drawn from $\\mathcal{W}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{W} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{n} \\mid \\sum W_{i}=n_{1}\\right\\}$, where $n_{1}$ is the treatment group size, and $n_{0}=n-n_{1}$ is the control group size.\n\nWhen experimental units are enrolled in a study, they typically include their baseline covariates such as age and gender, that could potentially affect experimental outcomes. Let $\\boldsymbol{x}$ be an $n \\times k$ real-valued matrix in which the $i$ 'th row $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is the covariate vector for unit $i$. Under complete randomization, a random draw of treatment allocation from $\\mathcal{W}$ can be highly correlated with certain linear combination of covariates. It's not a good idea to conduct the experiment with such an \"unlucky\" randomization because covariates are not balanced between treatment and control groups.\n\nRerandomization rejects a random draw from $\\mathcal{W}$ if some pre-determined balance cri-\n\nterion is not satisfied. The criterion can be formulated as an indicator function $\\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{W})$, where a decision is made to accept $\\boldsymbol{W}$ if $\\varphi=1$ and if $\\varphi=0$ to reject $\\boldsymbol{W}$ and rerandomize. A balance criterion is said to be affinely invariant if it satisfies\n\n$$\n\\varphi(\\mathcal{A}(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\boldsymbol{W})=\\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{W})\n$$\n\nfor any affine transformation $\\mathcal{A}$ on covariates defined as $\\mathcal{A}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{A}+\\boldsymbol{b}$.\n\nExample 1 (ReM). MR suggest rerandomization based on the squared Mahalanobis distance between treatment and control groups (ReM):\n\n$$\nD \\equiv \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}^{\\top}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{1}-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}$ is the difference in treatment and control group means of covariates, and $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}\\right)$ is the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}$ under complete randomization. A randomization is rejected if $D>a$ and accepted otherwise, where $a>0$ is a pre-specified threshold. This balance criterion is affine invariant because $D$ remains invariant under any affine transformation $\\mathcal{A}$ on covariates.\n\nA measure of covariate balance proposed by MR is the percentage reduction in variance of the difference in means for each covariate. MR show that, using ReM, the reduction in variance for each covariate, and for any linear combination of covariates is the same, namely EPVR. The conclusion builds on a finite population central limit theorem by H\u00e1jek (1960), which in fact holds with respect to the limiting distribution of $\\sqrt{n} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}$. Let $\\mathbb{E}_{\\text {lim }}$, var $_{\\text {lim }}$ and $\\operatorname{cov}_{\\text {lim }}$ denote the mean, variance and covariance with respect to the limiting distribution,\n\nrespectively. Let $\\sqrt{n} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x} \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}, \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$, denote the scaled difference in treatment and control group means of any linear combination of covariates.

Morgan \\& Rubin (2015) consider a situation where covariates vary in a priori importance, and suggest that better balance should be required for more important covariates. Another common situation is that covariates are a mixture of categorical and continuous variables. It is shown by Johansson \\& Schultzberg (2022) that stratification on binary covariates followed by rerandomization on continuous covariates is more efficient than rerandomization on all covariates at the same time.\n\nWe first review balance criteria that address these concerns.\n\nExample 2 (ReMT). Morgan \\& Rubin (2015) propose rerandomization using tiers of squared Mahalanobis distances (ReMT), where covariates are partitioned into $T$ tiers $(T>$\n\n1) ordered by decreasing importance. Covariates in each tier $t \\geq 2$ are projected onto those of lower tiers through\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{x}^{(t)}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}+\\sum_{l=1}^{t-1} \\boldsymbol{x}^{(l)} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j}+\\boldsymbol{e}^{(t)}\n$$\n\nand replaced with the projection residual $\\boldsymbol{e}^{(t)}$, with $\\boldsymbol{e}^{(1)}=\\boldsymbol{x}^{(1)}$. For $1 \\leq t \\leq T$, let $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t)}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{1}^{(t)}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{0}^{(t)}$ denote the difference in means for covariates in tier $t$ after the projection, and $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t)}\\right)$ denote the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t)}$ under complete randomization. A randomization is rejected if the squared Mahalanobis distance for any tier $t$, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t)} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t)}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{(t) \\top}$, exceeds a pre-specified threshold $a_{t}>0$.\n\nIn a stratified randomized experiment, units are divided in to $J$ strata according to the categorical variable $\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}^{(s)} \\in\\{\\boldsymbol{s}(1), \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{s}(J)\\}$. Let $n_{j}$ denote the number of units in stratum $j$, with $n=\\sum_{j=1}^{J} n_{j}$ the total units. A stratified randomization assigns units in each stratum to one of the two treatment arms through complete randomization (see e.g. Imbens \\& Rubin 2015, Ch. 9). Although the categorical variable is balanced through stratification, there usually exist remaining covariates that need to be balanced.\n\nExample 3 (SReM). To improve covariate balance in stratified experiments, Wang et al. (2021) propose two criteria for stratified rerandomization using squared Mahalanobis distances (SReM). For $j=1, \\ldots, J$, let $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{(j r)}=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{1}^{(j r)}-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}^{(j r)}$ denote the difference in means of remaining covariates between treatment and control groups in stratum $j$, and $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{(j r)}\\right)$ denote its sampling covariance under stratified randomization. Across all strata, denote by $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}=n^{-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{J} n_{j} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}^{(j r)}$, where $n_{j}$ is the sample size in the $j$-th stratum. Let $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)$\n\ndenote the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}$ under stratified randomization. The first criterion is for overall balance, which rejects a randomization if the overall squared Mahalanobis distance, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}^{\\top}$, exceeds a pre-specified threshold $a>0$. The second criterion is for stratum-specific balance, which rejects a randomization if the squared Mahalanobis distance for any stratum $j, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}^{(j r)} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}^{(j r)}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}^{(j r) \\top}$, exceeds a pre-specified threshold $a_{j}>0$.\n\nWhen randomized experiments involve $Q>2$ treatment arms, covariate balance becomes an increasingly important issue (Branson et al. 2016). We extend $\\boldsymbol{W}$ as an $n \\times(Q-1)$ matrix of mutually orthogonal dummy variables, where $W_{i q}=1$ if unit $i$ is assigned to the $q$-th treatment arm $(q=1, \\ldots, Q-1)$, and 0 otherwise (units in the 0 -th arm have all entries 0 ). Let $n_{q}$ denote the sample size for arm $q$, with $\\sum_{q=0}^{Q-1} n_{q}=n$. Specially, for $2^{K}$ factorial experiments with $K$ factors, each at levels +1 and -1 , there are $Q=2^{K}$ treatment combinations. Factorial effects are defined by $F=2^{K}-1$ orthogonal contrasts of potential outcomes (Dasgupta et al. 2015). A completely randomized factorial design draws an assignment matrix randomly from $\\mathcal{W}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{W} \\in\\{0,1\\}^{n \\times(Q-1)} \\mid \\sum_{q=1}^{Q-1} W_{i q} \\leq 1\\right.$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq$ $n, \\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_{i q}=n_{q}$ for $\\left.1 \\leq q \\leq Q-1\\right\\}$.\n\nExample 4 (ReFM). Li et al. (2020) consider rerandomization in factorial experiments with squared Mahalanobis distances (ReFM). Let $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}=\\left(\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}^{\\top}, \\ldots, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{Q-1}^{\\top}\\right)^{\\top}$ denote the matrix of covariate means within $Q$ treatment arms. For the $f$-th factorial effect $(1 \\leq f \\leq F)$, the contrast vector $\\boldsymbol{g}_{f} \\in\\{-1,+1\\}^{Q}$ satisfying $\\sum_{q=1}^{Q} g_{f q}=0$ defines\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x, f}=2^{-(K-1)} \\boldsymbol{g}_{f} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}\n$$\n\nwhich compares covariate means along this contrast. Let $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}=\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x, 1}, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x, F}\\right)$ denote the vector combining all factorial contrasts of covariates. Also, let $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}\\right)$ denote the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}$ under the completely randomized factorial design. Li et al. (2020) propose two rerandomization criteria for factorial designs. The first criterion rejects a randomization if the squared Mahalanobis distance, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{\\top}$, exceeds a prespecified threshold $a>0$. For the second criterion, factorial contrasts of covariates are partitioned into $H$ tiers. Let $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[h]}$ denote the sub-vector of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}$ containing factorial contrasts of covariates of tier $h(1 \\leq h \\leq H)$, and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}$ denote the sub-vector of the previous $h-1$ tiers $(1<h \\leq H)$. Let $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}\\right)$ denote the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}$, and $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[h]}, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}\\right)$ denote that between $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[h]}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}$. For $h>1$, applying block-wise Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h] \\top}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[h] \\top}-\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[h]}, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}\\right) \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1]}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1: h-1] \\top}\n$$\n\nwith $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[1]}=\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{r}}_{x}^{[1]}$. Let $\\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h]}\\right)$ denote the sampling covariance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h]}$. The second criterion rejects a randomization if the squared Mahalanobis distance for any tier $h, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h]} \\operatorname{cov}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h]}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{x}^{[h] \\top}$, exceeds a pre-specified threshold $a_{h}>0$.\n\nBalance criteria reviewed in Examples 2-4 can be effectively combined (see e.g. rerandomization based on squared Mahalanobis distances of tiers of both covariates and factorial effects, Li et al. 2018b), as they are built under a common principle introduced as follows.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3.2 Conditionally Affinely Invariant Criteria \n\nWe now introduce the formal definition of conditionally affinely invariant rerandomization, which can be viewed as a close analogue to the conditionally affinely invariant matching (Rubin \\& Thomas 1992).

A unified criterion places a threshold on a single weighted imbalance measure:\n\n$$\nI\\left(\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} \\zeta_{m}(\\omega) \\leq a\\right), \\quad \\pi_{m} \\geq 0, a \\in \\mathbb{R}, 1 \\leq m \\leq M\n$$\n\nIn contrast, an intersection criterion sequentially places thresholds on the $m$-th objective:\n\n$$\nI\\left(\\zeta_{m}(\\omega) \\leq a_{m}\\right), \\quad a_{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}, 1 \\leq m \\leq M\n$$\n\nConceptually, the intersection criterion is equivalent to $\\prod_{m=1}^{M} I\\left(\\zeta_{m}(\\omega) \\leq a_{m}\\right)$. However, as the process can be terminated before the last step, the cost of making a decision can be reduced.\n\nProposition 1. For $1 \\leq m \\leq M$, let $h_{m}(\\omega)$ be the cost of collecting and storing $\\zeta_{m}(\\omega)$, which is assumed to be non-negative and integrable. For an intersection criterion with $M$ steps, the expected cost is no larger than $\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{m}\\right]$, the average cost of making a decision until the final step.\n\nFor covariates available at the design stages in RCTs, the cost of rerandomization is computing and storing balance scores, which is not a major concern. While intersection methods may reduce computational cost by early termination, they are generally inadmissible. We illustrate this point with a class of popular balance criteria, the covariate balance table check.\n\nExample 5 (ReP). Contemporary RCTs often include covariate balance tables to check randomization quality. According to a survey by Bruhn \\& McKenzie (2009), practitioners tend to rerandomize if the standard $t$-test shows significant results on some covariates. Zhao \\& Ding (2024) formalize this practice as rerandomization using marginal rules (ReP). For each covariate $m=1, \\ldots, k$, define the standardized difference\n\n$$\nt_{m}=\\frac{\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{1}^{(m)}-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{0}^{(m)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(n_{1}-1\\right) s_{1}^{(m)}+\\left(n_{0}-1\\right) s_{0}^{(m)}}{n-2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{1}}+\\frac{1}{n_{0}}\\right)}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}_{z}^{(m)}$ and $s_{z}^{(m)}$ are the sample mean and variance of the $m$-th covariate in treatment $\\operatorname{arm} z \\in\\{0,1\\}$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k} \\geq 0$ denote pre-specified thresholds. The balance criterion $\\prod_{m=1}^{k} I\\left(\\left|t_{m}\\right| \\leq a_{m}\\right)=I(|\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$ rejects randomizations where any $\\left|t_{m}\\right|$ exceeds $a_{m}$.\nLet $\\boldsymbol{S}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}=\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)^{\\top}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}-\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)$ denote the sample covariance matrix of covari-\n\nates, and $\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\boldsymbol{S}_{x}\\right)$ the diagonal matrix of $\\boldsymbol{S}_{x}$. Zhao \\& Ding (2024) show that, under certain regularity conditions, $\\boldsymbol{t}=\\left(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}\\right)$ converges in distribution to $N\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\boldsymbol{S}_{x}\\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{S}_{x} \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\boldsymbol{S}_{x}\\right)^{-1}\\right)$, and that the asymptotic variances of Neyman's or Fisher's estimators under ReP decomposes into $\\operatorname{var}_{\\lim }(\\boldsymbol{t} \\gamma||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ and an error term no affected by ReP. A statistical question can be raised as whether the asymptotic variance $\\operatorname{var}_{\\lim }(\\boldsymbol{t} \\gamma||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$ can be further reduced for any fixed $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ without tightening $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}(|\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$.\n\nNote that the asymptotic variance under $I(|\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$ can be decomposed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{var}_{\\lim }(\\boldsymbol{t} \\gamma||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})=\\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\gamma_{m}^{2} \\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[t_{m}^{2}||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a}\\right] \\\\\n+2 \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\sum_{\\ell>m}\\left(\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}\\right)^{+} \\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[t_{\\ell} t_{m}||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a}\\right]+2 \\sum_{m=1}^{k} \\sum_{\\ell<m}\\left(\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}\\right)^{-} \\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[-t_{\\ell} t_{m}||\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a}\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left(\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}\\right)^{+}$denotes the maximum of $\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}$ and 0 , and $\\left(\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}\\right)^{-}$the minimum of $\\gamma_{\\ell} \\gamma_{m}$ and 0 .

By Theorem 2, in terms of minimizing the asymptotic conditional expectations of (11), the following class of balance criteria\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C}^{*}=\\left\\{\\varphi=I(\\zeta \\leq a), \\text { a.s. } \\mid \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}(\\zeta \\leq a) \\geq \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}(|\\boldsymbol{t}| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis complete. However, $I(|t| \\leq \\boldsymbol{a})$ lies outside $\\mathcal{C}^{*}$, as the acceptance region of each balance criterion of $\\mathcal{C}^{*}$ is defined by a quadratic form up to almost sure equivalence. Also, the asymptotic variance under $I(\\zeta \\leq a)$ admits the decomposition (10).

Moreover, specifying $k^{2}$ weights becomes impractical with high-dimensional covariates. Theorem 1 shows that, by imposing conditional affine invariance on balance criteria, the conditionally EPVR property holds within invariant subspaces, which reduces weight selection for imbalance measures structured as Mahalanobis distances.\n\nWe develop a unified framework to construct balance criteria for experimental designs involving tiers of covariates, stratification, and multiple treatment arms. To evaluate the improvement in causal estimation, we adopt a potential outcome framework from Dasgupta et al. (2015). For $Q \\geq 2$, let $Y_{i}(q)$ denote the potential outcome for unit $i$ under the $q$-th treatment $\\left(0 \\leq q \\leq Q-1\\right)$, and let $\\boldsymbol{Y}_{i}=\\left(Y_{i}(0), \\ldots, Y_{i}(Q-1)\\right)$ denote the vector of all\n\npotential outcomes. For $1 \\leq f \\leq F$, the $f$-th factorial effect for each unit $i$ is defined as $\\tau_{f i}=2^{-(K-1)} \\boldsymbol{g}_{f} \\boldsymbol{Y}_{i}$, with the average factorial effect as $\\tau_{f}=n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\tau_{f i}$. Let $y_{i}$ denote the observed outcome of unit $i$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$ the observed outcome vector for all units under the realized treatment assignment $\\boldsymbol{W}$. For each factorial effect, we consider $\\widehat{\\tau}_{f}=2^{-(K-1)} \\boldsymbol{g}_{f} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{y}}$ to estimate $\\tau_{f}$, where $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{y}}=\\left(\\bar{y}_{0}, \\ldots, \\bar{y}_{Q-1}\\right)^{\\top}$ denotes the vector of observed outcome means of $Q \\geq 2$ treatment arms. When $Q=2$, it reduces to the standard difference-in-means estimator $\\bar{y}_{1}-\\bar{y}_{0}$ for the average treatment effect. Denote by $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}=\\left(\\widehat{\\tau}_{1}, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\tau}_{F}\\right)$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\left(\\tau_{1}, \\ldots, \\tau_{F}\\right)$. Recall the definition of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ in Example 4. Li \\& Ding (2017) establish general forms of finite population central limit theorems (CLTs), showing that under certain regularity conditions,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{n}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}-\\boldsymbol{\\tau}), \\sqrt{n} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}\\right) \\xrightarrow{d} N(\\mathbf{0}, \\boldsymbol{V}), \\text { as } n \\rightarrow \\infty\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{V}$ is the limit of the joint sampling covariance of $\\left(\\sqrt{n}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}-\\boldsymbol{\\tau}), \\sqrt{n} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}\\right)$. Li \\& Ding (2017) also note that for stratified experiments with few strata but large within-stratum sample sizes, the finite population CLT can be applied independently to each stratum, and averaging across strata also leads to (12). For the case with many small strata, Liu et al. (2024) establish (12) using an extended finite population CLT.\n\nWe partition factorial contrasts into $H \\geq 1$ tiers and covariates into $T \\geq 1$ tiers based on their importance. Following Section 3.2, we construct $M=H \\times T$ scaled linear contrast vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{z}^{(m)}\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}$. Then $\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{z}^{(M)}\\right)$ is a permutation of $\\sqrt{n} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}_{x}$. To orthogonalize tiers of contrasts, for $1<m \\leq M$, we apply the block-wise Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to obtain the residual $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{(m)}$ by projecting $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(m)}$ onto $\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{z}^{(m-1)}\\right)$ with $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{(1)}=\\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)}$. The\n\ntransformation from $\\left(\\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{z}^{(M)}\\right)$ to $\\left(\\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\widetilde{\\boldsymbol{z}}^{(M)}\\right)$ is based on the sampling covariance, which has a limit $\\boldsymbol{V}$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Note that any balance criterion conditionally affinely invariant on $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(m)}$ is equivalent to that invariant on $\\boldsymbol{c}^{(m)}$.

The subclass $\\mathcal{C}_{M}^{*} \\subset \\mathcal{C}_{M}$ defines rerandomization with weighted Mahalanobis distances (ReWM), which consists of unified balance criteria in the form:\n\n$$\n\\varphi^{*}=I\\left(\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} D_{m} \\leq a\\right), \\quad \\pi_{m} \\geq 0, a>0\n$$\n\nFrom (13), we have\n\n$$\n\\left(D_{1}, \\ldots, D_{M}\\right) \\dot{\\sim}\\left(\\chi_{k_{1}}^{2}, \\ldots, \\chi_{k_{M}}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere each $\\chi_{k_{m}}^{2}$ is a chisquare random variable of $k_{m}$-degree of freedom independent of the rest.

The following standardized estimator decomposes into projections on canonical contrasts and a residual term $c_{0}$ uncorrelated with these contrasts:\n\n$$\nv^{-1 / 2}(\\widehat{\\tau}-\\tau)=\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{c}^{(m)} \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{m}+c_{0}\n$$\n\nwhere $v=\\operatorname{var}(\\widehat{\\tau})$ is the sampling variance of $\\widehat{\\tau}$ under complete randomization, and each $\\gamma_{m}$ is the projection coefficient.

Some authors (e.g. Wang \\& Li 2022, Harshaw et al. 2024) consider diminishing acceptance probability. Although covariate imbalance would disappear asymptotically in the latter framework, it exists in finite sample when perfect balance is not achieved. Harshaw et al. (2024) find that ignoring the finite sample covariate imbalance can invalidate the subsequent analysis for causal effects. We keep the truncated sum of normal distributions to reflect covariate imbalance in finite sample. Wang \\& Li (2022) also consider diverging number of covariates. In practice, this adds to the total cost of conducting randomized experiments. A\n\ngeneral framework to study the trade off between efficiency gain and the cost of collecting covariates is our future research topic.\n\nOur decision-theoretic framework applies to general rerandomization procedures. For example, Banerjee et al. (2020) formalizes another popular balance criterion that picks the best out of a pre-specified number of randomizations to maximize a utility function. Applying Theorem 2, we find it inadmissible in terms of maximizing the conditional utility of accepted randomizations, as balance criteria in the complete class are deterministic almost surely besides at the decision boundary.\n\nIn summary, conditional affine invariance and admissibility are two important principles in designing balance criteria for rerandomization. The former results in conditionally EPVR property for linear contrasts of covariate means, and the latter ensures that the asymptotic variance reduction cannot be dominated. Our theory helps researchers build balance criteria suitable for their experimental designs, and avoid inadmissible balance criteria that have already gained popularity. In particular, we recommend ReWM that follows the two principles, which applies to experimental designs involving tiers of covariates, stratification, and multiple treatment arms.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 10, "text": "# References \n\nBanerjee, A.

If $\\omega$ in $S^{+}$, $\\varphi(\\omega)$ must be positive and $a \\geq \\pi_{1} \\zeta_{1}(\\omega)$. In a similar way $a \\leq \\pi_{1} \\zeta_{1}(\\omega)$ for all $\\omega$ in $S^{-}$.

Denote by $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}=\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} \\zeta_{m}$. Suppose there exists $\\varphi^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ that dominates $\\varphi$. Summing these inequalities with respect to the positive vector $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$, we have $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\mid \\varphi^{\\prime}\\right]<\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\mid \\varphi]$. However, as shown in the $M=1$ case, $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\mid \\varphi^{\\prime}\\right] \\geq \\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\mid \\varphi]$. This contradiction means that $\\varphi^{\\prime}$ does not exist and $\\varphi$ is an admissible criterion.\n(ii) For all $\\psi$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, let $U$ be the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{M+1}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\left(\\int \\zeta_{1} \\psi d \\sigma, \\ldots, \\int \\zeta_{M} \\psi d \\sigma, \\int 1-\\psi d \\sigma\\right): \\psi \\in \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNote that $U$ is convex because it is the image of a linear transformation on the convex set\n\n$\\mathcal{C}$. Suppose an admissible criterion $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{C}$ is mapped to some $u=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{M+1}\\right) \\in U$. Let $V$ be the set of all points whose first $M$ coordinates are strictly lower than those of $u$ for fixed $u_{M+1}$. We state that $U \\cap V=\\emptyset$. Otherwise, we can find a point in $U$ mapped from $\\varphi^{\\prime}$ such that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varphi^{\\prime}\\right]=u_{M+1}$ and $\\int \\zeta_{m} \\varphi^{\\prime} d \\sigma<\\int \\zeta_{m} \\varphi d \\sigma, m=1,2, \\ldots, M$, which means $\\varphi$ is no longer admissible, a contradiction.\n\nBy the separation theorem there exists a hyperplane $\\Pi$ that separates two disjoint convex sets $U$ and $V$. An immediate observation is $u \\in \\Pi$ because $u \\in U \\cap \\bar{V}$. Let the equation of $\\Pi$ evaluated at $u$ be $\\pi_{0}+\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} u_{m}+a u_{M+1}=0$. According to the analytical form of the separation theorem,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m}\\left(v_{m}-u_{m}\\right) \\leq 0, \\quad \\forall\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}, u_{M+1}\\right) \\in V \\\\\n& \\int(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a) \\psi d \\sigma \\geq \\int(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a) \\psi d \\sigma, \\quad \\forall \\psi \\in \\mathcal{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt can be directly proved that $\\pi_{m} \\geq 0(m=1,2, \\ldots, M)$ by letting each coordinate tend to $-\\infty$ with the rest fixed in (24).\n\nConsider $\\varphi^{*} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\varphi^{*}(\\omega)=1$ when $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}(\\omega) \\leq a$ and $\\varphi^{*}(\\omega)=0$ when $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}(\\omega)>a$. Then $\\varphi^{*}$ attains the lower bound of (25). Let $S$ be the intersection of the set, on which $\\varphi^{*}$ and $\\varphi$ differs, with $\\{\\omega \\in \\mathcal{W} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}(\\omega) \\neq a\\}$. Since $(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a)\\left(\\varphi^{*}-\\varphi\\right)>0$ on $S$ and equals 0 on $\\mathcal{W} \\backslash S$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & \\leq \\int_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a)\\left(\\varphi^{*}-\\varphi\\right) d \\sigma \\\\\n& =\\int(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a)\\left(\\varphi^{*}-\\varphi\\right) d \\sigma=0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, $\\int_{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\zeta}-a)\\left(\\varphi^{*}-\\varphi\\right) d \\sigma=0$ which implies that $\\operatorname{Pr}(S)=0$ as was to be proved.\n\n(iii) For all $\\psi \\in \\mathcal{C}$, let $U_{\\text {ext }}$ be the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^{2 M+2}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\{\\left(\\int \\zeta_{1} \\psi d \\sigma, \\ldots, \\int \\zeta_{M} \\psi d \\sigma, \\int \\psi d \\sigma, \\int \\zeta_{1}(1-\\psi) d \\sigma, \\ldots\\right.\\right. \\\\\n\\left.\\left.\\int \\zeta_{M}(1-\\psi) d \\sigma, \\int 1-\\psi d \\sigma\\right): \\psi \\in \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nApplying Theorem 1 of Dvoretzky et al. (1951), $U_{\\text {ext }}$ is convex and compact. Recall that $U$ is defined as\n\n$$\nU=\\left\\{\\left(\\int \\zeta_{1} \\psi d \\sigma, \\ldots, \\int \\zeta_{M} \\psi d \\sigma, \\int 1-\\psi d \\sigma\\right): \\psi \\in \\mathcal{C}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nBecause $U$ can be obtained by coordinate projection over $U_{\\text {ext }}$, we know that $U$ is still convex and compact.\n\nFor any $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{C} \\backslash \\mathcal{C}^{*}$, by (ii), we know that $\\varphi$ is inadmissible and can be dominated by some $\\varphi^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{C}$. Consider a family of convex sets $V(d)=\\left\\{\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{M+1}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M+1} \\mid v_{1} \\leq\\right.$ $\\left.u_{1}^{\\prime}-d, \\ldots, v_{M} \\leq u_{M}^{\\prime}-d, v_{M+1}=u_{M+1}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, where\n\n$$\nu^{\\prime}=\\left(u_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, u_{M}^{\\prime}, u_{M+1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(\\int \\zeta_{1} \\varphi^{\\prime} d \\sigma, \\ldots, \\int \\zeta_{M} \\varphi^{\\prime} d \\sigma, \\int 1-\\varphi^{\\prime} d \\sigma\\right)\n$$\n\nDefine $d_{0}=\\inf \\{d \\geq 0: V(d) \\cap U=\\emptyset\\}$. Because $U$ is bounded from below in each coordinate, we know that $q_{0}<\\infty$.\n\nWe state $V\\left(d_{0}\\right) \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$. If, on the contrary, $V\\left(d_{0}\\right) \\cap U=\\emptyset$, because $V\\left(d_{0}\\right)$ is convex and closed, there exists a hyperplane that strictly separates them. It indicates the existence of $d_{1}<d_{0}$ such that $V\\left(d_{1}\\right) \\cap U=\\emptyset$, which contradicts with the definition of $d_{0}$. Therefore,\n\nthere exists $u^{*} \\in V\\left(d_{0}\\right) \\cap U$ for $d_{0} \\geq 0$, where\n\n$$\nu^{*}=\\left(u_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, u_{M}^{*}, u_{M+1}^{*}\\right)=\\left(\\int \\zeta_{1} \\varphi^{*} d \\sigma, \\ldots, \\int \\zeta_{M} \\varphi^{*} d \\sigma, \\int 1-\\varphi^{*} d \\sigma\\right)\n$$\n\nsatisfies $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varphi^{*}\\right]=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\varphi^{\\prime}\\right]$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\zeta_{m} \\mid \\varphi^{*}\\right] \\leq \\int \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\zeta_{m} \\mid \\varphi^{\\prime}\\right]$ for $m=1, \\ldots, M$. It follows that $\\varphi^{*}$ also dominates $\\varphi$. Applying the separation theorem to $V\\left(d_{0}\\right)$ and $U$, we repeat the proof of (ii) to obtain that\n\n$$\n\\varphi^{*}(\\omega) \\stackrel{\\text { a.s. }}{=} \\begin{cases}1, & \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} \\zeta_{m}(\\omega)<a \\\\ 0, & \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} \\zeta_{m}(\\omega)>a\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nfor $\\pi_{1} \\geq 0, \\ldots, \\pi_{M} \\geq 0, a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $\\varphi^{*} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{*}$.\n\nProof of Proposition 1. Given a sample $\\omega \\in \\mathcal{W}$ and an intersection criterion $\\varphi, m(\\omega, \\varphi)$ is the number of steps when first $\\varphi_{m}=0$ occurs (and equals $M$ if $\\varphi_{m}=1$ at all steps). Therefore, the cost of making a decision on $\\omega$ is $\\sum_{m=1}^{m(\\omega, \\varphi)} h_{m}(\\omega)=h_{1}(\\omega)+\\sum_{m=2}^{M}\\left(h_{m}(\\omega) \\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l}(\\omega)\\right)$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{m=1}^{m(\\omega, \\varphi)} h_{m}(\\omega)\\right] & =\\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{1}+\\sum_{m=2}^{M}\\left(h_{m} \\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =\\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{1}\\right]+\\sum_{m=2}^{M} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{m} \\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $m \\geq 2$, since $h_{m} \\geq 0$ and $\\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l} \\leq 1$, we further know that $h_{m}\\left(\\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l}-1\\right) \\leq 0$. Taking expectation on both sides and summing over $m$, we have $\\sum_{m=2}^{M} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{m} \\prod_{l=1}^{m-1} \\varphi_{l}\\right] \\leq$ $\\sum_{m=2}^{M} \\mathbb{E}\\left[h_{m}\\right]$, which completes the proof.\n\nProof of Corollary 2.1. (i) Equation (15) can be proved in the same way as Proposition A1 of Li et al. (2018a). By Theorem 1, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\rho_{m} \\epsilon_{1}^{(m)} \\mid\\{\\varphi=1\\}+\\sqrt{1-\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\rho_{m}^{2}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{0} \\sim \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\epsilon_{i_{m}}^{(m)} \\mid\\{\\varphi=1\\}+\\sqrt{1-\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\rho_{m}^{2}} \\cdot \\epsilon_{0}}\n$$\n\nfor $1 \\leq i_{m} \\leq k_{m}, 1 \\leq m \\leq M$. Because each $\\epsilon_{i_{m}}^{(m)}$ is symmetric around 0 , we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{var}_{\\lim }\\left(v^{-1 / 2} \\widehat{\\tau} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right) & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\frac{\\rho_{m}^{2}}{k_{m}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[\\sum_{1 \\leq i_{m} \\leq k_{m}}\\left(\\epsilon_{i_{m}}^{(m)}\\right)^{2} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]+\\left(1-\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\rho_{m}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\frac{\\rho_{m}^{2}}{k_{m}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[D_{m} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]+\\left(1-\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\rho_{m}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) The completeness of $\\mathcal{C}_{M}^{*}$ follows from Theorem 2. With positive weights $\\pi_{1}, \\ldots, \\pi_{M}$, we can also apply Theorem 2 to have\n\n$$\n\\varphi^{*}=I\\left(\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} D_{m} \\leq a\\right)\n$$\n\nis admissible for minimizing $\\left\\{\\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[D_{m} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}$, provided that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\varphi^{*}=1\\right)=p$. It remains to generalize the conclusion to non-negative weights. If all weights are 0 , the acceptance probability is either 1 or 0 , which are both trivial cases. Suppose that the positive weights are $\\pi_{j_{1}}, \\ldots, \\pi_{j_{L}}$ for $1 \\leq L<M$. Applying Theorem 2, for minimizing $\\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} \\pi_{j_{\\ell}} D_{j_{\\ell}} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]$,\n\n$$\n\\varphi^{* *}=I\\left(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} \\pi_{j_{\\ell}} D_{j_{\\ell}} \\leq a\\right)\n$$\n\nis admissible, provided that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\varphi^{* *}=1\\right)=p$. Moreover, a necessary condition for any balance criterion $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{C}_{M}$ being admissible for minimizing $\\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} \\pi_{j_{\\ell}} D_{j_{\\ell}} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]$ is that $\\varphi=\\varphi^{* *}$ almost surely. Therefore, if any balance criterion $\\varphi^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{M}$ dominates $\\varphi^{* *}$\n\nin minimizing $\\left\\{\\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[D_{m} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]\\right\\}_{m=1}^{M}$, it must have no larger conditional expectation than $\\mathbb{E}_{\\lim }\\left[\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} \\pi_{j_{\\ell}} D_{j_{\\ell}} \\mid \\varphi=1\\right]$, which leads to $\\varphi^{\\prime}=\\varphi^{* *}$ almost surely, a contradiction.\n(iii) The acceptance region defined by any balance criterion in $\\mathcal{C}_{M}^{*}$ is a pyramid defined by\n\n$$\n\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\pi_{m} D_{m} \\leq a, \\quad D_{m} \\geq 0(1 \\leq m \\leq M), \\quad \\text { a.s.. }\n$$\n\nHowever, the acceptance region defined by $\\prod_{m=1}^{M} I\\left(D_{m} \\leq a_{m}\\right)$ is a rectangular region, which differs from any balance criterion in $\\mathcal{C}_{M}^{*}$ by a non-zero probability measure.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}], "id": "2402.11336v2", "authors": ["Zhen Zhong", "Donald B.
