INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this paper, we study higher complex Sobolev spaces which extend the notion of complex Sobolev space introduced earlier by Dinh-Sibony in [DS06a]. The complex Sobolev space has been systematically studied by Vigny in [Vig07]. The key observation is that this space takes into account the complex structure of the ambient space and is stable under holomorphic transformations; thus, one could view it as a tailored version of the classical Sobolev space to the complex setting. As a consequence, this functional space plays a key role in complex dynamics and it leads to many fruitful applications in this field (e.g., see [BD24, DKW21, DS06a, DTV10, Vig15, Vu20]). Not limited to the theory of complex dynamics, the complex Sobolev spaces also find applications in other fields of mathematics. For example, in the study of the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, this space has been used as a test space to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for whether a given measure is a Monge-Amp\u00e8re measure with H\u00f6lder potentials (see [DKN22, DMV23]). Moreover, it has recently found applications in studying geometric estimates for (singular) K\u00e4hler metrics (see [Vu23, Vu24, DNV25]).\n\nThe classical Sobolev spaces $W^{n, p}$ are important tools in studying differential equations and are usually used as weak solution spaces for many fundamental equations. An important fact is that when $n$ and $p$ go to infinity, the solution gains more regularity and becomes the classical solution.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Date: April 14, 2025.\n\nWe study higher complex Sobolev spaces in both local (i.e., on bounded domains of $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$ ) and global (i.e., on compact K\u00e4hler manifolds) settings. Let $\\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$, we denote by $\\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)$ the set of plurisubharmonic (psh) functions in $\\Omega$. Let $(X, \\omega)$ be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold of dimension $k$, we denote by $\\operatorname{QPSH}(X)$ the set of quasiplurisubharmonic (qpsh) functions on $X$. These functions are locally given as the sum of a smooth and a plurisubharmonic function. We also denote by $\\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega)$ the set of $\\omega$-plurisubharmonic ( $\\omega$-psh) functions on $X$, i.e., the set of qpsh functions $\\varphi$ such that $\\omega+d d^{c} \\varphi \\geq 0$.\n\nDefinition 1.1 (Higher complex Sobolev spaces). For $q \\geq 1$, we define inductively $q$-complex Sobolev spaces $W_{q}^{*}$ as follows\n(1) (local setting) $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$ is the set of all functions $\\varphi \\in W^{1,2}(\\Omega)$ such that $d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq$ $d d^{c} \\psi$ for some $\\psi \\in W_{q-1}^{*}(\\Omega) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)(\\psi \\in \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)$ when $q=1)$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} d d^{c} \\psi \\wedge\\left(d d^{c}|z|^{2}\\right)^{k-1}<\\infty\n$$\n\n(2) (global setting) $W_{q}^{*}(X)$ is the set of all functions $\\varphi \\in W^{1,2}(X)$ such that $d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq$ $c_{\\varphi} \\omega+d d^{c} \\psi$ for some constant $c_{\\varphi} \\geq 0$ and $\\psi \\in W_{q-1}^{*}(X) \\cap \\operatorname{QPSH}(X)(\\psi \\in \\operatorname{QPSH}(X)$ when $q=1$ ).\n\nIn Section 2, we will introduce some notions and technical tools to study these functional spaces. In particular, using techniques in [DS06a, Vig07], we will build a quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ on $W_{q}^{*}$ which makes $W_{q}^{*}$ a quasi-Banach space sharing many properties with $W_{1}^{*}$. After that, we will prove some basic properties of these spaces and consider some specific examples. Moreover, we also introduce a family of functional capacities and show that all these capacities characterize pluripolar sets, similarly to how the original $W_{1}^{*}$-functional capacity does ([Vig07]).\n\nIn Section 3, we will prove the Moser-Trudinger inequalities for these higher complex Sobolev spaces. An important point in our results is that the exponent in the MoserTrudinger inequalities goes to infinity when $q$ goes to infinity. It follows that when $q$ grows, our spaces will gain more regularity and get closer to the bounded functions space.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let $q \\geq 1, \\alpha \\in\\left[1,2^{q}\\right)$ and $K$ be a compact subset of the unit ball $\\mathbb{B}$ of $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$. Let $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}$ be psh functions on $\\mathbb{B}$ which are H\u00f6lder continuous of H\u00f6lder exponent $\\beta$ for some $\\beta \\in(0,1)$ with $\\left\\|v_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathscr{C} \\beta} \\leq 1$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq k$. Let $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ such that $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$. Then there exist strictly positive constants $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ depending on $K, \\alpha$, and $\\beta$ but independent of $\\varphi, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{K} e^{c_{1}|\\varphi|^{\\alpha}} d d^{c} v_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} v_{k} \\leq c_{2}\n$$\n\nIn particular, there exist strictly positive constants $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ depending on $K$ and $\\alpha$ such that for every $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\int_{K} e^{c_{1}|\\varphi|^{\\alpha}}\\left(d d^{c}|z|^{2}\\right)^{k} \\leq c_{2}\n$$\n\nNote that two functions in $W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ are equal if they are equal almost everywhere. By [VV23, Theorem 1.1] (see also [DMV23]), for every function $\\varphi$ in $W_{1}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ (and thus\n\n$W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ ), all points are Lebesgue except for points in some pluripolar set. Therefore, by considering the canonical values of $\\varphi$ at its Lebesgue points, the first integral in the theorem makes sense, as $d d^{c} v_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} v_{k}$ has no mass on pluripolar sets. Throughout this paper, we always use the canonical values of $\\varphi$ as above.\n\nThe Moser-Trudinger inequality for $W_{1}^{*}$ was proven in [DMV23] by using the slicing method. Recently, in [VV23], alongside the main goal of proving that the complement of the Lebesgue point set of functions in $W_{1}^{*}$ is pluripolar, Vigny-Vu obtained a version of the Moser-Trudinger inequality for $W_{1}^{*}$ that corresponds to the last assertion of Theorem 1.2 for $q=1$. For $\\varphi \\in W_{1}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$, their strategy was to bound $|\\varphi|^{\\alpha}$ by some psh function which allows them to use Skoda's integrability theorem. The construction of the psh bound is motivated by the proof of Josefson's theorem (see [Jos78]). Following their strategy, we construct the psh bound for $|\\varphi|^{\\alpha}$ where $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ (see Theorem 3.7 below) and deduce Theorem 1.2 by using a singular version of Skoda's integrability theorem that has been obtained in [DNS10] (see also [Kau17]).\n\nIn Section 4, we will discuss the connection of the higher complex Sobolev spaces to the theory of complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation. In the global setting, the class $\\mathcal{E}(X, \\omega)$, introduced by Guedj-Zeriahi in [GZ07], is the largest class of $\\omega$-psh functions on which the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator is well defined and the comparison principle is valid. We will show that $\\omega$-psh functions with bounded $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$-norm belong to this space for every $q \\geq 1$. Furthermore, among the subsets of $\\mathcal{E}(X, \\omega)$, the finite energy classes $\\mathcal{E}^{p}(X, \\omega)$ have important applications in the variational approach to complex MongeAmp\u00e8re equation (see [BBGZ13]). In [DGL21], the authors proved a Moser-Trudinger inequality for functions in $\\mathcal{E}^{p}(X, \\omega)$. The crucial point here is that the exponent in their Moser-Trudinger inequality is $1+p / k$ which converges to infinity as $p$ goes to infinity. This similar property with our space $W_{q}^{*}(X)$ motivated us to study if $W_{q}^{*}(X) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega)$ is contained in some $\\mathcal{E}^{p(q)}$ with $p(q)$ increasing to infinity when $q$ goes to infinity. It turns out we can choose $p(q)=q-1$.\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let $(X, \\omega)$ be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold. Then we have the following inclusions:\n(1) $W_{q}^{*}(X) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega) \\subset \\mathcal{E}(X, \\omega)$ for $q \\geq 1$,\n(2) $W_{q}^{*}(X) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega) \\subset \\mathcal{E}^{q-1}(X, \\omega)$ for $q \\geq 2$.\n\nWe prove this theorem by induction, relying on estimates around energy functionals.\nIn the local setting, the domain of definition of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator $\\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$ has been well understood after the works of Cegrell ([Ceg04]) and B\u0142ocki ([B\u0142o06]). Recall that by [B\u0142o06, Theorem 1.1], a function $\\varphi$ belongs to $\\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$ if $\\varphi$ is a negative psh function on $\\Omega$ and for every $z \\in \\Omega$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $z$ in $\\Omega$ and a sequence $\\left\\{\\varphi_{n}\\right\\}$ of smooth negative psh functions such that the sequences\n\n$$\n\\left|\\varphi_{n}\\right|^{k-p-2} d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n} \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi_{n}\\right)^{p} \\wedge\\left(d d^{c}|z|^{2}\\right)^{k-p-1}, \\quad p=0, \\ldots, k-2\n$$\n\nare locally weakly bounded in $U$. Under this hypothesis, it is possible to define the Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator $\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi\\right)^{k}$ in a satisfactory way (in the sense that we have the continuity of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator under decreasing psh approximations). It has been proved in [B\u0142o04] that in $\\mathbb{C}^{2}, W_{\\text {loc }}^{1,2} \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega) \\subset \\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$. Thus, the result holds for $W_{1, \\text { loc }}^{*}$, where $W_{1, \\text { loc }}^{*}$ is the set of functions that locally are functions in $W_{1}^{*}$. Our next\n\ntheorem generalizes this fact by showing that the Monge-Amp\u00e8re operator $\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi\\right)^{k}$ is well-defined in the sense of Cegrell-B\u0142ocki for psh locally $q$-complex Sobolev functions when $q \\geq k-1$.\n\nTheorem 1.4. $W_{q, \\text { loc }}^{*}(\\Omega) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega) \\subset \\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$ for $q \\geq k-1$.\nWe prove this theorem by induction, relying on the condition 1.1.\nAcknowledgments.

Quasinorms and compactness. We now define some norms and quasinorms on $W_{q}^{*}$. First, we consider the local setting. Let $\\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$ and $\\varphi \\in$ $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$. Then by definition, there exist psh functions $\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}$ in $\\Omega$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|d d^{c} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|<\\infty \\text { and } d \\varphi_{j-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{j-1} \\leq d d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\text { for all } j=1, \\ldots, q\n$$\n\nHere we put $\\varphi_{0}:=\\varphi$. We call a sequence $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ satisfying (2.1) is a defining sequence of $\\varphi$ in $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$. We define the $q$-star quasinorm for $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)}:=\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{2}(\\Omega)}+\\inf \\left\\{\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{c} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all defining sequence $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ of $\\varphi$. It is easy to see that one can replace inf by min in the definition (2.2).\n\nNext, we consider the global setting. Let $(X, \\omega)$ be a compact K\u00e4hler manifold of dimension $k$ and $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X)$. Then by definition, there exist qpsh functions $\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}$ in $X$ and constants $c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{q} \\geq 0$ such that\n\n$$\nd \\varphi_{j-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{j-1} \\leq c_{j} \\omega+d d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\text { for all } j=1, \\ldots, q\n$$\n\nHere we put $\\varphi_{0}:=\\varphi$. We call a sequence $\\left(\\left(c_{1}, \\varphi_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(c_{q}, \\varphi_{q}\\right)\\right)$ satisfying (2.3) is a defining sequence of $\\varphi$ in $W_{q}^{*}(X)$. We define the $q$-star norm for $W^{*}(X)$ as follows\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(X)}:=\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{2}(X)}+\\inf \\left\\{\\sum_{j=1}^{q} c_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all defining sequence $\\left(\\left(c_{1}, \\varphi_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(c_{q}, \\varphi_{q}\\right)\\right)$ of $\\varphi$. As in the local case, one can replace inf by min in the definition (2.4). We note also that by Poincar\u00e9-Wirtinger inequality, if we replace $L^{2}$ in the definition of $\\|\\cdot\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(X)}$ by $L^{1}$, we obtain an equivalent quasinorm. In the sequel, for simplicity, we will use the notation\n\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ instead of $\\|\\cdot\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)}$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(X)}$ when there is no possible confusion of the domain.\n\nProposition 2.1. The function $\\varphi \\mapsto\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}$ defines a quasinorm on $W_{q}^{*}$.\nProof. We begin with the local setting. We first check the homogeneity. Let $\\psi=\\lambda \\varphi$, then $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ is a defining sequence for $\\varphi$ iff $\\left(|\\lambda|^{2} \\varphi_{1}, \\ldots,|\\lambda|^{2^{q}} \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ is a defining sequence for $\\psi$. Hence, $\\|\\psi\\|_{*, q}=|\\lambda|\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}$.\n\nWe now only need to check the quasi-triangle inequality. Let $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ be functions in $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$ where $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\psi_{1}, \\ldots, \\psi_{q}\\right)$ are two corresponding defining sequences. Put $f=\\varphi+\\psi$. We claim that $\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{q}\\right)$, with $f_{j}=\\frac{4^{2^{j-1}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{j}+\\psi_{j}\\right)$, is a defining sequence of $f$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}} \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe prove it by induction on $q$. For $q=1$, we have\n\n$$\nd f \\wedge d^{\\circ} f=d \\varphi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\varphi+d \\psi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\psi+\\left(d \\varphi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\psi+d \\psi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\varphi\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that\n\n$$\nd \\varphi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\psi+d \\psi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\varphi \\leq d \\varphi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\varphi+d \\psi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\psi\n$$\n\nThis implies that $d f \\wedge d^{\\circ} f \\leq 2\\left(d \\varphi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\varphi+d \\psi \\wedge d^{\\circ} \\psi\\right) \\leq d d^{\\circ}\\left(2 \\varphi_{1}+2 \\psi_{1}\\right)$. Then for $f_{1}=$ $2\\left(\\varphi_{1}+\\psi_{1}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\nd f \\wedge d^{\\circ} f \\leq d d^{\\circ} f_{1} \\text { and }\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{1}\\right\\|^{1 / 2} \\leq \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{1}\\right\\|^{1 / 2}+\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{1}\\right\\|^{1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence, the proof for $q=1$ is complete.\nNow, we assume that the desired property is true for $q-1$ where $q \\geq 2$. We have $f_{q-1}=$ $\\frac{4^{2^{q-2}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{q-1}+\\psi_{q-1}\\right)$. It thus follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the definition of defining sequences that\n\n$$\nd f_{q-1} \\wedge d^{\\circ} f_{q-1} \\leq \\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2} d d^{\\circ}\\left(\\varphi_{q}+\\psi_{q}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen for $f_{q}=\\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{q}+\\psi_{q}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\nd f_{q-1} \\wedge d^{\\circ} f_{q-1} \\leq d d^{\\circ} f_{q} \\text { and }\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}} \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, by the induction hypothesis, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}} & =\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} f_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}} \\\\\n& \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q-1}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right) \\\\\n& +2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{\\circ} \\psi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas desired.\n\nNext, we consider the global setting. The homogeneity is clear. Now let $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ be functions in $W_{q}^{*}(X)$ where $\\left(\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\varphi_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\alpha_{q}, \\varphi_{q}\\right)\\right)$ and $\\left(\\left(\\beta_{1}, \\psi_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\beta_{q}, \\psi_{q}\\right)\\right)$ are corresponding defining sequences. Let $f=\\varphi+\\psi$. As in the local case, it is sufficient to prove that $\\left(\\left(\\gamma_{1}, f_{1}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\gamma_{q}, f_{q}\\right)\\right)$, with $\\gamma_{j}=\\frac{4^{q^{j-1}}}{2}\\left(\\alpha_{j}+\\beta_{j}\\right)$ and $f_{j}=\\frac{4^{q^{j-1}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{j}+\\psi_{j}\\right)$, is a defining sequence of $f$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\gamma_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}} \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\alpha_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\beta_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe prove it by induction on $q$. For $q=1$, the same computation as in the local case gives\n\n$$\nd f \\wedge d^{c} f \\leq\\left(2 \\alpha_{1}+2 \\beta_{1}\\right) \\omega+d d^{c}\\left(2 \\varphi_{1}+2 \\psi_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen for $\\gamma_{1}=2\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\beta_{1}\\right)$ and $f_{1}=2\\left(\\varphi_{1}+\\psi_{1}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\nd f \\wedge d^{c} f \\leq \\gamma_{1} \\omega+d d^{c} f_{1} \\text { and } \\gamma_{1}^{1 / 2} \\leq \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\alpha_{1}^{1 / 2}+\\beta_{1}^{1 / 2}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis finishes the proof for $q=1$. Now we assume that the desired property is true for $q-1$ where $q \\geq 2$. We have $\\gamma_{q-1}=\\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2}\\left(\\alpha_{q-1}+\\beta_{q-1}\\right)$ and $f_{q-1}=\\frac{4^{2^{q-2}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{q-1}+\\psi_{q-1}\\right)$. It thus follows from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the definition of defining sequences that\n\n$$\nd f_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} f_{q-1} \\leq \\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2}\\left(\\alpha_{q}+\\beta_{q}\\right) \\omega+\\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2} d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi_{q}+\\psi_{q}\\right)\n$$\n\nThen for $\\gamma_{q}=\\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2}\\left(\\alpha_{q}+\\beta_{q}\\right)$ and $f_{q}=\\frac{4^{2^{q-1}}}{2}\\left(\\varphi_{q}+\\psi_{q}\\right)$, we have\n\n$$\nd f_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} f_{q-1} \\leq \\gamma_{q} \\omega+d d^{c} f_{q} \\text { and } \\gamma_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}} \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt thus follows from the induction hypothesis that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\gamma_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}} & =\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1} \\gamma_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\gamma_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}} \\\\\n& \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q-1}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1} \\alpha_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q-1} \\beta_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right)+2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq 2^{1-1 / 2^{q}}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\alpha_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\beta_{j}^{1 / 2^{j}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas desired.

Assume that the claim is true for $q=1$ where $q \\geq 2$. We have $f_{q-1}:=(1+c)^{2^{q-1}-1} \\varphi_{q-1}+(1+1 / c)^{2^{q-1}-1} \\psi_{q-1}$. Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd f_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} f_{q-1} & \\leq(1+c)(1+c)^{2^{q}-2} d \\varphi_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{q-1} \\\\\n& +(1+1 / c)(1+1 / c)^{2^{q}-2} d \\psi_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\psi_{q-1} \\\\\n& \\leq d d^{c}\\left((1+c)^{2^{q}-1} \\varphi_{q}+(1+1 / c)^{2^{q}-1} \\psi_{q}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe claim follows.\nWe now put $\\left\\|d d^{c} \\varphi_{q}\\right\\|=\\alpha_{q},\\left\\|d d^{c} \\psi_{q}\\right\\|=\\beta_{q}$ and choose $c:=\\left(\\beta_{q} / \\alpha_{q}\\right)^{1 / 2^{q}}$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|d d^{c} f_{q}\\right\\| & =\\left((1+c)^{2^{q}-1} \\alpha_{q}+(1+1 / c)^{2^{q}-1} \\beta_{q}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right)^{2^{q}-1} \\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\left(\\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right)^{2^{q}-1} \\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\alpha_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\beta_{q}^{1 / 2^{q}}\\right)^{2^{q}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTaking the power $2^{-q}$, we get $\\left\\|d d^{c} f_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}} \\leq\\left\\|d d^{c} \\varphi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}+\\left\\|d d^{c} \\psi_{q}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{q}}$ as desired.\nProposition 2.3. Let $K$ be a relatively compact subset of $\\Omega$. Then there exists a constant $C$ depending only on $K$ and $\\Omega$ such that $C\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(K)} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{* *, q} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}$.\nProof. The second inequality is clear. For the first inequality, let $\\chi$ be a cut-off function with compact support in $\\Omega$ such that $\\chi \\equiv 1$ on $K$. Let $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}$ and $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ be a defining sequence that minimize (2.5). By Stokes' formula and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{K} d d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1} & \\leq \\int_{\\Omega} \\chi d d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}=\\left|\\int_{\\Omega} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\chi \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\cdot\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} d \\varphi_{j} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)^{1 / 2} \\\\\n& \\leq C\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} d d^{c} \\varphi_{j+1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor $1 \\leq j<q$. The result follows.\nRemark 2.4. It is natural to consider the quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ since it takes information of all the elements in the defining sequence. Proposition 2.3 implies that if we only need to control the data in a compact subset, then we can construct a norm $(\\|\\cdot\\|_{* *, q})$ equivalent to the quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$. Moreover, Theorem 1.2 is still true if we replace $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ by $\\|\\cdot\\|_{* *, q}$.\n\nHowever, it is not true in the global setting because one cannot bound $c_{j}$ by some constant times $c_{j+1}$ (this is a different point in the global setting). It is interesting to know if we can build a norm in $W_{q}^{*}$ equivalent to $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$. When $q \\geq 2$, since the mass of elements in the defining sequence can be chosen independently with each other (one can consider the 1-dimensional case to see why), it seems to us that such a norm does not exist.\nRemark 2.5. Note that when the domain $\\Omega$ is nice (e.g., convex domain), we have $W_{1}^{*}=$ $W^{*}$. This restriction is from the fact that we cannot solve the equation $d d^{c} \\varphi=T$ in every domain. We also note that the spaces $W_{q}^{*}$ is decreasing in $q$.\n\nBy using induction on $q$ and the idea of [Vig07, Proposition 4], it is easy to prove that $W_{q}^{*}$ has the following compactness property.\nProposition 2.6. Let $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ be a bounded sequence in $W_{q}^{*}$. Then there exists a subsequence $\\left(\\varphi_{n_{j}}\\right)$ and a function $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}$ such that $\\varphi_{n_{j}}$ converges weakly to $\\varphi$ in $W^{1,2}$ and $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq$ $\\lim _{j \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\varphi_{n_{j}}\\right\\|_{*, q}$.\n\nNow, we prove that with the quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}, W_{q}^{*}$ is a quasi-Banach space.\nProposition 2.7. $W_{q}^{*}$ endowed with the quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ is a quasi-Banach space.\nProof. We prove by induction on $q$. For $q=1$, this is a slight modification of [Vig07, Proposition 1]. Suppose that $W_{q-1}^{*}$ is a quasi-Banach space endowed with the quasinorm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q-1}$ for $q \\geq 2$. Let $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $W_{q}^{*}$, then it is also a Cauchy sequence in $W_{q-1}^{*}$. Thus it converges to a function $\\varphi \\in W_{q-1}^{*}$. For every $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that for $m, n>N$, we have $d\\left(\\varphi_{n}-\\varphi_{m}\\right) \\wedge d^{c}\\left(\\varphi_{n}-\\varphi_{m}\\right) \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{n, m}$, where $\\psi_{n, m}$ is a function with $\\left\\|\\psi_{n, m}\\right\\|_{*, q-1}<\\varepsilon$. By Proposition 2.6, we can find a subsequence of $\\left(\\psi_{n, m}\\right)_{n}$ which converges weakly in $W^{1,2}$ to a function $\\psi_{m}$ such that $d\\left(\\varphi-\\varphi_{m}\\right) \\wedge d^{c}\\left(\\varphi-\\varphi_{m}\\right) \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{m}$ and $\\left\\|\\psi_{m}\\right\\|_{*, q-1} \\leq \\varepsilon$. Thus, $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}$ and $\\varphi_{n} \\rightarrow \\varphi$ in $W_{q}^{*}$.\nRemark 2.8. We can prove that $W_{q}^{*}$ endowed with the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{*, q}$ is a Banach space by using similar arguments in the proof of Proposition 2.7.\n2.2. Examples. We now give specific examples for the functions in $W_{q}^{*}$.\n\nExample 2.9. Let $\\varphi$ be a psh function in $\\Omega$. Assume that $\\varphi$ satisfies the following condition\n\n$$\nd \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq r d d^{c} \\varphi\n$$\n\nfor some $r>0$. Then it is clear by induction that $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$ for all $q$. Condition (2.7) was introduced in [DF83] and has many applications in studying the Bergman kernel of $\\Omega$ (see, for example, [BC00, B\u0142o13]).\nExample 2.10. Let $\\varphi$ be an $\\omega$-psh function in a compact K\u00e4hler manifold $(X, \\omega)$. If $\\varphi$ is bounded (assume that $0 \\leq \\varphi \\leq 1$ ), then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi=d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi^{2}\\right) / 2-\\varphi d d^{c} \\varphi \\leq \\omega+d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi^{2}\\right) / 2 \\\\\nd\\left(\\varphi^{2} / 2\\right) \\wedge d^{c}\\left(\\varphi^{2} / 2\\right)=\\varphi^{2} d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq \\omega+d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi^{2} / 2\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWe can choose $\\left(\\left(1, \\varphi^{2} / 2\\right), \\ldots,\\left(1, \\varphi^{2} / 2\\right)\\right)$ to be a defining sequence for $\\varphi$. Hence $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X)$ for all $q$ and we have the inclusion $\\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega) \\cap L^{\\infty} \\subset \\cap_{q} W_{q}^{*}(X)$.\n\nIf $\\varphi$ is unbounded (assume that $\\varphi \\leq-1$ ). Let $\\psi=-\\log (-\\varphi)$. We have\n\n$$\nd \\psi \\wedge d^{c} \\psi=\\frac{d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi}{|\\varphi|^{2}} \\text { and } d d^{c} \\psi=-\\frac{d d^{c} \\varphi}{\\varphi}+\\frac{d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi}{|\\varphi|^{2}}\n$$\n\nThis implies that $d \\psi \\wedge d^{c} \\psi=d d^{c} \\psi+d d^{c} \\varphi / \\varphi \\leq d d^{c} \\psi+\\omega$. We can choose $((1, \\psi), \\ldots,(1, \\psi))$ to be a defining sequence for $\\psi$. Therefore, $\\psi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X)$ for all q. See also [DS06a, Lemma 4.2] and [Vig07, Example 1].\n\nExample 2.11. It has been observed in [Vig07, Section 2.3] (see also [DS06a, Proposition 4.1]) that if $\\varphi, \\psi \\in W_{q}^{*}$, then\n\n$$\nd \\max (\\varphi, \\psi) \\wedge d^{c} \\max (\\varphi, \\psi)+d \\min (\\varphi, \\psi) \\wedge d^{c} \\min (\\varphi, \\psi) \\leq d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi_{1}+\\psi_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{1}, \\psi_{1}$ are functions in $W_{q-1}^{*}$ such that $d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq d d^{c} \\varphi_{1}$ and $d \\psi \\wedge d^{c} \\psi \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{1}$. So, both $\\max (\\varphi, \\psi)$ and $\\min (\\varphi, \\psi)$ belong to $W_{q}^{*}$ and\n\n$$\n\\|\\max (\\varphi, \\psi)\\|_{* q} \\leq 2\\left(\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}+\\|\\psi\\|_{*, q}\\right) \\text { and }\\|\\min (\\varphi, \\psi)\\|_{*, q} \\leq 2\\left(\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}+\\|\\psi\\|_{*, q}\\right)\n$$\n\nExample 2.12. The following example is a higher version of [Vig07, Example 2]. Let $\\varphi$ be the function defined by $-\\left(-\\log \\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\alpha}$ in the unit ball $\\mathbb{B}$ of $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$. Then\n\n$$\ni \\partial \\varphi \\wedge \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=\\frac{i d z_{1} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{1}}{\\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\left(-\\log \\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{2-2 \\alpha}}\n$$\n\nLet $\\psi=-\\left(-\\log \\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{2 \\alpha}$. We have\n\n$$\n\\bar{\\partial} \\psi=2 \\alpha\\left(-\\log \\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{2 \\alpha-1} \\frac{1}{\\bar{z}_{1}} d \\bar{z}_{1}, \\quad i \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\psi=2 \\alpha(1-2 \\alpha) \\frac{i d z_{1} \\wedge d \\bar{z}_{1}}{\\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\left(-\\log \\left|z_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{2-2 \\alpha}}\n$$\n\nThis implies that\n\n$$\ni \\partial \\varphi \\wedge \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi=\\frac{1}{2 \\alpha(1-2 \\alpha)} i \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\psi\n$$\n\nBy induction on $q$, we have $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ if and only if $\\alpha<1 / 2^{q}$. This example will be used frequently to distinguish $W_{q}^{*}$ with different $q$ (see also Example 3.8).\n\nExample 2.13. We consider the vanishing mean oscillation (VMO) property of functions in $W_{q}^{*}$. We highlight that this kind of property plays an important role in [DNV25].\n\nLet $u$ be a subharmonic function in $W^{1,2}(U)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{C}$. Then for any ball $B \\subset U$, by Poincar\u00e9-Sobolev inequality, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|B|} \\int_{B}\\left|u-m_{B}(u)\\right| \\leq c\\left(\\int_{B}|\\nabla u|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}\n$$\n\nwhere $c$ is a constant not depending on $u$ and $B$. Letting the radius of $B$ goes to zero, we deduce that $\\varphi$ is a VMO function. Thus, as pointed out in [BW24, Theorem 1.1], u must have zero Lelong number at every point of $U$.\n\nLet $\\varphi$ be a psh function in $W_{1}^{*}(\\Omega)$. By the slicing method (see [DMV23]) and Siu's theorem (see [Dem, Chapter. III (7.13)]), $\\varphi$ must have zero Lelong number at every point of $\\Omega$. By the remark after [Vig07, Proposition 6], we deduce that $W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$ is a VMO space for every $q>1$. The same result holds in the global setting. In fact, as we will see in Theorem 1.3, if $\\varphi \\in W_{1}^{*}(X) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega)$, then $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{E}(X, \\omega)$. And it is well known that functions in $\\mathcal{E}(X, \\omega)$ have zero Lelong numbers at every point.\n2.3. Density theorems. We now prove density theorems for $W_{q}^{*}$. The approximate sequences have been constructed in [Vig07], and we use the same construction for our spaces.\n\nFirst, we consider the local case. We have the following result.\n\nTheorem 2.14. Let $K$ be a relatively compact subset of $\\Omega$ and $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)$. Then there exists a sequence of smooth functions $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ converges to $\\varphi$ in $W^{1,2}(K)$. Moreover, we have\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(K)} \\leq \\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\varphi_{n}\\right\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(K)} \\leq\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{q}^{*}(\\Omega)}\n$$\n\nProof. Take $\\chi$ to be a non-negative smooth radial function with compact support in $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$ such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{C}^{k}} \\chi=1$ and define $\\chi_{\\varepsilon}(z)=\\varepsilon^{-2 k} \\chi(z / \\varepsilon)$. Put $\\varphi_{\\varepsilon}=\\varphi * \\chi_{\\varepsilon}$, then $\\varphi_{\\varepsilon}$ is well-defined in $K$ when $\\varepsilon$ is small enough. Let $\\psi \\in W_{q-1}^{*}(\\Omega) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)$ such that $d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq d d^{c} \\psi$. Let $\\left(\\varepsilon_{n}\\right)_{n}$ be a sequence decreasing to zero. Define $\\varphi_{n}=\\varphi_{\\varepsilon_{n}}, \\psi_{n}=\\psi * \\chi_{\\varepsilon_{n}}$. By [Vig07, Lemma 5], we have $d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n} \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{n}$.\n\nNow, let $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ be a defining sequence for $\\varphi$ and put $\\varphi_{n, j}=\\varphi_{j} * \\chi_{\\varepsilon_{n}}$ for $j=$ $1, \\ldots, q$. By induction, $\\left(\\varphi_{n, 1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{n, q}\\right)$ is a defining sequence for $\\varphi_{n}$. Moreover, we also have\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_{K} d d^{c} \\varphi_{n, j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1} \\leq \\int_{\\Omega} d d^{c} \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1} \\text { for } j=1, \\ldots, q\n$$\n\nIt follows that $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ is a bounded sequence in $W_{q}^{*}(K)$. Thus, by Proposition 2.6, there exists a subsequence $\\left(\\varphi_{n_{m}}\\right)$ converges to $\\varphi$ in $W^{1,2}(K)$ and satisfies the first inequality. By (2.8), this sequence also satisfies the second inequality. The proof is complete.\n\nWe now consider the case of compact K\u00e4hler manifolds. We have the following result.\nTheorem 2.15. Let $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X)$. Then there exists a sequence of smooth functions $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ such that $\\varphi_{n}$ converges to $\\varphi$ weakly in $W^{1,2}(X)$. Moreover, there is a constant $c$ that does not depend on $\\varphi$ such that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\left\\|\\varphi_{n}\\right\\|_{*, q} \\leq c\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}$.\n\nProof. The proof is similar to [Vig07, Theorem 10] (see also [DNV25, Theorem 2.2] for a stronger version) so we only sketch it and refer the reader to cited papers for more details. Recall that by [DS04], there exist two sequences $\\left(K_{n}^{+}\\right),\\left(K_{n}^{-}\\right)$of positive closed $(k, k)$ currents in $X \\times X$ such that $K_{n}:=K_{n}^{+}-K_{n}^{-}$converges to the current of integration on the diagonal of $X \\times X$. These currents are smooth outside the diagonal and $\\left\\|K_{n}^{ \\pm}(\\cdot, y)\\right\\|_{L^{1}} \\leq A$ where $A$ is a constant that depends only on $(X, \\omega)$.\n\nConsider $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X)$ and put\n\n$$\n\\varphi_{n}(x)=\\int_{y \\in X} \\varphi(y) K_{n}(x, y)\n$$\n\nLet $\\psi$ be the function in $W_{q-1}^{*}(X)$ such that $d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi \\leq c(\\omega+d d^{c} \\psi)$. Then we can bound $d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n}$ by the positive closed current\n\n$$\nc A \\int_{y \\in X}\\left(K_{n}^{+}(x, y)+K_{n}^{-}(x, y)\\right) \\wedge\\left(\\omega+d d^{c} \\psi\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can bound this current by $2 c A^{2}\\left(\\omega+d d^{c} \\psi_{n}\\right)$, where $\\psi_{n}:=\\int_{y \\in X} \\psi(y) K_{n}^{ \\pm}(x, y)$. After iterating this convolution several times, we can make $\\varphi_{n}$ smooth. The result follows by induction on $q$.\n2.4. Functional capacities. Consider the case where $(X, \\omega)$ is a compact K\u00e4hler manifold. Following [Vig07], for a Borel set $E$ in $X$, we define\n\n$$\nL_{q}(E)=\\left\\{\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(X): \\varphi \\leq-1 \\text { a.e on some neighborhood of } E \\text { and } \\varphi \\leq 0 \\text { on } X\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding functional capacity for $W_{q}^{*}$ can be defined as follows\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(E)=\\inf \\left\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}^{2}: \\varphi \\in L_{q}(E)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThese capacities share similar properties with the functional capacity introduced by Vigny in [Vig07]. We list below some important properties. The proofs are modifications of Vigny's proofs in [Vig07].\n\nProposition 2.16. The capacity $\\mathrm{Cap}_{q}$ satisfies the following properties\n(1) for $E \\subset F \\subset X, \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(E) \\leq \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(F)$;\n(2) if $\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ is a sequence of Borel sets in $X, \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(\\cup_{j} E_{j}\\right) \\leq 2 \\sum_{j} \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$;\n(3) $\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(X)=1$ and $\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(E) \\leq 1$ for any $E \\subset X$;\n(4) if $\\left(K_{j}\\right)$ is a decreasing sequence of compact sets, $\\lim _{j \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(K_{j}\\right)=\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(\\cap_{n} K_{j}\\right)$;\n(5) if $\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ is an increasing sequence of Borel sets, $\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(\\cup_{j} E_{j}\\right)=\\lim _{j \\rightarrow \\infty} \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$, that is, $\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}$ is a Choquet capacity.\nProof. We note that, due to Example 2.11, in $W_{q}^{*}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\|\\min (\\varphi, \\psi)\\|_{*, q}^{2} \\leq 8\\left(\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}^{2}+\\|\\psi\\|_{*, q}^{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\left\\|\\mathbf{1}_{X}\\right\\|_{*, q}=1$. We can now follow the proofs of [Vig07, Proposition 27 and Theorem 30] to prove this proposition.\n\nWe now show that $\\mathrm{Cap}_{q}$ also characterizes pluripolar sets.\nTheorem 2.17. There exists a constant $B>0$ such that for all Borel subset $E$ of $X$, we have\n\n$$\nB^{-1} \\operatorname{Cap}_{\\omega}(E) \\leq \\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(E) \\leq B\\left(\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\omega}(E)\\right)^{\\frac{1}{k \\beta^{2}-1}}\n$$\n\nIn particular, $\\operatorname{Cap}_{q}(E)=0$ if and only if $E$ is pluripolar.\nRecall that the capacity $\\mathrm{Cap}_{\\omega}$ was defined by Ko\u0142odziej in [Ko\u014203]. It is related to the well-known Bedford-Taylor capacity ([BT82]), and is defined by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\omega}(E)=\\sup \\left\\{\\int_{E}\\left(\\omega+d d^{c} u\\right)^{k}: u \\in \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega),-1 \\leq u \\leq 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $E$ is a Borel subset of $X$. We refer the reader to [GZ05] for more information on this capacity for local and global settings.\n\nWe also need the following notion of capacity introduced by Dinh-Sibony in [DS06b]. It is related to the capacities of Alexander in [Ale81] and of Siciak in [Sic62], see also [HL06] and [GZ05]. For a Borel subset $E$ of $X$, we consider the function\n\n$$\nV_{E}(x)=\\sup \\{u(x): u \\in \\operatorname{PSH}(X, \\omega) \\text { and } u \\leq 0 \\text { on } E\\}\n$$\n\nThen $V_{E}$ is a non-negative $\\omega$-psh function. Define\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}(E)=\\exp \\left(-\\sup _{X} V_{E}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nRecall from [GZ05, Proposition 6.1] the following relation between $\\mathrm{Cap}_{\\omega}$ and $\\mathcal{J}$.\nLemma 2.18. There is a constant $A>0$ such that for all compact subsets $K$ of $X$, we have\n\n$$\n\\exp \\left(-\\frac{A}{\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\omega}(K)}\\right) \\leq \\mathcal{J}(K) \\leq e \\cdot \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Cap}_{\\omega}(K)^{1 / k}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we can prove Theorem 2.17.\nProof of Theorem 2.17. Due to Example 2.10, if $\\varphi$ is a qpsh function such that $\\varphi<-1$, then the function $\\psi=-\\log (-\\varphi)$ belongs to $W_{q}^{*}$ for all $q$, and $\\psi$ has the same poles set as $\\varphi$. We can now follow the proofs of [Vig07, Proposition 28] to see the first inequality.\n\nWe now consider the second inequality. We closely follow the proof of [DKN22, Proposition 5.1]. We only need to show this inequality for compact regular sets $K \\subset X$ such that $1 \\leq M<\\infty$ where $M:=\\sup _{X} V_{K}(x)$.\n\nDefine $f_{K}(x)=\\left(V_{K}(x)-M\\right) / M$. Then $f_{K}$ is equal -1 on $K$ with $-1 \\leq f_{K} \\leq 0$ and $f_{K}$ is qpsh with $d d^{c} f_{K}+M^{-1} \\omega \\geq 0$. Since $f_{K}$ is a bounded qpsh function, it follows from Example 2.10 that $f_{K} \\in W_{q}^{*}$ for all $q$.\n\nWe now compute $\\left\\|f_{K}\\right\\|_{*, q}$. Direct calculation gives us\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd f_{K} \\wedge d^{c} f_{K}=-f_{K} d d^{c} f_{K}+\\frac{1}{2} d d^{c}\\left(f_{K}^{2}\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\omega}{M}+\\frac{1}{2} d d^{c}\\left(f_{K}^{2}\\right) \\\\\nd\\left(f_{K}^{2} / 2\\right) \\wedge d^{c}\\left(f_{K}^{2} / 2\\right)=\\left(f_{K}^{2}\\right) d f_{K} \\wedge d^{c} f_{K} \\leq d f_{K} \\wedge d^{c} f_{K} \\leq \\frac{\\omega}{M}+\\frac{1}{2} d d^{c}\\left(f_{K}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHence, we can choose $\\left(\\left(M^{-1}, f_{K}^{2} / 2\\right), \\ldots,\\left(M^{-1}, f_{K}^{2} / 2\\right)\\right)$ as a defining sequence for $f_{K}$.

As in [Vig07, Remark 33], one can define $\\mathrm{Cap}_{q}$ in the local case by the same method.

MOSER-Trudinger INEQUALITIES \n\nIn this section, we will follow the strategy in [VV23, Section 2] to construct psh bound for functions in $W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ and prove Theorems 1.2. The key point is that the additional information in the defining sequence will lead to stronger estimates which help us to improve the exponent in the Moser-Trudinger inequalities.\n\n3.1. Set up. As pointed out in Example 2.13, $W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ is a BMO space for every $q$. Therefore, by [JN61], for compact subset $K$ of $\\mathbb{B}$, there are constants $c$ and $A$ such that $\\int_{K} e^{c|\\varphi|} \\omega^{k} \\leq A$ for all $\\varphi$ in $W_{q}^{*}(X)$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$ (this can also be seen as a consequence of [DMV23, Theorem 1.1]). We will use the following consequence of this fact.\nLemma 3.1. Let $K$ be a compact subset of $\\mathbb{B}$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then there exists a constant $c_{1}>0$ such that, for every $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{K}|\\varphi|^{m} \\omega^{k} \\leq c_{1}, \\text { where } \\omega=d d^{c}|z|^{2}\n$$\n\nLet $\\varphi$ be a positive function in $W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$ and $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ be a defining sequence for $\\varphi$ such that\n\n$$\n\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q}=\\|\\varphi\\|_{L^{2}}+\\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\left\\|d d^{c} \\varphi_{j}\\right\\|^{1 / 2^{j}}\n$$\n\nRemark 3.2. Recall that if $\\left(\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}\\right)$ is a defining sequence for $\\varphi$, then $\\left(\\varphi_{1, \\varepsilon}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q, \\varepsilon}\\right)$ is a defining sequence for $\\varphi_{\\varepsilon}$ where $\\varphi_{\\varepsilon}$ is the standard regularization of $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi_{j, \\varepsilon}$ is the standard regularization of $\\varphi_{j}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, q$ (see Theorem 2.14).\n\nWe now provide some constructions similar to [VV23]. The different point is that we use data of the last term $\\varphi_{q}$ in the defining sequence. Suppose that $\\varphi_{q} \\leq 0$. For $n>0$, we define $\\phi_{n}=\\max \\left(\\varphi_{q},-n\\right), h_{n}=1+\\phi_{n} / n, T_{n}=d d^{c}\\left(h_{n}^{2} / 2\\right)$. Then $h_{n} \\in \\operatorname{PSH}(\\mathbb{B}), 0 \\leq h_{n} \\leq 1$, and $h_{n}=0$ on $\\left\\{\\varphi_{q} \\leq-n\\right\\}$. Moreover, $T_{n}$ is a positive closed $(1,1)$-current that vanishes on the open set $\\left\\{\\varphi_{q}<-n\\right\\}$.\n\nWe have the following lemma similar to [VV23, Lemma 2.2].\nLemma 3.3. Assume that $\\varphi_{q-1}$ and $\\varphi_{q}$ are smooth. Then the following inequalities holds:\n(1) $d h_{n} \\wedge d^{c} h_{n} \\leq T_{n}$ and $h_{n} d d^{c} h_{n} \\leq T_{n}$,\n(2) $d \\varphi_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{q-1} \\leq d d^{c} \\phi_{n}$ on $\\left\\{h_{n}>0\\right\\}$,\n(3) $d \\varphi_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{q-1} \\wedge T_{n} \\leq d d^{c} \\phi_{n+1} \\wedge T_{n}$,\n(4) $h_{n} d \\varphi_{q-1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{q-1} \\leq n h_{n} d d^{c} h_{n} \\leq n T_{n}$.\n\nSimilarly to [VV23], for every $m \\in \\mathbb{N}, K \\Subset \\mathbb{B}$, we define the following quantities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nI_{m, p, K} & =\\sup _{v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{p}} \\int_{K} h_{n}^{2} \\varphi^{2 m} d d^{c} v_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} v_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} \\text { for } 0 \\leq p \\leq k \\\\\nJ_{m, p, K} & =\\sup _{v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{p}} \\int_{K} \\varphi^{2 m} T_{n} d d^{c} v_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} v_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p-1} \\text { for } \\leq p \\leq k-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, the supremum taken over all psh functions $v_{j}$ on $\\mathbb{B}$ with $0 \\leq v_{j} \\leq 1$. These quantities can be seen as a higher analogue of the (same notation) quantities in [VV23]. As noted after Theorem 1.2, we use the canonical representative of $\\varphi$ here, and thus all the integrals make sense. Note that all definitions depend on $n$. However, we omit the index $n$ as the estimates in the next section do not depend on $n$.\n3.2. Estimates. We now prove some estimates for these quantities. As noted in the beginning of this section, the additional data in the defining sequence helps us to prove stronger estimates.\n\nLet $K$ be a compact subset of $\\mathbb{B}$. By standard regularization we can assume that $\\varphi, \\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{q}$ are smooth functions in an open neighborhood of $K$. Let $\\chi$ be a smooth\n\ncut-off function such that $\\chi \\equiv 1$ on an open neighborhood of $K$, and $\\chi$ is compactly supported on $B$. In what follows, we use $\\lesssim$ or $\\gtrsim$ to denote $\\leq$ or $\\geq$, respectively, modulo a multiplicative constant independent of $n$ and $\\varphi$ provided $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\kappa, q} \\leq 1$.\n\nWe first obtain the following lemma, which generalizes [VV23, Lemma 2.3].\nLemma 3.4.

Bounding by plurisubharmonic functions. With all these estimates in hand, we can now construct a psh bound for functions in $W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$.\nTheorem 3.7. Let $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}(\\mathbb{B})$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$ and $\\alpha \\in\\left[1,2^{q}\\right)$.

The proof of this theorem is almost line by line with the proof of [VV23, Theorem 1.3] (just change the coefficient form 1 to $q$ ). We only present the construction and refer the reader to the cited paper for details of the proof.\n\nWrite $\\varphi=\\max (\\varphi, 0)+\\min (\\varphi, 0)$, we can assume that $\\varphi \\geq 0$. Fix $\\alpha \\in\\left[1,2^{q}\\right)$ and choose a constant $\\lambda \\in\\left(\\max \\left(2^{\\alpha}, 2^{2^{q-1}}\\right), 2^{2^{q}}\\right)$.

This is our desired function.\nExample 3.8. (Sharpness of the exponential $\\alpha$ ) As in [VV23, page 13], we consider the case where $\\alpha>2^{q}$ and $k=1$. We choose the function $\\varphi$ to be $\\left(-\\log |z|^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2^{q}-\\delta}$ where $\\delta \\in\\left(0,1 / 2^{q}\\right)$. Then by Example 2.12, $\\varphi \\in W_{q}^{*}$. Since $\\alpha>2^{q}$, we can choose $\\delta$ small enough such that $\\beta=\\alpha\\left(1 / 2^{q}-\\delta\\right)>1$. Thus, $\\varphi^{\\alpha}=\\left(-\\log |z|^{2}\\right)^{\\beta}$ and then $e^{c \\varphi^{\\alpha}} \\geq c /|z|^{2}$ which is not locally integrable at 0 in $\\mathbb{C}$. Also, note that by arguments in [VV23], this function is not bounded from above by minus of a subharmonic function. So, the exponential coefficient here as well as the one in Theorem 1.2 cannot be greater than $2^{q}$. It is natural to predict\n\nthat the result still holds for $\\alpha=2^{q}$ (like in the case $q=1$ ), but currently, we do not know how to prove that.\n\nOne can argue similarly to the proof of Theorem 3.7 to obtain the following global version of psh bound.

So $\\varphi \\in \\mathcal{E}^{q-1}(X, \\omega)$ and we complete our proof.\n\nRemark 4.5. The above theorem provides a lower bound for $p(q)$ by $q-1$. From Example 3.8 and [DGL21, Theorem 2.1], we see that $p(q)$ has an upper bound by $k\\left(2^{q}-1\\right)$. It is an interesting question to know which is the best option for $p(q)$. One can also ask if the envelope method in [DGL21] can be used to give a new proof for the Moser-Trudinger inequalities. It has been noted in the beginning of Section 3, as a consequence of bounded mean oscillation property, there are constants $c$ and $A$ such that $\\int_{X} e^{c\\|\\varphi\\|} \\omega^{k} \\leq A$ for all $\\varphi$ in $W_{q}^{*}(X)$ with $\\|\\varphi\\|_{*, q} \\leq 1$. This fact can be used in place of Skoda's integrability theorem in the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [DGL21].\n4.2. Local setting. The following result is the key point in our proof of Theorem 1.4.\n\nProposition 4.6. Let $1 \\leq p \\leq k-1$ and $0 \\leq m \\leq k-p$. Let $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{p+1}$ be integers satisfying $q_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq q_{p+1}, q_{j} \\geq p-1+m$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq p$, and $q_{p} \\leq q_{1}+1$. Let $\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{p+1}$ be negative smooth psh functions on $\\Omega$ such that, for $j=1, \\ldots, p+1,\\left\\|\\varphi_{j}\\right\\|_{*, q_{j}} \\leq 1$. Assume that there exists a defining sequence $\\left(\\varphi_{j, 1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{j, q_{j}}\\right)$ of $\\varphi_{j}$ such that $\\varphi_{j, l}$ is smooth for $l=1, \\ldots, q_{j}$, $\\left\\|\\varphi_{j, l}\\right\\|_{*, q_{j}-l} \\leq 1$ for $l=1, \\ldots, q_{j}-1$ and $\\left\\|\\varphi_{j, q_{j}}\\right\\|_{L^{1}} \\leq 1$. Then for every compact subset $K$ of $\\Omega$, there is a constant $C>0$ depending only on $K, m$ and $p$ such that\n\n$$\n\\int_{K}\\left(-\\varphi_{p+1}\\right)^{m} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} \\leq C \\text { where } \\omega=d d^{c}|z|^{2}\n$$\n\nProof. We prove the result by induction on $p$ and $m$. Fix a compact set $K$ and a cut-off function $\\chi$ on $\\Omega$ such that $0 \\leq \\chi \\leq 1$ and $\\chi=1$ on $K$. In our estimates, $\\lesssim$ denotes $\\leq$ modulo a multiplicative constant depending only on $m$ and $K$.\n\nConsider the case where $p=1$. If $m=0$, then the desired property follows as $\\left\\|\\varphi_{1}\\right\\|_{*, 1} \\leq$ 1. Assume that the desired property is true for $0, \\ldots, m-1$ for some $1 \\leq m \\leq k-p$. We now prove this for $m$. By hypothesis, $q_{2} \\geq q_{1} \\geq m$. Hence, there exist smooth psh\n\nfunctions $\\psi_{1}, \\psi_{2}$ satisfying $\\left\\|\\psi_{1}\\right\\|_{*, m-1} \\leq 1,\\left\\|\\psi_{2}\\right\\|_{*, m-1} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\nd \\varphi_{1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{1}, \\quad d \\varphi_{2} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{2} \\leq d d^{c} \\psi_{2}\n$$\n\nBy Stokes' formula, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{K}\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1} & \\lesssim\\left|\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m-1} d \\varphi_{2} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the first term, by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and inequalities (4.1), we can bound it from above by the square root of\n\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\psi_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\psi_{2} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt follows from the induction hypothesis for $m-1$ that both factors are bounded by a constant depending only on $\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi)$ (and hence only on $K$ ). Hence, the first term of the RHS of inequality (4.2) is bounded by a constant depending only on $K$. For the second term of the RHS of inequality (4.2), by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and inequalities (4.1), we can bound it from above by the square root of\n\n$$\n\\left(\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m+1} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\chi \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)\\left(\\int_{\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi)}\\left(-\\varphi_{2}\\right)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\psi_{1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe use the induction hypothesis for $m-1$ for the second factor. The first factor can be bounded using Corollary 3.1. Hence, the second term of the RHS of inequality (4.2) is bounded by a constant depending only on $K$. The proof for the case $p=1$ is thus complete.\n\nNow, we consider the case where $p>1$. Assume that the desired property is true for $p-1$, where $2 \\leq p \\leq k-1$. We prove that this is true for $p$. Consider the case where $m=0$. We note that\n\n$$\nd d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p}=d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi_{p} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nHence, by Stokes' formula, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{K} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} & \\leq \\int_{\\Omega} \\chi d d^{c}\\left(\\varphi_{p} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1}\\right) \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} \\\\\n& =\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(-\\varphi_{p}\\right) d d^{c} \\chi \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} \\\\\n& \\lesssim \\int_{\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi)}\\left(-\\varphi_{p}\\right) d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe now only need to check that $\\varphi_{1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{p}$ satisfy the induction hypothesis for $p-1$ and $m=1$. This is clear because $q_{p-1} \\leq q_{p} \\leq q_{1}+1$ and $q_{j} \\geq p-1=(p-1)-1+1$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq p-1$. Therefore, we get the statement for $m=0$.\n\nAssume that the statement is true for $0, \\ldots, m-1$, where $1 \\leq m \\leq k-p$. We now prove this for $m$. Since $q_{p+1} \\geq q_{p}$, there exist smooth psh functions $\\phi_{p}, \\phi_{p+1}$ satisfying $\\left\\|\\phi_{p}\\right\\|_{*, q_{p}-1} \\leq 1,\\left\\|\\phi_{p+1}\\right\\|_{*, q_{p}-1} \\leq 1$ such that\n\n$$\nd \\varphi_{p} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\leq d d^{c} \\phi_{p}, \\quad d \\varphi_{p+1} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{p+1} \\leq d d^{c} \\phi_{p+1}\n$$\n\nWe need to bound, for $\\varphi=\\varphi_{p+1}$,\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi(-\\varphi)^{m} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\n$$\n\nBy Stokes' formula, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{\\Omega} \\chi(-\\varphi)^{m} d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left|\\int_{\\Omega}(-\\varphi)^{m} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right| \\\\\n& +\\left|\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi(-\\varphi)^{m-1} d \\varphi \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{p} \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the second term of the RHS of inequality (4.4), by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and inequalities (4.3), we can bound it from above by the square root of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi(-\\varphi)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\phi_{p} \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right) \\\\\n& \\times\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\chi(-\\varphi)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\phi_{p+1} \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe note that $q_{p}-1, q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{p-1}, q_{p+1}$ satisfy induction hypothesis for $p$ and $m-1$. Thus, both factors are bounded by a constant depending only on $\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi)$ (and hence only on $K)$. Hence, the second term of the RHS of inequality (4.4) is bounded by a constant depending only on $K$. For the first term of the RHS of inequality (4.4), by using CauchySchwarz inequality and inequalities (4.3), we can bound it from above by the square root of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\int_{\\Omega}(-\\varphi)^{m+1} d \\chi \\wedge d^{c} \\chi \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right) \\\\\n& \\times\\left(\\int_{\\operatorname{supp}(\\chi)}(-\\varphi)^{m-1} d d^{c} \\phi_{p} \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge d d^{c} \\varphi_{p-1} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is clear that $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{p-1}, q_{p+1}$ satisfy induction hypothesis for $p-1$ and $m+1$ and $q_{p}-1, q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{p-1}, q_{p+1}$ satisfy induction hypothesis for $p$ and $m-1$. Thus, we can bound (4.5) by a constant depending only on $K$. Therefore, we can bound the first term of the RHS of inequality (4.4). The proof is complete.\n\nWe now prove that psh $q$-complex Sobolev functions belong to $\\mathcal{D}(\\Omega)$ for $q \\geq k-1$.\nEnd of proof of Theorem 1.4. Let $\\varphi \\in W_{k-1, \\text { loc }}^{*}(\\Omega) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)$. Since the problem is local, we can assume that $\\varphi \\in W_{k-1}^{*}(\\Omega) \\cap \\operatorname{PSH}(\\Omega)$. We will prove that $\\varphi$ satisfies the condition (1.1). Let $U$ be an open relatively compact subset of $\\Omega$ and $\\left(\\varphi_{n}\\right)$ be the sequence of smooth psh functions constructed in the proof of Theorem 2.14. We note that $\\left\\|\\varphi_{n}\\right\\|_{W_{k-1}^{*}(U)} \\leq$ $2\\|\\varphi\\|_{W_{k-1}^{*}(\\Omega)}$ for every $n$. Let $\\left(\\varphi_{0,1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{0, k-1}\\right)$ be a smooth defining sequence for $\\varphi$. By the proof of Theorem 2.14, we can construct a smooth defining sequence $\\left(\\varphi_{n, 1}, \\ldots, \\varphi_{n, k-1}\\right)$ for $\\varphi_{n}$ such that $\\left\\|\\varphi_{n, l}\\right\\|_{W_{k-1-l}^{*}(U)} \\leq 2\\left\\|\\varphi_{0, l}\\right\\|_{W_{k-1-l}^{*}(\\Omega)}$ for $1 \\leq l \\leq k-2,\\left\\|\\varphi_{n, k-1}\\right\\|_{L^{1}(U)} \\leq$ $2\\left\\|\\varphi_{0, k-1}\\right\\|_{L^{1}(\\Omega)}$, for every $n$. Rescale $\\varphi$ if necessary, we can assume that, for every $n$, $\\left\\|\\varphi_{n}\\right\\|_{W_{k-1}^{*}(U)} \\leq 1,\\left\\|\\varphi_{n, l}\\right\\|_{W_{k-1-l}^{*}(U)} \\leq 1$ for $1 \\leq l \\leq k-2$ and $\\left\\|\\varphi_{n, k-1}\\right\\|_{L^{1}(U)} \\leq 1$.\n\nSince $d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n} \\leq d d^{c} \\varphi_{n, 1}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{U}\\left|\\varphi_{n}\\right|^{k-p-2} d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n} \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi_{n}\\right)^{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p-1} \\\\\n& \\leq \\int_{U}\\left|\\varphi_{n}\\right|^{k-p-2} d d^{c} \\varphi_{n, 1} \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi_{n}\\right)^{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt follows from Proposition 4.6 that the right-hand side is uniformly bounded by a constant depending only on $U$. Therefore, $\\left|\\varphi_{n}\\right|^{k-p-2} d \\varphi_{n} \\wedge d^{c} \\varphi_{n} \\wedge\\left(d d^{c} \\varphi_{n}\\right)^{p} \\wedge \\omega^{k-p-1}$ are locally weakly bounded in $U$ for every $p=0, \\ldots, k-2$.
