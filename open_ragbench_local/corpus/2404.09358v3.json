      "text": "# 1. Introduction \n\nPublic health data are often observational and exhibit spatial dependence, such as in environmental contaminations that may spread over a geographic region (Cressie, 1993). Spatial regression methods can improve efficiency, allow proper uncertainty quantification, and enhance predictive accuracy (Cressie, 1993). However, association between explanatory variables and latent functions of space in the response model can cause bias in estimated regression coefficients, and invalid statistical inference due to poor uncertainty quantification (Reich et al., 2006). This has often been termed \"spatial confounding,\" and was first observed in Clayton et al. (1993), discussed further in Reich et al. (2006) and Hodges and Reich (2010), and studied in other papers such as Paciorek (2010). The analogous issue in spline models has been discussed in Rice (1986) and Wood (2017). Several recent papers (Gilbert et al., 2021; Dupont et al., 2023; Khan and Berrett, 2024) have discussed definitions, causes, and effects of spatial confounding in attempts to unify varying accounts.\n\nMethods proposed to deal with spatial confounding aim to reduce bias in linear regression parameter estimates, such as in Marques et al. (2022), Guan et al. (2022), and Schnell and Papadogeorgou (2020). Methods similar to our proposal are geoadditive structural equation modeling (Thaden and Kneib, 2018), Spatial+ (Dupont et al., 2022), and a shift estimand, which does not assume a linear treatment effect, studied in Gilbert et al. (2021). Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM) subtracts estimated latent functions of space from the treatment and response, and regresses those residuals onto each other. Spatial+ subtracts an estimated function of space from the treatment variable and regresses the response onto those residuals and a spatial term modeled by a thin-plate spline. The shift estimand implemented in Gilbert et al. (2021) subtracts an estimated function of space from the treatment (in order to estimate a conditional density function) and response, but without assuming a linear and additive effect of the explanatory variable. Identifiability in gSEM, Spatial+, the\n\nshift estimand, and our method is typically due to independent, non-spatial variation in the treatment and response. In this situation, Gilbert et al. (2024) also showed that the standard generalized least squares (GLS), spline, and Gaussian process estimates are consistent even in some cases where they are misspecified due to spatial confounding, but noted that this does not imply variance estimates are accurate, and these estimators may converge at a rate slower than $n^{-1 / 2}$.\ngSEM was initially proposed for areal spatial data, and its analogue for point-referenced spatial data, based on Appendix B of Thaden and Kneib (2018), has not been studied thoroughly. The subject of this paper is point-referenced spatial data, so we use \"gSEM\" to refer to its point-referenced implementation. Dupont et al. (2022) states that \"it is not immediately clear why the method works\"; Dupont et al. (2023) states that \"the bias reduction will only be successful under the assumption that the initial regressions successfully remove all spatial confounders.\" gSEM has also lacked a closed-form variance estimate.\n\nLiterature on semiparametric regression (Robinson, 1988; Andrews, 1994; Chernozhukov et al., 2018) proves that under spatial confounding and additional regularity conditions, a class of estimators, including some nearly identical to gSEM (Robinson, 1988), can achieve $n^{-1 / 2}$-consistency and asymptotic normality, with a consistent closed-form variance estimate, even when not removing spatial confounding fully in initial regression estimates of spatial trends. Broadly speaking, these estimators first estimate the latent functions of space using nonparametric regression, subtract these estimates from the observed variables, and use those residuals to estimate the regression parameter in a second stage; the preliminary estimates of the latent functions need converge to the true values only slowly. Due to a form of orthogonality between the estimator and the preliminary estimates of the latent functions, the asymptotic variance of the estimator is unaffected by using these preliminary estimates. By either using sample-splitting as in Chernozhukov et al. (2018) or requiring\n\nadditional smoothness conditions as in Andrews (1994), asymptotic bias due to overfitting is controlled. A more detailed overview of the related semiparametric theory is presented in the Supplementary Materials section S1.\n\nGilbert et al. (2021) showed that a Double Machine Learning (DML) estimator can address spatial confounding using a purely nonparametric estimator of the average effect of a $\\delta$-shift in a scalar treatment variable. We show that a semiparametric DML approach to spatial confounding, while restrictive in some ways, has substantial upsides. Gilbert et al. (2021) relies on theory originally meant for social network data (Ogburn et al., 2024), which with spatial data results in an unnecessarily restricted sample-splitting strategy whose validity is unproven. No closed-form variance estimate is available for the shift estimator. In our semiparametric approach, we are able to use fully random sample splits, which allows sharper, clearer regularity conditions due to better estimation of spatial trends. The parametric model for treatment effects allows closed-form variance estimation using standard empirical estimators, avoids having to specify a shift $\\delta$, and easily incorporates multiple treatment variables. Our approach avoids estimating a density function, sometimes a computational difficulty. Finally, most methods for spatial confounding and spatial regression assume a linear model, so we continue to improve understanding of this common model.\n\nWe apply these semiparametric estimators to spatial confounding scenarios, using Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate the latent functions of space, a procedure also known as Kriging. We primarily rely on methods and theory from Chernozhukov et al. (2018), extending Chernozhukov et al.'s partially linear model to a vector treatment variable. As the two-stage estimators are termed Double Machine Learning in Chernozhukov et al. (2018), we refer to their narrower use to address spatial confounding as Double Spatial Regression (DSR). In simulations of spatial confounding, we show that DSR can provide superior performance in severe confounding scenarios. Finally, we analyze the association between\n\nof five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in blood using DSR.",

Double Spatial Regression\n### 2.1 Model and notation\n\nFor $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, let $Y_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the response variable, $\\mathbf{A}_{i}=\\left(a_{i 1}, a_{i 2}, \\ldots, a_{i \\ell}\\right)^{T} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\ell}$ be the treatment variables, $\\mathbf{Z}_{i}=\\left(z_{i 1}, z_{i 2}, \\ldots, z_{i e}\\right)^{T} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{v}$ be the covariates, and $\\mathbf{S}_{i}$ be the spatial location contained in spatial domain $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The assumed model for $j=1, \\ldots, \\ell$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i} & =\\mathbf{A}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}+\\mathbf{Z}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}+g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+U_{i} \\\\\nA_{i j} & =\\mathbf{Z}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 j}+m_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+V_{i j}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$ is the regression coefficient vector of interest. The vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 \\ell}$ and the vector of functions $\\eta_{0}=\\left(g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}\\right)$ are all nuisance parameters. $U_{i}$ and $V_{i j}$ are random error terms such that $E\\left(U_{i} \\mid \\mathbf{A}_{i}, \\mathbf{Z}_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)=E\\left(V_{i j} \\mid \\mathbf{Z}_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)=0$. Spatial confounding can be thought of as the presence of an unmeasured confounder with spatial structure, which is stochastically dependent with $\\mathbf{A}_{i}$, and which affects the conditional expectation of $Y_{i}$ (Thaden and Kneib, 2018). Spatial confounding is present in (1) and (2) unless the functions $g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)$ and $m_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)$ are orthogonal with respect to the distribution of $\\mathbf{S}_{i}$. If they are not orthogonal, standard spatial models will exhibit finite-sample bias and inaccurate variance estimation (Paciorek, 2010). For the theoretical results, we assume a random spatial design, but our empirical results verify that the proposed method can perform well if the $\\mathbf{S}_{i}$ are defined deterministically. Assume $\\mathbf{Y}$ and the columns of $\\mathbf{A}$ are centered with mean 0 .",

      "text": "### 2.2 Double Spatial Regression estimator\n\nDouble Spatial Regression estimates the spatial trends $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}$ and covariate effects $\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}, \\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{01}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 \\ell}$, subtracts those from $\\mathbf{Y}, \\mathbf{A}_{.1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{A}_{. \\ell}$, and then uses these residuals to estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$. The estimates of $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}$, and $\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}, \\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{01}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 \\ell}$, are obtained\n\nby cross-fitting: for example, to estimate the values of $g_{0}$ for the data in fold $k$, an estimate $\\widehat{g}_{0}$ of the function $g_{0}$ is obtained using the data not in fold $k$, and $\\widehat{g}_{0}$ is then evaluated on the data in fold $k$.\n\nFor cross-fitting, the full data set is randomly (we use a completely random sample) partitioned into $K$ folds each of size $\\frac{n}{K}$, assumed to be an integer. Let $f_{i} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$ denote the fold assignment of observation $i$. For $k=1, \\ldots, K$, let $\\mathbf{k}=\\left\\{i: f_{i}=k\\right\\}$ denote the set of indices assigned to fold $k$ and $\\mathbf{k}^{C}=\\left\\{i: f_{i} \\neq k\\right\\}$ denote the set of indices assigned to the complement of fold $k$. Then, for example, $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the vector of elements of $\\mathbf{Y}$ assigned to the $k$ th fold and $\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$ is the vector of elements of $\\mathbf{Y}$ not assigned to the $k$ th fold. For a generic matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$, the $i$ th row of $\\mathbf{X}$ is denoted $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$, the submatrix consisting of those rows of $\\mathbf{X}$ whose indices are in $\\mathbf{k}$ is denoted $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ (and likewise for $\\mathbf{k}^{C}$ ), the $j$ th column is denoted $\\mathbf{X}_{-j}$, and the $j$ th column vector of the submatrix corresponding to the $k$ th fold is denoted $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathbf{k}, j}$. Denote the full data as $\\mathbf{W}$, the data in fold $k$ as $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}}$, and the data in the complement of fold $k$ as $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$.\n\nUniversal Kriging using the Mat\u00e8rn correlation function is used to estimate $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}$ (Stein, 1999). The Mat\u00e8rn correlation function is:\n\n$$\nC_{\\gamma, \\tau}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{j}\\right):=\\frac{2^{1-\\tau}}{\\Gamma(\\tau)}\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\tau} \\frac{\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{i}-\\mathbf{S}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}}{\\gamma}\\right)^{\\tau} K_{\\tau}\\left(\\sqrt{2 \\tau} \\frac{\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{i}-\\mathbf{S}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}}{\\gamma}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{\\tau}$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. The Mat\u00e8rn correlation function has two parameters: $\\gamma$ controls the range of spatial dependence and $\\tau$ controls the smoothness (mean-square differentiability) of the process. A variance parameter $\\omega^{2}$ is typically defined so that $\\omega^{2} C(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B})$ is a covariance matrix.\n\nFor each fold $k$ and for each of $\\mathbf{Y}, \\mathbf{A}_{-1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{A}_{-\\ell}$, Models (1) and (2) are fit to $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$, using a spatial random effect with Mat\u00e8rn covariance to model the spatial terms $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}$, obtaining preliminary parameter estimates for each model fit. The preliminary estimates obtained on fold $k$ for $\\omega$, the correlation parameters used in (3), and the slope parameters\n\nused in (1) and (2), are denoted by a tilde and an additional subscript $k$; note that $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}^{-}$, a preliminary estimate of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$, is included.\n\nThe universal Kriging equations used to estimate the spatial trends on fold $k$ are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\widehat{g}_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right)=\\widehat{\\omega}_{0 k} C_{\\widehat{s}_{0 k}, \\widehat{s}_{0 k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)\\left(\\widehat{\\omega}_{0 k} C_{\\widehat{s}_{0 k}, \\widehat{s}_{0 k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)+\\widehat{\\sigma}_{0 k}^{2} \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n& \\times\\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}-\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0 k}-\\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{00 k}\\right) \\\\\n& \\widehat{m}_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right)=\\widehat{\\omega}_{j k} C_{\\widehat{s}_{j k}, \\widehat{s}_{j k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)\\left(\\widehat{\\omega}_{j k} C_{\\widehat{s}_{j k}, \\widehat{s}_{j k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)+\\widehat{\\sigma}_{j k}^{2} \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}{ }_{j}-\\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{0 j k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor $j=1, \\ldots, p$. For this working prediction model we also assume homoskedasticity of all error terms, with variance parameters $\\sigma_{0}^{2}, \\sigma_{1}^{2}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{\\ell}^{2}$. The estimated covariate effects for fold $k$ are $\\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{k}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{00 k}, \\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{k}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{01 k}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{k}}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{0 \\ell k}$.\n\nTo obtain universal Kriging estimates, we used the GpGp R package (Guinness, 2018), which estimates all covariance and slope parameters using restricted maximum likelihood (REML), and scales well to large samples by using the Vecchia approximation (Vecchia, 1988). Estimates are combined across folds to obtain $\\widehat{g}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ and $\\widehat{m}_{01}(\\mathbf{S}), \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{0 \\ell}(\\mathbf{S})$, and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}}, \\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{01}}, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 \\ell}}$. Denote the DSR estimator by $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$. Letting $\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{. j}=\\mathbf{A}_{. j}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0 j}}-$ $\\widehat{m}_{0 j}(\\mathbf{S})$, and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{U}}=\\mathbf{Y}-\\mathbf{A}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}}-\\widehat{g}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R} & =\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T}\\left(\\mathbf{Y}-\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{00}}-\\widehat{g}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right) \\\\\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}\\right) & =\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\widehat{U}_{i}^{2} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{i} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{i}^{T}\\right)\\left(\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1}\\right)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich are the estimators provided in Chernozhukov et al.

For a scalar $\\beta_{0}$, Fuhr et al. (2024) recommends using enough folds that the estimates are relatively stable, and pick the median point and variance estimates out of as large a number of estimates as is feasible. The marginal median could be selected for each component of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$ if it has length greater than 1.\n\nIn Supplementary Material Section S2, we prove root- $n$ consistency and asymptotic normality for a different DSR estimator, also based on Chernozhukov et al. (2018), which more closely resembles gSEM in that in the first stage, $\\mathbf{Y}$ is regressed directly onto $\\mathbf{S}$, ignoring treatment variables. Covariates are also considered treatment variables, a limitation of our theory. We term this the \"theoretical DSR\" estimator and denote it $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$. Instead of Mat\u00e8rn covariance, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$ estimates latent functions of space using Kriging with squared exponential covariance, with covariance parameter selection by a training-validation split (Eberts and Steinwart, 2013), which allows more thorough theoretical analysis. In summary, for $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the regularity conditions for $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$ require that the unknown functions of space are smoother than once-differentiable functions, and reside in $L_{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right) \\cap L_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\right)$, as well as other conditions. Under Assumptions A1-A6 in Supplemental Materials Section S2, we show root- $n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$ :\n\nTHEOREM 1: If Assumptions A1 - A6 are met, and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$ and $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}\\right)$ are obtained by Algorithm S2, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sqrt{n} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1 / 2}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right) \\xrightarrow{D} N\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right), \\text { and } \\\\\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}\\right)^{-1 / 2}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right) \\xrightarrow{D} N\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=E\\left[\\mathbf{V}_{i} \\mathbf{V}_{i}^{T}\\right]^{-1} E\\left[U_{i}^{2} \\mathbf{V}_{i} \\mathbf{V}_{i}^{T}\\right]\\left(E\\left[\\mathbf{V}_{i} \\mathbf{V}_{i}^{T}\\right]^{-1}\\right)$ is the approximate variance of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$.\nTheorem 1 does not apply directly to the estimator $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$.

Andrews (1994) provides sufficient conditions to forego cross-fitting, namely that both $\\left(g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\widehat{g}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{01}, \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{0 \\ell}\\right)$ obey additional smoothness conditions. These required results for GP regression with Mat\u00e8rn correlation and hyperparameters estimated via REML are not established to our knowledge, so use of $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$ is theoretically justified, and cross-fitting can be skipped if desired,\n\nwith assumptions about the convergence rates of $\\widehat{g}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{01}, \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{0 \\ell}$, and smoothness of both $\\left(g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 \\ell}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\widehat{g}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{01}, \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{0 \\ell}\\right)$. Although equally thorough theoretical analysis is not possible, in simulations, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$ performed much better than $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{T D S R}$.",

We include the DSR estimator presented in Section 2.2 (Equations 6 and 7), which we refer to as \"DSR\" in this section, and the \"theoretical DSR\" estimator studied in Section S2 (Algorithm S2). Cross-fitting is used for all DSR results presented in this section; the Supplementary Materials Section S5 include results for both versions of DSR without crossfitting. DSR estimators with cross-fitting used $K=5$ folds. Different estimators of spatial trends, use of cross-fitting, and types of DSR estimators were used to isolate characteristics important to good empirical performance, and are detailed in the Supplemental Materials Section S4. Comparison methods were the geoadditive structural equation model (gSEM) of Thaden and Kneib (2018), implemented using splines for geostatistical data (Supplementary Materials Algorithm S1), Spatial+ of Dupont et al. (2022), the naive (unadjusted for spatial confounding) spatial linear mixed model (LMM), spline regression using generalized crossvalidation (GCV) and REML to estimate the smoothing parameter for a smooth function of space (Wood, 2017), and ordinary least squares (OLS). The nonparametric shift estimator studied in Gilbert et al. (2021) was tried but was not able to obtain estimates in most scenarios we used. Spatial+ removes a fitted spatial surface from the treatment variable, and then performs regression of the outcome onto the residuals with a thin-plate spline smooth over space. The naive spatial linear mixed model (LMM) is fitted using the R package GpGp\n\n(Guinness, 2018) and spline models fit using the R package mgcv (Wood, 2011).

(2022):\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{Y}=\\beta_{0} \\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{Z}+\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}, \\quad \\epsilon_{i}{ }^{i, i, d .} N\\left(0, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathbf{A} \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\sim N\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0}\n\\end{array}\\right],\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{A}}+\\sigma_{A}^{2} \\mathbf{I} & \\rho \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{A}}^{1 / 2}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{1 / 2}\\right)^{T} \\\\\n\\rho \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{Z}}^{1 / 2}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{A}}^{1 / 2}\\right)^{T} & \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{Z}}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right)}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Y}, \\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{Z}}$ are spatial correlation matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, and $\\rho \\in[-1,1]$. $\\mathbf{A}$ is the independent variable, $\\beta_{0}$ is the parameter of interest, and $\\mathbf{Z}$ is an unobserved spatial confounder. Since the main regularity conditions presented in Section S2 relate to the differentiability of the unknown functions of space, we used two spatial covariance matrices for both $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{Z}}$ that generate realizations of smooth and rough, i.e., more and less differentiable, functions:\n\n- Smooth: Gneiting covariance function (Schlather et al., 2015) with range parameter $\\gamma=$ 0.2 , and variance 1\n- Rough: Mat\u00e8rn covariance function with smoothness parameter $\\tau=1.5$, range parameter $\\gamma=0.072$, and variance 1\n\nThe Gneiting covariance function approximates a squared exponential covariance function but is less prone to producing computationally singular covariance matrices (Schlather et al.,\n\n2015). These were both used as implemented in the R package geoR (Ribeiro Jr et al., 2023). Range parameters were chosen so that the distance at which spatial correlation is equal to 0.05 were approximately equal. Example draws of spatial surfaces from these distributions are visualized in the Supplemental Materials section S4.\n\nFor our main simulations, $n=1000, \\rho=0.5, \\sigma_{A}^{2}=0.1^{2}, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}=1$, and $\\beta_{0}=0.5$. The relative lack of i.i.d. variance in $\\mathbf{A}$ provides less unconfounded variation in the treatment, causing severe spatial confounding bias in finite samples. Spatial locations were randomly sampled uniformly from $[0,1]^{2}$. Several additional simulated scenarios generated data subject to heteroskedasticity, nonstationarity, non-Gaussianity of the confounder $Z_{i}$ or noise $\\epsilon_{i}$, or considering deterministically-defined latent functions of space $g_{0}$ and $m_{0}$ rather than random functions drawn from GP priors. These scenarios are discussed in the Supplementary Materials Section S4.\n\nFour hundred Monte Carlo replications were performed for each main simulation scenario. Confidence intervals for Spatial+ and gSEM were obtained using 100 nonparametric bootstrap replicates. Methods were compared using their bias, standard error, mean squared error (MSE), coverage, and confidence interval length.",

Table 1 displays corresponding coverage and mean confidence interval lengths. DSR has the lowest bias and shortest confidence intervals of the methods with at least nearnominal coverage. Theoretical DSR performs fairly poorly in terms of bias, coverage, and confidence interval length. gSEM and Spatial+ are improvements over the linear mixed model, and achieve nominal coverage, but they have higher bias and wider confidence intervals than DSR. These scenarios were chosen to be particularly challenging cases of\n\nspatial confounding, in that there is little unconfounded variation in the treatment variable, so the linear mixed model performs poorly by all metrics.\n[Figure 1 about here.]\n[Table 1 about here.]\n\nFull simulation result tables are in the Supplementary Material Section S5, Tables S1S13. In many scenarios, especially the deterministic scenarios where the latent functions of space were predefined, using cross-fitting proved beneficial. DSR implemented with spline regression without cross-fitting outperformed gSEM in many scenarios, indicating that direct estimation of $g_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ rather than ignoring $\\mathbf{A}$ in the first stage generally improves performance. Replacing the GP estimator in theoretical DSR by Kriging with Mat\u00e8rn covariance and REML estimation greatly improved performance, but in a number of scenarios resulted in slight undercoverage, and sometimes worse bias than DSR. To study the robustness of DSR to the choice of correlation function, we applied DSR with Mat\u00e8rn covariance smoothness fixed at 4.5. This resulted in slightly better estimates generally, but this may be because many of our confounding scenarios were generated with smooth covariance functions.\n\nIn more difficult scenarios, such as those with rougher unobserved confounders, and the deterministic scenarios, DSR's performance suffered but still outperformed other methods in bias, with slightly worse coverage than gSEM and Spatial+. The confounding scenario in which $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$ were generated with exponential covariance proved too difficult for any method to perform well and all suffered from substantial bias (Table S10 in the Supplementary Materials). When $\\sigma_{A}^{2}=1$, DSR had higher bias than gSEM and the shift estimand, although all methods had low bias in this scenario.",

      "text": "# 4. PFAS Data Analysis \n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals resistant to water and stains used in consumer products and manufacture of chemicals, many of which are frequently detected in humans due to resistance to degradation and solubility in water (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2022). PFAS have been associated with thyroid disruption in humans, although results have been inconsistent (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2022; Coperchini et al., 2021). Animal models indicate that PFAS can impact thyroid hormone function through a variety of mechanisms including thyroid hormone synthesis (Bali et al., 2024). Because PFAS reflect a broad class of chemicals, researchers are using in silico modeling to try to characterize these impacts (Barali\u0107 et al., 2024).\n\nIn Sun et al. (2016), high concentrations of a number of PFAS were detected in water at several collection points of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina (NC), the drinking water source for over a million people. One source of contamination is a fluorochemical manufacturing plant slightly downstream of Fayetteville, North Carolina (Kotlarz et al., 2020, 2024). In 2017, the GenX Exposure Study began collecting data on North Carolina residents in drinking water exposed communities in order to understand their patterns of exposure to PFAS and possible health effects. The data used in this analysis comes from blood samples collected from study participants in the private well community near the chemical plant in October 2021. We study associations between five PFAS, because each was detected in at least $80 \\%$ of our samples, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).\n\nThe sample from this community is comprised of 98 adult women who obtain their water from private wells, who lived near the Fayetteville Works chemical plant, and who did not have thyroid disease at the time of data collection. Women with thyroid disease were excluded because thyroid medication can stabilize thyroid hormone levels. The outcome\n\nvariable we studied was blood serum concentration of TSH. We focus on this outcome and community because the geographic area was relatively small (about 250 square miles), and the outcome and some exposures showed spatial dependence, so this analysis is a candidate for a spatial confounding adjustment. For example, other unmeasured pollutants might affect health outcomes and be correlated with the PFAS used in the analysis due to similar sources or spread. TSH was natural log-transformed to obtain approximately normal residuals.\n\nExposure variables were serum concentrations of five different PFAS detected in more than $80 \\%$ of our sample: perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid ( PFHpS ), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid ( PFHxS ). The blood serum concentrations of PFAS and thyroid hormones were measured in the same samples. Wallis et al. (2023) summarizes results from Li et al. (2018), Li et al. (2022), and Zhang et al. (2013) that show fairly long half-lives of these chemicals, indicating that the measurements taken for these PFAS are good proxies of cumulative exposure. We controlled for several confounders that could be associated with both exposures and outcome: age, sex, race, smoking status and current alcohol consumption. Table 2 provides summary statistics of the continuous variables. The spatial proportion of residual variance is the variance of spatially-correlated residuals, divided by the total residual variance, in a LMM regressing that variable onto covariates. Thirty-nine members ( $40 \\%$ ) of the sample had ever smoked, forty-two members ( $43 \\%$ ) currently drank, and $78(80 \\%)$ were White, ten ( $10 \\%$ ) were Black, and ten ( $10 \\%$ ) were other or multiple races. The median age was 59 years, with a mean of 56.9 and standard deviation of 14.7 .\n\nDouble spatial regression may offer an improved ability to analyze the effects of spatiallycorrelated chemical exposures, which may otherwise be difficult to estimate without adjustment for spatial confounding in standard models. DSR's regularity conditions, while informative as to the general strength of the method, are not possible to check in practice,\n\nas they are assumptions on unknown functions of space. We recommend simply comparing model estimates from DSR and the LMM, and possibly OLS. A substantial difference between DSR and LMM results may indicate that spatial confounding was present in the LMM and adjusted for more successfully in DSR's estimates.\n\nWe estimated the joint associations between the five PFAS and TSH using non-spatial linear regression (OLS), a spatial linear mixed model (LMM) estimated with GpGp using Mat\u00e8rn covariance, gSEM, Spatial + , and the DSR estimator with cross-fitting in Section 2.2. A large number of folds, 45 , was used in the DSR estimator to improve stability of estimates across random splits; the marginal median estimates, and corresponding variance estimates, were chosen from 11 runs with different random sample splits. Linear regression diagnostics showed that an assumption of a linear association of all PFAS serum concentrations with $\\log (\\mathrm{TSH})$ was reasonable.\n[Table 2 about here.]\n\nRegression analysis results, shown in Figure 2, indicate increasing magnitude and statistical significance of the $\\beta$ parameter for PFHpS, from OLS to LMM to DSR. This trend of increasing magnitude and significance with increasing spatial confounding adjustment suggests the presence of spatial confounding with respect to PFHpS. About $70 \\%$ of the residual variance in PFHpS was attributable to spatial variation, making estimation of its regression coefficient more susceptible to spatial confounding in this analysis.\n[Figure 2 about here.]",

      "text": "# 5. Discussion \n\nDouble spatial regression (DSR) is a method to estimate linear regression coefficients using point-referenced data that may be spatially confounded. In simulated severe confounding scenarios, DSR outperformed competing methods in bias and coverage. We derived explicit\n\nregularity conditions that govern asymptotic performance of a slightly different DSR estimator. These regularity conditions are fairly unrestrictive but this \"theoretical DSR\" estimator performed poorly in simulations of severe confounding. DSR also allows closed-form variance estimation, which many competing methods have lacked. Based on simulation results, we recommend using the DSR estimator from Section 2.2 with cross-fitting.\n\nWe linked the problem of spatial confounding to existing results in the semiparametric regression literature, which has provided insight into why gSEM is able to reduce bias compared to the naive spatial linear mixed model, and studied Double Machine Learning estimators (which we termed Double Spatial Regression in our narrower application) that outperform others proposed so far. These existing results explain when and why these types of two-stage estimators are able to correct for bias, even when the initial nonparametric regression estimates converge to the true functions slowly. Simulation results indicate that both use of GP regression using Mat\u00e8rn covariance, and direct estimation of the function $g_{0}$, as opposed to $h_{0}$, which marginalizes over the distribution of $A_{i}$, improved DSR's estimates compared to gSEM in many scenarios.\n\nDSR is similar in some ways to the method studied in Gilbert et al. (2021). This shift estimator was well-suited to estimating the average treatment effect when treatment effects were heterogeneous. In many practical situations there are multiple treatment variables, and it is reasonable to assume a linear and additive association between treatment(s) and response. In this situation, DSR is able to estimate multiple linear regression coefficients jointly, with their covariance matrix in closed-form. Gilbert et al. (2021) assumed increasingdomain asymptotics, while we assumed a fixed spatial domain.\n\nGilbert et al. (2021) also suggested using spatially-independent sample splits for crossfitting, under an assumption of local spatial covariance. With this type of sample splitting, the conditional mean or density functions of the response and treatment variables, conditional\n\non spatial location, are estimated using points in one subset of the spatial domain, and those functions' realized values estimated on a different subset of the spatial domain such that the points in the prediction set are spatially independent from the points in the training set. It is not clear that these estimates can converge to their true values when the training and prediction sets are spatially independent, since the goal is to learn functions of space; deriving conditions on the covariance functions generating the spatially-dependent data that are sufficient to achieve root- $n$ asymptotic normality and consistency when using spatiallyindependent splits could verify when this strategy can be used.\n\nFurther research could analyze convergence rates of functions estimated with Gaussian processes, when hyperparameters are selected using maximum likelihood or REML rather than training-validation splits; the only work we are aware of doing this, although with noiseless observations, is Karvonen et al. (2020). This would help yield more explicit regularity conditions for the main DSR estimator we proposed (although we also proposed using the Vecchia approximation to the full likelihood). Approaches to areal data should also be investigated. Finally, extensions to other types of semiparametric models, including weighted and nonlinear regression, are discussed in Robinson (1988), Andrews (1994), and Chernozhukov et al. (2018).",

      "text": "# S1. Overview of related semiparametric theory\n## S1.1 Overview of related semiparametric theory\n\nThis section briefly summarizes the semiparametric literature on root- $n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators similar to gSEM. More complete explanations can be found in Andrews (1994) and Chernozhukov et al. (2018), from which this summary draws heavily. For $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, let $Y_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the response variable, $A_{i}$ be the treatment variable, and $\\mathbf{S}_{i}$ be the spatial location contained in spatial domain $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. A simple model is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i} & =A_{i} \\beta_{0}+g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+U_{i} \\\\\nA_{i} & =m_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+V_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor illustration in this section we ignore covariates and assume $A_{i}$ is a scalar. In (1), $\\beta_{0}$ is the regression coefficient of interest, $g_{0}$ and $m_{0}$ are unknown functions treated as nuisance parameters, and $U_{i}$ and $V_{i}$ are error terms with finite, non-zero variance such that $E\\left(U_{i} \\mid A_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)=0$ and $E\\left(V_{i} \\mid \\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)=0$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Denote by $h_{0}(\\mathbf{s}):=E\\left(Y_{i} \\mid \\mathbf{S}_{i}=\\mathbf{s}\\right)$ (marginalizing over $A_{i}$ ), and let $\\eta_{0}$ denote the vector of functions $\\left(g_{0}, m_{0}\\right)$ or $\\left(h_{0}, m_{0}\\right)$.\n\nModel (1) can result in invalid inference due to spatial confounding if $g_{0}, m_{0}$ result in dependence between $\\mathbf{A}$ and $g_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$. For example, if $g_{0}=m_{0}$, this corresponds to an unmeasured confounder which is a function of space affecting both $Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{n}$ and $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n}$, and in a spatial linear mixed model, this dependence is typically ignored. For example, spatial random effects are commonly used to implement a smoother to model the unknown function $g_{0}$, but are usually marginalized into the conditional variance of $\\mathbf{Y}$ without consideration of dependence with A (Paciorek, 2010). Alternatively, some basis functions used to model $g_{0}$ may be collinear with $\\mathbf{A}$, in which case penalized estimation of the coefficients on the basis functions leads to bias in estimation of $\\beta_{0}$ (Reich et al., 2006).\n\nAlgorithm S1 Geoadditive Structural Equation Model (gSEM) estimation of $\\beta_{0}$ Input: Response vector $\\mathbf{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, location matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, treatment vector $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ Output: Estimate $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ of $\\beta_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n$\\widehat{h}_{0} \\leftarrow$ Estimate of $h_{0}$ from a spatial regression model for $\\mathbf{Y}$ onto $\\mathbf{S}$, such as a spline regression\n$\\mathbf{R}_{Y} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{Y}-\\widehat{h}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$\n$\\widehat{m}_{0} \\leftarrow$ Estimate of $m_{0}$ from a spatial regression model for $\\mathbf{A}$ onto $\\mathbf{S}$, such as a spline regression\n$\\mathbf{R}_{A} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{A}-\\widehat{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$\n$\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M} \\leftarrow\\left(\\mathbf{R}_{A}^{T} \\mathbf{R}_{A}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{R}_{A}^{T} \\mathbf{R}_{Y}$, i.e., obtain $\\widehat{\\beta}_{0}$ by regressing the residuals $\\mathbf{R}_{Y}$ onto the residuals $\\mathbf{R}_{A}$\nReturn $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$\n\nThe gSEM procedure is in Algorithm S1. Variance is typically estimated via bootstrap when gSEM is used in simulation studies (Guan et al., 2022; Gilbert et al., 2021). Aside from the method of estimating $h_{0}$ and $m_{0}$ and variance estimation, this is identical to the procedure considered in Robinson (1988). Intuitively, it is approximately orthogonalizing $\\mathbf{Y}$ and $\\mathbf{A}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{S}$ and therefore removing effects of spatial confounding.\n\nS1.1.1 Orthogonality of $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ and nuisance parameter estimates. To study $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ 's asymptotic properties, note that $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ is equivalently defined as the solution to\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\psi\\left(Y_{i}, A_{i} ; \\mathbf{S}_{i} ; \\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}, \\widehat{\\eta}_{0}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi\\left(Y_{i}, A_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i} ; \\beta, \\eta\\right)=\\left\\{Y_{i}-h\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)-\\beta\\left(A_{i}-m\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)\\right)\\right\\}\\left(A_{i}-m\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)\\right), \\eta=(h, m), \\widehat{\\eta}_{0}=\\left(\\widehat{h}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{0}\\right)$, and $\\widehat{h}_{0}$ and $\\widehat{m}_{0}$ are preliminary estimates of the nuisance parameters $h_{0}$ and $m_{0}$. The score function $\\psi$ is used in Robinson (1988), and also studied in Andrews (1994) and Chernozhukov et al. (2018). This score function results in a form of orthogonality between $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ and $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}$ :\n\nunder the model (1), replacement of $\\eta_{0}$ by $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}$ in $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E\\left[\\psi\\left(Y_{i}, A_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i} ; \\beta_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]$ has an effect that is $o_{P}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$ when $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}$ is close to $\\eta_{0}$ and $\\widehat{h}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{0}$ each converge to their true values at $o_{P}\\left(n^{-1 / 4}\\right)$ rate and obey smoothness conditions, and other regularity conditions are assumed (Andrews, 1994). ${ }^{1}$ Alternatively, Chernozhukov et al. (2018) uses the term (near-) Neyman orthogonality. Neyman orthogonality means that the Gateaux functional derivative ${ }^{2}$ with respect to $\\eta$ is 0 at the true nuisance parameter values:\n\n$$\n\\partial_{\\eta} E\\left[\\psi\\left(Y_{i}, A_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i} ; \\beta_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]\\left[\\eta-\\eta_{0}\\right]=0\n$$\n\nand in the case of near-Neyman orthogonality, that it is $o_{P}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$. Similarly, this indicates that close to $\\eta_{0}$, there is little effect on $E\\left[\\psi\\left(Y_{i}, A_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i} ; \\beta_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]$ when replacing $\\eta_{0}$ by its estimate. The orthogonality property means that the estimates $\\widehat{h}_{0}$ and $\\widehat{m}_{0}$ can converge to $h_{0}$ and $m_{0}$ at rates slower than $o_{p}\\left(n^{-1 / 2}\\right)$ and asymptotically this deviation from $\\left(h_{0}, m_{0}\\right)$ does not affect affect the variance of $\\widehat{\\beta}_{g S E M}$ (Andrews, 1994).\n\nS1.1.2 Stochastic equicontinuity or sample splitting. The orthogonality property of $\\psi$ must be paired with a means of ensuring that estimation error of $\\eta_{0}$ does not cause asymptotic bias, primarily due to overfitting (Chernozhukov et al., 2018). This is achieved by a property of empirical processes called stochastic equicontinuity in Andrews (1994) and by sample splitting in Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Stochastic equicontinuity follows from Donsker conditions (Belloni et al., 2017) which limit the complexity of $\\eta_{0}$ and $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}$. In Andrews (1994), these are primarily satisfied by placing a smoothness requirement on $\\eta_{0}$ and $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}$. In contrast, the sample-splitting approach of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) avoids requiring Donsker conditions, and therefore additional smoothness requirements.

By using crossfitting, the DML estimators of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) still use the full sample so do not lose power. We therefore rely on Chernozhukov et al. (2018) for our theoretical analysis of an estimator similar to gSEM, and term this estimator Double Spatial Regression since we are using Double Machine Learning with spatial regression.",

Double Spatial Regression estimator for theoretical analysis \n\nIn this section, we consider an algorithm similar to gSEM Appendix B (Thaden and Kneib, 2018) and the estimator in Robinson (1988), which allows derivation of explicit regularity conditions. For theoretical analysis, we combine treatment variables $\\mathbf{A}_{i}$ and covariates $\\mathbf{Z}_{i}$ into a combined vector $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ of regressors of length $p$. The model considered is then, for $i=1, \\ldots, n$ and $j=1, \\ldots, p$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i} & =\\mathbf{X}_{i}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}+g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+U_{i}, & & E\\left(U_{i} \\mid \\mathbf{X}_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)=0 \\\\\nX_{i j} & =m_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)+V_{i j}, & & E\\left(V_{i j} \\mid \\mathbf{S}_{i}=0\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe treat covariates as treatment variables since existing results from machine learning theory, such as Eberts and Steinwart (2013), do not typically incorporate parametric adjustment for covariates into their analysis. We use these existing results to fully justify and analyze our estimator. We are not aware of available theoretical results that would allow parametric adjustment for covariates within our framework.\n\nDSR uses Kriging (although other nonparametric estimators can be used) which requires a working correlation function be specified, and for theoretical analysis we use the squared exponential correlation function (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005):\n\n$$\nC_{\\gamma}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}, \\mathbf{S}_{j}\\right):=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{i}-\\mathbf{S}_{j}\\right\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\gamma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor matrix inputs $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ to a correlation function, $C(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B})$ denotes the correlation matrix where the element in row $i$ and column $j$ equals $C\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{i \\cdot}, \\mathbf{B}_{j \\cdot}\\right)$.\n\nDenote by $h_{0}(\\mathbf{s})$ the conditional expectation $E\\left(Y_{i} \\mid \\mathbf{S}_{i}=\\mathbf{s}\\right)$ (note that this does not depend on $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ ). The number of elements in fold $k$ is denoted by $|\\mathbf{k}|$. On each fold $k$, Kriging (Stein, 1999) is used to obtain cross-fitted estimates for $h_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right)$ and $m_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right)$ for $j=1, \\ldots, p$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\widehat{h}_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right):=C_{\\gamma_{0 k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)\\left(C_{\\gamma_{0 k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)+\\left|\\mathbf{k}^{C}\\right| \\lambda_{0 k} \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{Y}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}} \\\\\n\\widehat{m}_{0 j}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right):=C_{\\gamma_{j k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)\\left(C_{\\gamma_{j k}}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}, \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}\\right)+\\left|\\mathbf{k}^{C}\\right| \\lambda_{j k} \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}, j}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nPredictions are combined across folds to obtain $\\widehat{h}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ and $\\widehat{m}_{01}(\\mathbf{S}), \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{0 p}(\\mathbf{S})$. The hyperparameters $\\lambda_{0 k}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p k}, \\gamma_{0 k}, \\ldots, \\gamma_{p k}$ depend on $k$ because our theoretical analysis requires that they are selected each time predictions are obtained (i.e., on each fold); they are selected using a training-validation split of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$ (Eberts and Steinwart, 2013). The data in $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$ is split in two halves, a \"training\" half and a \"validation\" half. For each possible combination of hyperparameters $(\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$ ) considered, the training half of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$ is used to obtain predictions on the validation half of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$. The pair of hyperparameters with lowest mean squared error (MSE) on the validation half of $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}^{C}}$ is selected for estimating $h_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 p}$ evaluated at the locations corresponding to the data in $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ (Eberts and Steinwart, 2013). This procedure is adopted in order to satisfy the requirements of Eberts and Steinwart (2013), which proves the convergence rate of certain GP regression estimates, in order to allow derivation of clear regularity conditions for DSR.\n\nLetting $\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{-j}=\\mathbf{X}_{-j}-\\widehat{m}_{0 j}(\\mathbf{S})$ and $\\widehat{U}_{i}=Y_{i}-\\widehat{h}_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{S}_{i}\\right)-\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{i}^{T} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}$, the DSR estimator and its approximate variance are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0} & =\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}\\right)^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T}\\left(\\mathbf{Y}-\\widehat{h}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right) \\\\\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}\\right) & =\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}\\right)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[\\widehat{U}_{i}^{2} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{i} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{i}^{T}\\right]\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}^{T} \\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}\\right)^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich are the estimators from Chernozhukov et al. (2018). The algorithm is presented in Algorithm S2. Note that this estimator is essentially the same as gSEM except that it uses sample splitting, the method of estimating the latent functions of space is not\n\nspecified with gSEM, and gSEM has lacked a closed-form variance estimate; gSEM in turn is essentially identical to the estimator in Robinson (1988), except that Robinson (1988) uses nonparametric kernel regression estimators and provides a variance estimate.",

Additional simulation details \n\nAdditional scenarios:\n(1) Cubed confounder: $Y_{i} \\sim N\\left(\\beta A_{i}+Z_{i}^{3}, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)$.\n(2) Gamma errors in $\\mathbf{Y}: Y_{i}=\\beta A_{i}+Z_{i}+\\phi_{i}, \\phi_{i}=q\\left[\\Phi\\left(\\epsilon_{i} / \\sqrt{3}\\right)\\right]$, where $q$ is the quantile function for the $\\operatorname{Gamma}(1,1 / \\sqrt{3})$ distribution and $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF, and $\\epsilon_{i} \\sim N\\left(0, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)$.\n(3) \"East-west\" heteroskedasticity: $Y_{i}=\\beta A_{i}+Z_{i}+S_{1 i} \\epsilon_{i}$, where $S_{1 i}$ is the first coordinate of $\\mathbf{S}_{i}$ and $\\epsilon_{i} \\sim N\\left(0, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)$.\n\n(4) \"Middle-out\" heteroskedasticity: $Y_{i}=\\beta A_{i}+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\left(S_{1 i}\\right)}{3}} Z_{i}+\\sqrt{1-\\omega\\left(S_{1 i}\\right)} \\epsilon_{i}$, where $\\omega\\left(S_{1 i}\\right)=$ $\\Phi\\left(\\frac{S_{1 i}-0.5}{0.1}\\right)$ and $\\epsilon_{i} \\sim N\\left(0, \\sigma_{Y}^{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe last three are borrowed from Huiying Mao and Reich (2023). Five further scenarios were considered.\n(1) Higher variance in $\\mathbf{A}: \\sigma_{A}^{2}=1$, causing less confounding bias.\n(2) Very rough processes: $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{A}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{Z}$ were Mat\u00e8rn correlation matrices with smoothness 0.5 , equivalent to exponential covariance, making adjustment more challenging due to very rough sample paths. The range parameter for the covariance function was 0.114 to have similar practical spatial range as the other scenarios.\n(3) Gridded spatial locations: Theory requires random spatial locations, but this illustrates the method with (very regular) fixed spatial locations.\n(4) Deterministic function of space, same for $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$ : To avoid over-stating the effectiveness of DSR when the latent functions of space are generated and estimated using GPs, the data were generated using: $Y_{i}=\\beta_{0} A_{i}+g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)+\\epsilon_{0 i}$, and $A_{i}=m_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)+\\epsilon_{1 i}$, where $g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=m_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=\\cos \\left(10 s_{i 1}\\right) \\sin \\left(10 s_{i 2}\\right), \\epsilon_{0 i} \\stackrel{i . i . d .}{\\sim} N\\left(0,1^{2}\\right)$, and $\\epsilon_{1 i} \\stackrel{i . i . d .}{\\sim} N\\left(0,0.1^{2}\\right)$.\n(5) Deterministic function of space, different for $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$ : Similar to the previous scenario, but now $g_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)=m_{0}\\left(\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\right)+\\sin \\left(10 s_{i 1}\\right) \\sin \\left(10 s_{i 2}\\right)$ and $m_{0}$ is defined as in the previous scenario.\n\nPlots of smooth, rough, and very rough simulated spatial surfaces are below in Figures 1, 2, and 3. These are examples of surfaces drawn from the distributions used to generate observations of the treatment variable $\\mathbf{A}$ and the unobserved confounder $\\mathbf{Z}$ in the simulation study. Since these surfaces are drawn randomly in each iteration of the simulation, these are only representative of the level of smoothness in each type of distribution used, and are not actual simulated datasets used. The data in the following plots are placed on a regular\n\ngrid for easier visualization of the smoothnesses, rather than having spatial locations drawn randomly as in most of the simulated scenarios.\n[Figure 1 about here.]\n[Figure 2 about here.]\n[Figure 3 about here.]\nIn implementation of gSEM and Spatial+, no adjustment was made in the bootstrapping procedure for spatial correlation between observations, or the tendency of GAMs to undersmooth in bootstrap samples described in Wood (2017). Spline models, gSEM, and Spatial+ used 300 spline basis functions.",

      "text": "## S6.1 Proof of DML with partially linear model\n\nIn this section we extend Theorem 4.1 from (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which analyzes the partially linear model with a scalar treatment, to a vector treatment. The extension essentially follows the proof of Theorem 4.1 from (Chernozhukov et al., 2018) with slight changes.\n\nWe use \"DML2\", which is Definition 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018), where rather than aggregating K different estimates from K different folds, cross-fitting on the K folds is performed followed by estimation of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$ using the combined cross-fitted estimates.\n\nThe assumed model is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{Y} & =\\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}+g_{0}(\\mathbf{S})+\\mathbf{U} \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}_{j} & =m_{0 j}(\\mathbf{S})+\\mathbf{V}_{j}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith notation and definitions as in the main paper. Nuisance parameters and estimates $\\eta$ are assumed to be in $T$, a convex subset of some normed vector space.\n\nThe \"practical\" DSR estimator uses the score function:\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\eta):=\\left\\{Y-g(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{X}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right\\}(\\mathbf{X}-m(\\mathbf{S}))\n$$\n\nHowever, for theory, we focus on the score function:\n\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\eta):=\\left\\{Y-h(\\mathbf{S})-(\\mathbf{X}-m(\\mathbf{S}))^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right\\}(\\mathbf{X}-m(\\mathbf{S}))\n$$\n\nAssumption 1 consists of those of Assumption 4.1 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018) but expanded to encompass the case $p>1$, the length of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$, and with some other slight changes for theoretical convenience. Let $\\left\\{\\delta_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\Delta_{n}\\right\\}$ be sequences of positive constants converging\n\nto 0 . Let $c, C$, and $q$ be fixed strictly positive constants such that $q>4$, and let $K \\geqslant 2$ be a fixed integer. For any $\\eta=\\left(\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ldots, \\ell_{m}\\right)$ for any positive integer $m$ such that $\\ell_{1}, \\ldots, \\ell_{m}$ are functions mapping $\\mathcal{S}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, denote $\\|\\eta\\|_{P, q}=\\max _{1, \\ldots, m}\\left\\{\\left\\|\\ell_{1}\\right\\|_{P, q}, \\ldots,\\left\\|\\ell_{m}\\right\\|_{P, q}\\right\\}$.\n\nAssumption 1 (Regularity Conditions for partially linear regression model): Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the collection of probability laws $P$ for $\\mathbf{W}=(Y, \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{S})$ such that\na) Model (11) holds,\nb) $\\left\\|V_{1}\\right\\|_{P, q}, \\ldots,\\left\\|V_{p}\\right\\|_{P, q} \\leqslant C$ and $\\left\\|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right\\|_{\\infty} \\leqslant C$,\nc) The eigenvalues of the matrix $E\\left[U^{2} \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right]$ are greater than or equal to $c^{2}$ and the matrix $E\\left[\\mathbf{V V}^{T}\\right]$ has singular values at least $c$ and no greater than $C$,\nd) $\\left\\|E\\left[U^{2}|\\mathbf{S}]\\|_{P, \\infty} \\leqslant C\\right.\\right.$ and $\\left\\|E\\left[V_{j}^{2}|\\mathbf{S}]\\|_{P, \\infty} \\leqslant C\\right.$ for $j=1, \\ldots, p$,\ne) Given a random subset $I$ of $[n]$ of size $n / K$, the nuisance parameter estimator $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}=$ $\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{i}\\right)_{i \\in I^{C}}\\right)$ obey the following conditions for all $n / K \\geqslant 1$ : with $P$-probability no less than $1-\\Delta_{n}$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}-\\eta_{0}\\right\\|_{P, \\infty} \\leqslant C,\\left\\|\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}-\\eta_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant \\delta_{n}\n$$\n\nand for the score $\\psi$ in (13), where $\\widehat{\\eta}=\\left(\\widehat{\\ell}_{0}, \\widehat{m}_{10}, \\ldots, \\widehat{m}_{p 0}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\times\\left(\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2}+\\left\\|\\widehat{\\ell}_{0}-\\ell_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2}\\right) \\leqslant \\delta_{n} n^{-1 / 2} \\text { for } j=1, \\ldots, p\n$$\n\nThe following lemma is Theorem 4.1 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018) but expanded to the case $p>1$.\n\nLemma 1 (DML inference in the partially linear regression model with $p>1$ ): Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then the DML2 estimator constructed in Definition 3.2 of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) using the score (13) obeys\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1 / 2} \\sqrt{n}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right) \\xrightarrow{P} N\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)\n$$\n\nuniformly over $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=\\left[E\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right)\\right]^{-1} E\\left(U^{2} \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right)\\left[E\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$. The result continues to hold if $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is replaced by $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}$ from Theorem 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018).\n\nThe proof for Lemma 1 follows the proof of Theorem 4.1 in Chernozhukov et al. (2018) closely, only needing to add steps to deal with the vector-valued $\\psi$ and matrix-valued $\\psi^{a}$, and changing some assumptions slightly for convenience. The proof verifies Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018), from which the conclusion of Lemma 1 follows from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018).\n\nProof. [Proof of Lemma 1] Observe that the score (13) is linear in $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\psi(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\eta) & =\\left\\{Y-\\ell(\\mathbf{S})-(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S}))^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right\\}(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S}))=\\psi^{a}(\\mathbf{W} ; \\eta) \\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\psi^{b}(\\mathbf{W} ; \\eta) \\\\\n\\psi^{a}(\\mathbf{W} ; \\eta) & =-(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S}))(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S}))^{T}, \\quad \\psi^{b}(\\mathbf{W} ; \\eta)=(Y-\\ell(\\mathbf{S}))(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S}))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to verify Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Let $\\mathcal{T}_{n}$ be the set of all $\\eta=\\left(\\ell, m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{p}\\right)$ consisting of $P$-square-integrable functions $\\ell, m_{1}, \\ldots, m_{p}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left\\|\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}-\\eta_{0}\\right\\|_{P, q} \\leqslant C,\\left\\|\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}-\\eta_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant \\delta_{n} \\\\\n\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\times\\left(\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2}+\\left\\|\\widehat{\\ell}_{0}-\\ell_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2}\\right) \\leqslant \\delta_{n} n^{-1 / 2}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWe replace the constant $q$ and the sequence $\\left\\{\\delta_{n}\\right\\}$ in Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018) by $q / 2$ and $\\left\\{\\delta_{n}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, with $\\delta_{n}^{\\prime}=\\left(2 p^{2} C+\\sqrt{C} p+\\sqrt{p C}+p C+p C \\sqrt{p C}+\\right.$ $\\left.\\sqrt{p} p C^{2}+4 \\sqrt{p}\\right)\\left(\\delta_{n} \\vee n^{-[(1-4 / q) \\wedge(1 / 2)]}\\right)$ for all $n$. As in Chernozhukov et al. (2018), we use five steps.\n\nStep 1. Verify Neyman orthogonality. Note that $E\\left[\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]=0$ by the definitions of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}$. For any $\\eta \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n}$, the Gateaux derivative in the direction $\\eta-\\eta_{0}$ is given by, for $r=0$, (see derivation in Step 5):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{\\eta} E\\left[\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]\\left[\\eta-\\eta_{0}\\right] & =-E\\left[\\left(Y-\\ell_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\right]-E\\left[\\left(\\ell(\\mathbf{S})-\\ell_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& +E\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right] \\\\\n& +E\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy the law of iterated expectation, and since $\\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ and $U=Y-\\ell_{0}(\\mathbf{S})$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial_{\\eta} E\\left[\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right]\\left[\\eta-\\eta_{0}\\right] & =E\\left\\{E\\left[U \\times\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right) \\mid \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{S}\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& -E\\left\\{E\\left[\\left(\\ell(\\mathbf{S})-\\ell_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right) \\mathbf{V} \\mid \\mathbf{S}\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& +E\\left\\{E\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right) \\mathbf{V}^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0} \\mid \\mathbf{S}\\right]\\right\\} \\\\\n& +E\\left\\{E\\left[\\mathbf{V}\\left(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{S})-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0} \\mid \\mathbf{S}\\right]\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is equal to 0 since $E[\\mathbf{V} \\mid \\mathbf{S}]=\\mathbf{0}$ and $E[U \\mid \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{S}]=0$. This gives Assumption 3.1(d) from Chernozhukov et al. (2018) with $\\lambda_{n}=0$.\n\nStep 2. By definition,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ_{0} & =E\\left[\\psi^{a}\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\eta_{0}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =E\\left[-\\left(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{X}-\\mathbf{m}_{0}(\\mathbf{S})\\right)^{T}\\right] \\\\\n& =E\\left[-\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy assumption 1(c), the singular values of this matrix are between $c_{0}$ and $C$. This satisfies Assumption 3.1 (e) from Chernozhukov et al. (2018). Since the map $\\eta \\mapsto E\\left[\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta\\right)\\right]$ is twice Gateux-differentiable in $T$, this completes verification of Assumption 3.1 from Chernozhukov et al. (2018).\n\nStep 3. Assumption 3.2(a) from Chernozhukov et al. (2018) holds by construction of $\\mathcal{T}_{n}$ and Assumption 1(e). In addition, $\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)=U \\mathbf{V}$, so the eigenvalues of the matrix\n\n$$\nE\\left[\\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right) \\psi\\left(\\mathbf{W} ; \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}, \\eta_{0}\\right)^{T}\\right]=E\\left[U^{2} \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{V}^{T}\\right]\n$$\n\nare bounded below by $c_{0}$ by Assumption 1(c). This verifies Assumption 3.2(d) from Chernozhukov et al. (2018).\n\nStep 4. Next, we verify Assumption 3.2(b) from Chernozhukov et al. (2018).

[Proof of Theorem 1] First note that estimation of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}$ by $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{D S R}$ using Algorithm 1 is equivalent to using DML2 in Definition 3.2 of Chernozhukov et al. (2018), under the Partially Linear Regression DML estimation established by Lemma 1, and estimation of the nuisance parameters uses the same Gaussian Process (GP) estimates used in Facts 2 and 3. Therefore, the result of Theorem 1 follows from satisfying Assumption 1, which in turn is achieved in part by satisfying the assumptions for Facts 2 and 3 which establish the necessary convergence rates for prediction using GP regression.\n\nIn Assumption 1, (a) follows by Assumption A1, (b) follows from the assumption of bounded or normal distributions of $U, V_{j}$, so that all moments are finite, and the assumption that $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, and (c) and (d) follow from Assumption A2.\n\nTo satisfy (e) in Assumption 1, first note that by Assumption A4 the components of $\\eta_{0}$ are bounded in some interval, and that the nuisance parameter estimates are clipped accordingly to reside in some interval, satisfying $\\left\\|\\eta_{0}-\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}\\right\\|_{P, \\infty}<C$ for some $C>0$ (recall the notation $\\left\\|\\eta_{0}-\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}\\right\\|_{P, q}=\\max _{j}\\left\\|\\eta_{0 j}-\\widehat{\\eta}_{0 j}\\right\\|_{P, q}$ for $\\left.q \\in[0, \\infty)\\right)$. Next apply Lemmas 2 and 3 to satisfy the convergence rate requirements. Let $\\alpha_{X} \\geqslant \\frac{d}{2}$ and $\\alpha_{X}>1$ per Assumption A6. Then if each $m_{j 0}$ is estimated by $\\widehat{m}_{j 0}$ using a Gaussian process mean with clipping at appropriate bounds as in Facts 2 and 3, then with probability no less than $1-\\frac{2}{n},\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant C_{j} \\log (n) n^{-\\frac{\\alpha_{X}}{2 \\alpha_{X}+d}+\\xi}$ for any $\\xi>0$ and some $C_{j}>0$, and $n^{-\\frac{\\alpha_{X}}{2 \\alpha_{X}+d}}<n^{-1 / 4}$. Let $\\gamma=\\frac{\\alpha_{X}}{2 \\alpha_{X}+d}-1 / 4>0$. Then with probability no less than $1-\\frac{2}{n},\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant C_{j} \\log (n) n^{-1 / 4} n^{-\\gamma} n^{\\xi}$, for all $\\xi>0$. Pick $\\xi<\\gamma$. Let $\\gamma^{*}=\\gamma-\\xi>0$. This holds for $j=1, \\ldots, p$; let $C_{m}$ be greater than or equal to all $C_{j}$. Then letting $\\delta_{n}^{\\prime}=C_{m}\\left(\\log (n) n^{-\\gamma^{*}}\\right) \\vee n^{-1 / 4} \\rightarrow 0$, we have that $\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{j 0}-m_{j 0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant \\delta_{n}^{\\prime} n^{-1 / 4}$ with probability no less than $1-\\frac{2}{n}$ for all $m_{0 j}, j=1, \\ldots, p$, and if $\\alpha_{Y} \\geqslant \\frac{d}{2}$ and $\\alpha_{Y}>\\frac{d^{2}}{4 \\alpha_{X}}$, the analogous result holds for $g_{0}$ as well.\n\nSince all of the errors (of estimates of $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 p}$ ) individually obey the desired rates, each with marginal probability no less than $1-\\frac{2}{n}$, there exists a sequence $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$ such that with probability no less than $1-\\Delta_{n}$, all estimates of $g_{0}, m_{01}, \\ldots, m_{0 p}$ simultaneously obey the desired error bounds. To see why, let $A_{k n}, k=1, \\ldots, K, n=1,2, \\ldots$ be a finite number $K$ of sequences of events, such that $P\\left(A_{k n}\\right) \\rightarrow 1$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ for each $k . P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cup A_{2 n}\\right)=P\\left(A_{1 n}\\right)+$ $P\\left(A_{2 n}\\right)-P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cap A_{2 n}\\right)$, and since $P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cup A_{2 n}\\right) \\geqslant P\\left(A_{1 n}\\right), P\\left(A_{2 n}\\right)$, we have that $P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cup\\right.$ $\\left.A_{2 n}\\right) \\rightarrow 1$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. Hence, $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cap A_{2 n}\\right)=\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(A_{1 n}\\right)+\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(A_{2 n}\\right)-$ $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cup A_{2 n}\\right)=1$. Applying induction establishes that $\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cap A_{2 n} \\cap \\ldots \\cap\\right.$ $\\left.A_{K n}\\right)=1$. Therefore, there exists some sequence $L_{n} \\rightarrow 0$ such that $P\\left(A_{1 n} \\cap A_{2 n} \\cap \\ldots \\cap A_{K n}\\right) \\geqslant$ $1-L_{n}$.\n\nTherefore, there exists some sequence $\\Delta_{n} \\rightarrow 0$ such that $\\left\\|\\widehat{g}_{0}-g_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\times\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{0 j}-m_{0 j}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant$ $C \\delta_{n} n^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\left\\|\\widehat{m}_{0 j}-m_{0 j}\\right\\|_{P, 2}^{2} \\leqslant C \\delta_{n} n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, and $\\left\\|\\widehat{\\eta}_{0}-\\eta_{0}\\right\\|_{P, 2} \\leqslant \\delta_{n}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, p$, with $\\delta_{n}=\\delta_{n}^{\\prime 2} \\geqslant n^{-1 / 2}$, with probability no less than $1-\\Delta_{n}$.\n\nThus part (e) of Assumption 1 is satisfied.\nWith parts (a)-(e) of Assumption 1 satisfied, apply Lemma 1 to obtain $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}\\right)^{-1 / 2}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{0}-\\right.$ $\\left.\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{0}\\right) \\xrightarrow{D} N\\left(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)$.",

  "abstract": "Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial\nregression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the\nindependent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This\ncould occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant\nassociated with the independent and outcome variables in a spatial regression\nanalysis. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an\nestimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response\nvariables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been\nproposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's\nproperties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double\nmachine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures.\nWe propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using\nGaussian processes with Mat\\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and\nterm this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive\nregularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and\nclosed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard\nspatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can\nmitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.",
