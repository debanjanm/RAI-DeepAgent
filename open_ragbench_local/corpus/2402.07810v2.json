InTRODUCTION\n\n1.1. Main Results. Let $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be a closed manifold. Define its $l^{\\infty}$ width $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ as the infimum over all $(n-1)$-dimensional polyhedra $K^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and all continuous maps $\\phi: M^{n} \\longrightarrow K^{n-1}$ of $\\sup _{x \\in M^{n}}\\|x-$ $\\phi(x)\\|_{l^{\\infty}}$, where the distance between $x$ and $\\phi(x)$ is calculated with respect to the $l^{\\infty}$-norm. Denote by $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ the Euclidean volume of $M^{n}$.\n\nHere are our main results:\nTheorem 1.1. Let $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be a closed manifold. Then $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq$ $C \\sqrt{n} \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, where $C$ is an absolute constant (that, in particular, does not depend on $n$.) One can take $C=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}(1+o(1))$ as $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$.\n\nTheorem 1.2. Let $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be a closed hypersurface. Then $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq 3^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$.\n\nObserve that if $k \\in K^{n-1}$, then for every two points $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in$ $\\phi^{-1}(k) \\subset M^{n}$ the $l^{\\infty}$-distance between $x_{1}, x_{2}$ does not exceed $2 W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Therefore, if one considers $M^{n}$ with the extrinsic metric induced by\n\nthe ambient $N$-dimensional space regarded as $l_{\\infty}^{N}$, then we see that $U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq 2 W_{n-1}^{\\Gamma \\infty}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Here $U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ denotes the $(n-1)$ dimensional Urysohn width of $M^{n}$ defined as the infimum over all $(n-1)$ dimensional polyhedra $K^{n-1}$ and all continuous maps $\\phi: M^{n} \\longrightarrow K^{n-1}$ of $\\sup _{k \\in K^{n-1}} \\operatorname{diam}\\left(\\phi^{-1}(k)\\right)$. Informally, it measures how far is $M^{n}$ from an $(n-1)$-dimensional polyhedron.\n\nAn example of a smoothed-out unit cube demonstrates that Theorem 1.2 is optimal up to a constant factor. (In other words, one cannot replace factor $3^{\\frac{1}{n}}$ in the right-hand side of the inequality by $o(1)$, as $n \\longrightarrow \\infty$.) On the other hand we do not know if the estimate in Theorem 1.1 is optimal up to a constant factor.\n\nA (non-simply connected) manifold $M^{n}$ is called essential if there is no continuous map from $M^{n}$ to a polyhedron $K$ of dimension at most $n-1$ that induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups of $M^{n}$ and $K$. Examples of essential closed manifolds include all nonsimply-connected closed surfaces, and, more generally, all aspherical manifolds, as well as all projective spaces $\\mathbb{R} P^{n}$. In his foundational paper [G] Gromov proved that the length, sys $_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$, of the shortest non-contractible closed curve on $M^{n}$ (which is the same as the shortest non-contractible periodic geodesic on $M^{n}$ ) satisfies the inequality $\\operatorname{sys}_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq c(n) \\operatorname{vol}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. This inequality is now known as Gromov's systolic inequality. (On the other hand I. Babenko ([B]) demonstrated that this inequality does not hold for any non-essential manifold $M^{n}$.) The original proof of Gromov yielded $c(n) \\sim n^{\\frac{3}{2} n}$. A later, simpler, proof by S. Wenger ([W]), yields $c(n) \\sim n^{n}$. The best currently known upper bound for $c(n)$ is $2\\left(\\frac{n!}{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq n$ and was found in $[\\mathrm{N}]$ building upon ideas from paper $[\\mathrm{P}]$ by P. Papasoglou. Papasoglou was not interested in estimating $c(n)$ but the construction in $[\\mathrm{P}]$ (as is) would yield an upper bound of the form $\\exp ($ const $n)$.\n\nOn the other hand the round metrics on $\\mathbb{R} P^{n}$ (as well as some metrics on flat tori) have $s y s_{1} \\sim \\sqrt{n} v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, and Gromov conjectured that the optimal value of $c(n)$ is attained on round projective spaces. One can also consider a weaker conjecture that the optimal value of $c(n)$ exceeds $\\operatorname{sys}_{1}\\left(\\left(\\mathbb{R} P^{n}, \\operatorname{can}\\right)\\right) / v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(\\left(\\mathbb{R} P^{n}, \\operatorname{can}\\right)\\right)$ by not more than a constant factor that does not depend on the dimension:\n\nConjecture 1.3. There exists an absolute constant $C$ such that for each essential closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n} \\operatorname{sys}_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq C \\sqrt{n} v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$.\n\nIn [G] Gromov conjectured that $U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq c(n) v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. This conjecture is stronger than the systolic inequality because of the inequality $\\operatorname{sys}_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq 3 U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ that holds for all essential manifolds $M^{n}$. This inequality was proven by Gromov in the same paper. The proof is short and not difficult. A different short proof of a similar inequality $\\operatorname{sys}_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq$ $2 U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ for essential $M^{n}$ based on ideas of A. Schwarz ([S]) and an\n\nobservation of R. Karasev that they can be applied in this situation can be found in $[\\mathrm{N}]$.\n\nThis conjecture by Gromov was proven by L. Guth in [Gu1], [Gu2]. He proved that for each closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$\n\n$$\nU W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq c(n) \\operatorname{vol}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is now natural to conjecture that:\nConjecture 1.4. There exists a constant $C$ such that for each Riemannian manifold (and even Riemannian polyhedron) $M^{n}$\n\n$$\nU W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq C \\sqrt{n} \\operatorname{vol}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that Gromov's proof of the inequality $s y s_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq 3 U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ for essential $M^{n}$ as well as the proof of similar inequality $s y s_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq$ $2 U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ in [N] both hold for Riemannian polyhedra. Therefore, Conjecture 1.4 immediately implies Conjecture 1.3 for Riemannian polyhedra. It was proven in $[\\mathrm{N}]$ that $U W_{n-1}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq 2(n / 2)^{\\frac{1}{n}} v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq n v o l^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$.\n\nOne of the central ideas of $[\\mathrm{G}]$ is to use Kuratowski embedding $\\kappa: M^{n} \\longrightarrow$ $L^{\\infty}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ that sends each point $x \\in M^{n}$ to the distance function $\\operatorname{dist}(x, *)$. As this embedding is distance-preserving, the Hausdorff measures of the images of subsets of $M^{n}$ in $L^{\\infty}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ coincide with the Hausdorff measures of the same subsets in $M^{n}$.\n\nIt was observed in [Gu0] that there is no need to use an infinite dimensional space $L^{\\infty}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ here. One can use only the distance functions to points from a sufficiently dense (finite) set. While the embedding will not be isometric, the map from $M^{n}$ to its image in a finite-dimensional $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ can be made $(1+\\varepsilon)$-bilipschitz for an arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon$.\n\nTherefore, Conjectures 1.3 and 1.4 would follow from the positive answer for the following problem:\nProblem 1. Let $M^{n} \\subset l_{\\infty}^{N}$ be a closed manifold (or a polyhedron). Is it true that $W_{n-1}^{\\ell^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq$ const $\\sqrt{n} H_{n}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$, where $H_{n}$ denotes $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure defined with respect to the metric of the ambient space $l_{\\infty}^{N}$.\n\nTo compare our results with this conjecture, note that we can consider a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-bilipschitz embedding of $M^{n}$ in $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ as above and then apply Theorem 1.1. As the result we will obtain an upper bound for $W^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Yet in the right hand side we will have the volume, or, equivalently, the $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure with respect to the Euclidean metric on the ambient space $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ instead of the desired $l^{\\infty}$-Hausdorff measure $H_{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Note that each Euclidean ball of radius $r$ is contained in a cube with sidelength $2 r$ with the same center, that is, the $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ ball of radius $r$. Recall that the contribution of a Euclidean ball (respectively, the concentric cube) of infinitesimally small radius $r$ to the volume $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ (respectively, $H_{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ ) will be equal to the volume of the Euclidean ball of radius $r$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\geq H_{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Hence, Theorem 1.1. is strictly weaker than the inequality in Problem 1,\n\nand the right hand side in the inequality in Theorem 1.1 can be $\\sim \\sqrt{N}$ larger than the right hand side of the inequality in Problem 1.\n\nStill, our results can be used to obtain new information about shortest non-contractible closed curves in essential manifolds:\nTheorem 1.5. Assume that a $C^{1}$-smooth closed manifold $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is essential.\n(1) There exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^{n}$ contained in a cube in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with side length $\\frac{8 \\pi}{\\sqrt{n}}(1+o(1)) \\sqrt{n}$ vol $\\frac{1}{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Moreover, the cube has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n(2) If the codimension $N-n$ is equal to one, then a non-contractible closed curve on $M^{n}$ is contained in a cube with side length $4 \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$ and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nThis theorem immediately follows from Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and the following result that will be proven in the next section:\nTheorem 1.6. Assume that $C^{1}$-smooth closed manifold $M^{n} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is essential. Then for each $l>2 W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ there exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^{n}$ contained in an open cube in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with side length $l$ and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nObserve, that when the codimension is equal to 1 the upper bound for the minimal side length of the cube that contains a non-contractible closed curve on, say, a flat $n$-dimensional torus isometrically $C^{1}$-embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is better by a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$ than the optimal upper bound for the length of the shortest non-contractible curve. (Note that the Nash-Kuiper theorem implies that each Riemannian manifold diffeomorphic to $T^{n}$ can be isometrically embedded to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by means of a $C^{1}$-smooth embedding.) A possible explanation will be that each isometric embedding of flat $T^{n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with sys $_{1} \\sim \\sqrt{n}$ vol $\\frac{1}{n}$ has a distortion $\\geq$ const $\\sqrt{n}$. Indeed, a theorem of Khot and Naor ([KN]) implies that \"many\" flat tori cannot be bi-Lipschitz embedded in any Euclidean space or even $l^{2}$ with distortion $\\leq$ const $\\sqrt{n}$. In view of this result, it seems possible that dimensionless estimate in Theorem 1.5 holds not only in the case of codimension 1 but for all codimensions.\n\nAnother natural question is what happens if we replace $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}$ in Theorems 1.1, 1.2 by $W_{n-1}^{\\text {Eud }}$, where the distance is calculated with respect to the (Euclidean) metric on the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. As Euclidean balls are smaller than $l^{\\infty}$-balls of the same radius, $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq W_{n-1}^{\\text {Eud }}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. Now, observe that one can repeat the proof of Theorem $1.2(2)$ from $[\\mathrm{N}]$ to obtain the following linear in $n$ estimate for $W_{n-1}^{\\text {Eud }}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ :\n\nTheorem 1.7.\n\n$$\nW_{n-1}^{\\text {Eud }}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq n \\operatorname{vol}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe observed above that for $M^{n} \\subset l_{\\infty}^{N}$ Theorem 1.1 immediately implies that\n\n$$\nW_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq \\text { const } \\sqrt{n N} H_{n}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ denotes the Hausdorff measure with respect to the $l^{\\infty}$-metric. However, the argument of the proof of Theorem 1.2(2) in [N] also yields the following inequality that does not involve $N$ :", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "# Theorem 1.8. \n\n$$\nW_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right) \\leq \\text { const } n^{\\frac{3}{2}} H_{n}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe only difference between the proof of this theorem and the previous one is that one needs to replace the coarea formula not available for $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ by the coarea inequality (a.k.a. Eilenberg's inequality) that leads to an extra $\\sqrt{n}$ factor in comparison with the inequality in Theorem 1.7. Alternatively, Theorem 1.8 immediately follows from Theorem 1.4 in [N] and the obvious inequality between the Hausdorff content $H C_{n}$ in [N] and the corresponding Hausdorff measure.\n\nThe proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are based on different ideas. In order to prove Theorem 1.1 we modify the Federer-Fleming idea of projecting a \"small\" set $M^{n}$ to a random shift of the $(n-1)$-skeleton of the cubic grid in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ using an appropriately shifted copy of the $(N-n)$-skeleton of the cubic grid that does not intersect $M^{n}$. Instead, we use an optimal $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic foam in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ constructed in [KORW] and [AK]. We also prove a version of the kinematic formula, where an averaging with respect to all isometries of the ambient Euclidean spaces is replaced by an averaging with respect to all isometries of $l^{\\infty}$ (Theorem 3.5). Then we use this formula to construct \"small\" $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic intersections of appropriately shifted copies of the foam that play the role of the randomly shifted high-codimensional skeleta of the cubic grid in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. The nerve of the covering of the complement of the intersection by connected components of the complements of the shifted copies of the foam plays the role of the dual grid.\n\nThe main idea of the proof of Theorem 1.2 is to replace a shifted copy of the 1-skeleton of the cubic grid (that would be used in the Federer-Fleming construction) by a non-periodic curvilinear homeomorphic set in the complement of $M^{n},(n=N-1)$. The intersection of this set with each cube consists of six paths connecting a point in the complement of $M^{n}$ with $2 N$ points on different faces of the cube. The relative isoperimetric inequality for the $N$-cube plays the crucial role in the proof of the existence of these graphs in the complement of $M^{n}$ in each cube.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "## 2. Proof of Theorem 1.6\n\nWe are going to assume that there exists a positive $\\delta_{0}$ such that every closed curve in $M^{n}$ contained in every open cube in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with side length $2 \\cdot W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)+\\delta_{0}$ and sides parallel to coordinate axes is contractible. Using this assumption we will prove that $M^{n}$ is not essential.\n\nThe definition of $W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ implies that for arbitrary small positive $\\varepsilon$ there exists a continuous map $\\phi_{\\varepsilon}: M^{n} \\longrightarrow K^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ such that for\n\nall $x \\in M^{n}\\|x-\\phi(x)\\|_{l^{\\infty}}<W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)+\\varepsilon$. As $K^{n-1}$ is at most $(n-1)$ dimensional, there exists an arbitrarily fine open covering $\\left\\{V_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$ of $K^{n-1}$ such that each point of $K^{n-1}$ is covered by at most $n$ open sets $\\left\\{V_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$. For each $\\delta>0$ choosing a sufficiently fine covering, we can ensure that all connected components of sets $\\phi_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}\\left(V_{\\alpha}\\right)$ form a covering of $M^{n}$ of multiplicity $\\leq n$ by connected open sets of $l^{\\infty}$-diameter $<2 W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)+\\delta$ in $l^{\\infty}$ metric on the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. The last condition implies that each set of the covering of $M^{n}$ is contained in an open cube with side length $2 W_{n-1}^{l^{\\infty}}\\left(M^{n}\\right)+\\delta$ and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. If $\\delta<\\delta_{0}$, our assumption implies that closed curves in all open sets of the covering of $M^{n}$ are contractible in $M^{n}$. This makes this open cover of multiplicity $\\leq n$ inessential in terminology of Lemma A. 1 in [ABHK]. This lemma implies that $M^{n}$ is not essential, and this completes the proof of Theorem 1.6.\n\nIn fact Lemma A. 1 in [ABHK] asserts that $M^{n}$ is not essential if and only if $M^{n}$ has an open covering of multiplicity $\\leq n$ such that all closed curves contained in one set of the covering are contractible. (This lemma is similar to Theorem $14^{\\prime}$ in [S], and its proof is based on the same idea.) Here we obviously need this lemma only in one direction. The proof of this lemma in [ABHK] is short and easy to read, but for the sake of completeness we now sketch a somewhat different, more elementary, and more detailed proof of the fact that the existence of an open cover of $M^{n}$ of multiplicity $\\leq n$ by inessential connected sets $U_{\\alpha}$ implies that $M^{n}$ is not essential. (This proof is a more detailed version of the argument at the end of section 2 of $[\\mathrm{N}]$ ):\n\nConsider the universal covering $\\tilde{M}^{n}$ of $M^{n}$. Each element $U_{\\alpha}$ of the open covering lifts to a collection of disjoint connected sets $\\left\\{\\tilde{U}_{\\alpha g}\\right\\}_{g \\in \\pi_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)}$ indexed by elements of $G=\\pi_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$. (The sets are disjoint because $U_{\\alpha}$ is inessential.) Denote by $\\tilde{N}$ the nerve of the open covering $\\left\\{\\tilde{U}_{\\alpha g}\\right\\}_{\\alpha, g}$ of $\\tilde{M}^{n}$. As the underlying open covering has multiplicity $\\leq n$, the dimension of $\\tilde{N}$ is at most $n-1$. Consider a $G$-equivariant partition of unity subordinate to the open covering $\\left\\{\\tilde{U}_{\\alpha g}\\right\\}_{\\alpha, g}$, and the corresponding $G$-equivariant map $\\tilde{\\psi}: \\tilde{M}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{N}$. The group $G$ acts freely and discontinuously on $\\tilde{N}$, and $\\tilde{\\psi}$ is a lift of a map $\\psi: M^{n} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{N} / G$ into a CW-complex $\\tilde{N} / G$ of dimension $\\leq n-1$ that induces monomorphism of fundamental groups. Indeed, if $\\gamma$ is a closed non-contractible loop in $M^{n}$, it lifts into an arc with distinct endpoints in $\\tilde{M}^{n}$, which is being mapped into arc $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ with distinct endpoints in $\\tilde{N}$ by $\\tilde{\\psi}$. As $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is the covering of the loop $\\psi \\circ \\gamma$ in $\\tilde{N} / G, \\psi \\circ \\gamma$ is not contractible.\n\nNow we are going to prove that $\\tilde{N}$ is simply connected. Let $\\gamma$ be a noncontractible curve in $\\tilde{N}$. W.l.o.g. we can assume that $\\gamma$ is simple simplicial curve in the 1-skeleton of $\\tilde{N}$ that is formed by 1 -dimensiinal simplices $\\left[u_{i} u_{i+1}\\right]$ of $\\tilde{N}, i=1, \\ldots, n_{0}, u_{n_{0}+1}=u_{1}$. We observe that the composition of of $\\tilde{\\psi}: \\tilde{M}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{N}$ with each closed curve in $\\tilde{M}^{n}$ is contractible (as $\\tilde{M}^{n}$ is simply-connected). While $\\gamma$ might be not the image of a closed curve in\n\n$\\tilde{M}^{n}$, it is not is not difficult to construct a homotopic curve $\\beta$ that is the image of a close curve $\\alpha$ in $\\tilde{M}^{n}$.\n\nIn order to construct $\\alpha$, (and $\\beta=\\tilde{\\psi} \\circ \\alpha$ ), observe that (1) each vertex $u_{i}$ corresponds to a connected open set $U_{\\alpha_{i} g_{i}}$ in the open cover of $\\tilde{M}^{n}$, and (2) if $u_{i}$ and $u_{i+1}$ are connected by an edge in the nerve $\\tilde{N}$ of the covering, then $U_{\\alpha_{i} g_{i}} \\cap U_{\\alpha_{i+1} g_{i+1}} \\neq \\emptyset$. Now, for each $i$ choose $v_{i} \\in U_{\\alpha_{i} g_{i}}$, and $w_{i} \\in U_{\\alpha_{i} g_{i}} \\bigcap U_{\\alpha_{i+1} g_{i+1}}$. Connect $v_{i}$ with $w_{i}$ by a path $\\alpha_{i 1}$ in $U_{\\alpha_{i} g_{i}}$, and then connect $w_{i}$ and $v_{i+1}$ by a path $\\alpha_{i 2}$ in $U_{\\alpha_{i+1} g_{i+1}}$. Define $\\alpha_{i}$ as the concatenation $\\alpha_{i 1} * \\alpha_{i 2}$ of $\\alpha_{i 1}$ and $\\alpha_{i 2}$, and $\\alpha$ as the concatenation $\\alpha_{1} * \\alpha_{2} \\ldots *$ $\\alpha_{n_{0}}$. To see that there exists a homotopy from $\\beta=\\tilde{\\psi}(\\alpha)$ to $\\gamma$, first observe that $\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(v_{i}\\right)$ is in the (open) star of $v_{i}$, and $\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)$ is in the (open) star of the closed simplex $\\left[u_{i} u_{i+1}\\right]$ in $\\tilde{N}$. For each $i$ choose a path $\\tau_{i}$ from $u_{i}$ to $\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(v_{i}\\right)$ in the star of $u_{i}$ in $\\tilde{N}$. Observe that the closed curve $\\tau_{i} * \\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right) * \\tau_{i+1}^{-1} *$ $\\left[u_{i+1} u_{i}\\right]$ is contractible, as it is contained in the (contractible) (open) star of $\\left[u_{i} u_{i+1}\\right]$ in $\\tilde{N}$. (Here $\\tau_{i+1}^{-1}$ denotes the path $\\tau_{i+1}$ travelled in the opposite direction.) Therefore, for each $i$ there exists a path homotopy between $\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right)$ and $\\tau_{i}^{-1} *\\left[u_{i} u_{i+1}\\right] * \\tau_{i+1}$. Combining these path homotopies for all $i$, and then canceling pairs $\\tau_{i} * \\tau_{i}^{-1}$, we obtain the desired homotopy from $\\beta$ to $\\gamma$.\n\nTo see that monomorphism of the fundamental groups induced by $\\psi$ is also an epimorphism (and, therefore, an isomorphism) we can proceed as follows. Choose a loop $\\lambda$ representing a non-trivial element $g$ in $\\pi_{1}(\\tilde{N} / G)=G$ and lift it to a path $\\tilde{\\lambda}$ connecting the base point $p_{\\tilde{N}}$ and $g p_{\\tilde{N}}$. Without any loss of generality, we can assume that $p_{\\tilde{N}}$ is the image of the base point $p_{\\tilde{M}^{n}}$ under $\\tilde{\\psi}$. Connect $p_{\\tilde{M}^{n}}$ and $g p_{\\tilde{M}^{n}}$ by a path $\\tilde{\\varrho}$ in $\\tilde{M}^{n}$. As $N_{0}$ is simply connected, $\\tilde{\\psi} \\circ \\tilde{\\varrho}$ is path homotopic to $\\tilde{\\lambda}$. Therefore, the covering map projects $\\tilde{\\varrho}$ to a loop $\\varrho$ in $M^{n}$ such that $\\psi(\\varrho)$ is homotopic to $\\lambda$.\n\nAs $\\tilde{N} / G$ is a CW-complex of dimension $\\leq n-1, M^{n}$ is not essential.\nRemark. Instead of proving that $\\tilde{N}$ is simply-connected, if $n \\geq 3$ we could just add 2 -discs killing all generators of $\\pi_{1}\\left(M^{n}\\right)$ in a $G$-equivariant way: Once we attach a 2 -cell along a closed curve $\\gamma$, we also attach 2 -cells along closed curves $g \\gamma$ for all $g \\in G$. As the result, we would obtain a simply-connected complex $N_{0}$ of dimension $\\leq n-1$ and a $G$-equivariant map $\\tilde{M}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\tilde{N} \\longrightarrow N_{0}$ that must induce the isomorphism of fundamental groups of $M^{n}$ and $N_{0} / G$. If $n=2$ (and $n-1=1$ ), even if we do not know that $\\tilde{N}$ is simply connected, we can be sure that $\\tilde{N} / G$ is a 1-dimensional complex, and its fundamental group is free. A monomorphism from the fundamental group of a closed surface to a free group can exists only if the surface is simply-connected, and, therefore, not essential.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "# 3. Proof of Theorem 1.1. \n\n3.1. Kinematic inequalities for $l_{\\infty}^{N}$. We will start from stating the kinematic formula (cf. [F], Theorem 6.2, and the defintion 2.8 for $\\gamma$ ). We will need only its particular case when the curvature measures coincide with\n\nHausdorff measures. Assume that $T^{N-1}$ and $M^{m}$ are two compact submanifolds ( or, more generally, smooth subpolyhedra) of $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Let $G$ denote the group of isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ (generated by rotations and translations). According to the kinematic formula the integral over $G$ of $v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\cap g T^{N-1}\\right)$ equals $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{N}}(1+o(1)) v o l_{N-1}\\left(T^{N-1}\\right) v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right)$, where $g \\in G$. Here we average over the group of rotations (or, more precisely, integrate with the respect to the Haar measure on the orthogonal group where the measure of the whole group is equal to 1 ), and integrate over the group of translations (that can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ ).\n\nHere we will need an analogous formula when the the group of isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is replaced by the group of symmetries of $l_{N}^{\\infty}$. This group is generated by permutation of coordinates, reflections with respect to coordinate hyperplanes (that is, linear transformations $r_{i}$ that change the $i$ th coordinate $x_{i}$ of $x$ to $-x_{i}$ leaving the other coordinates intact), and translations. The first two types of transformations form a finite group of order $2^{N} \\cdot N$ ! isomorphic to the group of signed permutations. As in the particular case of the kinematic formula mentioned above, we are going to first average with respect to the (finite) group of signed permutations and then integrate with respect to the group of translations.\n\nAveraging with respect to the group of signed permutation will be based on the following lemma. A signed permutation $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ consists of a permutation $\\pi$ and an $N$-dimensional vector of signs $\\varepsilon$. Its action on an $N$ dimensional vector $b$ transforms $b$ into the vector $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b=\\left(\\varepsilon_{i} b_{\\pi(i)}\\right)_{i=1}^{N}$. Denote the group of signed permutations acting on $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ (or $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ ) by $S_{N}$.\n\nLemma 3.1. Let $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be two unit vectors. Then the average $\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}\\left|\\varepsilon_{i} a_{i} b_{\\pi(i)}\\right|$ of $|a \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b|$ does not exceed $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}}$.\nProof.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)}\\left|\\Sigma_{i} a_{i} b_{\\pi(i)} \\varepsilon_{i}\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} 1} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)}\\left(\\Sigma_{i} a_{i} b_{\\pi(i)} \\varepsilon_{i}\\right)^{2}}= \\\\\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!}} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\Sigma_{i, j} a_{i} a_{j} b_{\\pi(i)} b_{\\pi(j)} \\varepsilon_{i} \\varepsilon_{j}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nWe are going to analyze the last sum. First, note that for each pair $i, j$, where $i \\neq j$ and each permutation $\\pi$, exactly two combination of signs $\\varepsilon_{i}, \\varepsilon_{j}$ result in $\\varepsilon_{i} \\varepsilon_{j}$ equal to 1 , and exactly two result in -1 . Therefore, all such terms disappear. When $i=j$, we get terms $a_{i}^{2} b_{\\pi(i)}^{2}$ as $\\varepsilon_{i}^{2}$ is always equal to 1. Therefore, the summation over all possible $2^{N}$ combinations of signs will yield $2^{N}$ under the radical sign, that gets cancelled with the same term in the denominator of the factor $\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!}$. Thus, the expression in the right hand side is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N!}} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{\\pi} \\Sigma_{i} a_{i}^{2} b_{\\pi(i)}^{2}}$. In the last double sum each term $a_{i}^{2} b_{j}^{2}$ appears if and only if $\\pi(i)=j$, that is for $(N-1)$ ! permutations $\\pi$. Therefore,\n\nthis expression is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\sqrt{(N-1)!} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{i, j} a_{i}^{2} b_{j}^{2}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{i} a_{i}^{2} \\Sigma_{j} b_{j}^{2}}=$ $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$.\n\nThis lemma is a particular case of the next lemma:\nLemma 3.2. Let $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be a unit vector, $L \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ an m-dimensional linear subspace. Then the average of the lengths of orthogonal projections of $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b$ onto $L$ over the group of signed permutations $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ does not exceed $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}}$.\nProof. The proof generalizes the proof of the previous lemma. Choose an orthonormal basis $a^{(i)}, i=1, \\ldots, m$, of $L$. The length of the projection of a vector $v$ to $L$ is equal to $\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{j=1}^{m}\\left(v \\cdot a^{(j)}\\right)^{2}}$. The average of interest for us is $\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{j=1}^{m}\\left(\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} a_{i}^{(j)} b_{\\pi(i)} \\varepsilon_{i}\\right)^{2}} \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!}} \\sqrt{\\Sigma_{j=1}^{m} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)}\\left(\\Sigma_{i} a_{i}^{(j)} b_{\\pi(i)} \\varepsilon_{i}\\right)^{2}}$.\n\nNow we perform the summations with respect to $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ and with respect to $j$ under the radical sign. As before, for each $j$ the inner sum is equal to $2^{N} \\cdot(N-1)$ !, and we see that the expression in the right hand side of the last inequality is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{N}}$.\n\nLater in the paper we will need the following similar lemma:\nLemma 3.3. Let $L_{1}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m}\\right\\}, L_{2}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right\\}$ be two linear m-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$, where $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m}$ is an orthonormal basis of $L_{1}$, and $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}$ an orthonormal basis of $L_{2}$. For each signed permutation $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ consider the linear space $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) L_{2}=$ $\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b_{1}, \\ldots,(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b_{m}\\right\\}$. Denote the orthogonal projection $L_{1} \\longrightarrow$ $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) L_{2}$ by $P(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$. Denote the ratio of $\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}(P(\\pi, \\varepsilon) \\Omega)}{\\operatorname{vol}(\\Omega)}$ for any bounded domain $\\Omega \\subset L_{1}$ by $\\theta(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$. (It is easy to see that this ratio does not depend on $\\Omega$.) Then $\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\theta(\\pi, \\varepsilon) \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{N}{m}}}$.\n\nProof. Consider the matrix of $P(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ with respect to bases $\\left\\{a_{i}\\right\\}$ in $L_{1}$ and $\\left\\{(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b_{j}\\right\\}$ in $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) L_{2}$. Its entries are the dot products $a_{i} \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) b_{j}$. It can be expressed as the product of the $m \\times N$ matrix $A$ with rows $a_{i}$ and $N \\times m$ matrix $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B$, where $B$ is the matrix with columns $b_{j}$, and $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ acts on all columns of $B$. The quantity of interest is $\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\operatorname{det}(A \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)$. As before, we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to see that this quantity does not exceed $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2^{N} \\cdot N!} \\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\operatorname{det}^{2}(A \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)}$. Now we need to verify that the average of $\\operatorname{det}^{2}(A \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)$ over the group of signed permutations $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ does not exceed $\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}}$.\n\nApplying the Cauchy-Binet formula we see that $\\operatorname{det}(A \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B))=$ $\\Sigma_{S} \\operatorname{det} A_{S} \\cdot((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}$, where $S$ runs over all $\\binom{N}{m}$ subsets of $[N]$ of size $m$, $A_{S}$ is the $m \\times m$ minor of $A$ formed by its columns at indices from $S$. and\n\n$((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}$ denotes the $m \\times m$ minor of $(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B$ formed by its rows at indices from $S$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nd e t^{2}(A \\cdot(\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)=\\Sigma_{S} d e t^{2}\\left(A_{S}\\right) d e t^{2}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}\\right)+ \\\\\n\\Sigma_{\\left\\{S, S^{\\prime} \\mid S^{\\prime} \\neq S\\right\\}} d e t\\left(A_{S}\\right) d e t\\left(A_{S^{\\prime}}\\right) \\operatorname{det}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}\\right) d e t\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S^{\\prime}}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nObserve, that for each pair of distinct $m$-subsets $S, S^{\\prime}$ of $[N]=\\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$ the average of $\\operatorname{det}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}\\right) \\operatorname{det}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S^{\\prime}}\\right)$ with respect to $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ is equal to zero, and, therefore, the second term in the right hand side of the previous formula will vanish after one performs the averaging over the group of signed permutations. Indeed, find $k \\in S^{\\prime} \\backslash S$. For each permutation $\\pi$ and a combination of $N-1$ signs $\\varepsilon_{j}, j \\neq k$, there are two choices for $\\varepsilon_{k}$, leading to two terms with the same absolute values but opposite signs that will cancel each other. Therefore, $\\Sigma_{(\\pi, \\varepsilon)} \\operatorname{det}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}\\right) \\operatorname{det}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S^{\\prime}}\\right)=0$.\n\nNow we need to estimate the average of $\\Sigma_{S} \\operatorname{det}^{2}\\left(A_{S}\\right) \\operatorname{det}^{2}\\left(((\\pi, \\varepsilon) B)_{S}\\right)$ over the group of signed permutation. As each term in this sum does not depend on the choice of signs $\\varepsilon_{j}$, the average is equal to the average of $\\Sigma_{S} \\operatorname{det}^{2}\\left(A_{S}\\right) \\operatorname{det}^{2}\\left((\\pi B)_{S}\\right)$ over the group of all permutations $\\pi$. Observe, that for each pair of $m$-sets $S, S^{\\prime} \\subset[N]$ the number of permutations $\\pi$ such that $\\left\\{\\pi^{-1}(i)\\right\\}_{i \\in S}=S^{\\prime}$ is equal to $m!(N-m)$ !. Therefore, the average\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{1}{N!} \\Sigma_{\\pi, S} d e t^{2}\\left(A_{S}\\right) d e t^{2}\\left((\\pi B)_{S}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}} \\Sigma_{S, S^{\\prime}} d e t^{2}\\left(A_{S}\\right) d e t^{2}\\left(B_{S^{\\prime}}\\right)= \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}} \\Sigma_{S} d e t\\left(A_{S}\\left(A_{S}\\right)^{T}\\right) \\Sigma_{S^{\\prime}} d e t\\left(B_{S^{\\prime}}\\left(B_{S^{\\prime}}\\right)^{T}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}} d e t\\left(A A^{T}\\right) d e t\\left(B B^{T}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere the last equality again follows from the Cauchy-Binet formula. Now it remains to recall that vectors $a_{i}$ form an orthonormal system, and, therefore, $A A^{T}=I$, where $I$ denotes the identity matrix. Similarly, $B B^{T}=I$. Therefore, the average is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}}$, which completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nFinally, we are going to state two $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ kinematic inequalities. The first one is based on Lemma 3.2. Consider the group $G_{N}$ of isometries of $l_{\\infty}^{N}$ (or $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ ) generated by the group $S_{N}$ of signed permutations and the group of translations $E_{N}$ that can be identified with $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Note that the same group acts on spaces of compact submanifolds, or more generally, subpolyhedra of $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of every dimension. (Here and below we assume that all faces of considered subpolyhedra are smooth.) If $P^{k} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a $k$-dimensional polyhedron, $s=(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$ a signed permutation, and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ a vector, then $s P^{k}+x$ will be the polyhedron obtained from $P^{k}$ by acting on it by $s$, and then translating the result by $x$. Given a polyhedron $M^{l}$ of dimension $l \\geq N-k$ we will be interested in the average $A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{k+l-N}\\left(M^{l} \\bigcap s P^{k}\\right)$ over all $s \\in S_{N}$, and in the integral over $E_{N}=\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of $A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{k+l-N}\\left(M^{l} \\bigcap\\left(s P^{k}+x\\right)\\right)$ with respect to $d x$. Here is our result:\n\nTheorem 3.4. (1) Let $P^{N-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and $M^{m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be two polyhedra. Then $\\int_{E_{N}} A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P^{N-1}+x\\right)\\right) d x \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) v o l_{N-1}\\left(P^{N-1}\\right)$.\n(2) Assume that $P^{N-1}$ is an unbounded $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic polyhedron. Denote the intersection of $P^{N-1}$ with some $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-metric ball $C$ of radius 1 by $P_{0}$, and the volume of $P_{0}$ by $v$. (It is easy to see that $v$ does not depend on the choice of the $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-metric ball.) Then\n\n$$\n\\int_{[0,1]^{N}} A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P^{N-1}+x\\right)\\right) d x \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) \\cdot v\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exist a signed permutation $s_{0}$ and some $x_{0} \\in[0,1]^{N}$ such that\n\n$$\nv o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s_{0} P^{N-1}+x_{0}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) \\cdot v\n$$\n\n(3) Assume that $M^{m}$ and $P^{N-1}$ are both unbounded $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic polyhedra. Then there exists a signed permutation $s_{0}$ and $x_{0} \\in[0,1]^{N}$ such that for each $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-metric ball $C$ of radius 1\n$v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s_{0} P^{N-1}+x_{0}\\right) \\bigcap C\\right) \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap C\\right) v o l_{N-1}\\left(P^{N-1} \\bigcap C\\right)$.\nProof. (1) Observe that by additivity, it is sufficient to prove this result when both $P^{N-1}$ and $M^{m}$ are the interiors of compact manifolds with boundary. Further, we can partition $P^{N-1}$ into arbitrarily small elements that are arbitrarily close to a domain in a tangent hyperplane. Up to infinitisemally small terms we can assume that $P^{N-1}$ is an open disc $D^{N-1}$ of a small radius $\\Delta$ in a hyperplane with a unit normal vector $b$. Similarly, we can reduce $M^{m}$ to an infinitisemally small flat disc $B^{m}$ of radius $\\delta$, and we can assume that $\\Delta \\gg>\\delta$, yet $\\Delta$ is still infinitesimally small. We will be studying intersections of $s D^{N-1}+x$ with $B^{m}$. The subsequent integration will yield the product $v o l_{m}\\left(M^{n}\\right) v o l_{N-1}\\left(P^{N-1}\\right)$. We will try to determine the constant that will be multiplied by this product.\n\nFix the angle $\\alpha$ between $B^{m}$ and the straight line $l$ perpendicular to $D^{N-1}$. Consider the integral of $v o l_{m-1}\\left(B^{m} \\bigcap\\left(D^{N-1}+x\\right)\\right)$, where $x$ varies over $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. We will be integrating first along $l$, and then along $L^{N-1}$. Assume that the projection of the center of $B^{m}$ to $L^{N-1}$ is in the disc concentric with $D^{N-1}$ of radius $\\Delta-\\delta$. Let $u_{0}$ denote a unit vector spanning $l$. Then, when we translate $D^{N-1}$ along $l, B^{m}$ will be sliced in parallel round $(m-1)$ dimensional discs, and the integral $\\int_{l} v o l_{m-1}\\left(B^{m} \\bigcap\\left(D^{N-1}+t u_{0}\\right)\\right) d t$ will be equal to $v o l_{m}\\left(B^{m}\\right)|\\cos \\alpha|$. (To formally prove this assertion observe that we are integrating the $(m-1)$-dimensional volumes of the inverse images of the function $f$ on $B^{m}$ defined as the projection on $l$. The norm of the gradient of $f$ is equal to $|\\cos \\alpha|$. Now the assertion immediately follows from the coarea formula.) If the projection of the center of $B^{m}$ to $D^{N-1}$ will be outside of the disc concentric with $D^{N-1}$ of radius $\\Delta+\\delta$, then the integral\n\nover $l$ will be equal to 0 , as $D^{N-1}+t u_{0}$ will never intersect $B^{m}$. If the projection of the center of $B^{m}$ to $D^{N-1}$ will be in the annulus between balls with radii $\\Delta-\\delta$ and $\\Delta+\\delta$ with the same center as $D^{N-1}$ the the integral over $l$ will be between 0 and $\\left.\\operatorname{vol}_{m}\\left(B^{m}\\right)\\right\\rvert\\, \\cos \\alpha \\mid$. Therefore, after integrating over $L^{N-1}$ we will get $\\left.\\operatorname{vol}_{m}\\left(B^{m}\\right)\\right\\rvert\\, \\cos \\alpha \\mid \\cdot \\operatorname{vol}_{N-1}\\left(D^{N-1}\\right)(1+o(1))$, when $\\frac{\\delta}{\\Delta} \\longrightarrow 0$. Lemma 3.2 implies that for every $\\alpha$ the average of $|\\cos \\alpha|$ over the angles corresponding to all $2^{N} \\cdot N$ ! signed permutations applied to $D^{N-1}$ will not exceed $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{N}}$. Therefore, the average over all signed permutations $s$ of the integral over all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of the volume of $B^{m} \\cap\\left(s D^{N-1}+x\\right)$ will not exceed $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(B^{m}\\right) v o l_{N-1}\\left(D^{N-1}\\right)(1+o(1))$. Now the integration over $M^{m}$ and then $P^{N-1}$ yields the desired upper bound $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{N}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) v o l_{N-1}\\left(P^{N-1}\\right)$.\n(2) Observe that $P^{N-1}=\\bigcup_{K \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{N}}\\left(P_{0}+K\\right)$. Therefore,\n$\\int_{[0,1]^{N}} A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P_{n-1}+x\\right)\\right) d x=\\int_{E_{N}} A v e_{S_{N}} v o l_{m-1}\\left(M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P_{0}+x\\right)\\right) d x$.\nNow we can apply part (1) of the theorem to $M^{m}$ and $P_{0}$.\n(3) Apply part (2) to $M^{m} \\bigcap C$ instead of $M^{m}, P^{N-1}$, and $P_{0}=P^{N-1} \\bigcap C$.\n\nThe second inequality is based on Lemma 3.3. For a set $S$ we denote the number of points in $S$ by $|S|$. If $S$ is an infinite set, $|S|=\\infty$.\nTheorem 3.5. (1) Let $P^{N-m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and $M^{m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be two polyhedra. Then $\\int_{E_{N}} A v e_{S_{N}}\\left(\\left|M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P^{N-m}+x\\right)\\right|\\right) d x \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{N}{m}}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) v o l_{N-m}\\left(P^{N-m}\\right)$.\n(2) Assume that $P^{N-m}$ is unbounded $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic polyhedron. Denote the intersection of $P^{N-m}$ with any unit cube $C$ with sides parallel to the coordinate axes by $P_{0}$, and the volume of $P_{0}$ by $v$. (It is easy to see that $v$ does not depend on the choice of the unit cube.) Then\n\n$$\n\\int_{[0,1]^{N}} A v e_{S_{N}}\\left(\\left|M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s P^{N-1}+x\\right)\\right|\\right) d x \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{N}{m}}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) \\cdot v\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exist a signed permutation $s_{0}$ and some $x_{0} \\in[0,1]^{N}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|M^{m} \\bigcap\\left(s_{0} P^{N-1}+x_{0}\\right)\\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{N}{m}}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) \\cdot v\n$$\n\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 3.4(1), consider an infinitesimally small element of $P^{N-m}$ that can be regarded as being almost linear and chosen as a $(N-m)$-dimensional ball $\\beta$ of radius $\\Delta$ in a $(N-m)$-dimensional affine space $L$ tangent to $P^{N-m}$ and an infinitesimally small linear element $B$ in $M^{m}$ that can be chosen as a ball of radius $\\delta$. Decompose all translations of $\\beta$ into translations along $L^{\\perp}$ and translations along $L$. A plane $L+t$\n\nwith $t \\in L^{\\perp}$ has a non-empty intersection with $B$ if and only if $t$ is in the image $\\pi(B)$ of the orthogonal projection of $B$ onto $L^{\\perp}$. Generically, the intersection $(L+t) \\bigcup B$ is a point, if it is non-empty. The intersection of $\\beta$ and $B$ is non-empty if and only if the center of $\\beta+t$ in $L+t$ is $\\Delta$ close to the point $B \\bigcap(L+t)$. Thus, the integration over the space of all $t$ leads to the contribution $\\operatorname{vol}_{m}(\\pi(B)) \\operatorname{vol}_{N-m}(\\beta)$. Averaging over all signed permutations and applying Lemma 3.3, we see that the average does not exceed $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}}}$ vol $_{m}(B) v o l_{N-m}(\\beta)$. Now the integration over $P^{N-m}$ and $M^{m}$ yields the desired upper bound $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{m}}} v o l_{m}\\left(M^{m}\\right) v o l_{N-m}\\left(P^{N-m}\\right)$.\n\nPart (2) follows from part (1) exactly as in the previous lemma.\nHere is an example of the application of the previous theorem:\nLemma 3.6. Let $M^{n} \\subset[0,1]^{N} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ be a manifold of volume less then $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{n}}}$. Consider the union $U$ of all $\\binom{N}{n}(N-n)$-dimensional coordinate linear spaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$. There exist $t \\in[0,1]^{N}$ such that $(U+t) \\bigcap M^{n}$ is empty.\nProof. We are going to apply the previous theorem. Observe, that for each signed permutation $s s U=U$. Therefore, there is no need for the averaging with respect to the group of signed permutations $S_{N}$ in Theorem 3.5(2) with $P^{N-n}=U$. Observe that the volume $v$ of the intersection $U \\bigcap[0,1]^{N}$ is equal to $\\binom{N}{n}$. We see that, if the volume of $M^{n}$ is strictly less than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{N}{n}}}$, then for some $t_{0},\\left|M^{n} \\bigcap\\left(U+t_{0}\\right)\\right|<1$, and, therefore, $\\left|M^{n} \\bigcap\\left(U+t_{0}\\right)\\right|=0$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "# 3.2. Small separators and proof of Theorem 1.1. \n\nDefinition 3.7. Let $B^{N}$ be a $N$-dimensional Banach space, $m<N$ an integer, and $w$ a positive real number.

When $m$ is much smaller than $N$, this will be a much smaller volume than the volume of the intersection of the cubic lattice separators with the same unit cube.\n\nFirst, consider the case $m=0$. The required construction can be found in the paper by N. Alon and B. Klartag ([AK]). See also an earlier paper [KORW] with a more complicated construction proving the theorem below, and a recent paper $[\\mathrm{NR}]$.\n\nTheorem 3.8. ([AK], Theorem 3) For each $N$ there exists a subset $A^{N-1}$ of the unit cube in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ such that (1) The union of all integer translates $A^{N-1}+z$ of $A, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{N}$, divides $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ into subsets of $l^{\\infty}$ diameter $<1$; (2) The volume of $A^{N-1}$ does not exceed $2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{N}$.\n\nHere is a very brief sketch of the proof. One starts with the 1-parametric family of level sets $S_{\\lambda}=\\left\\{x \\in[0,1]^{N} \\mid \\Pi_{i=1}^{N} \\sin \\left(\\pi x_{i}\\right)=\\lambda\\right\\}$ for all $\\lambda \\in[0,1]$. The appearance of the function $\\Pi_{i=1}^{N} \\sin \\left(\\pi x_{i}\\right)$ here is due to the fact that it is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian $-\\Delta$ on the space of functions on the unit $N$-dimensional cube that vanish on its boundary. Observe that $S_{\\lambda}$ is the boundary of the domain $\\Omega_{\\lambda}=\\left\\{x \\in[0,1]^{N} \\mid \\Pi_{i=1}^{N} \\sin \\left(\\pi x_{i}\\right) \\geq \\lambda\\right\\}$. Then one chooses $\\lambda \\in(0,1]$ that minimizes the ratio $\\frac{\\operatorname{vol}_{N-1}\\left(S_{\\lambda}\\right)}{\\operatorname{vol}_{N}\\left(\\Omega_{\\lambda}\\right)}$ in this 1-parametric family and observes that Cheeger's inequality implies that the minimal value of the ratio does not exceed $2 \\pi \\sqrt{N}$. The shape of $S_{\\lambda}$ for the optimal value of $\\lambda$ will be somewhere between the shape of the ball and the shape of the cube with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. This fact explains the term \"spherical cubes\" in the title of [KORW].\n\nIdentify all pairs of opposite faces in $[0,1]^{N}$ (so that $[0,1]^{N}$ becomes the $N$ torus $T^{N}$ ), and assume that for each pair of vectors $v, w \\in[0,1]^{N}$ (regarded as $T^{N}$ ), $v+w$ means addition modulo 1 , so that $v+w$ will always be in $[0,1]^{N}$ regarded as $T^{N}$.\n\nFor each vector $v \\in[0,1]^{N}$ denote $S_{\\lambda}+v$ by $S^{v}$, and $\\Omega_{\\lambda}+v$ by $\\Omega^{v}$ Let $S_{0}=S_{\\lambda}=S^{0}$. For $i=1,2, \\ldots$ choose a random vector $v_{i} \\in[0,1]^{N}$. For each $i \\geq 1$ define $\\Omega_{i}$ as $\\bigcup_{j \\leq i} \\Omega^{v_{i}}$, and $S_{i}$ as $S_{i-1} \\bigcup S^{v_{i}} \\backslash\\left(S^{v_{i}} \\bigcap \\Omega_{i-1}\\right)$. In other words, one takes the unions of domains formed by random shifts of $\\Omega_{\\lambda}$, and at each step add the part of the boundary of the last shifted domain that is not inside the union of already constructed domains to $S_{i-1}$. Alon and Klartag observe that with probability 1 there exists a finite $k$ such that $S_{k}$ will separate each pair of opposite faces of the unit cube $[0,1]^{N}$. In particular, each connected component of the complement of $S_{k}$ has $l^{\\infty}$ diameter strictly less than 1 . Then they prove that for each $k$ the expectation of the $(N-1)$-dimensional volume of $S_{k}$ does not exceed $2 \\pi \\sqrt{N}$. Therefore, there exists a sequence of vectors $v_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots$ such that $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(S_{k}\\right) \\leq 2 \\pi \\sqrt{N}$, and $S_{k}$ separates all pairs of opposite faces of $[0,1]^{N}$.\n\nBy construction, $S_{k}$ is in $T^{N}$. Therefore, it can be lifted to a $\\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that has the desired properties. This completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nNow we are going to apply the previous theorem to construct a family of separators with increasing codimensions. Note that union of all integer translates of $A^{N-1}$ in Theorem 3.8 will be a 0 -separator. Denote it by $S E P_{0}^{N-1}$. The dual complex, $K^{0}$, can be defined as a collection of points, where we choose one point from each connected component $C_{j}, j=1, \\ldots$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash S E P_{0}^{N-1}$.\n\nTo construct an $m$-separator $S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ for each $m$, we are going to inductively define $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic $S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ such that the volume of its intersection with each $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-metric ball of radius 1 does not exceed $(2 \\pi)^{m+1} \\sqrt{N(N-1) \\ldots(N-m)}$ for each $m=1, \\ldots, N-1$ by intersecting $S E P_{m-1}^{N-m}$ with an appropriately chosen copy $\\left(S E P_{0}^{N-1}\\right)_{m}=s S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x$, where $s$ is a signed permutation, and $x \\in[0,1]^{N}$. (Observe that both sets are $\\mathbb{Z}$-periodic.) Theorem 3.4(2) implies the existence of a signed permutation $s$ and $x \\in[0,1]^{N}$ such the $(N-m-1)$-dimensional volume of the part of this intersection inside any $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-metric ball of radius 1 does not exceed $\\frac{\\sqrt{N-m}}{\\sqrt{N}} \\cdot(2 \\pi)^{m} \\sqrt{N(N-1) \\ldots(N-m+1)} \\cdot 2 \\pi \\sqrt{N}=$ $(2 \\pi)^{m+1} \\sqrt{N(N-1) \\ldots(N-m)}$. Denote the chosen $s$ by $s^{(m)}, x$ by $x^{(m)}$, and $s^{(m)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(m)}$ by $S E P^{(m)}$.\n\nObserve that $S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ will be intersection of $m+1$ isometric copies $\\left(S E P_{0}^{N-1}\\right)_{i}, i=0,1, \\ldots, m$, of $S E P_{0}^{N-1}$. For each $i$ consider (open) connected components $C_{j}^{(i)}$ of the complement of $\\left(S E P_{0}^{N-1}\\right)_{i}$. While these components are disjoint for each fixed $i$, the collection $\\left\\{C_{j}^{(i)}\\right\\}_{i, j}$ for all $i \\leq m$ and $j$ will be an open cover of $\\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash S E P_{m}^{N-1}$ of multiplicity $m+1$. The nerve of this cover will be an $m$-dimensional simplicial complex $K^{m}$. We can realize $K^{m}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ by choosing one point $v_{i j}$ in each open set $C_{j}^{(i)}$ and using simplices with vertices $v_{i_{1} j_{1}}, \\ldots, v_{i_{k} j_{k}}$ each time $C_{j_{1}}^{\\left(i_{1}\\right)} \\cap \\ldots C_{j_{k}}^{\\left(i_{k}\\right)} \\neq \\emptyset$. Note, that in this case numbers $i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{k}$ are pairwise distinct. Now using a subordinate partition of unity we obtain a continuous map $\\pi_{m}: \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash S E P_{m}^{N-m-1} \\longrightarrow K^{m}$. Each point $x$ is being mapped to a convex linear combination of at most $m+1$ points $v_{i} \\in C_{j}^{(i)}$ for different values of $i$ such that $x \\in C_{j}^{(i)}$. As the $l_{\\infty}^{N}$-diameter of $C_{j}^{(i)}$ is less than 1 , for each $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ $\\left\\|\\phi_{m}(x)-x\\right\\|_{l_{\\infty}^{N}}<1$.\n\nRescaling to an arbitrary positive mesh $w$, we obtain the following theorem establishing the existence of small separators:\n\nTheorem 3.9. For each $N \\geq 2, m=0,1, \\ldots, N-1$ and a positive real $w$ there exists a $w \\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic set $w S E P_{m}^{N-m-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and an $m$-dimensional complex $K^{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ such that:\n\n(a) The volume of the intersection of $w S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ with any cube with side length $w$ and sides parallel to the coordinates axes does not exceed $(2 \\pi)^{m+1} \\sqrt{N(N-1) \\ldots(N-m)} w^{N-m-1}$;\n(b) There exists a continuous map $\\phi_{m}: \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash w S E P_{m}^{N-m-1} \\longrightarrow K^{m}$ such that for each $x\\left\\|\\phi_{m}(x)-x\\right\\|_{l_{\\infty}^{N}}<w$.\n\nRemark 1. As the sum of dimensions of $S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$ and $K^{m}$ is strictly less than $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$, we can do an arbitrarily small perturbation of $K^{m}$ (and $\\phi_{m}$ ) to ensure that $K^{m} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash S E P_{m}^{N-m-1}$, if desired.\nRemark 2. The term small separators in the title of the paper refers to $w \\mathbb{Z}^{N}$-periodic subsets $w S E P_{m}^{N-m-1} \\subset l_{\\infty}^{N}$ satisfying the conditions of the previous theorem.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "# Proof of Theorem 1.1. \n\nWe provide two proofs. The first proof is simpler, and does not use Lemma 3.3. The second proof is shorter, and we hope that it can become a basis for a useful algorithm for dimensionality reduction.\nProof 1: Using a rescaling we can assume that $(2 \\pi)^{n} \\sqrt{n!} \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)<1$, and we would need to prove that $W_{n-1}^{\\Gamma \\infty}\\left(M^{n}\\right)<1$. We are going to inductively intersect $M^{n}$ with copies $s^{(i)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(i)}$ for signed permutations $s^{(i)}$ and shifts $x^{(i)} \\in[0,1]^{N}$ that are chosen for each $i$ so that the volumes of intersections do not exceed the averages provided by Theorem 3.4(2). On each step we get a factor $2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{n-i+1}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n$. After $n$ steps we are going to get $M_{0}=M^{n} \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} s^{(i)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(i)}$ ) such that $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(M_{0}\\right) \\leq(2 \\pi)^{n} \\sqrt{n(n-1) \\ldots 2} \\operatorname{vol}_{n}\\left(M^{n}\\right)<1$. Note that $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(M_{0}\\right)$ is the number of points in $M_{0}$. Therefore, if $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(M_{0}\\right)<1$, then $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(M_{0}\\right)=0$. and $M_{0}$ is empty. This means that $M^{n}$ is contained in the complement of $\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}\\left(s^{(i)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(i)}\\right)$. Therefore, it can be covered by the complements to $s^{(i)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(i)}$, which is an open covering of multiplicity $n$, and can be continuously mapped to the $(n-1)$-dimensional nerve of this covering. As above this nerve can be realized as a complex in the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$, with a vertex in each connected component of $\\mathbb{R}^{N} \\backslash\\left(s^{(i)} S E P_{0}^{N-1}+x^{(i)}\\right)$ (that have $l^{\\infty}$-diameters $<1$ ), and straight line simplices formed by the chosen vertices. Each point $x$ is being mapped to a convex linear combination of vertices that are points in open sets of diameter $<1$ containing $x$. Therefore, the distance between $x$ and its image is less than 1.\nProof 2: Construct $S E P_{n-1}^{N-n}, K^{n-1}, \\phi_{n-1}$ for $w=1$ as in Theorem 3.9. According to Theorem 3.5(3) the intersection of $M^{n}$ with $s S E P_{n-1}^{N-n}+x$ for a random signed permutation $s$ and a random shift $x \\in[0,1]^{N}$ is less than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\binom{n}{n}}}(2 \\pi)^{n} \\sqrt{\\frac{N!}{(N-n)!}} \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)=(2 \\pi)^{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{n!} \\cdot \\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)<1$. This means that for some $s$ and $x \\in[0,1]^{N}$ this intersection is empty. Therefore, $M^{n}$ is in the complement of $s S E P_{n-1}^{N-1}+x$, and we can use $\\phi_{n-1}$ to map $M^{n}$ to $s K^{n-1}+x$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 7, "text": "# 4. Proof of Theorem 1.2 \n\nLemma 4.1. Let $C^{n+1}=[0,1]^{n+1}$ be a unit cube such that each of its faces intersects $M^{n}$ transversally. Let $A=M^{n} \\cap C^{n+1}$. If $\\operatorname{vol}(A)<\\frac{1}{3}$, then there exists a connected component of $C^{n+1} \\backslash A$ whose intersection with the interior of each facet of the cube has volume greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nProof. Denote by $A_{i}$ the $i$ th connected component of $A$. Observe that the set $C^{n+1} \\backslash A_{i}$ has two connected components. Denote by $V_{i}$ the connected component of $C^{n+1} \\backslash A_{i}$ whose volume is at most $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet us first prove that the complement (in $C^{n+1}$ ) $U$ of the closure of $\\bigcup_{i} V_{i}$ is connected. Observe that for each $i$ there is a very small open neighborhood of $A_{i}$ that does not intersect $\\cup_{\\{j \\mid j \\neq i\\}} A_{j}$. Take two points $a, b$ in $U$. We would like to connect them by a path in $C^{n+1} \\backslash A$. The existence of such a path for all pairs of points $a$ and $b$ will demonstrate that $U$ is path connected. First, connect $a$ and $b$ by a straight line path $\\gamma$. Assume that this path intersects $A_{i_{1}}, A_{i_{2}}$, etc. Let $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$ be the first and the last points of intersection with $A_{i_{1}}$. Now connect $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$ by a path $\\tau$ in $A_{i_{1}}$, and replace the arc of $\\gamma$ between $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$ by $\\tau$. Now perform a small perturbation of the resulting path that moves $\\tau$ in the direction of the connected component of $C^{n+1} \\backslash A_{i}$ different from $V_{i}$. (Note that $\\gamma$ arrives to $p_{1}$ from this component and leaves $q_{1}$ towards the same component.) The resulting path will connect $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$ but will not intersect $A_{i_{1}}$, and we did not create any new intersections. Proceeding in a similar way we can eliminate the intersections with $A_{i_{2}}, A_{i_{3}}, \\ldots$ and obtain a path between $a$ and $b$ that does not intersect $A$.\n\nDenote by $S_{i, j}$ the intersection of $V_{i}$ with the $j$ th facet of the cube. (Recall, that a \"facet\" of a cube means a codimension one face.) With a slight abuse of notation we shall write $A_{i}, V_{i}$, or $S_{i, j}$ meaning the corresponding volumes. We shall prove that the complement $U$ of the closure of $\\bigcup V_{i}$ is the required connected component of $C^{n+1} \\backslash A$. To do so it is enough to prove that $\\sum_{i} S_{i, j}<\\frac{1}{2}$ for all $j$. And this, in turn, will immediately follow from the assumption $\\sum_{i} A_{i}=A<\\frac{1}{3}$ and the inequality $A_{i} \\geq \\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}$ which we are going to now prove for all $j$.\n\nLet $V_{i, j, t}$ be the volume of the section of $V_{i}$ by a hyperplane $x_{j}=t$, where $x_{j}$ is the coordinate axis orthogonal to the $j$ th facet of the cube. There are two cases possible, either $\\left|V_{i, j, t}-S_{i, j}\\right|<\\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}$ for all $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ or not.\n\nConsider the first case, that $\\left|V_{i, j, t}-S_{i, j}\\right|<\\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}$ for all $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. Then\n\n$$\nV_{i}=\\int_{0}^{1} V_{i, j, t} d t>\\frac{1}{3} S_{i, j}\n$$\n\nFrom the relative isoperimetric inequality in the cube (see the appendix in [ABBF] or an earlier paper [H]), and from $V_{i} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ we know that\n\n$$\nA_{i} \\geq 4 V_{i}\\left(1-V_{i}\\right) \\geq 2 V_{i}\n$$\n\nCombining the two we get that\n\n$$\nA_{i} \\geq 2 V_{i}>\\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}\n$$\n\nConsider the second case, that $\\left|V_{i, j, t}-S_{i, j}\\right| \\geq \\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}$ for some $t$. Let Proj $_{j}$ be the orthogonal projection to the $j$ th facet of the cube. Clearly, every point of the symmetric difference of $S_{i, j}$ and $\\operatorname{Proj}_{j}\\left(V_{i, j, t}\\right)$ belongs to $\\operatorname{Proj}_{j}\\left(A_{i}\\right)$. The former is at least $\\left|V_{i, j, t}-S_{i, j}\\right| \\geq \\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}$ and the latter is at most $A_{i}$, so once again we get\n\n$$\nA_{i} \\geq \\frac{2}{3} S_{i, j}\n$$\n\nWe are now ready to prove the theorem. Using an appropriate rescaling we can assume that $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}-\\varepsilon$ for an arbitrarily small positive $\\varepsilon$. Consider the integer cubic lattice in the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. After an arbitrary small translation of $M^{n}$ we may assume that it intersects all faces of all integer unit cubes transversally.\n\nA cross in an $(n+1)$-dimensional cube is a point in cube's interior together with $2(n+1)$ paths connecting the point to the interior of each of the cube's facets. The interiors of the paths are disjoint. The cross intersects the interior of each facet at a single point, these points are called endpoints of the cross.\n\nUsing $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{n}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3}$ and the lemma above, we can choose a cross disjoint with $M^{n}$ in each cube of the lattice. Moreover, because the connected component in the statement of the lemma intersects each facet at the volume greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$, we can assume that for every facet the two endpoints of two corresponding crosses (one for each cube containing the facet) coincide.\n\nConsider the union of the crosses, $T$. We would like to prove that there is a retraction $\\phi$ from $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\backslash T$ to the $(n-1)$-skeleton of the lattice such that $x$ and $\\phi(x)$ belong to the same cube of lattice for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\backslash T$. The restriction of $\\phi$ to $M^{n}$ will be the desired map from $M^{n}$ to an $(n-1)$ dimensional polyhedron with $\\|x-\\phi(x)\\|_{l^{\\infty}} \\leq 1$ for all $x$.\n\nIf $n+1=2$, then $\\phi$ is just the map which maps each connected component of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\backslash T$ to the single vertex of the lattice in this component.\n\nIf $n+1 \\geq 4$, then by general position there exists an isotopy of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ which preserves all faces of all dimension of the lattice and which moves $T$ to the 1 -skeleton of the dual lattice. And for $T$ being the 1 -skeleton of the dual lattice the retraction $\\phi$ is obvious.\n\nIf $n+1=3$, then, the arcs in the crosses can be knotted, and this might hinder the construction of an isotopy between $T$ and the dual 1-skeleton of the dual lattice. Therefore, we completely abandon the construction of $T$ above and present a simpler argument. We will prove that if $n+1=3$ then we can choose $T$ disjoint with $M^{2}$ to be the image of the 1 -skeleton of the dual lattice under some translation. For such $T$ the retraction $\\phi$ is again obvious.\n\nOne way of doing that is to simply apply Lemma 3.6 to $N=3, n=2$. Lemma 3.6 immediately implies that if $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, which is weaker than $\\operatorname{vol}\\left(M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3}$, then there exists the desired $T$ that does not intersect $M^{2}$.\n\nAnother way is more elementary and does not use Lemma 3.6.\nFor $t \\in[0,1]$ denote by $X_{t}, Y_{t}$, and $Z_{t}$ the unions of the planes $\\{x=m+t$ : $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\},\\{y=m+t: m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$, and $\\{z=m+t: m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ respectively. By the coarea formula\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(X_{t} \\cap M^{2}\\right) d t \\leq \\operatorname{vol}_{2}\\left(M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n(Here and below we use subscripts to indicate the dimension of the volumes that we are considering.) Therefore, there exists $t$ such that $\\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(X_{t} \\cap M^{2}\\right)<$ $\\frac{1}{3}$. Denote this $X_{t}$ simply by $X$.\n\nLikewise, by the coarea formulas\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(Y_{t} \\cap M^{2}\\right) d t \\leq \\operatorname{vol}_{2}\\left(M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Y_{t} \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right) d t \\leq \\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(X \\cap M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exists $t$ such that $\\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(Y_{t} \\cap M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Y_{t} \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right)<$ $\\frac{2}{3}$ at the same time. Denote this $Y_{t}$ by $Y$.\n\nFinally, by the coarea formulas\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\int_{0}^{1} \\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z_{t} \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right) d t \\leq \\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(X \\cap M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n& \\int_{0}^{1} \\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z_{t} \\cap Y \\cap M^{2}\\right) d t \\leq \\operatorname{vol}_{1}\\left(Y \\cap M^{2}\\right)<\\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, there exists $t$ such that $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z_{t} \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right)<1$ and $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z_{t} \\cap Y \\cap\\right.$ $\\left.M^{2}\\right)<1$ at the same time. Denote this $Z_{t}$ by $Z$.\n\nThe $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Y \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right), \\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z \\cap X \\cap M^{2}\\right)$, and $\\operatorname{vol}_{0}\\left(Z \\cap Y \\cap M^{2}\\right)$ are zerodimensional volumes, that is, just the numbers of points in corresponding sets. So, the fact that they are strictly less than 1 implies that the corresponding sets $Y \\cap X \\cap M^{2}, Z \\cap X \\cap M^{2}$, and $Z \\cap Y \\cap M^{2}$ are empty. This means that $T:=(Y \\cap X) \\cup(Z \\cap X) \\cup(Z \\cap Y)$ is as required.\n\nNote that the previous lemma immediately implies the first part of the following result that is stronger than Theorem 1.2. The second part will then immediately follow from Theorem 1.6 (and is stronger than Theorem $1.5(2))$.\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let $M^{n}$ be a $C^{1}$-smooth submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Consider a cubic lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with side length l. Assume that the volume of the intersection of $M^{n}$ with any closed $(n+1)$-dimensional cube of the cubic lattice is strictly less than $\\frac{1}{3} l^{n}$. Then there exists a continuous map $\\phi$ of $M^{n}$ to the $(n-1)$-skeleton of the cubic lattice such that $x$ and $\\phi(x)$ always belong to the same closed $(n+1)$-dimensional cube of the lattice. If $M^{n}$ is\n\nessential, then there exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^{n}$ contained in an open cube with side length $2 l$ and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nAcknowledgements.

We prove that\n$W^{l^\\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\\leq const\\ \\sqrt{n}\\ vol(M^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$, and if\nthe codimension $N-n$ is equal to $1$, then $W^{l^\\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\\leq\n\\sqrt{3}\\ vol(M^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$.\n  As a corollary, we prove that if $M^n\\subset \\mathbb{R}^N$ is {\\it\nessential}, then there exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^n$\ncontained in a cube in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with side length $const\\ \\sqrt{n}\\\nvol^{\\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$ with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. If the\ncodimension is $1$, then the side length of the cube is $4\\\nvol^{\\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$.\n  To prove these results we introduce a new approach to systolic geometry that\ncan be described as a non-linear version of the classical Federer-Fleming\nargument, where we push out from a specially constructed non-linear\n$(N-n)$-dimensional complex in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ that does not intersect $M^n$. To\nconstruct these complexes we first prove a version of kinematic formula where\none averages over isometries of $l^N_\\infty$ (Theorem 3.5), and introduce\nhigh-codimension analogs of optimal foams recently discovered in [KORW] and\n[AK].", "updated": "2025-04-16T22:36:23Z", "published": "2024-02-12T17:15:58Z"}
