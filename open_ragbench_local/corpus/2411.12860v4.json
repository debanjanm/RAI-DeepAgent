Our new framework carries the interpretation that the organization and its agents may be misaligned in pursuing some underlying matching goal. We design matching mechanisms that integrate agent decision-making and the algorithm by avoiding matches that are unanimously disagreeable between the two parties. Our mechanisms also satisfy restricted efficiency properties. Subsequently, we prove that no unanimous mechanism is strategy-proof but that ours can be non-obviously manipulable. We generalize our framework to allow for any preference aggregation rules and extend the famed Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem to our setting. We apply our framework to place foster children in foster homes to maximize welfare. Using a machine learning model that predicts child welfare in placements and a (planned) novel lab-in-the-field eliciting real caseworkers' preferences, we empirically demonstrate that there are important match-specific welfare gains that our mechanisms extract that are not realized under the status quo.

      "text": "# 1 Introduction \n\nThe traditional goal of matching theory is to use agents' preferences to achieve an assignment of objects to agents or agents to agents that is efficient, fair, and sustainable, or some combination of all three. However, in some organizational contexts, matching based on individual decision-maker preferences can hamper an institution's goals. Decision-makers, even when attempting to pursue the organizational objective, can fall prey to informational asymmetries, cognitive limitations, or a lack of experience. Simultaneously, even if the organization has access to an algorithm that can outperform the decision-makers, it may be infeasible to implement in practice due to legal, ethical, and trust concerns.\n\nIn this paper, we develop one-sided matching mechanisms that input two preference rankings. We take it as given that there is some underlying welfare attained when any decision-maker matches to any object. We represent decision-maker (DM) preferences over objects, which might or might not align with welfare, as one set of preference rankings. The second set of preference rankings - which we call evaluations - are the ordinal representation of an algorithm's predictions of welfare between DM-object matches. We design mechanisms that satisfy a fairness notion that we call unanimity, two weaker efficiency properties for unanimous matching mechanisms, and non-obvious manipulability under some conditions. Following this, we apply our mechanisms to the child welfare domain.\n\nIn the United States, the foster care system is responsible for caring for children found to be victims of abuse or neglect at the hands of their parents. In 2022, there were 368,530 children in the foster care system (U.S. Children's Bureau 2024). Economists have evaluated numerous policy interventions to improve outcomes in foster care (Bald et al. 2022). However, one critical aspect of foster care has gone unnoticed: how should a child be matched to a temporary foster home?\n\nExisting processes for matching children to foster home are highly varied across U.S. counties, burdened with inefficiencies, and leave practitioners longing for better systems (Zeijlmans et al. 2016). Therefore, we cannot offer a uniform characterization of a child's journey from her home of origin to a foster home. Generally speaking, children that are suspected to be victims of abuse or neglect are often reported to the local child welfare agency by community members. The child welfare agency sends an investigator to the child's home, and, if the investigator substantiates the allegations, then the child is removed from her home. The agency assigns a caseworker (DM) to represent the child, and the child can be kept in custody of the county for up to several days before she is matched to a temporary foster home (object). The caseworker can use various means to search for a suitable match for the child, and this step in the process is the most heterogeneous step across counties. In most counties, caseworkers sequentially decide to match the child that the caseworker represents to the caseworker's most preferred available home, where the order is simply the first (or next) caseworker to initiate matching. We describe this time-ordered serial dictatorship as the \"status quo\".\n\nCaseworkers representing children have preferences over the homes that a child can be matched to. Often, these preferences can legitimately be in the best interests of the child and encode important, qualitative information that cannot be easily subsumed into algorithms that predict a child's persistence in a home. On the contrary, some caseworkers might have erroneous judgment causing them to systemically choose homes where children will not persist. Nevertheless, the human element in the matching process\n\nis essential, and most counties are unwilling-justifiably so-to fully replace caseworkers with algorithms that decide placements. One objective goal in the matching process is placement stability (Carnochan, Moore, and Austin 2013). A child's placement in a foster home is stable if the child remains in the home until the child is reunified with their home of origin, the foster home permanently adopts the child, or the child ages out of the foster care system. We refer to this as persistence to avoid confusion with the matching theory concept of stability. Persistence is not common ${ }^{1}$, and there are widespread efforts to improve persistence for children as more placements are strongly associated with trauma and worse outcomes for youth in foster care.\n\nWe model this problem as a one-sided matching market where children are strategic agents allocated to homes (objects) ${ }^{2}$. Children have strict ordinal preferences $\\succ_{c}$ over homes ${ }^{3}$. The matchmaker has strict ordinal preferences $>_{c}$ over homes that a given child can be placed in. We call these evaluations. We introduce a fairness concept termed unanimity. A home $h$ is unanimously acceptable for $c$ if $h \\succ_{c} \\varnothing$ and $h>_{c} \\varnothing$. A child $c$ has a unanimous improvement over $h$ if there exists another $h^{\\prime}$ where $h^{\\prime} \\succ_{c} h$ and $h^{\\prime}>_{c} h$. A home is unanimous for a child if the child has no unanimous improvement over it. A matching $\\mu$ is unanimous if there is no other matching which can weakly expand the set of children matched to unanimously acceptable homes. Unanimity is a form of preference aggregation, and our particular method of aggregation prioritizes allocations where the matchmaker eliminates or reduces matches where a DM and the algorithm would jointly agree that another match is superior. This desideratum is fair under the prior that these strong agreements between humans and algorithms should be respected over simply improving preferences or evaluations alone. Simultaneously, unanimity provides robustness in cases where one decision model-the human or the algorithm-is fundamentally flawed but the other is more accurate in predicting welfare. Unanimity is useful when institutional constraints prohibit fully automating the matching process and require respecting human preferences as is the case in foster care. We show a simple equivalence between unanimity and an efficient matching with appropriately aggregated preferences (Proposition 2).\n\nThe equivalence shows that the Serial Dictatorship (SD) mechanism appropriately modified for indifference (Serial Dictatorship with Indifference or SDI) generates unanimous matchings (Proposition 3). Many matchings can be unanimous, and a unanimous and efficient matching can fail to exist. Thus, we impose further efficiency restrictions. We tweak the Top Trading Cycles mechanism to find Pareto improvements on any unanimous matching while maintaining unanimity. Next, we innovate the concept of a Serial Dictatorship to allow for selective replacements in matches to objects and show that our mechanism, Linear Exchange (LE), achieves a median between unanimity and efficiency. Its matchings are more unanimous than a large class of matchings and more efficient (or incomparably efficient) than any unanimous matching (Theorem 1)\n\nTurning to strategic incentives, we show that no unanimous mechanism can be strategy proof (Proposition 5). Worse, we show that every unanimous mechanism is obviously manipulable (Theorem 2). The manipulations are truncation strategies. Nevertheless,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The average number of placements for a child was 2.56 in 2015; see Robinson-Cort\u00e9s (2021).\n    ${ }^{2}$ In practice, homes can have dichotomous preferences. However, this two-sided matching problem reduces to a one-sided matching problem where a child finds a home acceptable only if the child and home find the match acceptable.\n    ${ }^{3}$ As aforementioned, caseworkers are the DMs and actually hold preferences, but we refer to them as children in exposition for simplicity. One can think of the caseworkers as analogous to parents in school choice.\n\nwe restore some positive results regarding the strategic incentives of SDI and LE. When the number of homes is smaller than the number of children, as is typically the case in foster care, both mechanisms are non-obviously manipulable. We also discuss the fact that children may generally only desire unanimous improvements when they recognize that the algorithm can be complementary to welfare. In this case, no harmful manipulations will occur. Our results suggest that we might be able to attain a limited version of strategy-proofness that we term group robustness. Group robustness requires that there is no profitable manipulation that can improve all children with respect to either $\\succ$ or $>$. This concept is important because the matchings we select may not be efficient with respect to either order which can afford opportunities for children or the matchmaker to improve without harming anyone. We generalize our model to examine whether or not any mechanism and aggregated preferences can satisfy group robustness. Unfortunately, we find a negative result: any strategy-proof and efficient mechanism satisfying mild regularity conditions that uses aggregated preferences cannot be group robust unless the aggregation is equivalent to $\\succ$ or $>$ (Theorem 3).\n\nThe following section is still under construction. We design an experiment to understand how the structure of caseworker preferences interacts with unanimity. Our experiment invites real caseworkers to report their preferences to a novel device for the assignment of children to homes in a simulated market where, based on a nationally representative panel of foster care placements, we build a machine learning model to predict persistence in the simulated market. Our experimental device is specifically designed to elicit preferences using simple instruments like surveys; it is strategy proof (Proposition A.1) and features truth-telling as the unique, non-trivial weakly dominant strategy (Proposition A.2). Caseworkers receive monetary payoffs when the children that they represent persist. Our lab-in-the-field experiment elicits caseworkers' true preferences. We input these preferences into our mechanisms to estimate the treatment effect on average persistence in the simulated markets. In a preliminary simulation where caseworkers racially match children and foster homes, the placements under SD using caseworker preferences are barely better than random assignment. SDI increases average persistence by 18.8 pp , empirically demonstrating that unanimity alone improves welfare when the algorithm is more accurate than humans. UTTC improves over SDI by a marginal 5.9 pp . Linear Exchange increases average persistence by $11.2 \\mathrm{pp}(18 \\%)$ when the machine learning model is fully accurate. When the out-of-sample error is fitted to the error in the test sample, average persistence still increases by $7.4 \\mathrm{pp}(13 \\%)$. Caseworkers' preferences do not align with predicted persistence, and these results suggest that they do not align with actual persistence. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate that there are match-specific benefits to persistence, a fact not observed in previous work. In the current version of the paper, we include a fully simulated empirical section. We show that across many specifications where a predictive algorithm may be inaccurate and even highly inaccurate when caseworkers are accurate, utilizing SDI, UTTC, or LE improves average persistence by $6.5 \\%$ at worst and $28.3 \\%$ at best.\n\nLiterature Contribution-As far as we are aware, no other literature on one-sided matching has ever considered the problem where two rankings may be involved. However, in the adjacent literature on social choice theory, many such issues involving preference aggregation arise. We see our work as a near direct extension of Danan et al. (2016) to matching theory. Their unambiguous Pareto dominance property emphasizes choosing acts where agents unambiguously agree in the face of ex-ante uncertainty about what social outcomes the acts entail. Conceptually, unanimity is quite similar to this property.\n\nThe main difference lies in the fact that unanimity is appropriate for application to matching allocations rather than a society's preferences. Further, we remain agnostic as to the formation of the rankings whereas the aforementioned work uses assumptions on preferences to derive important main results. Furthermore, we integrate preference aggregation with matching theory, showing that unanimity is equivalent to efficiency with respect to a preference aggregation. Our work then extends Gibbard (1973) to our setting showing that there is little hope of preempting strategic incentives.\n\nAdditionally, this paper intersects results on Pareto-constrained welfare maximization in the computer science literature. Our evaluation ranking can be reformulated as a cardinal match valuation. In this context, Bir\u00f3 and Gudmundsson (2020) study the computational complexity of finding a Pareto efficient matching of highest welfare, where welfare in their case is a sum of match valuations and, in a large part of their work, where the match valuation depends only on one side. They find that this problem is NP-hard in general and prove stringent conditions under which it is computationally feasible. Following this, they define a general linear programming solution that may require permuting all matchings to identify the constrained welfare maximizing matching. They also analyze some conditions where positive strategy proofness results can be proven. We contribute through taking a fundamentally different stance from welfare maximization, i.e., a unanimous matching need not be efficient with respect to the evaluations. Our work still touches on theirs as the equivalence between unanimity and unanimouspreference efficiency implies that finding a unanimous and efficient matching is a case of Pareto-constrained welfare maximization. We use separate efficiency notions for unanimous matchings that do not require a solution to the aforementioned problem. Other works by Cechl\u00e1rov\u00e1, Fleiner, and Schlotter (2017) and Saban and Sethuraman (2015) explore the computational tractability of problems inherent in computing efficient and unanimous matchings and motivate some of our restrictions on the problem.\n\nLastly, a few select papers intersecting matching theory and child welfare loosely relate to our work. Slaugh et al. (2016) analyze the matching recommendation system that had previously been abandoned by the Pennsylvania child welfare system and take an operations approach to reform it. They show tangible benefits in increasing the number of placements. Robinson-Cort\u00e9s (2021) estimates caseworker preferences and counterfactual persistence for children under various different policies using an empirical matching framework. Some policies that focus on increasing market thickness, like matching across larger geographic regions, can significantly boost persistence. Notably, Baron et al. (2024) study the problem of reassigning child investigations to investigators while maintaining a sort of status quo. They coin the term \"mechanism reform\"-changing the status quo mechanism while maintaining at least the same level of welfare for all agents-which relates to our problem in that unanimous matchings incorporate the existing preferences of DMs. For a more comprehensive overview of the overlap between market design and child welfare systems, we refer the reader to this paper's sister Highsmith (2024). This work develops matching mechanisms for expedient adoptions from foster care where dynamic incentives play a far greater role than in matching children to temporary foster homes.\n\nCentralization in Practice-Foster care in the United States is an interesting application of matching theory because, at present, there are no counties that we are aware of that utilize any formal matching mechanism to assign children to homes. One simple reason why this could be the case is that the status-quo, as we have described it, is equivalent to a Pareto efficient matching mechanism. Therefore, all mechanisms developed in matching theory, save those that we described in our literature review, would have\n\nnearly or exactly the same efficiency as the status-quo. Furthermore, two-sided matching mechanisms are not well-fit for foster care. This is because the set of children to be matched is fluid and constantly changing; the preferences that homes report, then, must similarly constantly update. One could construct preferences based on child observable characteristics which homes report once-and-for-all, but this would require additional theoretical developments to reach the same desirable properties as in the standard case. In working on this and related projects, we have conducted interviews with practitioners to understand the matching process in foster care. Our interviews indicate that individual caseworkers face a relatively easy problem: choose the best perceived home for a child. However, when practitioners aggregate this decision-making rule to the entire market, they find that persistence falls short of their goals. We show in this work that implementing a unanimous mechanism would be distinct from a Pareto efficient mechanism and could significantly ameliorate welfare losses.\n\nPaper Organization-In Section 2, we detail our model preliminaries and mechanism properties. In Section 3, we give theoretical results on unanimous matchings and mechanisms, their non-strategic properties, and their strategic properties. We also present existence proofs for other mechanisms satisfying our properties. Finally, we construct a general model we term matching with preference aggregation that shows an impossibility result regarding incentive-compatibility even if we modify the concept of unanimity. In Section 4, we detail our empirical simulations in lieu of the experiment design and results. Last, we conclude in Section 5 with practical considerations.",

Let $A$ be a set with an arbitrary, finite number of agents. $C$ is the set of all children and $H$ is the set of all prospective homes for children, thus $A=C \\cup H$. The matchmaker's task is to assign each generic child $c \\in C$ to a generic home $h \\in H$. Formally, the matching market is an undirected, bipartite graph with labels $M=(C, H, E)$ where $E$ is the edge set representing feasible assignments. Let $\\gamma: E \\rightarrow\\{\\{c, h\\}: c \\in C, h \\in H\\}$ represent the incidence function for $M$ and $E_{h}(\\mu)=\\{d \\in \\mu: h \\in \\gamma(d)\\}$ where $\\mu \\subseteq E$. A feasible matching or assignment is some $\\mu \\subseteq E$ that is one-to-one ${ }^{4}$.\n\nWe say that child $c$ is assigned to or placed with home $h$ under $\\mu$ if $\\{c, h\\} \\in \\mu$. For convenience, we use the shorthand notation with $\\mu$ as a function where $\\mu: A \\rightarrow A \\cup \\varnothing$ such that $\\mu(c)=h \\Longleftrightarrow c \\in \\mu(h) \\Longleftrightarrow\\{c, h\\} \\in \\mu$. We say that $c$ is unassigned or unplaced if $c \\notin \\gamma(d)$ for any $d \\in \\mu$ and write $\\mu(c)=\\varnothing$. We will also write that $\\mu(\\varnothing)=\\varnothing$.\n$P$ is the set of preference orderings (total preorders) over $H \\cup \\varnothing$. Each child $c$ has a ranking $\\succ_{c} \\in P$ over prospective homes. There are no externalities. Each child only cares about her own assignments. We write $h \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}$ if and only if $c$ ranks $h$ higher than $h^{\\prime}$. If $\\varnothing \\succ_{c} h$, we say that $h$ is unacceptable to $c$. We also assume that children's preferences are strict and write that $h^{\\prime} \\succcurlyeq c h$ if and only if $h^{\\prime}=h$. In the foster care setting, it is important to note that children do not represent themselves in the matching process. Instead, caseworkers typically decide the best home for a child. Nevertheless, we will\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ We do not pursue a capacitated model. One might imagine that some homes are willing to take in multiple foster children, which can be true, but this rarely happens in a single matching market. Homes will typically only be offered one placement at any given time. We may capture the separate issue that some children require greater than unit capacity (sibling groups) by incorporating this into preferences, where a home is only acceptable if it can accommodate the group.\n\nprimarily refer to children as holding preferences and making decisions in our theoretical work for exposition's sake. When we highlight our applications, it will be an important fact that caseworkers are the real decision-makers.\n\nIn addition to these preferences, the matchmaker has evaluations for a child $c$ which is a ranking $>_{c} \\in P$ over prospective homes for that child. We assume that these evaluation rankings are strict. While evaluations will play a similar role to priorities, for example, in the school choice literature, they are not the same ${ }^{5}$.\n\nThe vector of preferences for all children is $\\succ_{C}=\\left(\\succ_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$ and for all matchmaker evaluations is $>=\\left(>_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$. A preference double is a combination of these two: $\\succ=$ $\\left(\\succ_{C},>\\right)$. A problem $L=(M, \\succ)$ consists of the market, preferences, and evaluations. A mechanism $\\phi[L]$ maps a problem to a feasible matching $\\mu$ on $M$. From hereon, we omit \"feasible\" when referring to matchings and consider it implicit.",

A matching $\\mu$ is $\\succ$-efficient if there does not exist another matching $\\mu^{\\prime}$ that $\\succ$-Pareto dominates it.

A constrained-efficient matching is not Pareto dominated by a matching that weakly expands the set of unanimous and matched children.

      "text": "# 2.2 Algorithms in Child Welfare \n\nOur framework captures the tension inherent in using algorithms to facilitate matching whenever humans are involved in the process. Humans can fundamentally disagree-misalign-with algorithms. We refer to misalignment as humans and algorithms having either separate goals or separate ideals of pursuing the same goal. The first case is more fundamental and likely to be antithetical to unanimity. For example, if humans pursued some goal orthogonal to social welfare, then we can arrive in a case where evaluations are preferences in reverse order. Therefore, there would be no possible unanimous improvement and every matching would be unanimous. Redressing this requires a fundamentally different approach (Bir\u00f3 and Gudmundsson 2020). We view this as a rare situation. The second case is more usual: humans and algorithms both seek to maximize social welfare, but they use different criteria for a \"good\" match, thereby arriving at different rankings over objects.\n\nWe demonstrate that it is feasible to combine human and algorithm decision-making to produce matchings. Our formulation of unanimity emphasizes the idea that matches where humans and algorithms coincide on their judgment should receive priority over other options. A child in a unanimous matching cannot unanimously improve unless it would make another child unanimously worse. Unanimity provides both provides robustness against utilizing only one decision model (an algorithm or a human) and synthesizes the information that algorithms and humans generate regarding the value of any particular match when the two parties seek the same goal. Mostly positive concerns motivate the first point: an algorithm could be poor precisely in special circumstances where a human sees an obvious error. Institutional concerns (often concerns in other environments as well) motivate our second point: with the future of a child on the line, many practitioners are unwilling to purely rely on an algorithm - even if it is accurate-to place children in homes for practical, ethical, and legal concerns.\n\nOur main task is showing that our unanimity criterion is beneficial in theory and\n\npractice. Theoretically, we show that these matchings always exist, demonstrate how to construct them, and analyze their strategic and normative properties. Proposition 1 highlights a tradeoff between unanimity and efficiency. Constrained-efficiency circumvents this tradeoff through improving on unanimous matchings. Incontestable matchings need not improve on a unanimous matching, but they do guarantee that there exists no unanimous matchings that simultaneously Pareto improve. In that, constrained-efficiency emphasizes unanimity while incontestability emphasizes efficiency. Empirically, we compare human judgment to our mechanisms using experimental data from real caseworkers' preferences.\n\nConcretely, in foster care, a local matchmaker could use placement stability as its welfare measure, or evaluation, for children. The matchmaker's evaluations would be predicted placement stability. This is the probability that, if $c$ is placed at $h$, the placement would persist until $c$ permanently exits foster care. We will refer to this as persistence to avoid confusion with the matching theory term stability. Persistence is a generally agreeable goal among practitioners, but caseworkers still might fail to make the welfare optimal decision on behalf of the children they represent. Currently, caseworkers in almost all counties in the United States effectively follow a decentralized approach where the earliest caseworker to find a suitable home for a child can contact that home to begin the match. This is equivalent to a serial dictatorship ordered by time which will always yield a Pareto efficient matching. Using this process, one reason why caseworkers make suboptimal decisions is simple inexperience. Edwards and Wildeman (2018) estimates that the average caseworker only spends 1.8 years on the job before quitting. The field is notorious for high turnover rates, where the same authors estimate that $14-22 \\%$ of caseworkers turnover every year in the US. An inexperienced caseworker's judgment can, in turn, be quite poor, and the matchmaker should not rely on them alone for assessing persistence. This same concept applies to any organizational setting with misalignment.\n\nOne could hypothesize that the government could enforce an algorithm that matches children to homes purely based on its evaluations rather than caseworker preferences. However, to most practitioners, many features of foster care render it unamenable to algorithmic decision-making. Caseworkers routinely use qualitative information that is not easily encoded into usable data to make matching decisions. Moreover, as aforementioned, in a high-stakes environment, turning to full automation might not be an option. Last, caseworkers often simply do not trust algorithms. This motivates our use of preferences and evaluations. Including relevant caseworker datum and their choices in the process alleviates all of these problems. As it stands, to reap the boundless improvements from algorithmic decision-making seen in traditional matching theory applications like school choice, hospital-doctor matching, and kidney exchange, practitioners must agree to utilizing the methods invented in matching theory. Ensuring that they can incorporate algorithmic tools with human decision-making is a binding constraint. As we will detail in our empirical section, this simple strategy could greatly improve persistence in foster care and substantially benefit the tens of thousands of children entering foster care every year in the United States.\n\nFinally, implementing algorithmic matching could constitute a partial solution to the major labor supply issues seen in child welfare. Caseworkers are notoriously overwhelmed with large caseloads, and a simple system that uses an objective metric to place children with the best possible home could simplify caseworkers' decisions, decrease the amount of manual labor involved, and increase retention. Importantly, the algorithms we devise cannot replace caseworkers; we do not desire this. Instead, caseworkers would be an im-\n\nportant check-and-balance against an algorithm that may have systemic prediction errors that could harm children's persistence. Thus, our mechanisms would achieve the best of both worlds: maximum utilization of qualitative data present in caseworker preferences and automated optimization of child outcomes using predictive analytics.",

The preferences and evaluations are as follows:\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\n\n![table_1](table_1)\n\nLet $(i, j, k, x, y)$ indicate the matching where $\\mu(a)=i, \\mu(b)=j, \\mu(c)=k, \\mu(d)=x$, and $\\mu(e)=y$.

We will return to this fact later.\n\nNevertheless, this example highlights the perils of using serial dictatorships with firstcome ordering to select homes for children in foster care.

Denote $U$ as the set of all unanimously acceptable and feasible matchings for the problem $L$.\n\nLemma 1. The relation $\\triangleright_{U D}$ is a strict partial order on the set $U$.\nProof. We demonstrate irreflexivity, asymmetry, and transitivity. First, observe that for any $\\mu=\\mu^{\\prime}, I^{*}(\\mu)=I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\kappa(\\mu)=\\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, $\\neg\\left(\\mu \\triangleright_{U D} \\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$. Second, if $\\mu \\triangleright_{U D} \\mu^{\\prime}$ then $I^{*}(\\mu) \\subset I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ or $\\kappa(\\mu) \\subset \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$, implying that $\\neg\\left(\\mu^{\\prime} \\triangleright_{U D} \\mu\\right)$. It remains to show transitivity. Suppose, for a contradiction, that $\\triangleright_{U D}$ is not transitive on comparable elements in $L$. Then, there must exist some $x, y, z \\in U$ such that $x \\triangleright_{U D} y, y \\triangleright_{U D} z$, but $\\neg\\left(z \\triangleright_{U D} x\\right)$. This implies that either (a) $I^{*}(z) \\subseteq I^{*}(x)$ and $\\kappa(z) \\subseteq \\kappa(x)$, (b) $I^{*}(z) \\subset I^{*}(x)$, or (c) $\\kappa(z) \\subset \\kappa(x)$. However, by definition of unanimity, we have that (i) either $I^{*}(x) \\subset I^{*}(y)$ or $\\kappa(x) \\subset \\kappa(y)$, (ii) either $I^{*}(y) \\subset I^{*}(z)$ or $\\kappa(y) \\subset \\kappa(z)$, and (iii) $I^{*}(x) \\subseteq I^{*}(y) \\subseteq I^{*}(z)$ and $\\kappa(x) \\subseteq \\kappa(y) \\subseteq \\kappa(z)$. (iii) rules out case (b) and (c). By (i) and (ii) we have:\n\n$$\nI^{*}(x) \\subset I^{*}(y) \\subseteq I^{*}(z)\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\kappa(x) \\subset \\kappa(y) \\subseteq \\kappa(z)\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the remaining case (a). This proves the lemma.\nCorollary 1. A unanimous matching always exists.\nProof. Suppose not. Then for any $\\mu \\in U$, there exists another $\\mu^{\\prime}$ such that $\\mu \\triangleright_{U D} \\mu^{\\prime}$. By transitivity of the partial order and finiteness of $U$, this is impossible.\n\nThese two results show that unanimous matchings have well-ordered structure that trivially offers existence. The unanimous domination order is the same as Pareto dominance: irreflexivity, asymmetry, and transitivity all hold for both on the set of feasible matchings. Still, in the Proposition below, we find that this does not guarantee that combining unanimity and efficiency yields positive results. For the proof below, we denote the sets of unanimous homes (homes where the child has no unanimous improvement) as $H^{*}: C \\rightarrow 2^{H}$.\n\nProposition 1. An efficient and unanimous matching can fail to exist.\nProof. Consider the following market with $C=\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and $H=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The preferences and evaluations are as follows:\n\n![table_2](table_2)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& d \\\\\n& \\succ_{c}: 4,3,2,1 \\\\\n& >_{c}: 4,3,2,1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sets of unanimous homes for each child are: $H^{*}(a)=\\{1,3,4\\}, H^{*}(b)=\\{1,2,3\\}$, $H^{*}(c)=\\{1\\}$, and $H^{*}(d)=\\{4\\}$. We can build the matching $\\mu=(3,2,1,4)$ which has unanimous children $I^{*}(\\mu)=\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. One can verify that this is the only matching where all children are unanimous. Therefore, it is the only unanimous matching. However, $\\mu$ is Pareto dominated by $\\mu^{\\prime}=(2,3,1,4)$. This proves the Proposition.\n\nThe key insight from this counterexample is that a child need not remain unanimous even after improving with respect to her own preferences. A Pareto improvement can entail a worse evaluation. In the previous Proposition, a Pareto improving to 2 from 3 gives her the worst possible evaluation. Compared to this, the matchmaker would prefer her at 1 and $a$ would prefer the same. This \"non-monotonicity\" of unanimity with respect to Pareto improvements implies the non-existence result.\n\nNext, we turn to the first steps to construct unanimous matchings. We will prove a useful proposition below. We introduce the notion of unanimous rankings. We call $>_{I(c)} \\in P$ the unanimous ranking for $c$ if it satisfies, for all $h, h^{\\prime} \\in H, h>_{I(c)} h^{\\prime}$ if and only if either (a) $h \\in H^{*}(c)$ and $h^{\\prime} \\notin H^{*}(c)$ or (b) $h \\in H^{-}(c)$ and $h^{\\prime} \\notin H^{*}(c) \\cup H^{-}(c)$. Otherwise, $h \\sim_{I(c)} h^{\\prime}$, i.e., $h$ and $h^{\\prime}$ are indifferent on the unanimous ranking. For all $h, h>_{I(c)} \\varnothing$ if and only if $h$ is unanimously acceptable. The vector of all unanimous rankings is $>_{I}=\\left\\{>_{I(c)}\\right\\}_{c \\in C}$. Under this ranking, the child is indifferent between all homes that have no unanimous improvement, and the child strictly prefers all homes with no unanimous improvement to homes that have unanimous improvements.\n\nProposition 2. A matching $\\mu$ is unanimous on $L$ if and only if it is efficient on $L^{\\prime}=$ $\\left(M,>_{I},>\\right)$.\n\nProof. In the Appendix.\nProposition 2 identifies a striking reduction: instead of constructing a new mechanism to identify unanimous matchings, the problem can be simplified by constructing \"unanimous preferences\" that input into any Pareto efficient mechanism. The details are delicate because the unanimous ranking contains indifference. We describe the Serial Dictatorship with Indifference (SDI) mechanism that adequately accommodates this slight nuance in the next section. Using SDI and Proposition 2, we obtain unanimous matchings. Nevertheless, the space of unanimous matchings can be large. Using the groundwork laid here, our main results offer two novel methods: one to find a constrained-efficient and unanimous matching and another to find incontestable matchings.",

Before describing these, we provide a formal definition for SDI which computes unanimous matchings. For short, we will denote the problem $L^{I}=\\left(M,>_{I},>\\right)$ as the transformation of the problem $L=(M, \\succ,>)$ with the unanimity order $>_{I}$ defined on $\\succ$ and $>$.\n\nWe provide Serial Dictatorship with Indifferences, an algorithm to compute unanimous matchings directly, for completeness. It is frequently alluded to in the literature on onesided matching but rarely described in detail. SDI allows children to select allocations, or outcomes as referred to in social choice theory, that they are indifferent between. The next dictator selects allocations from those that remain, and so on. This process is Pareto efficient just as SD is in the setting with no indifference.\n\nProposition 3. Serial Dictatorship with Indifference is unanimous.\nProof. This follows from the fact that SDI is Pareto efficient. Suppose, for a contradiction, that it is not, i.e., $\\phi_{S D I} \\triangleright_{P D} \\mu^{\\prime}$ for some $\\mu^{\\prime} \\in U$. Consider the earliest dictator $c$ in round\n\nAlgorithm 1.

Set $U^{n+1}=U_{c}$.\n\nIf all children have been dictators or all homes are matched in every allocation in $U^{n+1}$, then terminate and return any $\\mu \\in U^{n+1}$. Otherwise, continue to round $n+1$.\n$n$ such that $\\mu^{\\prime}(c) \\succ_{c} \\phi_{S D I}(c) . \\quad c$ would have chosen $\\mu^{\\prime}$ if it were available, and every allocation in every future round $j>n$ must keep $c$ indifferent to $\\mu^{\\prime} . \\mu^{\\prime}$ must not have been available in round $n$. Hence, some dictator $c^{\\prime}$ in an earlier round $k<n$ did not choose $\\mu^{\\prime}$. This implies that $\\phi_{S D I}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$, contradicting $\\phi_{S D I} \\triangleright_{P D} \\mu^{\\prime}$. Therefore, SDI is Pareto efficient. By Proposition 2, it is unanimous when applied to the problem $L^{I}$.\n\nUnanimous matchings can exhibit large degrees of inefficiency; in the example given below, we demonstrate an extreme case where any matching is unanimous but only one is efficient.\n\nExample 2. Unanimous matchings can be inefficient.\nConsider the following market with $C=\\{a, b, c\\}$ and $H=\\{1,2,3\\}$. The preferences and evaluations are as follows:\n\n![table_3](table_3)\n\nAll homes are unanimous for all children, but the only efficient matching has all children receiving their top choices, i.e., $\\mu=(1,2,3)$.\n\nWe desire mechanisms that satisfy unanimity (or nearly so) and, subject to that constraint, are also efficient. Our first mechanism is a variant of Top Trading Cycles which uses the insight from Proposition 2 to improve on any unanimous matching so that it meets our constrained efficiency criteria. We describe the operation of our mechanism, Unanimous Top Trading Cycles (UTTC), in Algorithm 2.\n\nProposition 4. Unanimous Top Trading Cycles is constrained-efficient and unanimous.\nProof. In the Appendix.\nConstrained efficiency requires that one cannot Pareto improve children without unanimously worsening a child. Our approach fixes a unanimous matching and uses TTC on a restricted problem where unanimous children only point to their favorite unanimous",

By the unanimity of the original matching, it is a given that we cannot find another matching where we can expand the set of unanimous children. Therefore, we know that any matching that is more efficient requires unanimously worsening some child, and we can use this pointing rule without loss. The remainder of the proof for constrained efficiency involves showing that the rule still guarantees no Pareto improvements unless the improvement necessitates unanimously worsening a child, and this follows from the same reasoning as above. The Theorem follows.\n\nUTTC allows the matchmaker to improve on any unanimous matching which may be useful in large markets where a large number of unanimous homes can create substantial opportunity for Pareto improving trades. One can see that UTTC would execute the trade between $a$ and $c$ in the Illustrative Example.\n\nIn some circumstances, even constrained efficiency may be a weak requirement when the matchmaker has a strong motivation to see one decision model maximally utilized. A constrained efficient matching can be Pareto dominated by many other unanimous matchings. Hence, we are interested in the contrary: can we find a matching that is only Pareto dominated by a matching that is not unanimous, i.e., a incontestable matching? The answer is yes. We do so using our second mechanism elaborated in Algorithm 3: Linear Exchange. It is an innovation on the SD mechanism with substantially different properties.\n\nThe mechanism relies on a modification of unanimity-weak unanimity-and cycles we term strict unanimously improving cycles. A matching $\\mu$ is weak unanimously dominated by $\\mu^{\\prime}$ if, for every $c$ such that $\\mu(c) \\neq \\mu^{\\prime}(c)$, (a) $c \\in I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $c \\notin I^{*}(\\mu)$ or (b) $c \\in \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $c \\notin \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$, i.e., if a child's match changes between the two, the child must reallocate to a unanimous home. $\\mu$ is weakly unanimous if it is not weak unanimously dominated. Trivially, every unanimous matching is weakly unanimous. A strict unanimously improving cycle (SU-cycle) on $\\mu$ is a cycle $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ where $\\mu\\left(c_{j+1}\\right)>_{I\\left(c_{j}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{j}\\right)$ for all $j \\neq n$ and $\\mu\\left(c_{1}\\right)>_{I\\left(c_{n}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{n}\\right)$. A strict unanimously improving chain (SU-chain) is some $c, h$ (where possibly $h=\\varnothing$ ) with $\\mu(h)=\\varnothing$ such that $h>_{I(c)} \\mu(c)$. We prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma 2. $\\mu$ is weakly unanimous if and only if there are no strict unanimously improving cycles nor chains.\n\nProof. $(\\Longrightarrow)$ We prove the following claim: if $\\mu$ has a SU-cycle or SU-chain, then $\\mu$",

This will be a SU-cycle.\n\nUsing this Lemma, we obtain our next result.\nTheorem 1. The following statements are true:\ni. Linear Exchange is incontestable.\nii. Linear Exchange is weakly unanimous.\niii. Any weakly unanimous matching that Pareto dominates Linear Exchange is unanimously dominated by Linear Exchange.\n\nProof. In the Appendix.\nNote that the algorithm terminates. In every round, either a child is matched or a child is unmatched while another is matched and permanently removed from the exchange. $\\phi_{L E}$ will terminate since it does so when all children are matched, there are no children left in the exchange, or there are no homes left in the exchange.\n\nThe structure of an exchange mechanism is similar to dictatorial mechanisms in that an arbitrary ordering determines a series of children that will, in turn, select their most unanimous option from all available options. However, it differs in the key feature that children with potential to Pareto improve remain in the exchange, and children that would Pareto- and unanimously-improve their matching by replacing a children within the exchange can do so. The surprise of the Linear Exchange mechanism is that, when the replacement rule is carefully designed not to generate SU-cycles among children outside of the exchange, replacements will not generate strict unanimously improving trades among any children. One can verify that $\\phi_{L E}$ runs in polynomial time as the key step-checking for SU-cycles - can be done in linear time and is repeated, at most, $|C| *|H|$ times.\n\nTheorem 1 implies that Linear Exchange navigates a middle ground between unanimity and efficiency: it is more efficient than or comparably efficient as every unanimous matching (incontestable) and more unanimous than every weakly unanimous matching that is more efficient. The value of weak unanimity emerges when unanimity is a constraint rather than a goal. Weak unanimity eliminates obvious trades that increase unanimity. The matchmaker may be willing to allow trades that are not obvious, i.e., those that require reallocations among children that would move between homes without a clear change in unanimity. The natural question is: how will the mechanism perform in practice? We relegate this to our experimental work which compares the status quo (SD), SDI, UTTC, and LE.\n\nWe note that neither incontestability nor property (iii) in Theorem 1 are trivial. In the following example, we compare LE to a \"naive efficient\" Serial Dictatorship that uses the following rule: the dictator chooses a unanimous home if possible, an animous home if not, and nothing otherwise. Break ties by choosing the dictator's most preferred home. This mechanism will always produce a weakly unanimous matching, but it does not possess the other desirable properties.",

      "text": "# 3.3 Strategic Incentives \n\nIn this section, we prove several key results about the strategic properties of unanimous matching mechanisms. We find that there is no unanimous and strategy proof matching mechanism (Proposition 5). In addition, the manipulations that caseworkers could pursue are concerning to the healthy operation of any unanimous matching mechanism. Subsequently, based on Troyan and Morrill (2019), we evaluate our mechanism's obvious manipulability, that is, whether or not an agent that has limited contingent reasoning can evaluate successful manipulations.\n\nProposition 5. A weakly unanimous and strategy-proof mechanism does not exist.\nProof. Consider the following market with $C=\\{a, b, c\\}$ and $H=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The preferences, evaluations, and induced unanimity orders are as follows, where omitted homes are not unanimously acceptable and brackets indicate indifference:\n\n![table_5](table_5)\n\nThe following matchings are weakly unanimous: $(1,3, \\varnothing),(1,4,3),(4,1,3)$, and $(4,3, \\varnothing)$. A weakly unanimous mechanism must output one of these matches. We prove that each one would induce some child to have a profitable manipulation.\n\nFirst, consider $(1,3, \\varnothing),(1,4,3)$, or $(4,3, \\varnothing)$. We will denote $>_{b}^{\\prime}$ as the preference ranking where $b$ reports only 2 as acceptable. Under this report, only 2 would be a unanimous home for $b$. The resulting two weakly unanimous matchings would be $(1,2,3)$ and $(4,2,3)$. In either case, $b$ has a profitable manipulation.\n\nNext, consider $(4,1,3)$. Let $>_{a}^{\\prime}$ be the preference ranking where $a$ reports only 2 as acceptable. Then the only weakly unanimous matchings are: $(2,1,3),(2,3, \\varnothing)$, and $(2,4,3)$. In any case, $a$ has a profitable manipulation.\n\nTherefore, under any weakly unanimous matching that is selected, either $a$ or $b$ have a profitable manipulation, contradicting the existence of a weakly unanimous and strategyproof mechanism.\n$a$ and $b$ 's improving manipulations are simple: refuse to report less-preferred options when anticipating that they might be relegated to one of them. The Proposition trivially implies that there is also no unanimous and strategy proof mechanism since every unanimous matching is weakly unanimous. Unfortunately, this counterexample also demonstrates that any unanimous mechanism is manipulable by truncations in such a\n\nway that a falsifying child can find a Pareto improvement without necessarily matching to another unanimous home. In the worst case scenario where all agents adopt truncation strategies, this could severely harm children's welfare.\n\nThe very structure of unanimous matchings requires the matchmaker to use the reported preferences against the preferred interests of the children when there is no unanimous agreement. In particular, when the matchmaker knows that children have acceptable homes that generate no unanimous improvement, the matchmaker is obligated to attempt to assign the children to these homes irregardless of whether they are the children's most preferred homes. This proves to defeat strategy-proofness altogether.\n\nHowever, this all comes with one important caveat that has been an observation leading to a burgeoning literature of matching under incomplete information: it is unlikely that caseworkers know the preferences of other agents. In our setting-and in the case of unanimous matching in general-the asymmetric information is more extreme, because caseworkers do not know the matchmaker's evaluations for all children ${ }^{6}$. How, then, should a caseworker evaluate manipulations under incomplete information? We adopt the notion of non-obvious manipulability as in Troyan and Morrill (2019). In short, a mechanism is non-obviously manipulable if there is no manipulation that makes a child strictly better off in the worst case or best case compared to truth-telling when she does not know others' preferences and evaluations.\n\nWe assume that every child knows her own preferences and evaluations. Fixing $M$, a matching $\\mu$ is consistent with $\\phi, \\succ_{c}$, and $>_{c}$ if there is some profile of preferences $\\succ_{-c}$ and evaluations $>-_{c}$ such that $\\phi\\left[M, \\succ_{c}, \\succ_{-c},>_{c},>-_{c}\\right]=\\mu$. We denote the set of matchings consistent with $\\succ_{c}$ and $>_{c}$ :\n\n$$\nC U\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right]=\\left\\{\\mu: \\phi\\left[M, \\succ_{c},>_{-c},>_{c},>-_{c}\\right]=\\mu \\text { for some } \\succ_{-c},>-_{c}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe worst possible consistent matchings for $c$ given $\\succ_{c}$ and $>_{c}$ are:\n\n$$\nC U^{-}\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right]=\\left\\{\\mu: \\mu \\in C U\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right] \\text { and } \\mu^{\\prime}(c) \\succsim_{c} \\mu(c) \\text { for all } \\mu^{\\prime} \\in C U\\left[\\succ_{c}\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand the best possible consistent matchings for $c$ given $\\succ_{c}$ and $>_{c}$ are:\n\n$$\nC U^{-}\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right]=\\left\\{\\mu: \\mu \\in C U\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right] \\text { and } \\mu(c) \\succsim_{c} \\mu^{\\prime}(c) \\text { for all } \\mu^{\\prime} \\in C U\\left[\\succ_{c}\\right]\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWe will sometimes refer to these worst and best consistent matchings as singular without loss of generality as we could select an arbitrary element from the sets. We say that $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime}$ is a worst-case manipulation if:\n\n$$\nC U^{-}\\left[\\succ_{c}^{\\prime},>_{c}\\right](c) \\succ_{c} C U^{-}\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right](c)\n$$\n\nand $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime}$ is a best-case manipulation if:\n\n$$\nC U^{+}\\left[\\succ_{c}^{\\prime},>_{c}\\right](c) \\succ_{c} C U^{+}\\left[\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right](c)\n$$\n\nA mechanism $\\phi$ is non-obviously manipulable if no $c$ has a worst-case nor best-case manipulation. We can now state our result.\n\nTheorem 2. The following statements are true:\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ The evaluations for a given child might be reported to the caseworker that represents that child, but they need not be reported to caseworkers that do not represent the child.\n\ni. Any unanimous matching mechanism is obviously manipulable.\nii. Serial Dictatorship with Indifference and Linear Exchange are non-obviously manipulable if $|H| \\leq|C|$.\n\nProof. In the Appendix.\nThe Theorem is silent on UTTC. It is easy to prove that the mechanism is nonobviously manipulable conditional on the initial endowment. However, UTTC must always input a unanimous matching. Any unanimous matching mechanism it uses to generate an endowment will be obviously manipulable. Therefore, UTTC is obviously manipulable by proxy.\n\nThe proof for the non-obvious manipulability of SDI and LE under the imbalance condition is fairly straightforward. The best-case for a child $c$ when truth-telling is always matching to her most preferred home which is always unanimous. We can find another set of preferences and evaluations for other children that will ensure that this match for $c$ is unanimous. Therefore, the key step is to prove that the worst-case for truth-telling is never strictly worse than the worst-case under any misreport. This follows from one observation. Children that go later in the order are at a disadvantage when children earlier in the order will permanently match to unanimous homes, which occurs when these children's unanimous homes align with their most preferred home. Under such a worst-case conjecture, manipulations can never help. If we return to the same example in Proposition 5, when $a$ reports that only 2 is acceptable, she will be unmatched under the conjecture that either $b$ or $c$ is prior to her in the order and has a most preferred home 2 .\n\nCondition (i) in Theorem 2 is bad news. We add that Linear Exchange is obviously manipulable in general. When the number of homes is large relative to the number of children, the obvious strategy for a child is to truncate her preferences to remove her least preferred homes (up until the length of her preference list matches the number of children) so that there is no possibility that the mechanism matches her to one of them to enforce unanimity. However, condition (ii), and our approach to modeling this problem, provide good news. First, for our application, there is almost always a shortage of foster homes, meaning that the Theorem will apply. Second, the proof for condition (ii) shows that the mechanisms have no best-case manipulation, and the only worstcase manipulation are truncations leaving at least $|C|$ homes as unanimously acceptable. Third, the concern that children might manipulate the mechanism is predicated on the underlying assumption that children universally want to satisfy their preferences at all costs. This may not be true.\n\nIn foster care, children's preferences-as mentioned-are actually caseworker preferences on behalf of children. Caseworkers themselves can be unsure of what homes are best for children; consequently, the algorithm's ranking might be informative of some unknown social welfare parameter. In this case, it would not necessarily be beneficial to pursue a manipulation that guarantees a Pareto improvement without guaranteeing a unanimous improvement. Furthermore, the manipulations that guarantee unanimous improvement are not necessarily harmful. We conclude that it is critical that the matchmaker is aware of the strategic incentives that might arise when implementing our mechanisms and that an organization should strive to align its decision-makers and algorithm with its objective in order to mitigate strategic behavior.",

      "text": "# 3.4 A General Theory of Matching with Preference Aggregation \n\nOur results above offer a promising direction for future research. Our primary focus in this paper is the applied problem of matching foster children to foster homes with human and algorithm decision-making, but Proposition 2 hints that a number of preference aggregation rules other than unanimity could emerge as viable candidates for this task. Here, we briefly outline a general framework that we term matching with preference aggregation, and we show that no desirable aggregation rule can restore positive strategyproofness results. An aggregation rule will input preferences and evaluations and output an aggregated ranking. We will then seek to find matchings that are efficient with respect to the aggregated ranking and mechanisms that are, in some sense, strategy-proof on the problem with the aggregated ranking. Strategy-proofness takes on a new form in this framework owing in part to institutional constraints and in part to the intricacies of matching with preference aggregation. We address each.\n\nGroup Efficiency Concerns in Practice-As we outlined in our Introduction, no counties that we are aware of use matching mechanisms to match children to homes. However, there are some that use match recommendation tools. Slaugh et al. (2016) redesigns the match recommendation system used by a Pennsylvania statewide child welfare authority. Children unable to find a match in the local county would be forwarded to the state authority, and the state would use the system to identify suitable homes for the child. As of 2025, we verified with the practitioners in question that the general procedure outlined here was still operational. However, an issue that Slaugh et al. identified-and that we confirmed still exists to some degree-is that the match recommendation system was not heeded because caseworkers questioned the matches it proposed. We quote their account of the problem highlighted when they surveyed the caseworkers in Pennsylvania counties: \"[O]nly 32 percent agreed with the statement that PAE does a good job of recommending the most suitable families via electronic matches from the Resource Family Registry for each child.\"\n\nWe interviewed caseworkers in one county that, even after the redesign, parroted this sentiment. Another perspective from Slaugh et al. explains how they view the role of the new system they provided to the state: \"[O]ur algorithm generates a list of mere recommendations that may be implemented in conjunction with the judgment of the professionals ... [In foster care], such ranking information is impossible to elicit directly because of limitations such as market size and informational asymmetry. One main function of our algorithm can be seen as constructing such preferences from given pieces of information [about homes] and using them as the basis of recommendations.\" In other words, caseworkers cannot fully form preferences, so the algorithm completes them by using a large swathe of information about homes that humans would otherwise need to manually sort through. Then, the caseworker reviews the recommendations and selects matches that accord with her own, true preferences. One can see this as an informal case of matching with preference aggregation where the recommendation system is the algorithm; the key difference is that the matches it produces are not binding.\n\nThe intuition behind why a county might abandon this match recommendation system is not that a single caseworker might find matches she prefers more than the recommendation. Consider a situation where one caseworker is unsatisfied, others receive their most preferred match from the recommendation system, and there are no unmatched homes. This is Pareto efficient. The fundamental problem is that multiple caseworkers could be unsatisfied with recommendations-being able to jointly improve from a \"recom-\n\nmendation reallocation\"-or that unmatched homes might be more preferable than the recommendation. In other words, matching with preference aggregation does not always produce efficient allocations. In Pennsylvania, this proved to be its downfall. One might hypothesize that, if the recommendations were efficient, even if there were caseworkers who could benefit by strategically providing incorrect information to the recommendation system to benefit their recommendation, they would not do so. The reason why is that caseworkers are to do right by all children and colleagues, but strategic manipulation of an efficient matching is guaranteed to harm some other caseworker's preferences.\n\nTheoretic Concerns-This connects to the fine details of strategic incentives in matching with preference aggregation. As we demonstrated with Example 2, a matching that is efficient with respect to aggregated preferences can be $\\succ$-inefficient. Therefore, our first criteria for a \"strategy-proof\" aggregation rule and mechanism is that there should be no profitable manipulation by a child that does not harm another child. This is a relaxed version of strategy-proofness that considers only particular types of manipulations.\n\nWe add a second criteria. There should additionally be no profitable manipulation by the algorithm that can weakly improve all children with respect to its preferences. Suppose that this did not hold. A matchmaker that uses, for instance, predictive analytics to assess match persistence could have strange and perverse incentives to artificially distort the predictions. One could argue that this reduces confidence in utilizing a mechanism with aggregated preferences at all. The matchmaker might even be driven to dictate the matches purely by the algorithm - a very undesirable option as we discussed in the Preliminaries-thereby avoiding inefficiencies. Hence, we would like to ensure that the mechanism attains $>$-efficiency when the matchmaker provides the true algorithmic predictions to the mechanism.\n\nWe retain our previous notation. An aggregation rule $\\tau: P \\times P \\rightarrow P$ maps two rankings (a preference and an evaluation) into one ranking. The aggregate ranking vector is $\\bar{\\tau}=\\left\\{\\tau\\left(\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right)\\right\\}_{c \\in C}$. Every aggregation rule defines a subproblem $L_{\\tau} \\equiv(M, \\bar{\\tau}) . \\quad \\phi$ is $(\\tau-)$ group robust if (i) for all $c$ and manipulations $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime}$, if $\\phi\\left[\\left(M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{\\prime},>_{c}\\right), \\bar{\\tau}_{-c}\\right](c) \\succ_{c}\\right.$ $\\left.\\phi\\left[L_{\\tau}\\right](c)\\right.$, then $\\left.\\phi\\left[L_{\\tau}\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} \\phi\\left[\\left(M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{\\prime},>_{c}\\right), \\bar{\\tau}_{-c}\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)\\right.$ for some $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$ and (ii) for all $c$ and manipulations $>_{c}^{\\prime}$, if $\\phi\\left[\\left(M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c},>_{c}^{\\prime}\\right), \\bar{\\tau}_{-c}\\right](c)>_{c} \\phi\\left[L_{\\tau}\\right](c)\\right.$, then $\\left.\\phi\\left[L_{\\tau}\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)>_{c^{\\prime}} \\phi\\left[\\left(M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}\\right.\\right.\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.,>_{c}^{\\prime}\\right), \\bar{\\tau}_{-c}\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ for some $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$.\n\nThis framework has immediate parallels to social choice theory and, in anticipation for the main result in this section, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem (Gibbard 1973, henceforth GS). The aggregation $\\tau\\left(\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right)$ is a social outcome with two interested parties: the child $c$ and the matchmaker. This reveals three important distinctions between matching with preference aggregation and social choice theory. First, there are only two parties. Many \"voting rules\" (aggregations) will be degenerate due to frequent ties. Second, we greatly relax strategy-proofness to only outlaw manipulations that are efficient improvements with respect to either $\\succ$ or $>$. Third, the social outcome is not important per-se. It is only relevant insofar as it affects matchings. These three differences might offer some hope that group robust mechanisms exist more in wider variety than in social choice theory. Our main result below shows that this is not true for most desirable rules and mechanisms.\n\nBefore we state the result, we give additional definitions. Let $T_{c} \\equiv \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c},>_{c}\\right)$ be the aggregated preference relation. We will consider aggregation rules $\\tau$ that select strict rankings, noting that we will show that our mechanism desideratum from earlier sections can be reduced to a case of strict preference aggregation. $\\tau$ follows the weak Pareto principle (WPP) if, (a) for any $h, h^{\\prime} \\in H$ such that $h \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}$ and $h>_{c} h^{\\prime}$, then $h T_{c} h^{\\prime}$ and\n\n(b) for any $h \\in H$ such that $\\varnothing \\succ_{c} h$ and $\\varnothing>_{c} h$, then $\\varnothing T_{c} h$, and (c) for any $h \\in H$. such that $h \\succ_{c} \\varnothing$ and $h>_{c} \\varnothing$, then $h T_{c} \\varnothing$. WPP requires that ranking a home higher on both rankings than another ensures that the home is at least as highly ranked under $\\tau$ as the other. It also requires that unanimously acceptable homes remain acceptable and unanimously unacceptable homes remain unacceptable.\n\nA (deterministic) mechanism $\\phi$ satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) if it is independent of worse alternatives (IWA) and independent of unmatched alternatives (IUA). IWA requires a child shuffling homes without lowering the ranking of the child's matched home has no effect on a mechanism. Formally, whenever $\\phi[L]=\\mu$ for some problem $L, \\phi\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right]=\\mu$ for any problem $L^{\\prime}=\\left(M, \\succ^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $\\succ^{\\prime}{ }_{-c} \\succ \\succ_{-c}$ and $\\succ^{\\prime}{ }_{c}$ satisfies if $\\mu(c) \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}\\left(\\mu(c) \\sim_{c} h^{\\prime}\\right)$ for some $h^{\\prime} \\in H$, then $\\mu(c) \\succ^{\\prime}{ }_{c} h^{\\prime}\\left(\\mu(c) \\succ^{\\prime}{ }_{c} h^{\\prime}\\right)$. A mechanism satisfies IUA if a child's misreport that causes her to be matched to an unmatched home does not affect other children if they would not match to the child's old home. Formally, for any $\\succ, \\succ^{\\prime}$ where $\\succ^{\\prime}{ }_{-c}=\\succ_{-c}$, if $\\phi\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right](\\phi[L](c))=\\varnothing$ and $\\phi[L]\\left(\\phi\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right](c)\\right)=\\varnothing$, then $\\phi[L]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)=\\phi\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ for any $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$. It is immediate that SD and TTC will satisfy both criterion.\n\nA serial choice rule (SCR) $\\tau$ is defined by a predetermined series of dictators which we can denote $\\tau^{D}=(c, m, \\ldots)$ where $c$ indicates that the child is the dictator, and $m$ indicates that the matchmaker is the dictator. The aggregated preference is constructed by the dictator choosing her top home that has not been chosen before to be the next home in the ranking. The next dictator does the same and so on. We denote the length of the sequence $\\tau^{D}$ as $\\# \\tau^{D}$ and assume that $\\# \\tau^{D} \\geq|C|$. A SCR is dictatorial if every element in $\\tau^{D}$ is equivalent, i.e., if $\\tau=\\succ_{c}$ or $\\tau=>_{c}$ in the case where $\\# \\tau \\geq|H|$.\n\nTheorem 3. When $|H| \\geq|C|+2$, for any $\\tau$ satisfying the weak Pareto principle, an efficient, strategy-proof, and IIA mechanism $\\phi$ is group robust if and only if $\\tau$ is a dictatorial serial choice rule.\n\nProof. We prove that if $\\phi$ is efficient, strategy-proof, and IIA, then it is only group robust for a $\\tau$ satisfying WPP if $\\tau$ is a dictatorial serial choice rule. First, we show that the rule is a serial choice rule and prove that it is dictatorial in a later step. We will prove the Theorem for the simplifying case where $|C|=1$ and $|H| \\geq 3$. Then, we extend it to any case where $|C|$ is finite and positive and $|H| \\geq|C|+2$.\n\nLet $C=\\{c\\}$ and $1,2 \\in H$ be two distinct homes. Consider the rankings:\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c}: 1,2, j\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n>_{c}: 2,1, j\n$$\n\nwhere for any other $j \\in H, 2 \\succ_{c} j$ and $1>_{c} j$.\nClaim 1: if $\\tau$ follows WPP, then $\\phi(c) \\in\\{1,2\\}$ for any efficient (with respect to $L_{r}$ ) and group robustness $\\phi$. WPP implies that $1 T_{c} j$ and $2 T_{c} j$. Since either 1 or 2 will always be unmatched, the claim immediately follows by efficiency.\n\nSuppose that $\\phi(c)=2$. We have that $2 T_{c} 1$ by efficiency.\nClaim 2: Given that $\\phi(c)=2$, for any arbitrary preference $\\succ^{\\prime \\prime}$ and any evaluation $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where 2 is top-ranked with corresponding aggregation $T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}, 2 T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} i$ for any $i \\neq 2$\n\nConsider a report for $c$ :\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c}^{j}: 1, j, 2\n$$\n\ni.e., $1 \\succ_{c}^{J} j$ and $j \\succ_{c}^{J} 2$ for all $j \\neq 1,2$. Denote $T_{c}^{J} \\equiv \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)$. By group robustness, we still have that $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c) \\neq 1$. If $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=j$, then we must have that $j T_{c}^{J} 1$. However, by WPP, we have that $1 T_{c}^{J} j$, a contradiction. Therefore, $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=2$.\n\nNow, we will consider a series of preferences and evaluations to show the Claim. We denote these as sequences to shorten exposition. Let the binary relation representing the aggregation in each case be $T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n(1) Preferences are $(1, i)$ where 1 is preferred to any $i \\neq 1$ and each $i$ is positioned arbitrarily. Evaluations are $(2,1, i)$. By the same logic as above, the match must still be 2 .\n(2) Preferences are $(1, i)$ and evaluations are $(2, i)$. By group robustness, the match must still be 2 , otherwise the matchmaker could deviate to the report in (1).\n(3) Preferences are some arbitrary $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and evaluations are $(2, i)$. Suppose that the match is not 2. In the case where $c$ 's preferences are as in $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}, c$ has an incentive to deviate to $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$, contradicting group robustness. The match must still be 2 . Therefore, for any arbitrary preference $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime},>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where 2 is top-ranked we have that $\\phi\\left[\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime},>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right](c)=2$. This implies that $2 T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} i$ for any $i \\neq 2$.\n\nClaim 3: Given that $\\phi(c)=1$, for any preference $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where 1 is top-ranked and any arbitrary evaluation $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ with corresponding aggregation $T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}, 1 T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} i$ for any $i \\neq 2$ The argument proceeds as in Claim 2 symmetrically.\n\nWe can apply these arguments to any pair of homes $i, k$, and, by Claim 1, either $\\phi(c)=i$ or $\\phi(c)=k$. This will partition $H$ into sets $H_{2}$ (homes such that Claim 2 will apply) and $H_{3}$ (homes such that Claim 3 will apply). Suppose that $\\left|H_{2}\\right|>0$ and $\\left|H_{3}\\right|>0$. For any generic elements $i \\in H_{2}$ and $k \\in H_{3}$, we can take arbitrary evaluations and preferences for $c$ such that $i$ and $k$ are at the top, respectively. By each claim, we must have that $\\phi(c)=i$ and $\\phi(c)=k$, which is impossible. Therefore, either $H_{2}=H$ or $H_{3}=H$ but not both. Without loss of generality, suppose that $H_{3}=H$ Then, $i T_{c} j$ for any $j \\neq i$ when $i$ is top-ranked under preferences.\n\nFor $|C|=n$, we use induction. First, notice that one can extend the above argument to any $|C|$ by inserting an additional child and home such that the child's only acceptable home under both rankings is the additional home. However, we only proved that $\\tau$ is dictatorial for the top choice. We extend this to $\\# \\tau^{D} \\geq n$.\n\nInduction Statement: for a market with $|C| \\geq n$, an efficient and IIA $\\phi$ can only be group robust if $\\tau$ is equivalent to a serial choice rule where $\\# \\tau^{D} \\geq n$. We proved the base case $n=1$ above. We show it for $n+1$ assuming that it holds for all integers $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$.\n\nConsider a hypothetical market where $|C|=n+1$. For all $c^{\\prime} \\in C$, we will specify the following rankings:\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c^{\\prime}}: 1,2, \\ldots, n, x, y, j\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n>_{c^{\\prime}}: 1,2, \\ldots, n, y, x, j\n$$\n\nwhere exactly $n$ homes precede $x$ under the preferences and $n$ homes precede $y$ under the evaluations, and $j$ is defined as in the case with $|C|=1$.\n\nBy the WPP, we have that $i T_{c^{\\prime}} i+1$ for all integers $i \\in[1, n]$. By efficiency, $\\phi(i) \\neq \\varnothing$ . We also have that there exists some $c \\in C$ such that $\\phi(c) \\neq i^{\\prime}$ for any such $i^{\\prime}$ by the pigeonhole principle. By the same logic as Claim 1 above, $\\phi(c) \\in\\{x, y\\}$.\n\nClaim 4: Given that $\\phi(c)=y$, for any arbitrary preferences $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and any evaluation $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where $y$ is ranked before $x, j, y T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} x$ and $y T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} j$.\n\nConsider a report for $c$ :\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c}^{J}: 1,2, \\ldots, n, x, j, y\n$$\n\nIf $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c) \\succ_{c} x$ then $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=n^{\\prime}$ for some $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$. However, this contradicts IIA because $n^{\\prime} T_{c}^{J} i$ and $n^{\\prime} T_{c} i$ for any $i>n^{\\prime}$, but switching back to the report $\\succ_{c}$ changes $c$ 's match. So we have that $x \\succsim \\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)$. If $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=j$, then we must have that $j T_{c}^{J} x$. However, by the WPP, we have that $x T_{c}^{J} j$, a contradiction. This implies that $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c) \\in\\{x, y\\}$.\n\nSuppose that $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=x$. By group-robustness, it must be that some $c^{\\prime} \\neq$ $c$ has $\\phi\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} \\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right]\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$. However, again, this violates IIA because switching back to $\\succ_{c}$ changes the match for $c^{\\prime}$ when $c$ moves to the unmatched home $y$. Therefore, $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}\\right)\\right](c)=y$.\n\nNext, we follow the same proof strategy as in Claim 2. Consider the following series of preferences and evaluations for $c$ :\n(1) Preferences are $(1,2, \\ldots, n, x, i)$ where $x$ is preferred to any $i>n$ for arbitrarily positioned $i$. Evaluations are $(1,2, \\ldots, n, y, x, i)$. By the same logic as above, the match must still be $y$.\n(2) Preferences are $(1,2, \\ldots, n, x, i)$ and evaluations are $(1,2, \\ldots, n, y, i)$. We can argue as above that the match cannot be any $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$. The match must by $y$ or some $i$. By IIA, it cannot be any $i$ since the match is $y$ in case (1) and evaluations in this case scramble homes ranked lower than $y$. Therefore, the match is still $y$.\n(3) Preferences are some arbitrary $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and evaluations are $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} \\equiv(1,2, \\ldots, n, y, i)$. Suppose that the match is not $y$. First, note that even if $T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\succ_{c}$, we cannot have that $c$ 's match is some $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$ because then, by IIA, $c$ 's match must also be $n^{\\prime}$ under $T_{c}$. Strategyproofness implies that no report can improve $c$ 's match beyond truthful reporting, so the match is not any such $n^{\\prime}$. If the match is not $y$ then it is some $j>n$ (potentially including $x)$. Furthermore, by efficiency we had that that $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{J},>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\right](j)=\\varnothing$, and we must have that the first $n$ homes are still matched. Therefore, $\\phi\\left[M, \\tau\\left(\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime},>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)\\right](y)=\\varnothing$. By IIA, all other $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$ have the same match. Suppose that $c$ 's true preferences were $\\succ_{c}^{j}$, then $c$ would have an incentive to misreport $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and would not harm any other children, violating group robustness. Therefore, we must have that the match is still $y$.\n(4) Preferences are some arbitrary $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and evaluations are $\\left(n^{\\prime}, y, i\\right)$ for some arbitrary re-positioning of the first $n$ elements. Suppose that the match is not $y$. By the same argument as in (3), it cannot be any $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$. Additionally, by the same argument as in (3), if it is some $j>n$ for $j \\neq y$, then $c$ has an incentive to misreport $(1,2, \\ldots, n, y, i)$. Therefore, the match must still be $y$. Hence, for any arbitrary $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ and any $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where $y$ is ranked above any $i>n$, we have that $y T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} i$.\n\nClaim 4 implies that $\\tau$ is dictatorial if $\\phi(c)=y$. To see this, observe that it must hold for the evaluation $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}=>_{c}$ above and any preferences:\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}: 1,2, \\ldots, x, n^{\\prime}, \\ldots, n, y\n$$\n\nwhere $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$. By the induction statement, for $|C|=n+1$, at least the first $n$ homes in the ranking $\\tau$ are determined by a serial choice rule. $y$ cannot be chosen since it is not in the first $n$ rankings under either ranking. However, we still have that $y T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} x$, implying that $x$ also cannot be chosen. Since this holds for an arbitrary $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$, the child can never be the dictator. Furthermore, since the order of dictators is fixed under a SCR, she can never be the dictator for any preferences.\n\nClaim 5: Given that $\\phi(c)=x$, for any preference $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ where $x$ is ranked before $y, j$ and any arbitrary evaluation $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}, x T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} y$ and $1 T_{c}^{\\prime \\prime} j$. The argument proceeds as in Claim\n\n4 symmetrically. We also have that if $\\phi(c)=x$, then the matchmaker can never be the dictator.\n\nFix the first $n$ homes as we initially did for preferences and evaluations. We can apply these arguments to any pair of homes $i, k>n$, and, by Claim 4 , either $\\phi(c)=i$ or $\\phi(c)=k$. This will partition all such homes into sets $H_{4}$ (homes such that Claim 4 will apply) and $H_{5}$ (homes such that Claim 5 will apply). Suppose that $\\left|H_{4}\\right|>0$ and $\\left|H_{5}\\right|>0$. For any generic elements $i \\in H_{4}$ and $k \\in H_{5}$, we can define:\n\n$$\n\\succ_{c}^{4}: 1,2, \\ldots, n, i, k, j\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n>_{c}^{5}: 1,2, \\ldots, n, k, i, j\n$$\n\nBy each claim, we must have that $\\phi(c)=i$ and $\\phi(c)=j$, which is impossible. Therefore, either $\\left|H_{4}\\right|>0$ or $\\left|H_{5}\\right|>0$ but not both.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose that $H_{5}=H$. Since $|H| \\geq n+3$, we can take some $i, k \\in H_{5}$ where $i$ is ranked in position $n+1$ in $c$ 's preferences $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$ so that Claim 5 applies for any arbitrary $>_{c}^{\\prime \\prime}$. This will imply that $i T_{c} m$ for any $m \\neq i, k$ such that $m>n$. However, if we take some $i, j \\in H_{5}$, then we also get that $i T_{c} m^{\\prime}$ for any $m^{\\prime} \\neq i, j$ and $m^{\\prime}>n$. So $i T_{c} k$ and $i T_{c} j$. Therefore, $i T_{c} j^{\\prime}$ for any $j^{\\prime} \\neq i$ and $j^{\\prime}>n$. The first $n$ homes in $\\tau$ are chosen dictatorially, so $i$ must be ranked exactly in position $n+1$ as desired.\n$\\tau$ is a function that only depends on preferences and evaluations, so, even when varying the problem, $\\tau$ must be the same. Furthermore, the initial choice of the first $n$ homes was arbitrary, so we can repeat this entire argument for any permutation of preferences to show that $\\tau$ is always dictatorial. Finally, one can insert any number of additional dummy children or homes as described above to meet the statement for any $n^{\\prime \\prime}>n+1$. This proves the induction statement.\n\nThe other direction is immediate. If either side is the dictator, then a $\\tau$-efficient and strategy-proof mechanism is $\\succ$ or $>$-efficient. Therefore, there cannot be any groupbeneficial manipulations for the dictatorial side. Furthermore, the non-dictatorial side cannot manipulate $\\phi$ because its reports are irrelevant.\n\nThis proves the Theorem.\nTheorem 3 extends GS to our setting with two relatively innocuous assumptions: WPP and IIA. The WPP is necessary to assess aggregation rules that are sensible. One example of a rule that does not follow the WPP but ensures group robustness is a rule that makes all homes indifferent for any preferences and evaluations. In our proof, IIA essentially requires the mechanism to have behave normally when decision-irrelevant preferences change or when a child is reallocated between homes that no other child prefers to her own match (i.e., an unmatched home in an efficient matching). Unfortunately, we cannot argue that the mechanism will remain consistent when a child's preferences change without this assumption, though it may be possible to prove the Theorem using a less restrictive version of the condition.\n\nThe intuition for the first set of claims that prove that $\\tau$ is a serial choice rule, is, frankly, rather opaque. The main thrust of the argument relies on using similar proofs for GS to show that in a single-agent environment, the matching is a social outcome, and, therefore, an efficient and IIA mechanism will be dictatorial in the sense that either the child or the matchmaker will choose the matching. Even with this proven, extending the same idea to multi-agent markets is not easy because we must show that the SCR is dictatorial for multiple choices. We do this by finding a multi-agent problem where\n\nat least one agent faces the single-agent problem. We use induction to assume that the aggregation rule must be a SCR. Next, we can show that the same proof for the singleagent problem implies that the SCR maintains its dictatorial structure and that it can be extended to $n+1$.\n\nThis result is sweeping and implies that unanimity's susceptibility to strategic incentives is not unique. The Theorem would apply if we strengthened group-robustness to an individual strategy-proofness because a group-beneficial manipulation is, of course, individually beneficial. We assumed that the matchmaker would not manipulate in Section 3.3, but the Theorem suggests that, in that case, avoiding manipulations by children could entail dictating according to their preferences. This point is not definitive, but we conjecture it to be true. Moreover, the Theorem guarantees that that any appealing (WPP) method to aggregate preferences in one-sided matching will fall prey to manipulations. Moreover, we are able to show that our framework offers powerful and tractable theoretical analysis. Theorem 3 prohibits any useful aggregation from providing group robustness. Nevertheless, as it is in classical social choice theory, different rules may have varying degrees of manipulability and other positive properties. We close out this section with a survey of potential aggregation rules.\n\nExample 4. All of the following rules satisfy the WPP.",

It could be objected unanimity is does not satisfy WPP because non-unanimous homes are not strictly ranked when there is a unanimous improvement. Additionally, the aggregation is not strict. Therefore, it fails the standards we imposed in Theorem 3. This is true. Yet, our refinements address this. Let $\\tau^{u}$ be the extended unanimity rule where if $h \\in H^{*}(c)$ and $h^{\\prime} \\notin H^{*}(c)$, then $h T_{c}^{u} h^{\\prime}$.

We run simulations for a small market case with five to ten children, noting that in additional simulations we perform in larger markets, the effect magnitudes become larger in the same directions. The small market case is representative of a typical foster care matching market in small to medium sized counties ${ }^{8}$. The number of homes in a market is uniformly randomly distributed according to the same values ${ }^{9}$.\n\nOur simulations assume that caseworkers and the matchmaker have utility representations for each home $\\left(u_{c}(h)\\right.$ and $\\left.v_{c}(h)\\right)$, respectively) that give rise to orderings over homes. Further, we assume that the two parties will be generally aligned in pursuing some underlying social welfare $w_{c, h}$ that depends on the child-home match.\n\nWe simulate preferences and outcomes under eight different specifications. The first specification branch is accurate versus noisy evaluations. Concretely, we assume that $w_{c, h}$ is a uniformly distributed random variable with support on $[0,1]$, i.e, it is the true probability of persistence for a child of type $c$ matched to a home of type $h$. The evaluation utility $v_{c}(h)=w_{c, h}+\\alpha \\epsilon_{c, h}$ where $\\epsilon_{c, h}$ is also a uniformly distributed random variable with support on $[0,1]$.

We do not pursue analysis where caseworker preferences are more accurate than evaluations; the result, which is a mirror of our main result in this section, is that unanimous mechanisms decrease welfare if the decision-makers (caseworkers) using Serial Dictatorship are more accurate than the evaluations (algorithms) that bound the decision-makers. Instead, we will say that the caseworker preferences assist the algorithm when it is incorrect. This specification assumes the following:\n\n$$\nu_{c}(h)= \\begin{cases}\\epsilon_{c, h}^{\\prime} & \\text { if (a) } w_{c, h} \\geq 0.5 \\text { and } v_{c}(h) \\geq 0.5 \\text { or (b) } w_{c, h}<0.5 \\text { and } v_{c}(h)<0.5 \\\\ w_{c, h} & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe caseworker is exactly correct when the algorithm's predicted persistence would be a false negative or a false positive, otherwise, her preference is pure noise. We use this modeling to understand the impact of human decision-makers when they have limited complementary with the algorithm, i.e., they can \"correct\" it when it is severely mistaken.\n\nOur last specification is vertical differentiation of homes. In this specification, there is a uniformly randomly distributed vertical quality for each home $q_{h}$ such that the utility for each caseworker is $u_{c}(h)=q_{h}+\\epsilon_{c, h}^{\\prime}$. This allows us to capture scenarios where the caseworkers agree on the quality dimension for homes but have some taste heterogeneity. Vertical differentiation is an interesting challenge for unanimous mechanisms because it can create significant overlap in the set of unanimous homes, thereby preventing the mechanisms from achieving widespread unanimous matches.\n\nIn every specification, we run one-thousand simulations and compare the status quo, Serial Dictatorship, with SDI, UTTC, and LE.

      "text": "# Results \n\nIn the baseline case, all of our theoretical predictions hold. First, Serial Dictatorship achieves a poor rate of average persistence at just $50 \\%$, which is to be expected as caseworker's preferences are essentially a coin toss. Every unanimous mechanism improves when the algorithm is an accurate predictor. Somewhat surprisingly, even though SDI is not tuned for efficient matching, it still drastically improves average persistence by 18.8 pp. We see that SDI and UTTC match an equivalent proportion of children to unanimous homes. Since we assume complete preferences and evaluations, the overall number of children matched is the same in every mechanism. These results suggest that unanimity alone results in higher welfare even without $>$-efficient improvement. UTTC is the next-best in average persistence with a marginal improvement of 5.9 pp over SDI. Finally, LE achieves the best with another marginal 3.7 pp improvement for a total of 28.4 pp over SD. However, it is significantly less unanimous than SDI and UTTC owing to its weak unanimity. Still, it outperforms SD in this aspect.\n\nNoise and Assistance-Despite concerns one might have about prediction error hampering our results, the unanimous mechanism's improvements are robust over all of our specifications, although the effect sizes are attenuated. When caseworkers are not complementary to the algorithm, we see that LE's welfare increase over SD is just 14.6 pp with $\\alpha=0.75$. However, considering the severity of the error - the noise term is up to seventy-five percent at maximum - this is excellent news for our mechanisms. They remain significantly superior to the status-quo even when a very, very poor algorithm is utilized as long as its predictions are centralized near the truth. In relative terms, SDI experiences the smallest decrease from its baseline performance. SDI's drop from baseline to $\\alpha=0.75$ is 9.1 pp .\n\nUnder assistance, the same general patterns hold. The first main difference is that SD's performance gains under higher error. This effect is mechanical because of our assumption that caseworkers are accurate when the mechanism is not. The mechanism makes more false positive and false negative predictions under higher error, so caseworkers are more accurate more frequently. The second main difference is that the complementarity attenuates the loss in performance under higher error specifications. For instance, SDI's performance drops by 5.4 pp less from baseline to $\\alpha=0.75$ when assisted, and all mechanism's average persistence are strictly greater under assistance versus no assistance. This implies that unanimous mechanisms are effective in combining the information aggregated in preferences and evaluations.\n\nVertical Differentiation-Interestingly, we find that unanimous matching mechanisms\n\nperform even better when the caseworkers' preferences are correlated. The largest gain is when using SDI as its average persistence increases by 4.7 pp . We hypothesize that this result owes to the fact that, when caseworker preferences are noisy, simply correlating them will cause the noise to negatively impact persistence over a large number of simulations. In contrast, when we draw preferences randomly for each caseworker, poor draws have a smaller probability of negatively impacting average persistence.\n\nTable 3: Persistence, Vertical Differentiation\n\n![table_8](table_8)",

      "text": "# 5 Conclusion \n\nBefore concluding, we highlight a number of salient future directions for our simulations. As mentioned in the Introduction, our tentative plan involves running a lab-in-the-field experiment with real caseworkers to evaluate their preferences and decision-making in a simulated market where children's predicted persistence is determined through a random forest predictor that we train on a national dataset with several million observations. It achieves an $83 \\%$ out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Combining these elements, we can estimate counterfactual matchings and persistence in the simulated market to provide plausible indications on the welfare improvements from using unanimous matching mechanisms in the child welfare context. Furthermore, we can use surveyed information about participants to assess how experience affects within-caseworker average persistence.\n\nHighsmith (2024) argues that child welfare systems have lacked the toolkit necessary to create organized and effective centralized assignments. Our work in this paper establishes matching mechanisms that are appropriate for foster care while also improving placements beyond the status quo (Serial Dictatorship) as measured by reducing the number of placements that a child experiences while in foster care. In our preliminary simulations, placement stability-or persistence - can increase by up to 28.3 pp in small markets with five to ten children matched every day when the algorithm is accurate and at worst 6.5 pp when the algorithm is poor in cases when the caseworkers are accurate. We note that in our work on the experiment so far, we find that when assessing persistence with our random forest predictor and simulating caseworker preferences by assuming that they racially match, we find that average persistence increases by 11.2 pp . We use a new property, unanimity, to characterize mechanisms that fairly assign children to homes where caseworkers and the algorithm do not concur that there is a better home for the child. Our baseline mechanism, SDI, constructs unanimous matchings and improves average persistence. Further mechanisms-UTTC and LE-succeed in improving average persistence even more through theoretically proven efficiency properties.\n\nNevertheless, no mechanisms in this setting are meaningfully strategy-proof in any way unless the number of homes is less than or equal to the number of children. Generally,\n\nthis is true in foster care. We generalize our model to allow any preference aggregation rule to check the commonality of strategy-proofness for rules other than unanimity. We find that no mechanism and aggregation rule satisfy a weakened version of strategy-proofness-group robustness-that only allows manipulations that improve all children. This demonstrates that unanimity is not unique in its failure to mitigate strategic incentives. We highlight that further research could expand on our generalized model and explore whether or not other aggregation rules feature any other positive, useful properties.\n\nAs a final note, while our application focuses on child welfare, our framework can be applied to many other one-sided matching markets where there are multiple preference orderings for one side of the market ${ }^{10}$. It is actually trivial to extend unanimity to any number of orderings, but generalizing matching with preference aggregation is a more difficult task. Examining other applications is another area with great potential for future research.",

A matching $\\mu$ is unanimous on $L$ if and only if it is efficient on $L^{\\prime}=$ $\\left(M,>_{I},>\\right)$.\n\nProof. We first prove $(\\Longrightarrow)$, that is, if $\\mu$ is unanimous on $L$ then it is efficient on $L^{\\prime}$. Suppose, for a contradiction, that this is not true. This would imply that $\\mu$ is unanimous on $L$, but $\\mu$ is not efficient on $L^{\\prime}$. If $\\mu$ is not efficient on $L^{\\prime}$, then there exists some sequence $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ such that for all $i \\neq n$, (i) $\\mu\\left(c_{i+1}\\right) \\geq_{I\\left(c_{i}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{i}\\right)$, (ii) either $\\mu\\left(c_{1}\\right) \\geq_{I\\left(c_{n}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{n}\\right)$ or $h \\geq_{I\\left(c_{n}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{n}\\right)$ for some $h$ with $\\mu(h)=\\varnothing$, and (iii) this must hold strictly for at least one $i$. Consider the matching $\\mu^{\\prime}$ such that the (possibly cyclic) trades implied by the sequence above occur. For any $c$ such that $\\mu(c)=\\mu^{\\prime}(c)$, we have that $c \\in I^{*}(\\mu) \\Longleftrightarrow c \\in I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $c \\in \\kappa(\\mu) \\Longleftrightarrow c \\in \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$. For any $c^{\\prime}$ such that $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$, we have that $\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq_{I\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$, so:\n\n$$\nc^{\\prime} \\in I^{*}(\\mu) \\Longrightarrow \\mu\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\Longrightarrow \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\Longrightarrow c^{\\prime} \\in I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nthe following also holds:\n\n$$\nc^{\\prime} \\in \\kappa(\\mu) \\Longrightarrow \\mu\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing \\Longrightarrow \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing \\Longrightarrow c^{\\prime} \\in \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor at least one $c^{\\prime \\prime}: \\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)>_{I\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. We have that either $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\notin I^{*}(\\mu)$ or $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=\\varnothing$. We also have that if $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\notin I^{*}(\\mu)$, then $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\in I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$. If $\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=\\varnothing$, then $\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing$. These facts imply that either $I^{*}(\\mu) \\subset I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ or $\\kappa(\\mu) \\subset \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$, i.e., $\\mu$ is not unanimous, a contradiction.\n\nNext, we prove $(\\Longleftarrow)$, that is, if $\\mu$ is efficient on $L^{\\prime}$ then it is unanimous on $L$. Again, suppose, for a contradiction, that $\\mu$ is efficient on $L^{\\prime}$ but that it is not unanimous on $L$. Since $\\mu$ is not unanimous, there exists some $\\mu^{\\prime}$ such that either (a) $I^{*}(\\mu) \\subset I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\kappa(\\mu) \\subseteq \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ or (b) $I^{*}(\\mu) \\subseteq I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\kappa(\\mu) \\subset \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$. Without loss of generality, we denote the set $S$ and $S^{\\prime}$ as $I^{*}(\\mu)$ and $I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ if (a) holds, alternatively, $\\kappa(\\mu)$ and $\\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ if (b) holds. First, note that if $\\mu^{\\prime}(c)=h$ for some $c \\in S^{\\prime}$ such that $c \\notin S$ and $h$ with $\\mu(h)=\\varnothing$, then we can construct a third matching $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}$ where $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}(c)=h$ and $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}=\\mu$ otherwise. The above relations give us that $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}(c)>_{I(c)} \\mu(c)$ and $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)=\\mu\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ for all $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$, so $\\mu^{\\prime \\prime}$ Pareto dominates $\\mu$ on $L^{\\prime}$, contradicting efficiency. Therefore, for any $c$ satisfying the stated conditions, it must be that $\\mu^{\\prime}(c)=h$ for some $h$ such that $\\mu(h) \\neq \\varnothing$. We can construct a sequence $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ such that $c_{1}=c$ and $c_{i}=\\mu\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c_{i-1}\\right)\\right)$ for $i \\neq 1$. By unanimity of $\\mu^{\\prime}, \\mu\\left(c_{i}\\right)=\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c_{i-1}\\right) \\geq_{I\\left(c_{i-1}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{i-1}\\right)$ for $i \\neq 1$ and $\\mu\\left(c_{2}\\right)=\\mu^{\\prime}\\left(c_{1}\\right)>_{I\\left(c_{1}\\right)} \\mu\\left(c_{1}\\right)$. Yet, if $\\mu$ is efficient on $L^{\\prime}$, then no such sequence described can be constructed, a contradiction. This proves the Proposition.\n\nProposition 4. Unanimous Top Trading Cycles is constrained-efficient and unanimous.\nProof. Unanimity follows because for any $c \\in I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{1}\\right), c$ can only participate in a cycle or chain such that $c$ would be matched to some $h \\in H^{*}(c)$. A similar conclusion holds for every $c \\in \\kappa\\left(\\mu^{1}\\right)$. Unanimity of $\\mu^{1}$ directly implies unanimity for $\\phi_{U T T C}$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that UTTC is constrained-efficient. Suppose, for a contradiction, that it is not. There must exist some $\\mu^{\\prime}$ such that $\\phi_{U T T C} \\triangleright_{P D} \\mu^{\\prime}$. Since $\\phi_{U T T C}$ is unanimous, $\\mu^{\\prime}$ cannot (a) weakly expands the set of unanimous children and matched children and (b) strictly so for one of the two sets. Therefore, $I^{*}\\left(\\phi_{U T T C}\\right)=I^{*}\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\kappa\\left(\\phi_{U T T C}\\right)=\\kappa\\left(\\mu^{\\prime}\\right) . \\phi_{U T T C} \\triangleright_{P D} \\mu^{\\prime}$ implies that we can identify some Pareto improving cycle or chain $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ such that every $c_{j}$ in the cycle satisfying $c_{j} \\in I^{*}\\left(\\phi_{U T T C}\\right)$ is reallocated to a unanimous home.\n\nConsider the earliest child $c_{i}$ in the cycle to be removed from the UTTC algorithm. If $c_{i} \\in I^{*}\\left(\\phi_{U T T C}\\right)$, then $\\phi_{U T T C}\\left(c_{i+1}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c_{i}\\right)$. Since $c_{i}$ was removed, this implies that $c_{i}$ was not pointing at $c_{i+1}$. Further, because $\\phi_{U T T C}\\left(c_{i+1}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c_{i}\\right)$ we know that it must be the case that $c_{i+1}$ was removed in an earlier round. This contradicts our assumption that $c_{i}$ was the earliest to be removed. If $c_{i} \\notin I^{*}\\left(\\phi_{U T T C}\\right)$, the same contradiction is immediate because $c_{i}$ 's pointing is only restricted to unanimously acceptable homes. Therefore, no such cycle or chain can exist, and $\\phi_{U T T C}$ cannot be Pareto dominated by a matching that weakly expands the set of unanimous and matched children. This proves the Proposition.\n\nTheorem 1. The following statements are true:\ni. Linear Exchange is incontestable.\nii. Linear Exchange is weakly unanimous.\n\niii. Any weakly unanimous matching that Pareto dominates Linear Exchange is unanimously dominated by Linear Exchange.\n\nProof. We will say that $c$ u-prefers $h$ over $h^{\\prime}$ if $h>_{I(c)} h^{\\prime}$ and $c$ prefers $h$ over $h^{\\prime}$ if $h \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}$. First, we show that the algorithm produces a weakly unanimous matching. Suppose, for a contradiction, that $\\phi_{L E}$ is not weakly unanimous. Note first that if $h \\notin H^{k}$ for some round $k$, then $h \\notin H^{k^{\\prime}}$ for any $k^{\\prime}>k$ as if a child is unmatched from a home, another child is matched to that home. Suppose that $h>_{I(c)} \\phi_{L E}(c)$ for some $h$ with $\\phi_{L E}(h)=\\varnothing$. Let $i$ be the round when $c$ exits the exchange. If $h \\in H^{*}(c)$, then it cannot be that $c$ exited the exchange in this round. Hence, $h \\in H^{-}(c)$ and $\\phi_{L E}(c)=\\varnothing$. However, this implies that $h$ was a tradable home for $c$. Hence, there exists some $c^{\\prime} \\notin C^{i}$ such that $h>_{I\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)} \\phi_{L E}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$. Similarly, at round $i^{\\prime}$ when $c^{\\prime}$ left the exchange, $c^{\\prime}$ only leaves if $h \\notin H^{*}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$. Hence, $h \\in H^{-}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)=\\varnothing$. We can consider the first $c^{\\prime \\prime}$ that exits the exchange and u-prefers an unmatched home. As we showed above, there must be another child that exited the exchange earlier with no match and u-prefers the same unmatched home. This is a contradiction, therefore, no $c$ u-prefers an unmatched home over $\\phi_{L E}(c)$.\n\nThis implies that $\\phi_{L E}$ must contain a SU-cycle. Let $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ be this SU-cycle. Note that since all children u-prefer the following child's home, it must be that $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\in$ $H^{-}\\left(c_{j}\\right)$ for all $c_{j}$ in the cycle. Hence, any child in the cycle must exit the exchange in some round. Consider the last $c$ in the cycle that exits the exchange in some round i. $\\mu^{i+1}(c)=\\phi_{L E}(c)$ only if no cycle would form as a result. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $\\phi_{L E}$ cannot contain a SU-cycle.\n\nNext, we prove, by strong induction, that $\\phi_{L E}$ is not Pareto dominated by any other weakly unanimous matching $w$ that $\\phi_{L E}$ does not unanimously dominate. Denote $c^{n}$ as the $c$ choosing in round $n$. Our induction statement is this: in any round $n$, for any $c, h$ such that:\n\n1. $c \\notin C^{n}$,\n2. $h$ is unanimously acceptable to $c$, and\n3. $h \\succ_{c} \\mu^{n}(c)$\nthen, for any weakly unanimous matching $w$ with $w(c)=h$, we have $\\mu^{n}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ for some $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$.\n\nBase case: $n=1$. The statement trivially holds since $C^{1}=C$.\nInduction step: We assume that the statement holds for all rounds $k \\leq n$ and prove that it holds for round $n+1$. Note that if $c^{n} \\in C^{n+1}$, the statement trivially holds, so we consider only rounds when $c^{n} \\notin C^{n+1}$ and prove the statement by cases. Denote $\\mathbf{h}$ as $c^{n}$ 's most preferred home in $H^{n}$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{n}\\right)=\\mathbf{h}$. Since $\\mu^{n+1}(c)=\\mu^{n}(c)$ for all $c \\notin C^{n}$, if (1)-(3) hold for $c$ in round $n$, then the statement must hold for $c$ in round $n+1$. We show it holds also for $c^{n}$. Clearly, (1) holds for $c^{n}$ in round $n+1$. Suppose (2)-(3) also hold for some $h^{\\prime}$. We have:\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime} \\notin H^{n}\n$$\n\nOtherwise:\n\n$$\nh^{\\prime} \\succ_{c^{n}} \\mathbf{h}\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction. Denote $c^{\\prime} \\equiv \\mu^{n+1}\\left(h^{\\prime}\\right)$. In any weakly unanimous matching $w$ with $w\\left(c^{n}\\right)=h^{\\prime}, w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq h^{\\prime}$. If $h^{\\prime} \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$, then we are done. Otherwise, since $w$\n\nis weakly unanimous, $w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ is acceptable to $c^{\\prime}$. If $w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} h^{\\prime}$, then, by the inductive assumption, there must exist another $c^{\\prime \\prime}$ such that $\\mu^{n}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=\\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime \\prime}} w\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{n}\\right) \\neq \\mathbf{h} \\Longrightarrow N T^{n}\\left(c^{n}\\right) \\neq H^{n}$. As we demonstrated above, $c^{n}$ cannot improve to any $h^{\\prime} \\notin H^{n}$. Hence, if the statement does not hold, (2)-(3) must be true for some $h \\in H^{n}-N T^{n}\\left(c^{n}\\right)$. However, in any weakly unanimous $w$ with $w\\left(c^{n}\\right)=h$, we must have that $w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\neq \\mu^{n}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$ for some $c^{\\prime} \\notin C^{n}$. Otherwise, there would be a SU-cycle on $w$. If $\\mu^{n}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)=\\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right)$, we are done. If $w\\left(c^{\\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime}} \\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, then, by the inductive assumption, there must exist another $c^{\\prime \\prime}$ such that $\\mu^{n}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=\\mu^{n+1}\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\succ_{c^{\\prime \\prime}} w\\left(c^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$.\n\nNote that if $\\phi_{L E}$ is Pareto dominated by any $w$, there must be a Pareto improving cycle $Y=\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{m}\\right)$ on $\\phi_{L E}$ where $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{j+1}\\right) \\succsim_{c} \\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{j}\\right)$ for all $j \\neq m$ and $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{1}\\right) \\succsim_{c_{m}}$ $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{m}\\right)$ with at least one strict relation. (There may also be a chain where $c_{m}$ 's Pareto improving home is vacant. This case is ruled out by ruling out cycles, so we do not write it explicitly.) By the induction above, any Pareto improving cycle $Y$ that maintains weak unanimity (and unanimous acceptability) cannot involve any $c$ such that $c \\notin C^{n}$ for any $n$. Any $c_{k} \\in Y$ must satisfy $c_{k} \\in C^{n}$ for all $n$, so $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{k}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c_{k}\\right)$. Let $w$ be the weakly unanimous matching implied by executing the trades on $Y$. Consider the $c_{j}$ that chooses in the earliest round $i$ such that all other children in the cycle choose after $c_{j}$. Since $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{j}\\right)$ is $c_{j}$ 's most preferred home in $H_{i}^{*}\\left(c_{j}\\right), w\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\succ_{c_{j}} \\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\Longrightarrow$ $w\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\notin H_{i}^{*}\\left(c_{j}\\right)$. Additionally, $w\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\in H^{i}$ since $Y$ only involves children remaining in the exchange. These facts imply that $w\\left(c_{j}\\right) \\in H^{-}\\left(c_{j}\\right)$. Because $\\phi_{L E}\\left(c_{k}\\right) \\in H^{*}\\left(c_{k}\\right)$ for all $c_{k} \\in Y, w$ is unanimously dominated by $\\phi_{L E}$. Therefore, any such $w$ that Pareto dominates $\\phi_{L E}$ must be unanimously dominated by $\\phi_{L E}$, and there cannot exist a weakly unanimous $w$ that Pareto dominates $\\phi_{L E}$ that is not unanimously dominated by $\\phi_{L E}$.\n\nFinally, suppose that $\\phi_{L E} \\triangleright_{P D} \\mu$ for any feasible $\\mu$. If $\\mu$ is unanimous, then it is weakly unanimous. However, if it is weakly unanimous and Pareto dominates $\\phi_{L E}$, then it is unanimously dominated, a contradiction. This proves the Theorem.\n\nTheorem 2. The following statements are true:\ni. Any unanimous matching mechanism is obviously manipulable.\nii. Serial Dictatorship with Indifference and Linear Exchange are non-obviously manipulable if $|H| \\leq|C|$.\n\nProof. We prove (i) that any unanimous matching mechanism is obviously manipulable using an example. Consider the following market with $C=\\{a, b\\}$ and $H=\\{1,2,3\\}$. The preferences, evaluations, and induced unanimity orders for $b$ are as follows, where omitted homes are not unanimously acceptable and brackets indicate indifference:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\succ_{b}: 1,2,4,3 \\\\\n\\succ_{b}: 3,1,2,4 \\\\\n>_{I(b)}:[1,3],[2,4]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nLet $\\phi$ be any unanimous matching mechanism. Every matching that is consistent with it must be unanimous. Under the truthful report for $b$, in any unanimous matching $\\mu$, either $\\mu(b)=1$ or $\\mu(b)=3$. This implies that the worst-case scenario in any unanimous matching is that $b$ is matched to 3 . Under the report $\\succ_{a}$ where $a$ reports only 1 as acceptable, $H^{*}(a)=\\{1\\}$. Therefore:\n\n$$\nC U^{-}\\left[\\succ_{b}\\right]=\\{(1,3)\\}\n$$\n\nThis implies that the worst-case under truth-telling is no better than $b$ matching to 3 . Consider a profile $\\succ_{b}^{\\prime}$ where $b$ reports the order $\\succ_{b}^{\\prime} ; 4,2,1$. Under this report, every home is unanimous except for 3 . Thus, in any unanimous matching $\\mu^{\\prime}$, either $\\mu^{\\prime}(b)=1$ or $\\mu^{\\prime}(b)=2$, or $\\mu^{\\prime}(b)=4$. The worst-case under $\\succ_{b}^{\\prime}$ must be better than 3 , so this manipulation is a worst-case manipulation.\n\nLast, we prove (ii) in a general environment for any child $c$. It is immediate that the best case for $c$ under truthful reporting is going first in the order and matching to her top choice which is always unanimous. Under LE, she leaves the exchange and is permanently matched. Under SDI, we can stipulate preferences for all other $c^{\\prime} \\neq c$ such that $c$ 's top choice is unacceptable. Therefore, $c$ will also be matched to her top choice under SDI in the best-case scenario.\n\nSuppose that $|H|<|C|$. The worst-case scenario under either mechanism, under any report, is that $c$ goes last and that every preceding child has a single top choice such that the set $H$ is covered by the children's top choices. In this case, $c$ is unmatched under either mechanism. If $|H|=|C|$, under any report, the same argument applies to show that $c$ is always matched to her least favorite home if $c$ 's report is such that all homes are unanimously acceptable and is unmatched if at least one home is not unanimously acceptable.\n\nProposition 6. The following statements are true:\ni. $\\tau^{u}$ is a strict total order,\nii. $\\tau^{u}$ is regular, and\niii. If $\\mu$ is constrained-efficient and unanimous, then $\\mu$ is efficient under $\\tau^{u}$.\n\nProof. First, we show that $\\tau^{u}$ is a strict total order, i.e., that it is an element of $P$. Let the binary relation of $\\tau^{u}$ be $T_{c}^{u}$. We omit $c$ and simply consider an arbitrary $c$ for this part.\n\nIrreflexive: If $T^{u}$ is not irreflexive, then there exists some $x \\in H$ such that $x T^{u} x$. Clearly, it cannot be that $x$ is strictly preferred to itself on preferences nor evaluations. Furthermore, it cannot be that $x \\in H^{*}$ and $h \\notin H^{*}$.\n\nTransitive: Suppose that for some $x, y, z$, we have that (i) $x T^{u} y$ and (ii) $y T^{u} z$. (i) implies that (a) $x$ is a unanimous improvement over $y$, (b) $x \\in H^{*}$ and $y \\notin H^{*}$, or (c) $x \\succ y$. In case (a) or (b), $y \\notin H^{*}$. Therefore, (ii) only if $y$ is a unanimous improvement over $z$. Hence, $z \\notin H^{*}(c)$. In case (a), $x$ must also be a unanimous improvement over $z$ so that $x T^{*} z$. In case (b), immediately $x T^{u} z$. In case (c), if $x \\in H^{-}$then $y \\in H^{-}$and (ii) only if $z \\in H^{-}$and $y \\succ z$, hence $x \\succ z$ by assumption that $\\succ \\in P$. If $x \\in H^{*}$ and $y \\in H^{*}$, then the same holds if $z \\in H^{*}$. If $z \\notin H^{*}$, then immediately $x T^{u} z$.\n\nAsymmetry: This follows by irreflexivity and transitivity.\nConnected: All homes are comparable by definition.\nSince only unanimously acceptable homes are acceptable under $\\tau^{u}$, it cannot be that any unanimously acceptable home is not acceptable or that any unanimously unacceptable home is acceptable. Furthermore, suppose that $x \\succ y$ and $x>y$ for any $x, y \\in H$. It cannot be that $y \\in H^{*}$. If $x \\in H^{*}$, then $x T^{u} y$. If $x \\notin H^{*}$, then still $x T^{u} y$ by definition and transitivity. These facts imply that the rule satisfies the WPP.\n\nLast, we prove that if $\\mu$ is constrained-efficient and unanimous, then $\\mu$ is efficient under $\\tau^{u}$. Suppose, for a contradiction, that $\\mu$ is constrained-efficient and unanimous, but $\\mu$ is not $\\tau^{u}$-efficient. There must exist some $\\tau^{u}$-improving cycle $\\left(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\right)$ such\n\nthat $\\mu\\left(c_{i+1}\\right) R_{v_{i}}^{u} \\mu\\left(c_{i}\\right)$ for all $i \\neq n$ and $\\mu\\left(c_{1}\\right) R_{v_{n}}^{u} \\mu\\left(c_{n}\\right)$ with at least one strict relation. However, this implies that any child that is assigned to a unanimous home is reassigned to another unanimous home that is a Pareto improvement. Any child that is assigned to a non-unanimous home is reassigned to another non-unanimous home that is a Pareto improvement. Otherwise, if a child at a non-unanimous home improves to a unanimous home, this contradicts $\\mu$ being unanimous. The reassignment will therefore have the same unanimous coalition and will Pareto dominate $\\mu$, which contradicts $\\mu$ being constrainedefficient.\n\nProposition A.1. Random Serial Assignment is strategy proof when ignoring feasibility constraints.\n\nProof. We prove this by counterexample. Denote the true preferences for $c$ as $\\succ_{c}$ (with corresponding problem $L$ ). Suppose that for some manipulation $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime}$ (with corresponding problem $\\left.L^{\\prime}\\right), \\phi_{R S A}\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right](c) \\succ_{c} \\phi_{R S A}[L](c)$. Then in some round $n$, under $L^{\\prime}$, RSA selects some $h^{\\prime}$ that $c$ prefers over the $h$ selected (or not selected) in the same round $n$ under $L$. However, if $h^{\\prime}$ is not selected under $L$, then $a\\left(h^{\\prime}\\right)=0$. Therefore, it could not be selected under $L^{\\prime}$. This proves the Proposition.\n\nProposition A.2. Truth-telling is the unique, non-trivial weakly dominant strategy under Random Serial Assignment when ignoring feasibility constraints.\n\nProof. In qualifying the proof with non-trivial, we make the assumption that every $c$ has at least one acceptable home. Under any manipulation $\\succ_{c}^{\\prime}, c$ either ranks some $h^{\\prime}$ higher than some $h$ such that $h \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}$ or $c$ reports some $h$ as unacceptable. In the latter case, it is clear that if $a(h)=1$ and $a\\left(h^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=0$ for all $h^{\\prime \\prime} \\neq h$, then this manipulation is strictly worse than truth-telling. In the former case, suppose that, (a) for every $h^{\\prime \\prime}$ such that $h^{\\prime \\prime} \\succ_{c} h, a\\left(h^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=0$, (b) $a\\left(h^{\\prime}\\right)=1$, and (c) $a(h)=1$, then under the manipulation $h \\succ_{c} \\phi_{R S A}\\left[L^{\\prime}\\right](c)$, but under truth-telling $\\phi_{R S A}[L](c)=h$. Since there is always some case where a misreport is strictly worse than truth-telling, truth-telling must be the only unique weakly dominant strategy under the non-triviality assumption.

Anecdotally, we are aware that caseworkers in some counties use race as a criteria to attempt to match a child to a culturally relevant home. LaBrenz et al. (2022) used an IPW regression model to estimate the effects of race-based matching. When the assumptions of the model hold, they show it has a positive impact on persistence. Concretely, we assume that given some market $m$, the foster home $h$ has a parent with the same race as the child $c$ and the foster home $h^{\\prime}$ does not, then $h \\succ_{c} h^{\\prime}$. Otherwise, $h \\sim h^{\\prime}$. We further assume that all homes are acceptable.\n\nTable B.1: Mechanism Performance under Race-Based Preferences\n\n![table_9](table_9)\n\nWe generate one-hundred small markets as in the experimental design assuming these preferences. Our initial finding is promising. All mechanisms substantially increase persistence: SDI by 11.6 pp relative to SD while UTTC and LE increase by 13.4 pp relative to SD.\n\nNext, we run robustness checks for the case where the algorithm has prediction error. We randomly perturb the persistence $Y_{c}(h)$. We flip a weighted coin that is one with probability 0.83 (the out-of-sample accuracy for our ML model) and zero otherwise. If the coin returns zero, then we set $Y_{c}(h)=1-\\hat{Y}_{c}(h)$. Otherwise, $Y_{c}(h)=\\hat{Y}_{c}(h)$. We reconduct the analysis above with these outcomes. The results are reported in Table B.2. We find that the positive welfare effects of our mechanisms are smaller in magnitude but still sizeable.\n\nTable B.2: Mechanism Performance under Race-Based Preferences, Robust\n\n![table_10](table_10)\n\nFinally, we use this sample to conduct our optimal sample size analysis. We run one hundred simulations where we randomly keep $N$ observations for Serial Dictatorship and the mechanism in comparison in the sample and re-calculate the treatment effect, noting the significance and magnitude of the coefficient. We run these simulations for $N \\in\\{25,50,75\\}$. Our simulations show that the coefficient sizes remain close, on average, to the same as in Table B.1. For $N=25,52 \\%, 57 \\%$, and $53 \\%$ of the coefficient estimates were significant for SDI, UTTC, and LE, respectively. This jumps to $82 \\%, 98 \\%$, and $95 \\%$ at $N=50$ and $100 \\%$ for all at $N=75$.",

  "abstract": "We study the problem of an organization that matches agents to objects where\nagents have preference rankings over objects and the organization uses\nalgorithms to construct a ranking over objects on behalf of each agent. Our new\nframework carries the interpretation that the organization and its agents may\nbe misaligned in pursuing some underlying matching goal. We design matching\nmechanisms that integrate agent decision-making and the algorithm by avoiding\nmatches that are unanimously disagreeable between the two parties. Our\nmechanisms also satisfy restricted efficiency properties. Subsequently, we\nprove that no unanimous mechanism is strategy-proof but that ours can be\nnon-obviously manipulable. We generalize our framework to allow for any\npreference aggregation rules and extend the famed Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem\nto our setting. We apply our framework to place foster children in foster homes\nto maximize welfare. Using a machine learning model that predicts child welfare\nin placements and a (planned) novel lab-in-the-field eliciting real\ncaseworkers' preferences, we empirically demonstrate that there are important\nmatch-specific welfare gains that our mechanisms extract that are not realized\nunder the status quo.",
