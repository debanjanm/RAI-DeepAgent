      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nWithin a semigroup, an identity element or a zero element is a particularly special element with useful properties for semigroup theory. One-sided identities and one-sided zeroes are included in this interest. While notably studied as elements themselves, the sets of one-sided identities or one-sided zeroes have also been studied. For example, when nonempty, the set of right zeroes of a semigroup is a two-sided ideal of that semigroup, and it is contained in every other two-sided ideal. Hence it is the kernel. See [7] for more work involving this kernel.\n\nWe extend the definition of a one-sided identity and a one-sided zero with respect to an entire set with a binary operation to subsets of a set with a binary operation. Given a set $S$ with a binary operation and a subset $A$ of $S$, lidentity $(A)$ is the set of all $b \\in S$ such that $b a=a$ for all $a \\in A$. There is a similar definition for $\\operatorname{ridentity}(A)$. Also given a set $S$ with a binary operation and a subset $A$ of $S, l z e r o(A)$ is the set of all $b \\in S$ such that $b a=b$ for all $a \\in A$. There is a similar definition for $r \\operatorname{zero}(A)$.\n\nWe then proceed to discuss several direct consequences of these definitions and establish parallels between identities and zeroes. There are well known results for these one-sided identity and zero sets of the entire groupoid or semigroup, but we also show analogues of these results for the one-sided identity and zero sets of single element sets containing idempotents, elements $e$ such that $e e=e$.\n\nAny one-sided identity or zero of a groupoid is an idempotent, and any idempotent of a groupoid is the identity or zero of a subgroupoid, namely the set containing that idempotent is trivially a subgroupoid containing the idempotent as its identity and its zero, but there are other examples as well.\n\nIt is known that every idempotent of a semigroup is the identity of a maximal subgroup, see [2], [17], [6]. We show that every idempotent of a semigroup corresponds to a maximal left [right] zero subsemigroup.\n\nThe structure of rectangular bands is well known. See [5]. We use the concepts of one-sided identity and zero sets to create statements equivalent to the known definitions of rectangular bands. Then we completely describe for each idempotent the set of all rectangular band subsemigroups containing that idempotent using subsets of maximal left and right zero subsemigroups.\n\nThe structure of right groups is also well known. See [2], [13], [3], [10], [8], [9], [1], [11], [12], [15], [4], [16], [14]. We use maximal subgroups and maximal left and right zero subsemigroups to show that every\n\nidempotent corresponds to a maximal right [left] subgroup.\nIn many theorems, there are both a statement and its dual, left and right, and in these cases, we prove the statement for one side, and the proof of the dual statement is nearly identical.",

If $A=\\{a\\}$, we may write lidentity $(a)$, ridentity $(a)$, lzero $(a)$, and $r z e r o(a)$.\n\nBased on these definitions, for any $a, b \\in S$,\n\n$$\nb \\in \\text { lidentity }(a) \\Longleftrightarrow a \\in \\operatorname{rzero}(b)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nb \\in \\text { ridentity }(a) \\Longleftrightarrow a \\in \\operatorname{lzero}(b)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for any $A, B \\subset S$,\n\n$$\nB \\subset \\text { lidentity }(A) \\Longleftrightarrow A \\subset \\operatorname{rzero}(B)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nB \\subset \\text { ridentity }(A) \\Longleftrightarrow A \\subset l z e r o(B)\n$$\n\nLet $S$ be a set with a binary operation. There are many properties of $S$ that can be reformulated using identity and zero sets. Recall $e \\in S$ is an idempotent if and only if $e e=e . S$ is a left [right] zero semigroup if and only if for any $a, b \\in S, a b=a[a b=b]$.\n\nLet $e, z \\in S$.\n$e$ is an idempotent if and only if $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(e)[e \\in \\operatorname{ridentity}(e), e \\in l z e r o(e), e \\in \\operatorname{rzero}(e)]$.\n$e$ is a left [right] identity of $S$ if and only if $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(S)[e \\in \\operatorname{ridentity}(S)]$.\n$e$ is a left [right] identity of $S$ if and only if $r z e r o(e)=S[l z e r o(e)=S]$.\n$z$ is a left [right] zero of $S$ if and only if $\\operatorname{ridentity}(z)=S[$ lidentity $(z)=S]$.\n$z$ is a left [right] zero of $S$ if and only if $z \\in l z e r o(S)[z \\in r z e r o(S)]$.\n$\\operatorname{lidentity}(S)=S[r z e r o(S)=S]$ if and only if $S$ is a right zero semigroup.\n$\\operatorname{ridentity}(S)=S[l z e r o(S)=S]$ if and only if $S$ is a left zero semigroup.\nTheorem 2.2.

For any $a \\in A, x \\in S$, and $b \\in l z e r o(A)$,\n\n$$\n(x b) a=x(b a)=x b\n$$\n\nIn semigroup theory, idempotents are particularly important elements. Every one-sided identity or zero is an idempotent. Therefore every subsemigroup containing a one-sided identity or zero contains an idempotent. For semigroup $S$, if $e \\in S$ is an idempotent, then the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ is a subsemigroup of $S$, which contains $e$ as an identity and zero. Thus the existence of such subsemigroups coincides with idempotents. In particular, for a semigroup $S$ with idempotent $e$, there exist maximum subsemigroups of $S$ containing $e$ as a one-sided identity or one-sided zero.\nTheorem 2.4. Let $S$ be a set with a binary operation. Let $e \\in S$.\n\n1. $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, $\\operatorname{lidentity}(e)$ is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as a right zero.\n2. $e \\in \\operatorname{ridentity}(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, $\\operatorname{ridentity}(e)$ is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as a left zero.\n3. $e \\in l z e r o(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, lzero(e) is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as a right identity and lzero $(e)=S e$.\n4. $e \\in r z e r o(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, rzero(e) is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as a left identity and $r z e r o(e)=e S$.\n\nProof. 1. $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(e)$ if and only if $e e=e$.\nIn this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, $\\operatorname{lidentity}(e)$ is a subsemigroup containing $e$ and all $a \\in S$ such that $a e=e$. Therefore $\\operatorname{lidentity}(e)$ is the maximum subsemigroup containing $e$ as a right zero.\n3. $e \\in l z e r o(e)$ if and only if $e e=e$.\n\nIn this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, lzero(e) is a subsemigroup containing $e$ and all $a \\in S$ such that $a e=a$. Therefore lzero(e) is the maximum subsemigroup containing $e$ as a right identity.\nFor any $a \\in l z e r o(e), a=a e \\in S e$. For any $x \\in S$,\n\n$$\n(x e) e=x(e e)=x e \\in l z e r o(e)\n$$\n\nThus lzero $(e)=S e$.\n\nFor a set $S$ with a binary operation, we review some basic concepts of one-sided identity and zero sets of $S$, and we produce analogues for one-sided identity and zero sets of idempotents.\nTheorem 2.5. Let $S$ be a set with a binary operation.\n\n1. $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(S) \\cap \\operatorname{ridentity}(S)$ if and only if $e$ is the unique identity in $S$. In this case, the intersection is $\\{e\\}$ and lzero $(e)=r z e r o(e)=S$.\n2. $z \\in l z e r o(S) \\cap r z e r o(S)$ if and only if $z$ is the unique zero in $S$. In this case, the intersection is $\\{z\\}$ and $\\operatorname{lidentity}(z)=\\operatorname{ridentity}(z)=S$.\n3. $\\operatorname{lidentity}(S) \\cap l z e r o(S) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $S$ is the trivial group.\n4. $\\operatorname{ridentity}(S) \\cap \\operatorname{rzero}(S) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $S$ is the trivial group.\n5. If $S$ is a semigroup, $\\operatorname{lidentity}(S) \\cap \\operatorname{rzero}(S) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $S$ is a right zero semigroup.\n6. If $S$ is a semigroup, $\\operatorname{ridentity}(S) \\cap l z e r o(S) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $S$ is a left zero semigroup.\n\nProof. 1. $e \\in S$ such that $e x=x=x e$ for any $x \\in S$ if and only if $e$ is an identity in $S$. If $e^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(S) \\cap \\operatorname{ridentity}(S)$, then $e=e e^{\\prime}=e^{\\prime}$.\n3. There exists $e \\in S$ such that $e x=x$ and $e x=e$ for any $x \\in S$ if and only if $e e=e \\in S$ and $x=e$ for any $x \\in S$.\n5. Given there exists $e \\in S$ such that $e x=x$ and $x e=e$ for any $x \\in S$, then for any $a, b \\in S$, $a b=a(e b)=(a e) b=e b=b$, and $S$ is a right zero semigroup. If $S$ is a right zero semigroup, then $\\operatorname{lidentity}(S) \\cap \\operatorname{rzero}(S)=S$.\n\nTheorem 2.6. Let $S$ be a set with a binary operation. Let $e \\in S$.\n\n1. $e \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(e) \\cap \\operatorname{ridentity}(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, the intersection is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as the zero.\n\n2. $e \\in l z e r o(e) \\cap r z e r o(e)$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, if $S$ is a semigroup, the intersection is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as the identity and equals eSe.\n3. lidentity $(e) \\cap l z e r o(e) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, the intersection equals $\\{e\\}$.\n4. ridentity $(e) \\cap$ rzero $(e) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, the intersection equals $\\{e\\}$.\n5. If $S$ is a semigroup, lidentity $(e) \\cap$ rzero $(e) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, the intersection is a right zero semigroup.\n6. If $S$ is a semigroup, ridentity $(e) \\cap l z e r o(e) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e$ is an idempotent. In this case, the intersection is a left zero semigroup.\n\nProof. 1. $e \\in$ lidentity $(e) \\cap$ ridentity $(e)$ if and only if $e e=e$.\nIf $S$ is a semigroup, the intersection is a subsemigroup containing $e$. For any $a$ in this intersection, $a e=e=e a$, and $e$ is its zero. For any $b \\in S$ such that $b e=e=e b, b \\in$ lidentity $(e) \\cap$ ridentity $(e)$. Therefore the intersection is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as its zero.\n2. $e \\in l z e r o(e) \\cap r z e r o(e)$ if and only if $e e=e$.\n\nIf $S$ is a semigroup, the intersection is a subsemigroup containing $e$. For any $a$ in this intersection, $a e=a=e a$, and $e$ is its identity. For any $b \\in S$ such that $b e=b=e b, b \\in l z e r o(e) \\cap r z e r o(e)$. Therefore the intersection is the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as its identity.\nFor any $a \\in l z e r o(e) \\cap r z e r o(e), a=a e=(e a) e \\in e S e$. For any $x \\in S, e(e x e)=(e e) x e=e x e$ and $(e x e) e=e x(e e)=e x e$. Thus $l z e r o(e) \\cap r z e r o(e)=e S e$.\n3. If $a \\in S$ such that $a e=e$ and $a e=a$, then $e=a$ and $e e=e$. Therefore $e$ is an idempotent.\n\nIf $e$ is an idempotent, then $e e=e$ and $e \\in$ lidentity $(e) \\cap l z e r o(e)$, so this intersection is nonempty. In this case, for any $a \\in S$ with $a e=e$ and $a e=a, a=e$ and the intersection is $\\{e\\}$.\n5. If $a \\in S$ such that $a e=e$ and $e a=a$, then $e a e=(e a) e=a e=e$ and $e a e=e(a e)=e e$. Therefore $e e=e$, and $e$ is an idempotent.\nIf $e$ is an idempotent, then $e e=e$ and $e \\in$ lidentity $(e) \\cap$ rzero $(e)$, so this intersection is nonempty. In this case, for any $a, b \\in$ lidentity $(e) \\cap$ rzero $(e)$,\n\n$$\na b=a(e b)=(a e) b=e b=b\n$$\n\nThus the intersection is a right zero semigroup.\n\nRecall a semigroup in which every element is an idempotent is sometimes referred to as an idempotent semigroup or band. In particular, a rectangular band is a semigroup $S$ in which $a b a=a$ for any $a, b \\in S$. Also a right group is a left cancellative and right simple semigroup. A left group is a right cancellative and left simple semigroup. For semigroup $S$, we refer to a right group [left group] subsemigroup of $S$ as a right [left] subgroup of $S$.\n\nIf a semigroup contains a subgroup, then it contains the subgroup's identity as an idempotent. If a semigroup contains a left zero [right zero, rectangular band] subsemigroup, then it contains an idempotent because these subsemigroups are bands. Also, if a semigroup contains a right [left] subgroup of $S$, then it contains an idempotent using the definition as a left [right] cancellative and right [left] simple semigroup. For semigroup $S$, If $e \\in S$ is an idempotent, then the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ is a subsemigroup of $S$, which is also a group, left zero semigroup, right zero semigroup, rectangular band, right subgroup, and left subgroup. Thus the existence of such subsemigroups coincides with idempotents.\n\nLet $S$ be a semigroup. For every idempotent $e \\in S$, there exists a maximum subgroup of $S$ containing $e$ : the subset of $e S e$, the maximum subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ as its identity, of units with respect to $e$. We let $H(e)$ be this maximum subgroup of $S$ containing idempotent $e$. Any subgroup of $S$ is a subgroup of the maximum subgroup containing its idempotent identity. For distinct idempotents $e$ and $f, H(e) \\cap H(f)=\\emptyset$. Let $E$ be the set of idempotents in $S,\\{H(e) \\mid e \\in E\\}$ is the set of all maximal subgroups of $S$. These are also the $\\mathcal{H}$-classes of $S$ containing idempotents.\n\nNow we use the notions of identity and zero sets of idempotents to identify maximal left zero and right zero subsemigroups, to identify all rectangular band subsemigroups and their decompositions in terms of identity and zero sets, and to identify maximal right subgroups and left subgroups.",

Hence for any idempotent $e$ of semigroup $S$, since $L Z(e)[R Z(e)]$ is the maximum left zero [right zero] subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$, all subsets of $L Z(e)[R Z(e)]$ containing $e$ account for all left zero [right zero] subsemigroups of $S$ containing $e$.\nCorollary 3.2.

Every left [right] zero subsemigroup is an idempotent semigroup or band containing only idempotent elements, and every idempotent in $S$ is contained in a maximal left [right] zero subsemigroup.

      "text": "# 4 Rectangular Band Subsemigroups \n\nA rectangular band is a semigroup $S$ in which $a b a=a$ for any $a, b \\in S$. There are several equivalent definitions, and the structure of a rectangular band as a product of a left zero and right zero subsemigroups is well known. We develop some equivalent definitions in the context of one-sided identity and zero sets, and we describe all rectangular band subsemigroups containing a particular idempotent, which reiterates this structure.\nTheorem 4.1. Let $S$ be a semigroup. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) $S$ is a rectangular band;\n(2) $S$ is a band and for any $a, b \\in S, a b=b$ if and only if $b a=a$.\n(3) $S$ is a band and for any $a, b \\in S, a b=a$ if and only if $b a=b$.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Longrightarrow$ (2): If $S$ is a rectangular band, then $S$ is a band. For any $a, b \\in S$ with $a b=b$, $a b a=(a b) a=b a$. Since $S$ is a rectangular band, $a b a=a$, and $b a=a$. Similarly, for any $a, b \\in S$ with $b a=a, b a b=(b a) b=a b$. Since $S$ is a rectangular band, $b a b=b$, and $a b=b$.\n(2) $\\Longrightarrow$ (1): $S$ is a band, and for any $a, b \\in S, a b=b$ if and only if $b a=a$. For any $a, b \\in S$, $a(a b)=(a a) b=a b$, which implies $(a b) a=a$. Therefore $S$ is a rectangular band.\n\nThe proofs for (1) $\\Longrightarrow$ (3) and (3) $\\Longrightarrow$ (1) are similar.\nConditions (2) and (3) can then be explicitly expressed in terms of identity and zero sets.\nCorollary 4.2. Let $S$ be a semigroup. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) $S$ is a rectangular band;\n(2) For any $a \\in S$, lidentity $(a)=r z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n(3) For any $a \\in S$, ridentity $(a)=l z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nProof. Given (2) from Theorem 4.1, $S$ is a band and for any $a, b \\in S, a b=b$ if and only if $b a=a$. Since $S$ is a band, $a a=a \\in \\operatorname{lidentity}(a), r z e r o(a)$, and $\\operatorname{lidentity}(a), r z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$. Since for any $b \\in S, a b=b$ if and only if $b a=a, r z e r o(a)=\\operatorname{lidentity}(a)$ by definition. Therefore (2) from Corollary 4.2 is implied.\n\nGiven (2) from Corollary 4.2, for any $a \\in S$, lidentity $(a)=r z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$. For any $a \\in S$, since lidentity $(a)=r z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$, lidentity $(a) \\cap r z e r o(a) \\neq \\emptyset$, and by Theorem 2.6, $a$ is an idempotent, so that $S$ is a band. Since lidentity $(a)=r z e r o(a)$ for any $a \\in S$, then for any $b \\in S, b a=a$ if and only if $a b=b$ by definition. Therefore (2) from Theorem 4.1 is implied.\n\nLemma 4.3. Let $S$ be a semigroup, let $e$ be an idempotent, and let $T \\subset S$. If $T=T_{L} T_{R}$ for some sets $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ such that $T_{L} \\subset L Z(e), T_{R} \\subset R Z(e)$, and $T_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}$, then $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ are unique.\n\nProof. Let $T=T_{L} T_{R}$ and $T=T_{L}^{\\prime} T_{R}^{\\prime}$ such that $T_{L}, T_{L}^{\\prime} \\subset L Z(e), T_{R}, T_{R}^{\\prime} \\subset R Z(e), T_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}$, and $T_{R}^{\\prime} T_{L}^{\\prime}=\\{e\\}$.\n\nSince $T_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}$ and $T_{R}^{\\prime} T_{L}^{\\prime}=\\{e\\}, T_{L}, T_{R}, T_{L}^{\\prime}, T_{R}^{\\prime}$ must all be nonempty. For any nonempty $A, B$ subsets of a left zero semigroup, $A B=A$, and for any nonempty $A, B$ subsets of a right zero semigroup, $A B=B$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_{L} T_{R} & =T_{L}^{\\prime} T_{R}^{\\prime} \\\\\nT_{L} T_{R} T_{R} & =T_{L}^{\\prime} T_{R}^{\\prime} T_{R} \\\\\nT_{L} T_{R} & =T_{L}^{\\prime} T_{R} \\\\\nT_{L} T_{R} T_{L} & =T_{L}^{\\prime} T_{R} T_{L} \\\\\nT_{L}\\{e\\} & =T_{L}^{\\prime}\\{e\\} \\\\\nT_{L} & =T_{L}^{\\prime}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nmultiply by $T_{R}$ on the right\n\n$$\nT_{R}, T_{R}^{\\prime} \\subset R Z(e)\n$$\n\nmultiply by $T_{L}$ on the right\n\n$$\nT_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}\n$$\n\n$T_{L}, T_{L}^{\\prime},\\{e\\} \\subset L Z(e)$.\n\nSimilarly, $T_{R}=T_{R}^{\\prime}$.\n\nTheorem 4.4. Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $e$ be an idempotent. $T$ is a rectangular band subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ if and only if $T=T_{L} T_{R}$ for some sets $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ such that $e \\in T_{L} \\subset L Z(e)$, $e \\in T_{R} \\subset R Z(e)$, and $T_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}$. In this case, $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ are unique.\n\nProof. If $T$ is a rectangular band subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$, then for any $x \\in T$,\n\n$$\nx=x e x=x(e e) x=(x e)(e x) \\in(T e)(e T)\n$$\n\nFor any $x, y \\in T$,\n\n$$\n(x e)(e y)=x e y \\in T\n$$\n\nbecause $T$ is a subsemigroup containing $x, e, y$. Therefore $T=(T e)(e T)$.\nBy Theorem 2.4, $T e \\subset S e=l z e r o(e)$ and $e T \\subset e S=r z e r o(e)$. For any $x \\in T, e(x e)=e x e=e$, so $T e \\subset$ ridentity $(e)$, and $T e \\subset L Z(e)$. For any $x \\in T,(e x) e=e x e=e$, so $e T \\subset$ lidentity $(e)$, and $e T \\subset R Z(e)$. For any $x, y \\in T,(e x)(y e)=e(x y) e=e$ because $T$ is a rectangular band subsemigroup with $x y \\in T$. Therefore $(e T)(T e)=\\{e\\}$.\n\nIf $T=T_{L} T_{R}$ for some sets $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$ such that $e \\in T_{L} \\subset L Z(e), e \\in T_{R} \\subset R Z(e)$, and $T_{R} T_{L}=\\{e\\}$, then $e e=e \\in T$.\n\nFor any $a, c \\in T_{L}$ and $b, d \\in T_{R}, a b, c d \\in T$, and\n\n$$\n(a b)(c d)=a(b c) d=a e d=(a e) d=a d \\in T\n$$\n\nThus $T$ is a subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$.\nFor any $a, c \\in T_{L}$ and $b, d \\in T_{R}, a b, c d \\in T$, and\n\n$$\n(a b)(c d)(a b)=a(b c)(d a) b=a(e e) b=a e b=a(e b)=a b\n$$\n\nTherefore $T$ is a rectangular band subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$.\n$T_{L}=T e$ and $T_{R}=e T$ are unique by the previous lemma.\nCorollary 4.5. Let $S$ be a rectangular band. For any $e \\in S, S=(S e)(e S)$ such that $S e$ is a maximal left zero subsemigroup of $S$ and $e S$ is a maximal right zero subsemigroup of $S$.\n\nProof. If $S$ is a rectangular band and $e \\in S$, then $e$ is an idempotent. By Theorem 3.1, $L Z(e)$ is the maximum left zero subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$ and $R Z(e)$ is the maximum right zero subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$.\n\nFor any $a \\in S,(a e) e=a(e e)=a e$ and $e(a e)=e$. Therefore $a e \\in L Z(e)$ and $S e \\subset L Z(e)$. For any $b \\in L Z(e), b=b e \\in S e$, so $L Z(e) \\subset S e$. Thus $L Z(e)=S e$.\n\nFor any $a \\in S, e(e a)=(e e) a=e a$ and $(e a) e=e$. Therefore $e a \\in R Z(e)$ and $e S \\subset R Z(e)$. For any $b \\in R Z(e), b=b e \\in e S$, so $R Z(e) \\subset e S$. Thus $R Z(e)=e S$.\n\nSince $S$ is a rectangular band, $(e S)(S e)=\\{e\\}$ and $S=(S e)(e S)$.",

      "text": "# 5 Right and Left Subgroups \n\nA right group is left cancellative and right simple semigroup. Let $S$ be a right group. For $a \\in S$, there exists $b \\in S$ such that $a b=a$ because $S$ is right simple. Then $a b b=a b$, which implies $b b=b$ because $S$ is left cancellative. Therefore $S$ contains the idempotent $b$. Similarly, a left group contains an idempotent.\n\nThe structure of a right group as a product of a subgroup and a right zero subsemigroup is well known. Dually the structure of a left group is a product of a left zero subsemigroup and a subgroup. We include a proof in the context of right [left] subgroups for completeness.\nLemma 5.1. Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $e \\in S$ be an idempotent. Then\n$H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$, for some subgroup $H^{\\prime}(e) \\subset H(e)$ and some $R Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset R Z(e)$ containing $e$, is a right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$, and\n$L Z^{\\prime}(e) H^{\\prime}(e)$, for some subgroup $H^{\\prime}(e) \\subset H(e)$ and some $L Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset L Z(e)$ containing $e$, is a left subgroup of $S$ containing $e$.\nSince $H^{\\prime}(e)$ is a subgroup of $H(e), H^{\\prime}(e)$ contains $e$ as its identity. Since $e \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset R Z(e), R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ is a right zero subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e$.\n\nProof. $e=e e \\in H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$.\nFor any $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $e_{1}, e_{2} \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e)$,\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{1} e_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{2} e_{2}\\right)=x_{1} e_{1}\\left(e x_{2}\\right) e_{2}=x_{1}\\left(e_{1} e\\right) x_{2} e_{2}=x_{1} e x_{2} e_{2}=x_{1} x_{2} e_{2} \\in H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)\n$$\n\nTherefore $H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ is a subsemigroup.\nFor any $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3} \\in H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3} \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e)$, if $\\left(x_{1} e_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{2} e_{2}\\right)=\\left(x_{1} e_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{3} e_{3}\\right)$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{1} x_{2} e_{2} & =x_{1} x_{3} e_{3} \\\\\nx_{1}^{-1} x_{2} e_{2} & =x_{1}^{-1} x_{1} x_{3} e_{3} \\\\\ne x_{2} e_{2} & =e x_{3} e_{3} \\\\\nx_{2} e_{2} & =x_{3} e_{3}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nx_{1}^{-1} \\in H^{\\prime}(e)\n$$\n\n$x_{1}^{-1} x_{1}=e$\n$e x=x$ for any $x \\in H^{\\prime}(e)$.\n\nTherefore $H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ is left cancellative.\nFor any $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $e_{1}, e_{2} \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e)$,\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{1} e_{1}\\right)\\left(x_{1}^{-1} x_{2} e_{2}\\right)=x_{1} x_{1}^{-1} x_{2} e_{2}=e x_{2} e_{2}=x_{2} e_{2}\n$$\n\nTherefore $H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ is right simple, and thus it is a right group.\nTheorem 5.2. Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $e \\in S$ be an idempotent. Then\n$R G(e)=H(e) R Z(e)$ is the maximum right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$, and\n$L G(e)=L Z(e) H(e)$ is the maximum left subgroup of $S$ containing $e$.\nNote that $R Z(e) H(e)=H(e)$ because for any $e_{1} \\in R Z(e)$ and $x \\in H(e)$,\n\n$$\ne_{1} x=e_{1}(e x)=\\left(e_{1} e\\right) x=e x=x\n$$\n\nSimilarly $H(e) L Z(e)=H(e)$.\nProof. By Lemma 5.1, $R G(e)$ is a right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$.\nLet $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ be a right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$, and let $x \\in R G^{\\prime}(e)$. For any $a \\in R G^{\\prime}(e)$, ee $=e$ implies $e e a=e a$, which implies $e a=a$ because $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is left cancellative.\n\nSince $x, e \\in R G^{\\prime}(e), x e \\in R G^{\\prime}(e)$, and there exists $e^{\\prime} \\in R G^{\\prime}(e)$ such that $(x e) e^{\\prime}=x$ because $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is right simple. Then we get the following implications.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx\\left(e e^{\\prime}\\right) & =x \\\\\nx\\left(e e^{\\prime}\\right) e & =x e \\\\\n(e e^{\\prime}) e & =e \\\\\ne e^{\\prime} e & =e \\\\\ne^{\\prime} e & =e\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nx\\left(e e^{\\prime}\\right) e=xe\n$$\n\nbecause $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is left cancellative\nbecause $e e=e$\nbecause $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is left cancellative.\n\nSince $e a=a$ for any $a \\in R G^{\\prime}(e), e e^{\\prime}=e^{\\prime}$. Therefore $e^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e)$ because $e^{\\prime} e=e$ and $e e^{\\prime}=e^{\\prime}$.\nSince $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is right simple, there exists $y \\in R G^{\\prime}(e)$ such that $x y=e$. Since $e$ is a left identity for any element of $R G^{\\prime}(e), e(x e)=(e x) e=x e \\in e S e$ and $e(y e)=(e y) e=y e \\in e S e$. Also,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx y & =e \\\\\nx y x & =e x \\\\\nx y x & =x \\\\\nx y x e & =x e \\\\\ny x e & =e\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\nx y x=e\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text { multiply by } x\n$$\n\nbecause $R G^{\\prime}(e)$ is left cancellative.\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\n(x e)(y e)=x(e y) e=x y e=e e=e\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n(y e)(x e)=y(e x) e=y x e=e\n$$\n\nso $x e \\in H(e)$.\nThus $x=(x e) e^{\\prime} \\in H(e) R Z(e)=R G(e)$. This means that $R G(e)$ is the maximum right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$.\n\nLemma 5.3. Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $e \\in S$ be an idempotent. Let $H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $H^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$ be subgroups of $H(e)$, and let $R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ and $R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$ be subsets of $R Z(e)$ containing $e$. If $H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)=H^{\\prime \\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$, then $H^{\\prime}(e)=H^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$ and $R Z^{\\prime}(e)=R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$.\n\nProof.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e) & =H^{\\prime \\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e) & & \\text { given } \\\\\nH^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)\\{e\\} & =H^{\\prime \\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)\\{e\\} & & \\text { multiply by }\\{e\\} \\\\\nH^{\\prime}(e)\\{e\\} & =H^{\\prime \\prime}(e)\\{e\\} & & \\text { because } R Z(e)\\{e\\}=\\{e\\} \\\\\nH^{\\prime}(e) & =H^{\\prime \\prime}(e) & & \\text { because } e \\text { is the identity of } H(e) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor any $f \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e), f=e f \\in H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)=H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$. Therefore $f=x f^{\\prime}$ for some $x \\in H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $f^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e)^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f=x f^{\\prime} \\\\\n& f e=x f^{\\prime} e \\\\\n& e=x e \\\\\n& e=x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf e & =f^{\\prime} e=e \\text { for any } f, f^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e) \\\\\ne & \\text { is the identity in } H(e) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus $f=e f^{\\prime}=f^{\\prime}$, and $R Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$. Similarly, $R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e) \\subset R Z^{\\prime}(e)$, so $R Z^{\\prime}(e)=R Z^{\\prime \\prime}(e)$.\nCorollary 5.4. Let $S$ be a semigroup, let $e \\in S$ be an idempotent, and let $T \\subset S$. Then\n$T$ is a right subgroup of $S$ containing $e$ if and only if $T=H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ for some unique subgroup $H^{\\prime}(e) \\subset H(e)$ and some unique $R Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset R Z(e)$ containing $e$, and\n$T$ is a left subgroup of $S$ of $S$ containing $e$ if and only if $T=L Z^{\\prime}(e) H^{\\prime}(e)$ for some unique subgroup $H^{\\prime}(e) \\subset H(e)$ and some unique $L Z^{\\prime}(e) \\subset L Z(e)$ containing $e$.\n\nProof. Every right subgroup $T$ of $S$ containing idempotent $e$ is the maximum right subgroup of itself containing $e$, so that $T=H^{\\prime}(e) R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ for $H^{\\prime}(e)$ as the maximum subgroup of $T$ containing $e$ and maximum right zero subsemigroup of $T$ containing $e$. Since $T$ is a subsemigroup of $S, H^{\\prime}(e)$ is a subgroup of the maximum subgroup of $S$ containing $e, H(e)$, and $R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ with $e \\in R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ is a right zero subsemigroup of the maximum right subsemigroup of $S$ containing $e, R Z(e)$. By the preceding lemma, $H^{\\prime}(e)$ and $R Z^{\\prime}(e)$ are unique.\n\nBy Lemma 5.1, $T$ is a right subgroup of $S$.\nIf $S$ is a right [left] group, then it is its own maximal right [left] subsemigroup.\nCorollary 5.5. If $S$ is a right [left] group, then $S=H(e) R Z(e)[S=L Z(e) H(e)]$.\nLet $E$ be the set of idempotents in semigroup $S$. Every right [left] subgroup contains an idempotent, and every idempotent in $S$ is contained in a maximal right [left] subgroup. Then $\\{L G(e) \\mid e \\in E\\}$ is the set of all maximal left subgroups in $S$, and $\\{R G(e) \\mid e \\in E\\}$ is the set of all maximal right subgroups in $S$. For these sets and $e, f \\in E$, either $L G(e)=L G(f)$ or $L G(e) \\cap L G(f)=\\emptyset$, and either $R G(e)=R G(f)$ or $R G(e) \\cap R G(f)=\\emptyset$, as seen in the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.6. Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $e, f \\in S$ be idempotents. Then\n$R G(e) \\cap R G(f) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e f=f$ and $f e=e$ if and only if $R Z(e)=R Z(f)$ if and only if $R G(e)=R G(f)$, and\n$L G(e) \\cap L G(f) \\neq \\emptyset$ if and only if $e f=e$ and $f e=f$ if and only if $L Z(e)=L Z(f)$ if and only if $L G(e)=L G(f)$.\n\nProof. Let $R G(e) \\cap R G(f) \\neq \\emptyset$. Then there exist $x \\in H(e), e^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e), y \\in H_{f}$, and $f^{\\prime} \\in R Z(f)$ such that $x e^{\\prime}=y f^{\\prime}$.\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx e^{\\prime} e & =y f^{\\prime} e \\\\\nx e & =y f^{\\prime} e \\\\\nx & =y f^{\\prime} e \\\\\nf x & =f y f^{\\prime} e \\\\\nf x & =y f^{\\prime} e \\\\\nf x & =x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nmultiply by $e$\n$e^{\\prime} e=e$\n$x e=x$ in $H(e)$\nmultiply by $f$\n$f y=y$ in $H_{f}$\n$x=y f^{\\prime} e$,\n\nand similarly $e y=y$.\nSince $f x=x$ and there exists $x^{-1} \\in H(e), f x x^{-1}=x x^{-1}$, or $f e=e$. Similarly, $e y=y$ implies $e f=f$.\n\nBy a previous theorem, this implies $R Z(e)=R Z(f)$.\nGiven $R Z(e)=R Z(f)$, let $x \\in H(e)$ and $e^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e)$, so that $x e^{\\prime} \\in H(e) R Z(e)=R G(e)$. Then $x e^{\\prime}=x\\left(f e^{\\prime}\\right)=(x f) e^{\\prime}$ because $e^{\\prime} \\in R Z(e)=R Z(f)$.\n\nAlso\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf x & =f(e x) & & \\text { because } x \\in H(e) \\text { and } e x=x \\\\\n& =(f e) x & & \\text { associativity in semigroup } S \\\\\n& =e x & & \\text { because } f \\in R Z(f)=R Z(e) \\\\\n& =x & & \\text { because } x \\in H(e) \\text { and } e x=x .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore $f(x f)=(f x) f=x f \\in f S f$.\nSince $x \\in H(e)$, there exists $x^{-1} \\in H(e)$, and similarly to $x, f x^{-1}=x^{-1}$ and $x^{-1} f \\in f S f$. Then\n\n$$\n(x f)\\left(x^{-1} f\\right)=x\\left(f x^{-1}\\right) f=x x^{-1} f=e f=f\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left(x^{-1} f\\right)(x f)=x^{-1}(f x) f=x^{-1} x f=e f=f\n$$\n\nso $x f \\in H_{f}$.\nTherefore $x e^{\\prime}=(x f) e^{\\prime} \\in H_{f} R Z(f)$, and $H(e) R Z(e) \\subset H_{f} R Z(f)$. Similarly $R G(f) \\subset R G(e)$, so that $R G(e)=R G(f)$.\n\nGiven $R G(e)=R G(f)$, since $e=e e \\in H(e) R Z(e)=R G(e)=R G(f), R G(e) \\cap R G(f) \\neq \\emptyset$.",
