      "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nEL (Owen, 2001) is a versatile and flexible tool for statistical inference, providing a framework that accommodates broadly defined model conditions. Unlike traditional likelihood approaches, EL does not require the explicit specification of probability distributions governing the data generation process. This inherent flexibility offers numerous practical advantages, such as the ability to incorporate a wide range of model specifications and prior knowledge, making it highly\n\nadaptable for integrating information from multiple data sources. Additionally, EL retains key benefits of its parametric likelihood counterpart, including efficiency (in the semiparametric sense) and the convenience of conducting hypothesis tests and estimating confidence sets through the Wilks-type likelihood ratio framework.\n\nRecent developments in EL approaches have a focus on addressing the challenges posed by complex high-dimensional data. To handle the complexities arising from various model conditions, researchers have explored regularization techniques applied to the Lagrange multipliers associated with EL or the empirical versions of moment conditions, aiming to achieve enhanced model parsimony. In Shi (2016), a two-step procedure is introduced. The first step involves employing a \"relaxed\" EL that incorporates specific inequality constraints in its formulation. The second step includes moment selection and bias correction. Chauss\u00e9 (2017) addresses a continuum of moment conditions where the numerical optimization problem becomes ill-conditioned. To resolve this, a penalty on the continuous version of the Lagrange multiplier's counterpart is proposed and investigated. Chang et al. (2018) proposes a method to penalize the magnitudes of both the Lagrange multiplier and the model parameters, specifically to tackle high-dimensional model parameters under complex conditions. More recently, Chang et al. (2021) explores the projection of high-dimensional moment conditions onto lower-dimensional spaces to facilitate statistical inference for specific components of model parameters and to assess model specification validity. Besides addressing the challenge of handling many moment conditions, the development of EL approaches that incorporate penalties on model parameters to promote parsimonious structures can effectively manage high-dimensional problems, as discussed in Tang and Leng (2010), Leng and Tang (2012), Chang et al. (2015), and Chang et al. (2023).\n\nThe synergy of Bayesian methodologies with traditional likelihoods has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness. Leveraging advances in sampling techniques, Bayesian approaches have established their significance in tackling a wide array of challenges across various domains. This is particularly valuable when dealing with intricate statistical problems where maximizing or even computing the objective function becomes infeasible. The amalgamation of Bayesian principles with EL shows great promise in practical applications. This integration enhances the adaptabil-\n\nity and robustness of the Bayesian framework, enabling the creation of statistical models that can accommodate a wide range of scenarios. Recent developments in the realm of Bayesian EL (BEL) methods are evident in a growing body of literature; see Lazar (2003), Rao and Wu (2010), Chaudhuri and Ghosh (2011), Yang and He (2012), Mengersen et al. (2013), Chib et al. (2018), Cheng and Zhao (2019), Zhao et al. (2020), Tang and Yang (2022), and Yu and Bondell (2024).\n\nThe class of EL approaches often encounters significant challenges due to substantial computational complexity, which frequently presents barriers in practice. These difficulties primarily arise from the nonconvex nature of the objective function and the potential nonconvexity of its support. As the complexity of the model increases with additional parameters and conditions, these computational obstacles become more severe. Thus, developing computationally efficient strategies is crucial to address these challenges. Indeed, as demonstrated in Chauss\u00e9 (2017) and related works, solving the associated optimization problem of penalized EL (PEL) can be a dauntingly difficult task. In our study, we demonstrate that, when combined with the Bayesian framework, sampling schemes offer promising alternatives. Once successfully drawn, samples from the posterior distribution can be used to develop the estimator.\n\nIn recent research, sampling techniques, often perceived as computationally demanding alternatives to optimization methods, demonstrate remarkable efficiency in approximating target distributions, outperforming optimization alternatives in handling nonconvex problems; see Ma et al. (2019). While sampling techniques offer a promising approach within the framework of BEL, there exist numerous challenges associated with devising these computational schemes. On one hand, EL has the potential to leverage information from various model conditions, leading to more precise estimates of unknown model parameters. However, the inclusion of a large number of these conditions introduces additional complexities, both in theory and practical implementation. Indeed, the dimensionality of the problem remains a central obstacle in EL approaches, as elaborated in Hjort et al. (2009). Furthermore, the incorporation of an increasing number of moment conditions can substantially amplify the nonconvex nature of the associated optimization problems, making the development of an effective sampling scheme increasingly more challenging. As underscored in Chaudhuri et al. (2017), traditional MCMC techniques encounter significant\n\nhurdles when applied to BEL due to the intricate and nonconvex characteristics of the parameter space in which new samples are generated.\n\nOur research aims to establish an innovative methodological framework, guided by two primary objectives: (i) our approach maintains the inherent flexibility and adaptability of EL, allowing for the incorporation of broad model conditions; and (ii) our framework provides convenient access to well-established MCMC computing schemes, streamlining practical implementations. To address the first objective and mitigate challenges stemming from numerous model conditions, we propose a penalized approach. By penalizing the magnitudes of the Lagrange multipliers used in evaluating EL at specific model parameter values, we create an effective mechanism similar to moment selection. This approach reduces the problem's dimensionality while still leveraging the potential efficiency gains from a comprehensive set of model conditions. For the second objective, our approach effectively overcomes the obstacles associated with devising sampling schemes for applying Bayesian approaches, thanks to the efficient dimensionality reduction achieved through PEL. In our study, we demonstrate the practicality of our framework using two well-established sampling methods: the popular Metropolis-Hastings sampling and the influential adaptive multiple importance sampling technique for approximate Bayesian computations.\n\nOur study makes several noteworthy contributions, in addition to the methodological advancement mentioned earlier. On a theoretical level, our analysis establishes the properties of the BPEL estimator, allowing for an exponentially increasing number of model conditions, thereby enabling unprecedented adaptability in practical applications. Furthermore, we develop theory that guarantees the convergence of the two showcased sampling schemes, thereby ensuring the validity of BPEL in statistical inference. Our study reinforces the observations made in a recent study by Ma et al. (2019) that sampling techniques offer compelling alternatives to optimization methods in addressing computationally demanding problems. Our theoretical results and numerical studies demonstrate that sampling schemes converge rapidly to stationary distributions centered around the true global optimizer. In contrast, optimization methods often require more time and can become trapped at local peaks, limiting their ability to locate the true optimum.\n\nThe rest of this article are structured as follows. Section 2 delves into the framework of BPEL\n\nand introduces two MCMC algorithms. Numerical studies and real data analysis for an international trade dataset are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 comprehensively develops the properties and theoretical guarantees of the proposed methods. Some discussions are provided in Section 6, while all technical proofs are available in the supplementary material. The used real data and the code for implementing our proposed methods are available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/JinyuanChang-Lab/BayesianPenalizedEL.\n\nNotation.

Here, the parameter space $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a compact set. The information regarding the model parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is gathered through a set of unbiased moment conditions $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}=\\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)=$ $\\left\\{g_{1}(\\cdot ; \\cdot), \\ldots, g_{r}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)\\right\\}^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}$ is referred to as the estimating function, and the true, yet unknown value $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ is situated within the interior of $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$.\n\nIn existing studies, it has been typically required that $r \\geq p$ for the identification of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$. When $p$ and $r$ are fixed constants, the EL with the estimating function $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)$ considered in Qin and Lawless (1994) can be formulated as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\exp \\left[-n \\log n-\\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\widetilde{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}: \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{V}\\right.$ for any $\\left.i \\in[n]\\right\\}$ with an open interval $\\mathcal{V}$ containing zero. The standard EL estimator for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ is defined as $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, which is equivalent to solving the corresponding dual problem:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}=\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ exhibits several desirable properties: (i) it is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent, (ii) it possesses asymptotic normality, and (iii) it attains the semiparametric efficiency bound of Godambe and Heyde (1987). However, in high-dimensional scenarios, the literature has highlighted the challenge of accommodating a diverging $r$. This issue is discussed in works such as Donald et al. (2003), Chen et al. (2009), Hjort et al. (2009), Leng and Tang (2012), and Chang et al. (2015). To elaborate, it is generally required that $r \\ll n^{1 / 2}$ for the consistency and $r \\ll n^{1 / 3}$ for the asymptotic normality of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$. These constraints on the diverging rate of $r$ pose significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional estimating equations.\n\nTo address scenarios where $r \\gg n$ and $p$ remains fixed, we investigate the PEL estimator for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}=\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}-n \\sum_{j=1}^{r} P_{\\nu}\\left(\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}=\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{r}\\right)^{\\top}$, and $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ is a penalty function with the tuning parameter $\\nu$. Given a penalty function $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ with the tuning parameter $\\nu$, we define $\\rho(t ; \\nu)=\\nu^{-1} P_{\\nu}(t)$ for $t \\in[0, \\infty)$ and $\\nu \\in(0, \\infty)$. For $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ in (3), we consider the following class of penalty functions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathscr{P}=\\{P_{\\nu}(\\cdot): & \\rho(t ; \\nu) \\text { is increasing in } t \\in[0, \\infty) \\text { and has continuous } \\\\\n& \\text { derivative } \\rho^{\\prime}(t ; \\nu) \\text { for any } t \\in(0, \\infty) \\text { with } \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+} ; \\nu\\right) \\in(0, \\infty) \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+} ; \\nu\\right) \\text { is independent of } \\nu\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe class $\\mathscr{P}$ is broad and general, encompassing commonly used penalty functions. Theorem 1 in Section 5.1 demonstrates that the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ follows an asymptotically normal distribution and accommodates exponentially diverging $r$ with respect to $n$.\n\nTo practically implement (3), we encounter a two-layer optimization problem for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ and\n\n$\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}$. Let\n\n$$\nf_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}-\\sum_{j=1}^{r} P_{\\nu}\\left(\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}$ is concave in $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$, the inner optimization layer of (3), which seeks $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ given $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ by maximizing $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, can be efficiently implemented even for large $r$ when $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ is chosen as a convex function, such as the $L_{1}$ penalty. The main challenge is the outer optimization layer of (3), which seeks the optimizer $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$. This is difficulty due to the nonconvex nature of the problem, making it NP-hard to find global minima (Jain and Kar, 2017). As a result, this complexity often leads to computational inefficiency and a higher likelihood of converging to local optima.",

      "text": "# 2.2 Bayesian Penalized Empirical Likelihood \n\nWe are motivated to explore an alternative approach using sampling techniques to solve the nonconvex problem associated with PEL. Indeed, as an efficient alternative for addressing nonconvex optimization problems, Ma et al. (2019) has demonstrated that solving these issues with MCMC techniques can yield highly effective results. Their findings indicate that the computational complexity of sampling algorithms exhibits linear scalability with the model dimension, in contrast to the exponential scaling of optimization algorithms in nonconvex settings.\n\nApplying sampling techniques to EL in conjunction with a Bayesian framework emerges as a compelling approach. For $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ defined as (1), let $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$ represent a prior distribution for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. Then, the posterior distribution $\\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ is proportional to $\\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. In cases where $r$ and $p$ are fixed constants, $\\pi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ converges to a Gaussian distribution with mean being the standard EL estimator $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (2). Consequently, when samples are successfully drawn from the posterior distribution, their sample mean can serve as an estimator for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$.\n\nAs the model's complexity increases, BEL faces challenges. In this study, we explore a scenario with high-dimensional model conditions $(r \\gg n)$, while keeping $p$ fixed. The flexibility by allowing large number $r$ also brings significant challenges. For example, as demonstrated in Tsao (2004), as $n \\rightarrow \\infty, \\mathbb{P}\\{\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=0\\} \\rightarrow 1$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in a small neighborhood of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ if $r / n \\geq 0.5$. Such degeneration renders $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ inapplicable in this scenario. To handle diverging $r$, we propose to\n\nreplace $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\exp \\left(-n \\log n-\\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\Lambda_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}-n \\sum_{j=1}^{r} P_{\\nu}\\left(\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|\\right)\\right]\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ is a penalty function with the tuning parameter $\\nu$. Since adding the penalty term $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ encourages sparse Lagrange multiplier $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$, the PEL effectively performs a selection of the model conditions at each given $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. We then consider the BPEL with a prior distribution $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$, which leads to a posterior distribution defined as\n\n$$\n\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times I(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta})\n$$\n\nOur BPEL connects with and differs from the so-called Gibbs posterior in the literature of Bayesian methods (Bissiri et al., 2016; Tang and Yang, 2022; Frazier et al., 2023). On one hand, they share a common foundation with the Gibbs posterior in that both are built upon generic loss functions. The key difference lies in the device each utilizes: EL employs an appropriate multinomial likelihood, $\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{n}\\right)$ with $p_{i} \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}=1$, subject to a broad class of model conditions. In contrast, the Gibbs posterior uses a \"pseudo-likelihood\" proportional to the exponential loss. Furthermore, the inclusion of the penalty on the Lagrange multiplier helps achieve substantial dimension reduction of the problem, which is key in handling high-dimensional problems with many moment conditions. As shown in our numerical studies in Section 3 and Section A. 3 of the supplementary material, MCMC schemes developed from the proposed BPEL demonstrate compelling performance in their finite sample accuracy in approximating the posterior distributions.\n\nOur theory, as elaborated in Section 5.2, establishes the fundamental properties of BPEL. Theorem 2 in Section 5.2 demonstrates that the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ defined as (7) exhibits a Gaussian limiting distribution centered around the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ as defined in (3). Additionally, we define the expected value as\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{p}} \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\n$$\n\nCorollary 1 in Section 5.2 suggests that $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ can be effectively approximated by $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ with an approximation error that diminishes faster than $n^{-1 / 2}$. This validates the approach to obtain\n\n$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ : generating samples from the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ and then using the associated sample mean to approximate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$. In Section 2.3, we will introduce two algorithms designed for implementing BPEL.\n\nThe impact of prior specification on the properties of resulting estimators is a notable area of research. For instance, Vexler et al. (2014) explores this in the context of EL. In various scenarios, the choice of prior can enhance desirable properties of the estimator derived from the posterior distribution, such as sparsity, as discussed in Narisetty and He (2014), Castillo et al. (2015), and Ouyang and Bondell (2023). Given the two primary goals of our study - developing BPEL and investigating it with MCMC - we use a non-informative prior in our numerical demonstrations. As detailed in Section A. 1 of the supplementary material, we examined the effects of different prior specifications. The overall finding is intuitive: when the prior is specified closer to the true value, the resulting estimator performs better compared to using a non-informative prior. Conversely, if the prior is specified further from the true value, the performance of the estimator deteriorates and becomes less competitive.",

For an extensive overview of this body of work, we refer to the monograph by Brooks et al. (2011) and reference therein. The Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm family plays a central role in the practical implementation of MCMC techniques, serving as a cornerstone in the toolbox of statisticians and data scientists.\n\nOur first algorithm explores the utilization of the M-H algorithm for BPEL. To accomplish this, we begin by specifying a proposal distribution with a density function denoted as $\\phi(\\cdot \\mid \\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$.

      "text": "# 2.3.2 Algorithm 2 \n\nAnother widely-used MCMC technique is Importance Sampling (Ripley, 2006; Hesterberg, 1995). This method involves generating samples from a proposal distribution and then applying importance weights to these samples to account for the disparities between the proposal distribution and the target distribution. In practical applications, recycling successive samples often proves to be an effective strategy (Marin et al., 2019), particularly when the computation of importance weights is computationally intensive. In this context, Cornuet et al. (2012) introduces the Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling (AMIS) algorithm, which combines various importance sampling methods with adaptive techniques. The integration of the AMIS approach with EL, as shown in Mengersen et al. (2013), is particularly compelling. To ensure the consistency of AMIS, Marin et al. (2019) introduces a modified variant called Modified AMIS (MAMIS) with a simpler\n\nrecycling strategy compared to AMIS.\nWe present and investigate an MAMIS algorithm, as outlined in Algorithm 2, specifically designed for computing BPEL. This algorithm operates in a scenario where a density function $\\varphi(\\cdot ; \\boldsymbol{\\zeta})$ is defined, with $\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}$ representing a parameter in $\\mathbb{R}^{s}$, and where an explicit function $\\mathbf{h}: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\mapsto$ $\\mathbb{R}^{s}$ is known. This configuration allows us to generate weighted samples that effectively capture the characteristics of the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$, as defined in (7).\n\n```\nAlgorithm 2 An MAMIS algorithm to generate the weighted samples with respect to \\(\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)\\)\nInput: the proposal distribution admits density \\(\\varphi(\\cdot ; \\boldsymbol{\\zeta})\\) with the parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s}\\), an initial parameter \\(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{1}\\), an\n    explicitly known function \\(\\mathbf{h}: \\mathbb{R}^{p} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{s}\\), the number of iteration \\(K\\) and the increasing sampling sizes\n    \\(\\left\\{N_{1}, \\ldots, N_{K}\\right\\}\\).\nfor \\(k \\in[K]\\) do\n    for \\(i \\in\\left[N_{k}\\right]\\) do\n        Proposal step:\n        generate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}\\) from the proposal distribution with density \\(\\varphi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{k}\\right)\\).\n        compute the importance weight \\(\\omega_{i}^{k}=\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) / \\varphi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k} ; \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{k}\\right)\\).\n    end for\n    update the parameter of the proposal distribution: \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{k+1}=N_{k}^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{k}} \\omega_{i}^{k} \\mathbf{h}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}\\right)\\).\nend for\nfor \\(k \\in[K]\\) do\n    for \\(i \\in\\left[N_{k}\\right]\\) do\n        Recycling process:\n        update the importance weight \\(\\omega_{i}^{k}=\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) /\\left\\{S_{K}^{-1} \\sum_{l=1}^{K} N_{l} \\varphi\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{l}\\right)\\right\\}\\) with \\(S_{K}=N_{1}+\\cdots+N_{K}\\)\n        if \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}\\).\n    end for\nend for\nOutput: the weighted samples \\(\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}^{\\dagger}, \\omega_{1}^{\\dagger}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{N_{1}}^{\\dagger}, \\omega_{N_{1}}^{\\dagger}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{1}^{K}, \\omega_{1}^{K}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{N_{K}}^{K}, \\omega_{N_{K}}^{K}\\right)\\).\n```\n\nAlgorithm 2 generates a sequence of samples while progressively adjusting the parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\zeta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{s}$ involved in the proposal distribution. At each iteration $k$ of Algorithm 2, the new value for the parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}$ of the proposal distribution is determined based on the most recent $N_{k}$ samples drawn. This represents the primary distinction between the MAMIS algorithm by Marin et al. (2019) and the AMIS algorithm by Cornuet et al. (2012). Specifically, MAMIS updates the proposal distribution parameter using only the last $N_{k}$ samples at iteration $k$, while AMIS updates this parameter by considering all past $\\sum_{j=1}^{k} N_{j}$ samples. The end product output of Algorithm 2 is generated by updating the importance weights for all samples produced during the recycling process.",

      "text": "# 2.4 Sampling vs Optimizations \n\nWe advocate the utilization of sampling techniques as a practical and efficient alternative to optimization methods for addressing computationally challenging PEL problems. Specifically for obtaining the estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ as defined in (3), we can rely on samples $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{K}$ generated from the M-H algorithm (see Algorithm 1), estimating $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, as defined in (8), by computing the sample mean, i.e., $K^{-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{k}$. When employing the MAMIS algorithm (see Algorithm 2) and completing $K$ iterations, the estimator for $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is determined as a weighted average:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\pi^{\\dagger}, K}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\frac{1}{S_{K}} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{k}} \\omega_{i}^{k} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $S_{K}=N_{1}+\\cdots+N_{K}$.\nOur theory in Section 5.2 supports the use of sampling algorithms as efficient alternatives. For the M-H algorithm, Theorem 3 in Section 5.2 demonstrates that, conditional on $\\mathcal{X}_{n}$, the average $K^{-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{k}$ converges almost surely to $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ as $K \\rightarrow \\infty$. For the MAMIS algorithm, Theorem 4 in Section 5.2 establishes that, conditional on $\\mathcal{X}_{n}, \\widehat{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\pi^{\\dagger}, K}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ in (9) converges almost surely to $\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\sim \\pi^{\\dagger}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ as $K \\rightarrow \\infty$. These results, combined with Corollary 1 in Section 5.2, validate the properties of BPEL estimators obtained through these established sampling techniques. Another consideration in Algorithms 1 and 2 is the choice of the initial point, denoted, respectively, as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{0}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{1}$. Our theoretical analyses only require $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{0} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ satisfying $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{0} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)>0$ and do not impose any restriction on $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{1}$; see Theorems 3 and 4 in Section 5.2 for details. Our empirical simulation studies in Section 3 consistently demonstrate the proposed algorithms' robust performance, irrespective of the initial value chosen. Notice that the performance of the optimization methods for the nonconvex optimization problems usually depends crucially on the choice of the initial point. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evidence underscores that, in comparison to competing optimization methods, these sampling-based approaches offer significant advantages in terms of convergence speed, stability across replications, and resilience to variations in initial values. This reaffirms the benefits of incorporating BPEL into the methodology.\n\nThe M-H and MAMIS algorithms each have their strengths. M-H is easy to implement, but high rejection rates can reduce its efficiency, especially with a poorly tuned proposal distribution. MAMIS, while requiring more effort - particularly in computing importance weights - offers\n\nimproved sampling efficiency and is less sensitive to the proposal distribution, making it ideal for complex posterior distributions. Choosing between these algorithms depends on the specific problem and the balance between implementation ease and sampling efficiency.",

      "text": "# 3 Numerical Studies\n### 3.1 Data Generation Process\n\nWe conduct simulation studies to empirically assess the performance of our proposed methods. For the data generation process (DGP), we adopt the structural equation $y_{i}=\\hbar\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)+e_{i}^{(0)}$, $i \\in[n]$, where $\\hbar: \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function, $e_{i}^{(0)}$ is the error, and $\\mathbf{u}_{i}=\\left(u_{i, 1}, u_{i, 2}\\right)^{\\top}$ represents two endogenous variables. The set of all instrumental variables (IVs) is denoted as $\\mathbf{z}_{i}=\\left(z_{i, 1}, \\ldots, z_{i, r}\\right)^{\\top}$ for $i \\in[n]$. The true reduced-form equations for the endogenous variables are specified as $u_{i, 1}=0.5 z_{i, 1}+0.5 z_{i, 2}+e_{i}^{(1)}$ and $u_{i, 2}=0.5 z_{i, 3}+0.5 z_{i, 4}+e_{i}^{(2)}$, where $\\left(e_{i}^{(1)}, e_{i}^{(2)}\\right)$ represents the random errors. Essentially, each of the two endogenous variables is influenced by only two IVs. All IVs are selected orthogonal to the error term $e_{i}^{(0)}$. Hence, we have $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{y_{i}-\\hbar\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right) \\mid \\mathbf{z}_{i}\\right\\}=\\mathbf{0}$, which implies that $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ can be identified by the $r$ unbiased moment conditions $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}=\\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)=\\left\\{y_{i}-\\hbar\\left(\\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\} \\mathbf{z}_{i}$ with $\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left(y_{i}, \\mathbf{u}_{i}^{\\top}, \\mathbf{z}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)^{\\top}$.

      "text": "### 3.2 Sampling Efficiency and Stability\n\nWe begin by demonstrating the improvement in sampling efficiency achieved through the use of PEL. In this context, we generate data following the DGP with linear link function $\\hbar(\\cdot)$ by setting $n=120$ and varying $r$ in the range $[50,1000]$. We aim to sample from two posterior distributions $\\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $\\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ are, respectively, given in (1) and (6). Evaluating $\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ involves an optimization problem that solves for $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ by maximizing the objective function $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ defined as (5) at given $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. To ensure the attainment of a sparse Lagrange multiplier and maintain the convexity of the objective function, we select $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$\n\nas the $L_{1}$ penalty function. In practice, since the prior information about the true parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$ is typically unavailable, we select $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$ as the improper uniform prior. We implement Algorithm 1 to sample from both posterior distributions using identical settings, employing a proposal distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)$ with $\\sigma^{2}=10^{-4}$ and initializing from $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{0}=(0.3,0.3)^{\\top}$. In the case of PEL, we set the tuning parameter $\\nu=0.03$ involved in $\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.\n\nTo compare efficiency, we measure the number of iterations required to obtain the same number of accepted samples. Figure 1 illustrates the average number of iterations needed over 500 runs to accept 5 samples for different values of $r$, thereby providing a comparison between using EL and PEL within a Bayesian framework. The sampling efficiency of Algorithm 1 when using $\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is notably superior to that achieved with $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. The selection of $\\sigma^{2}$ within the proposal distribution closely influences the acceptance rate in each step of the M-H algorithm. With our small choice of $\\sigma^{2}$ in the simulation, the M-H algorithm should efficiently generate valid samples. It is worth highlighting that the acceptance rate remains consistently high and stable when using PEL across all $r$ settings. In contrast, when employing EL without any penalty, it may require thousands more iterations to achieve the same number of accepted samples. Additionally, it is evident that the M-H algorithm with EL becomes increasingly unstable as $r$ increases.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: The average number of iterations over 500 runs required to obtain 5 valid samples.",

      "text": "# 3.3 Comparison with the Optimization Methods \n\nAs we suggested in Section 2.3, the computation of the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3) can be implemented using Algorithm 1 (referred to as M-H) and Algorithm 2 (referred to as MAMIS). In this part, we compare their performance with two optimization methods: (a) optim: A versatile R\n\nfunction for general-purpose optimization of objective functions, supporting various optimization algorithms like Nelder-Mead, quasi-Newton, and conjugate-gradient; and (b) nlm: An R function specialized in non-linear optimization, particularly designed for finding minima of objective functions using Newton-type algorithms.\n\nThe choice of the proposal distribution plays a crucial role in achieving efficient sampling with BPEL. Within the context of the M-H algorithm, one commonly used scheme is the random walk M-H, where the proposal distribution takes the form of a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{I}_{p}\\right)$ with the current state denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. It is essential to carefully select an appropriate value for $\\sigma^{2}$. A small value for $\\sigma^{2}$ can result in slow exploration of the state space, while a large value can lead to decreased acceptance rates, subsequently slowing down the algorithm. To strike a balance between exploration and acceptance rates, we can monitor the acceptance rate of the algorithm. In the simulation for M-H, we set $\\sigma^{2}=C(n \\log r)^{-1}$ with some constant $C>0$. We adjust the value of $C$ until the acceptance rate closely matches the desired rate, typically aiming for approximately 0.234 , as suggested in Gelman et al. (1997). It is known that the M-H algorithm requires some time to converge to its stationary distribution, especially when the initial point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{0} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ is situated in the tails of the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$. Considering this, we set a burn-in period of 500 iterations. For the MAMIS algorithm, we adhere to recommendations from Cornuet et al. (2012) and Mengersen et al. (2013) that advocate for the adoption of $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ as the proposal distribution. During each iteration $k$ of MAMIS, we calculate the updated value $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}}_{k+1}=\\left\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{k+1}^{\\top}, \\operatorname{vech}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{k+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right\\}^{\\top}$ for the parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}^{\\top}, \\operatorname{vech}(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})^{\\top}\\right\\}^{\\top}$ involved in the proposal distribution $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ as $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{k+1}=N_{k}^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{k}} \\omega_{i}^{k} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}$ and $\\operatorname{vech}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{k+1}\\right)=$ $N_{k}^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{k}} \\omega_{i}^{k} \\operatorname{vech}\\left\\{\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{k+1}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i}^{k}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{k+1}\\right)^{\\top}\\right\\}$, where $\\omega_{i}^{k}$ represents the corresponding importance weights, as outlined in Algorithm 2. In our simulations, we initialize $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{1}=\\mathbf{I}_{p}$, and the selection of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{1}$ is described in the next paragraph.\n\nWe conduct 200 replications following the DGP and explore various combinations of dimensionalities. Specifically, we consider $n \\in\\{120,240\\}$ and $r \\in\\{80,160,320,640\\}$. To assess the robustness of these methods with respect to initial points, we select 49 equally spaced grid points on the plane within the range of $[-3,4] \\times[-3,4]$ as our chosen initial points. In the case of\n\nMAMIS, which is not an iterative algorithm, we set these initial points as the initial means $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{1}$ for its proposal distribution $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ to facilitate comparison. In our simulations, we identify the true global minima $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3) through exhaustive search. To achieve this, in each replication of the simulation (indexed by $k$ ), we generate a grid of 10201 equally spaced points within the range $[-0.5,1.5] \\times[-0.5,1.5]$. We then compute the posterior probabilities for these points and selected $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{\\text {mode }}$ as the point with the highest probability. Since $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$ is selected as the improper uniform prior, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{\\text {mode }}$ is actually the required true global minima in the $k$-th replication. We repeat this process for $k=1$ to 200 , and compare the outcomes obtained from both optimization and sampling methods by calculating the measure\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE}_{1}=\\frac{1}{200 \\times 49} \\sum_{k=1}^{200} \\sum_{l=1}^{49}\\left|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}(l)-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{\\text {mode }}\\right|_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}(l)$ represents the related outcome in the $k$-th replication initiated from the $l$-th initial point.\n\nIn the context of BPEL sampling, we explore three scenarios with varying sample sizes of 1500, 2500, and 3500, which we label as (M-H-1, M-H-2, M-H-3) and (MAMIS-1, MAMIS-2, MAMIS-3), respectively, for Algorithms 1 and 2. Additionally, we conduct an investigation into the influence of different values for the tuning parameter $\\nu$. Table 1 presents the simulation results. The overall performance of the sampling approaches surpasses that of the optimization methods. Notably, for the nonlinear model, the optimization using the R function nlm is proven to be unreliable, resulting in highly unstable results. As the size of the generated samples increases, the performance of BPEL improves. Both M-H and MAMIS exhibit promising performance in both linear and nonlinear cases. For the nonlinear models, MAMIS significantly outperforms M-H, possibly owing to the advantages gained from employing importance weights for parameter estimation. The role of the tuning parameter $\\nu$ is pivotal, underscoring the merits from using the PEL approach in achieving more parsimonious models by effectively selecting most useful model conditions within the constraints of the available data information. When using very small values of $\\nu$, such as 0.01 , the performance of the methods becomes less satisfactory. Overall, the BPEL performs satisfactorily for a reasonable range of choices for $\\nu$.\n\nTable 1: Comparison of BPEL and optimization methods\n\n![table_0](table_0)",

      "text": "# 3.4 Comparison with Competing Methods \n\nIn this part, we compare the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3) with two other estimators: the standard EL estimator $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (2) and the relaxed EL (REL) estimator introduced by Shi (2016). The REL is tailored for high-dimensional estimating equations, making it resilient to minor deviations from the equality constraints. Notice that the standard EL can only work for low-dimensional estimating equations. In line with our model specifications, where the two endogenous variables $u_{i, 1}$ and $u_{i, 2}$ are linked to IVs ( $z_{i, 1}, z_{i, 2}$ and $z_{i, 3}, z_{i, 4}$, respectively) for each $i \\in[n]$, we only use the first four moment conditions, that are related to the IVs $z_{i, 1}, z_{i, 2}, z_{i, 3}$ and $z_{i, 4}$, to produce the standard EL estimator $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$. The computation of $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ can be implemented by the function gel in the R-package gmm. For both our PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ and the REL estimator, we use all the $r$ moment conditions.\n\nFor the selection of the tuning parameter in the REL estimator, we follow the recommendation in Shi (2016), using a consistent tuning parameter $0.5 n^{-1 / 2}(\\log r)^{1 / 2}$ throughout the simulations. Regarding the tuning parameter $\\nu$ in our BPEL, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) defined as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{BIC}(\\nu)=\\log \\left\\{\\frac{1}{r}\\left|\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right)\\right|_{2}^{2}\\right\\}+\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right| n^{-1} \\log n\n$$\n\nfor its selection, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}$ is the associated PEL estimator with tuning parameter $\\nu$ calculated by our sampling algorithm, and $\\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\\nu)}=\\operatorname{supp}\\left\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right)\\right\\}$ with $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right)=\\left(\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}^{(\\nu)}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\lambda}_{r}^{(\\nu)}\\right)^{\\top}=$ $\\arg _{\\lambda \\in \\hat{\\lambda}_{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right)} f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}^{(\\nu)}\\right)$ with $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ defined as (5). In practice, we set $\\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\\nu)}=\\{j \\in[r]$ : $\\left.\\left|\\hat{\\lambda}_{j}^{(\\nu)}\\right|>10^{-6}\\right\\}$ and restrict $\\nu$ in the interval $\\left[0.05 n^{-1 / 2}(\\log r)^{1 / 2}, 0.75 n^{-1 / 2}(\\log r)^{1 / 2}\\right]$.\n\nFor the same 49 initial points of the 200 replications mentioned in Section 3.3, we calculate the measure\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSE}_{2}=\\frac{1}{200 \\times 49} \\sum_{k=1}^{200} \\sum_{l=1}^{49}\\left|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}(l)-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nto evaluate the performance of different estimators, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}(l)$ is the related estimator in the $k$-th replication initiated from the $l$-th initial point. Table 2 compares the measure $\\mathrm{MSE}_{2}$ for the three estimators: the PEL estimator (MAMIS, M-H), the standard EL estimator, and the REL estimator. The results for M-H and MAMIS are derived based on the generated samples\n\nof size 3500. It becomes clear that BPEL demonstrates substantial performance improvements, clearly establishing its superiority over the other estimation methods. Particularly noteworthy is the effectiveness of MAMIS in addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear estimating equations, showing its promising performance.\n\nTable 2: Comparison of BPEL and other estimators\n\n![table_1](table_1)",

      "text": "## 4 Real Data Analysis\n\nInternational trade refers to the cross-border exchange of capital, commodities, and services between nations or regions. This type of trade typically constitutes a substantial portion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP). Eaton et al. (2011), hereafter referred to as EKK, combined an empirical model with microeconomic principles to analyze France's international trade patterns. Additionally, Shi (2016) utilized EKK's microeconomic model to derive parameter\n\nestimates for Chinese exporting companies. In this section, we reexamine the dataset previously examined in Shi (2016), employing the proposed BPEL approach.\n\nThe model proposed by EKK comprises five parameters denoted as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\left(\\theta_{1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{5}\\right)^{\\top} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$. The first component, $\\theta_{1}$, characterizes the distribution of production efficiency among firms, with a higher $\\theta_{1}$ indicating a larger proportion of manufacturers with lower efficiency. The second component, $\\theta_{2}$, quantifies the cost associated with accessing a fraction of potential buyers, where a higher $\\theta_{2}$ corresponds to lower costs. Parameters $\\theta_{3}, \\theta_{4}$ and $\\theta_{5}$ represent the standard deviation of the demand shock, the standard deviation of the entry cost shock, and the correlation coefficient between these two shocks, respectively. Each firm is identified by the index $i \\in[n]$, while countries are represented by the index $j \\in\\{0\\} \\cup[r]$, with $j=0$ denoting the home country.\n\nAccording to the EKK's model, the sales of firm $i$ in country $j$ is $Z_{i, j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; e_{i, j}^{(1)}, e_{i, j}^{(2)}, e_{i}^{(3)}\\right)=$ $\\kappa \\tilde{Z}_{j}\\left(1-\\tau_{i, j}\\right)^{\\theta_{2} / \\theta_{1}} \\tau_{i, j}^{-1 / \\theta_{1}} a_{i, j}^{(1)} / a_{i, j}^{(2)}$, where $a_{i, j}^{(1)}=\\exp \\left\\{\\theta_{3}\\left(1-\\theta_{5}^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2} e_{i, j}^{(1)}+\\theta_{3} \\theta_{5} e_{i, j}^{(2)}\\right\\}, a_{i, j}^{(2)}=\\exp \\left\\{\\theta_{4} e_{i, j}^{(2)}\\right\\}$, $\\tau_{i, j}=\\min \\left\\{1, e_{i}^{(3)} \\bar{u}_{i} / \\bar{u}_{i, j}\\right\\}$ and\n\n$$\n\\kappa=\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{1}}{\\theta_{1}-1}-\\frac{\\theta_{1}}{\\theta_{1}+\\theta_{2}-1}\\right) \\exp \\left\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\theta_{3}-\\theta_{1}^{2} \\theta_{4}^{2}\\right)+\\theta_{3} \\theta_{4} \\theta_{5}\\left(\\theta_{1}-1\\right)+\\frac{1}{2} \\theta_{4}\\left(\\theta_{1}-1\\right)^{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwith $\\bar{u}_{i, j}=\\left(a_{i, j}^{(2)}\\right)^{\\theta_{1}} N_{j}$ and $\\bar{u}_{i}=\\min \\left\\{\\bar{u}_{i, 0}, \\max _{j \\in[r]} \\bar{u}_{i, j}\\right\\}$, and $\\left(\\tilde{Z}_{j}, N_{j}\\right)_{j \\in\\{0\\} \\cup[r]}$ are known constants. Here $e_{i, j}^{(1)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1), e_{i, j}^{(2)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $e_{i}^{(1)} \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ are mutually independent. Furthermore, $Z_{i, j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; e_{i, j}^{(1)}, e_{i, j}^{(2)}, e_{i}^{(3)}\\right)=0$ means that the firm $i$ is kept outside of the country $j$. As a pertinent economic indicator of our interest, the mean sale of all firms in country $j$ is $\\mu_{j}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{Z_{i, j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} ; e_{i, j}^{(1)}, e_{i, j}^{(2)}, e_{i}^{(3)}\\right)\\right\\}$, where the expectation is taken respect to the random variables $\\left\\{e_{i, j}^{(1)}, e_{i, j}^{(2)}, e_{i}^{(3)}\\right\\}$. The dataset is sourced from the Chinese administrative databases, encompassing a total of $n=6754$ firms and their export data to $r=126$ foreign destination countries in 2006. Leveraging this dataset, we obtain the $r$-dimensional estimating function $\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)=\\left\\{g_{1}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right), \\ldots, g_{r}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}^{\\top}, i \\in[n]$, with $\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left(x_{i, 1}, \\ldots, x_{i, r}\\right)^{\\top}$ and $g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)=x_{i, j}-\\mu_{j}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for any $j \\in[r]$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, where $x_{i, j}$ is the sale of firm $i$ in country $j$ from this dataset ( $j=0$ is not considered in this dataset).\n\nSince the model is highly nonlinear with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, resulting in no closed-form expression for $\\mu_{j}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, we approximate it via numerical simulation (Eaton et al., 2011; Shi, 2016). Specifically, in the estimation, we utilize the \"artificial data\" for another $5 n=33770$ firms\n\nfrom the dataset. This involves simulating the entry decisions and sales across various countries for each of these artificial firms. Subsequently, we calculate sample means to approximate $\\mu_{j}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for any $j \\in\\{0\\} \\cup[r]$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$. We generated samples of size 3500 from the posterior distribution for the BPEL. To select the tuning parameter $\\nu$, we employed the BIC as defined in (10). For the parameter space $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, we adopted a compact range of values, specifically $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}=[1.5,10] \\times[0.5,5] \\times[0.1,5] \\times[0.1,5] \\times[-0.9,0.9]$, which is consistent with the economic context and aligns with the study of Shi (2016). To initiate the analysis, we selected 15 samples uniformly distributed within the parameter space $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$. Figure 2 presents the box-plots of the corresponding 15 estimates obtained by M-H and MAMIS from these initial values. The results for the REL with the same initial values are also included for comparative evaluation.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The box-plots of the estimated points.\n\nIt is evident that for all five parameters, MAMIS exhibits the smallest variations in the resulting estimates, whereas the variations of M-H and REL are relatively similar. This consistency with the findings in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 reaffirms the robustness of MAMIS when considering different initial points. Such robustness is desirable for conducting more in-depth analyses. For instance, let us take $\\theta_{5}$ into consideration which represents the correlation coefficient between the demand shock and the entry cost shock. The sign of its estimate carries the key implication. The 15 estimates of $\\theta_{5}$ obtained by REL and M-H, from different initial values, fall within the ranges of $(-0.8738,0.8507)$ and $(-0.8774,0.8996)$, respectively. In contrast, the estimates of $\\theta_{5}$ by MAMIS\n\nrange in $(-0.7978,0.1329)$, with the majority being negative, signaling a more assuring result.\n\nWe then proceed to examine the specific moments selected by the respective methods. For REL, we employ the greedy algorithm outlined in Section 3.2 of Shi (2016). To assess the effectiveness of moment selection, we validate whether or not the top 10 trading partners of China in terms of export volume in this dataset, including the USA, Japan, Germany, etc., are either selected or partially selected. We find that, although REL selects at least some of these countries for 10 out of the 15 initial values, the number of selected countries does not exceed 3. In contrast, for 13 out of the 15 initial values, M-H identifies at least some of these countries, with 9 of them including more than 3 . In the case of MAMIS, 13 out of the 15 initial values result in the identification of some of these countries, and all of them include more than 3 countries. Additionally, the robustness of MAMIS with respect to the initial points provides enhanced reliability in this context.",

(a) There exist universal constants $K_{2}>0$ and $\\gamma>4$ such that\n\n$$\n\\max _{j \\in[r]} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}}\\left|g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right|^{\\gamma}\\right\\} \\leq K_{2}\n$$\n\nand $\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\max _{j \\in[r]} \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{\\left|g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right|^{\\gamma}\\right\\}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)$. (b) There exist universal constants $0<K_{3}<K_{4}$ such that $K_{3}<\\lambda_{\\min }\\left\\{\\mathbf{V}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\} \\leq \\lambda_{\\max }\\left\\{\\mathbf{V}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}<K_{4}$. (c) For any $\\mathbf{x}$ and $j \\in[r], g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is twice continuously differentiable with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\max _{j \\in[r], k \\in[p]} \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{\\left|\\frac{\\partial g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\partial \\theta_{k}}\\right|^{2}\\right\\}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)=\\sup _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} \\max _{j \\in[r], k_{1}, k_{2} \\in[p]} \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{\\left|\\frac{\\partial^{2} g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)}{\\partial \\theta_{k_{1}} \\partial \\theta_{k_{2}}}\\right|^{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nDetailed discussion on Conditions 1 and 2 are given in Section B of the supplementary material. For any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, define\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{M}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{*}=\\left\\{j \\in[r]: \\mid \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\} \\mid \\geq C_{*} \\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor some $C_{*} \\in(0,1)$.

Proposition 1 shows that $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ is consistent to the true parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$, allowing $r$ growing exponentially with the sample size $n$.\n\nProposition 1. Let $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot) \\in \\mathscr{P}$ be a convex function for $\\mathscr{P}$ defined as (4). Under Conditions 1 , 2(a) and 2(b), if $\\log r \\ll n^{1 / 3}$ and $\\ell_{n} n^{-1 / 2}(\\log r)^{1 / 2} \\ll \\min \\left\\{\\nu, n^{-1 / \\gamma}\\right\\}$, then the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3) satisfies $\\left|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{\\infty}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\nu)$.\n\nProposition 1 establishes the consistency of the PEL estimator with diverging $r$, incorporating the impact of the penalty function. In particular, the convergence rate of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ is $\\nu$, provided that the tuning parameter $\\nu$ in (3) satisfies $\\nu \\gg \\ell_{n} n^{-1 / 2}(\\log r)^{1 / 2}$. As a result, the convergence rate of\n\n$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ is slower than $n^{-1 / 2}$, which can be viewed as the price paid for using the penalty in handling exponentially growing dimensionality $r$.\n\nRecall $\\rho(t ; \\nu)=\\nu^{-1} P_{\\nu}(t)$. For $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot) \\in \\mathscr{P}$ with $\\mathscr{P}$ defined as (4), since $\\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+} ; \\nu\\right)$ is independent of $\\nu$, we write it as $\\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)$for simplicity. Let $\\mathcal{R}_{n}=\\operatorname{supp}\\left\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)\\right\\}$ for the Lagrange multiplier $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)=\\left(\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\lambda}_{r}\\right)^{\\top}=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)} f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)$ with $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ defined as (5). Then $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)$ satisfy the score equation:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{0}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)}{1+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\left(\\hat{\\eta}_{1}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\eta}_{r}\\right)^{\\top}$ with $\\hat{\\eta}_{j}=\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(\\left|\\hat{\\lambda}_{j}\\right| ; \\nu\\right) \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\hat{\\lambda}_{j}\\right)$ for $\\hat{\\lambda}_{j} \\neq 0$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_{j} \\in\\left[-\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right), \\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)\\right]$ for $\\hat{\\lambda}_{j}=0$. Here, an effective drastic dimension reduction is achieved with the associated sparse $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)$. The use of the penalty function $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ leads to $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}$ in (11), an extra term compared to that of the conventional EL. While $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot)$ ensures the consistency of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ as shown in Proposition 1, as we will show in Theorem 1 later, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}$ leads to a bias of the PEL estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$.\n\nWe further remark that while penalizing the Lagrange multiplier in our PEL does effectively achieve the selection of moments, its properties in terms of the validity of the selected moments remain an interesting research question. On one hand, it is reasonable to expect that under appropriate conditions and with a suitably chosen tuning parameter, our PEL may correctly select the set of valid moments. On the other hand, the major challenge lies in the ambiguity of defining valid moments when the corresponding moment functions are evaluated at broad candidate values of the model parameters rather than the truth. This consideration opens the door to a research question of its own interest in the context of moment selection that we are interested in investigating in our future research.\n\nTo study the asymptotic distribution of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$, we need the following regularity conditions.\nCondition 3. Let $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathcal{F}}=\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}_{\\mathcal{F}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)^{\\top, \\otimes 2}$ for any $\\mathcal{F} \\subset[r]$. There exist universal constants $0<K_{5}<$ $K_{6}$ such that $K_{5}<\\lambda_{\\min }\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathcal{F}}\\right) \\leq \\lambda_{\\max }\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathcal{F}}\\right)<K_{6}$ for any $\\mathcal{F}$ with $p \\leq|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq \\ell_{n}$.\n\nCondition 4.

Proposition 2 in the supplementary material shows that the asymptotic behavior of $\\aleph_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in these three regions are different.\n\nInvestigating the asymptotic behavior of $\\aleph_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ calls some new technical arguments. Write\n\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\} \\text { and } \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} \\tilde{f}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\n$$\n\nWhen $r$ is a fixed constant, we know $2 n \\tilde{f}_{n}\\{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ is the conventional log-EL ratio in the literature. The asymptotic behavior of $2 n \\tilde{f}_{n}\\{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ depends on the magnitude of $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}$. More specifically, under some mild conditions, it holds that (i) $2 n \\tilde{f}_{n}\\{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ is asymptotically chi-square distributed with degree of freedom $r$ if $\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}\\right|_{2} \\ll n^{-1 / 2}$, (ii) $2 n \\tilde{f}_{n}\\{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ converges to a noncentral chi-square distribution if $\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}\\right|_{2} \\asymp n^{-1 / 2}$, and (iii) $2 n \\tilde{f}_{n}\\{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ diverges to $\\infty$ in probability if $\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}\\right|_{2} \\gg n^{-1 / 2}$. See, for example, Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 of Chang et al. (2013) for such results with $r=1$. In comparison to $\\tilde{f}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ defined in (15), $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ involved in $\\aleph_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ includes a penalty term imposed on the Lagrange multiplier $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$.

      "text": "# 6 Discussion \n\nIn this paper, we explore BPEL and demonstrate its promising performance using MCMC sampling as a competitive alternative to optimization in addressing EL problems. This framework has the potential for further advancements in several areas. To maintain focus and avoid digressions, we have confined our study to fixed-dimensional model parameters and exponentially growing moment conditions. However, there is significant interest in extending this approach to tackle variable and model selection using BPEL, which could accommodate high-dimensional sparse model parameters and potentially a continuum of moment conditions, as considered in Chauss\u00e9 (2017). Incorporating specific priors in the context of concrete studies, particularly in high-dimensional problems, is another area of interest. Research in this direction presents additional challenges, especially in selecting appropriate priors, developing efficient sampling schemes, and conducting associated analyses.\n\nIn the broader context of Bayesian methodology, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) are two competitive methods for handling situations where the likelihood is difficult to evaluate or intractable. ABC and BSL have been extensively compared in the literature. We demonstrate that the rationale of ABC integrates well with our BPEL method, achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our Algorithm 2, inspired by ABC , uses importance weights for samples drawn from an alternative distribution to address challenging sampling situations. Empirical evidence shows promising performance, particularly in difficult cases. BSL leverages the limiting distribution, such as the normal distribution, to handle intractable probability distributions, with the advantage of easy sampling from the normal distribution. We view our BPEL as a compelling alternative to BSL: EL uses a multinomial likelihood that incorporates model information without requiring a fully specified parametric model, making it a competitive option when the full likelihood is intractable.\n\nFurthermore, we foresee the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes in conjunction with PEL as highly valuable for addressing complex problems with specific considerations. Examples include the Hamiltonian MCMC method examined in Chaudhuri et al. (2017) and the variational Bayesian approach explored in Yu and Bondell (2024). These avenues of research are part of our plans for future projects.",

Let $C, \\bar{C}$ and $\\tilde{C}$ be generic positive finite constants that may be different in different uses. Let $\\lfloor a\\rfloor$ represent the largest integer not greater than $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For any positive integer $q$, we write $[q]=\\{1, \\ldots, q\\}$. Denote by $I(\\cdot)$ the indicator function. Let $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathbf{A})$ be the trace of a $q \\times q$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}=\\left(a_{i, j}\\right)_{q \\times q}$. For a $q \\times q$ symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, denote by $\\lambda_{\\min }(\\mathbf{A})$ and $\\lambda_{\\max }(\\mathbf{A})$ the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$, respectively. For a $q_{1} \\times q_{2}$ matrix $\\mathbf{B}=\\left(b_{i, j}\\right)_{q_{1} \\times q_{2}}$, let $\\|\\mathbf{B}\\|_{2}=\\lambda_{\\max }^{1 / 2}\\left(\\mathbf{B}^{\\otimes 2}\\right)$ be the spectral norm with $\\mathbf{B}^{\\otimes 2}=\\mathbf{B B}^{\\top}$. Specifically, if $q_{2}=1$, we use $|\\mathbf{B}|_{\\infty}=\\max _{i \\in\\left[q_{1}\\right]}\\left|b_{i, 1}\\right|,|\\mathbf{B}|_{1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{q_{1}}\\left|b_{i, 1}\\right|$ and $|\\mathbf{B}|_{2}=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{q_{1}} b_{i, 1}^{2}\\right)^{1 / 2}$ to denote the $L_{\\infty}$-norm, $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{2}$-norm of the $q_{1}$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{B}$, respectively. Given index sets $\\mathcal{S}_{1} \\subset\\left[q_{1}\\right]$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{2} \\subset\\left[q_{2}\\right]$, denote by $[\\mathbf{B}]_{\\mathcal{S}_{1}, \\mathcal{S}_{2}}$ the $\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{1}\\right| \\times\\left|\\mathcal{S}_{2}\\right|$ matrix that is obtained by extracting the rows of a $q_{1} \\times q_{2}$ matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ indexed by $\\mathcal{S}_{1}$ and columns indexed by $\\mathcal{S}_{2}$.

For a given set $\\mathcal{F} \\subset[r]$, we denote by $\\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ the subvector of $\\mathbf{g}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ collecting the components indexed by $\\mathcal{F}$. Analogously, let $\\overline{\\mathbf{g}}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}, \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=$ $\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\overline{\\mathbf{g}}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{V}}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{F}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})^{\\otimes 2}\\right\\}$. We also write $\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathcal{F}}$ as the corresponding subvector of vector a. Recall $f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left[\\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}\\right]-\\sum_{j=1}^{r} P_{\\nu}\\left(\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|\\right)$ and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\left\\{\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), \\ldots, \\hat{\\lambda}_{r}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}^{\\top}=$ $\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.

In particular, we have observed that when the prior is specified \"closer\" to the truth, the resulting estimator has better performance in comparison to the one using a non-informative prior. Conversely, if a prior is specified \"further away\" from the truth, the performance of the resulting estimator deteriorates and becomes less competitive.",

More specifically, we adopt the data generation process outlined in Section 3.1 with linear link function $\\hbar(v)=v$. As described in Section 3.3, we identify the true global minima $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3) through exhaustive search. Subsequently, we calculate its asymptotic covariance matrix $n^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}^{-1}$ with $\\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}$ defined as (12). We then generate 5000 samples, respectively, from the Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}, n^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}^{-1}\\right)$ and the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ defined as (7). To generate samples from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}, n^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}^{-1}\\right)$, we use the function mvrnorm in the R-package MASS. To generate samples from $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$, we use Algorithm 1 with the burn-in period of 1000 iterations. Based on these samples, we compute the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions $\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}, n^{-1} \\widehat{\\mathbf{H}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{n}}^{-1}\\right)$ and $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ using the function wasserstein in the R-package transport. Figure S1 below illustrates the average Wasserstein distance between the two distributions across different sample sizes $n$ under 500 replications. It can be observed that, the two distributions exhibit a relatively large differences at smaller sample sizes, with this distance diminishing notably as the sample size increases.\n\nWe further validate the efficacy of our proposed methods in approximating the true global minima $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ defined as (3). Table S5 below presents the measure $\\mathrm{MSE}=\\frac{1}{500} \\sum_{k=1}^{500}\\left|\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right|_{2}^{2}$ across different sample sizes $n$, where $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{k}$ is the mean of the 5000 samples drawn from the posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ in the $k$-th replication.

      "text": "# A. 4 Comparison of the Performance of Posteriors Derived by Different Methods \n\nIn this section, we conduct some additional numerical studies to further compare the performance of posteriors derived by different methods. Assume the observations $\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_{n}$ are drawn independently from the distribution $F\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ with some unknown parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$. The likelihood function admits the form $L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right)$ where $f(\\cdot ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is the density function of $F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. Write $\\mathcal{X}_{n}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_{n}\\right\\}$. Let $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$ represent a prior distribution for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. Then the traditional posterior is given by $\\pi^{\\mathrm{L}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. To estimate the unknown parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$, we can also identify it by $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}=\\mathbf{0}$ with some $r$-dimensional estimating function $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)$. For given estimating function $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)$, we can define the empirical likelihood $\\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and penalized empirical\n\nlikelihood $\\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, respectively, as (1) and (6) in the main paper. Hence, the associated ELbased posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\mathrm{EL}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ and PEL-based posterior distribution $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ satisfy $\\pi^{\\mathrm{EL}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{EL}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right) \\propto \\pi_{0}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\times \\operatorname{PEL}_{\\nu}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$. We select $\\pi_{0}(\\cdot)$ as the improper uniform prior and compare these three posteriors via the following two models:\n\n- Model I: Let $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ be independent and identically distributed observations from the normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\theta_{0}^{2}\\right)$ with $\\theta_{0}=1$. We can select $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)=\\left\\{g_{1}(\\cdot ; \\cdot), \\ldots, g_{r}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)\\}^{\\top} \\in\\right.$ $\\mathbb{R}^{r}$ with $g_{j}\\left(x_{i} ; \\theta\\right)=x_{i}^{2 j}-(2 j-1)!!\\theta^{2 j}$.\n- Model II: Consider the linear regression model $y_{i}=z_{i} \\theta_{0}+e_{i}, i \\in[n]$, where $\\theta_{0}=0.5$, $z_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is the covariate variable and $e_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,0.9)$ is the error orthogonal to $z_{i}$. We can select $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)=\\left\\{g_{1}(\\cdot ; \\cdot), \\ldots, g_{r}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)\\}^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}\\right.$ with $g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\theta\\right)=\\left(y_{i}-z_{i} \\theta\\right) z_{i}^{j}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left(y_{i}, z_{i}\\right)^{\\top}$.\n- Model III: Consider the generalized linear model where the covariates $z_{i}, i \\in[n]$, are drawn independently from the gamma distribution with shape parameter 2 and rate parameter 1. The response variables $y_{i}, i \\in[n]$, are generated from the Bernoulli distribution such that $\\mathbb{P}\\left(y_{i}=1 \\mid z_{i}\\right)=\\exp \\left(z_{i} \\theta_{0}\\right) /\\left\\{1+\\exp \\left(z_{i} \\theta_{0}\\right)\\right\\}$ with the true parameter $\\theta_{0}=0.2$. We can select $\\mathbf{g}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)=\\left\\{g_{1}(\\cdot ; \\cdot), \\ldots, g_{r}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)\\}^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}\\right.$ with $g_{j}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\theta\\right)=\\left[y_{i}-\\exp \\left(z_{i} \\theta\\right) /\\left\\{1+\\exp \\left(z_{i} \\theta\\right)\\right\\}\\right] z_{i}^{j}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{i}=\\left(y_{i}, z_{i}\\right)^{\\top}$.\n\nWe generate 5000 samples from each of these posterior distributions via the M-H algorithm with the burn-in period of 2000 iterations. Based on these samples, we compute the Wasserstein distances between $\\pi^{\\mathrm{L}}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ and $\\pi^{\\mathrm{EL}}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$, as well as between $\\pi^{\\mathrm{L}}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ and $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$, using the function wasserstein in the R-package transport. Figure S2 below illustrates the average Wasserstein distances between these posterior distributions across different sample sizes $n$ under 500 replications. Figures S3 and S4 show the density functions of $\\pi^{\\mathrm{L}}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right), \\pi^{\\mathrm{EL}}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ and $\\pi^{\\dagger}\\left(\\theta \\mid \\mathcal{X}_{n}\\right)$ across different sample sizes $n$ in one replication.\n\nOverall, the numerical results indicate that the posterior distributions constructed the (unpenalized) empirical likelihood without the penalty on the Lagrange multiplier exhibit significant discrepancies from those derived from the likelihood function. However, this disparity can be markedly reduced through the introduction of a penalty term on the Lagrange multipliers in the\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure S2: Comparison of the two average Wasserstein distances under 500 replications.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure S3: Comparison of the density functions of the posterior distributions derived by different methods with $r=50$.\nempirical likelihood.",

      "text": "# A. 5 Comparison to ABC and BSL \n\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our proposed methods with the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) methods, implemented as described below.\n\n- abc: The R function performs parameter estimation using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm in the R-package abc.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure S4: Comparison of the density functions of the posterior distributions derived by different methods with $r=70$.\n\n- bsl: The R function for performing Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) to sample from the approximate posterior distribution in the R-package BSL.\n\nWe conduct the comparisons using the same three models as described in Section A.4. Both the ABC and BSL methods require the selection of summary statistics. In our numerical experiments, for demonstration purposes, we chose sufficient statistics for the parameters of interest, thereby favoring the ABC and BSL methods. Specifically, for Model I, we selected the sample standard deviation as the summary statistic. For Models II and III, we selected the maximum likelihood\n\nestimator as the summary statistic.\n\nWhen implementing abc, we set the tolerance levels to $0.05,0.1$, and 0.2 to obtain 5000 valid approximate samples of the traditional posterior distributions for the three models. These tolerance levels correspond to $100,000,50,000$, and $25,000 \\mathrm{MCMC}$ iterations, respectively. The results are labeled as (abc-0.05, abc-0.1, abc-0.2). For bsl, we ran the MCMC sampler for 7000 iterations, discarding the first 2000 iterations for burn-in.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of abc and bsl, we used the wasserstein function from the R package transport to compute the Wasserstein distances between the approximate samples and those obtained directly via the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm from the traditional posterior distribution. For our PEL method, we report results for the case with $r=50$ and also evaluate the corresponding Wasserstein distances relative to those generated by the M-H algorithm. Figure S5 below presents the results, showing the average Wasserstein distances calculated for different sample sizes $n$ under 500 replications.\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure S5: Comparisons of the proposed method, ABC, and BSL. The average Wasserstein distances based on 500 replications are reported for the three models.\n\nOverall, the numerical results indicate that our proposed method, along with abc and bsl, effectively approximates the posterior distribution, with the accuracy of the approximation improving as the sample size $n$ increases. For smaller sample sizes, abc and bsl exhibit better accuracy. However, as the sample size $n$ grows, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving satisfactory approximation accuracy. Additionally, it is notable that the ABC method often requires significantly higher computational costs to achieve comparable\n\napproximation accuracy.\nHere, we also note that the settings favor the ABC and BSL methods in the choice of summary statistics, yet our method performs very competitively. Figure S6(b) presents results from a slightly modified setting of Model I, where the data generation process is changed from a normal distribution to a Student's $t$-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, and we are still interested in estimating the standard deviation parameter. In this case, the summary statistic based on the sample standard deviation for ABC and BSL is no longer sufficient. For side-by-side comparisons, the corresponding case with results from the normal distribution is shown in Figure S6(a). In this scenario, the performance of the PEL-based method is superior, demonstrating the compelling performance of our approach, owing to the merits of using empirical likelihood.\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nFigure S6: Estimating the standard deviation parameter with: (a) normal distribution, (b) Student's $t$-distribution",

      "text": "# B Discussion of the Technical Conditions \n\nConditions 1 and 2 are commonly used assumptions in the literature. Condition 1 is the identification condition for the unknown true parameter $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}$. A similar condition can be found in Shi (2016) and Chang et al. (2018). Condition 2(b) requires the covariance matrix of $\\mathbf{g}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ behaves reasonably well. Conditions 2(a) and 2(c) impose the moments requirements on each estimating function $g_{j}(\\cdot ; \\cdot)$ and its derivatives. If there exist functions $B_{l}(\\cdot)$ with $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{B_{l}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right)\\right\\}<\\infty, l=1,2,3$, such that $\\left|g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right|^{\\gamma} \\leq B_{1}(\\mathbf{x}),\\left|\\partial g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) / \\partial \\theta_{k}\\right|^{2} \\leq B_{2}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\left|\\partial^{2} g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) / \\partial \\theta_{k_{1}} \\partial \\theta_{k_{2}}\\right|^{2} \\leq B_{3}(\\mathbf{x})$ for\n\nany $j \\in[r]$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, then the second requirement in Condition 2(a) and the two requirements in Condition 2(c) hold automatically. More generally, if there exist functions $B_{l, j}(\\cdot)$ such that $\\left|g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right|^{\\gamma} \\leq B_{1, j}(\\mathbf{x}),\\left|\\partial g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) / \\partial \\theta_{k}\\right|^{2} \\leq B_{2, j}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\left|\\partial^{2} g_{j}(\\mathbf{x} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}) / \\partial \\theta_{k_{1}} \\partial \\theta_{k_{2}}\\right|^{2} \\leq B_{3, j}(\\mathbf{x})$ for any $j \\in[r]$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, and $\\max _{j \\in[r]} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\{B_{l, j}^{m}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right)\\right\\} \\leq K m!H^{m-2}$ for any $m \\geq 2$ and $l=1,2,3$ with two universal constants $K, H>0$, it follows from Theorem 2.8 of Petrov (1995) that the second requirement in Condition 2(a) and the two requirements in Condition 2(c) hold automatically provided $\\log (r p)=o(n)$. In fact, the order $O_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)$ in Conditions 2(a) and 2(c) can be replaced by $O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\varpi_{n}\\right)$ with some diverging sequence $\\varpi_{n}$, and our main results remain valid. We use $O_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)$ here for ease of presentation. To establish the consistency of the penalized empirical likelihood estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$, Conditions 1, 2(a) and 2(b) are needed. Condition 2(c) is needed for establishing the asymptotic normality of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$.\n\nCondition 3 is standard in the literature. Due to the penalty imposed on the Lagrange multiplier $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ involved in the optimization (3), the standard theoretical analysis of empirical likelihood cannot be applied here. Condition 4(a) is a technical assumption used to derive the convergence rate of the Lagrange multiplier $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)} f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)$ associated with $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$; see the proof of Lemma 3 in the supplementary material for details. Condition 4(b) requires that each $\\hat{\\eta}_{j}$ $\\left(j \\in \\mathcal{R}_{n}^{c}\\right)$ lies in the interior of $\\left[-\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right), \\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)\\right]$with probability approaching one, which is realistic in practice. If the distribution function of the random variable $\\hat{\\eta}_{j}$ is continuous at $\\pm \\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)$, we then have $\\mathbb{P}\\left\\{\\left|\\hat{\\eta}_{j}\\right|=\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)\\right\\}=0$. Condition 4 makes sure that $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is continuously differentiable at $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}$ with probability approaching one; see Lemma 4 in Section D.\n\nCondition 5(a) guarantees that the Lagrange multiplier $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1}$ satisfies two properties: (i) $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is continuously differentiable on $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ with probability approaching one, and (ii) $\\mathcal{R}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=$ $\\mathcal{R}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right)$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{1}$ with probability approaching one; see Lemmas 9 and 10 in Section F. When $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\notin \\mathcal{C}_{1}$, characterizing the asymptotic property of $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is quite challenging. Due to $f_{n}\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\} \\geq f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, a feasible strategy to construct the lower bound of $f_{n}\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\}$ with $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\notin \\mathcal{C}_{1}$ is to find a specific $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and then derive the lower bound of $f_{n}\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right\\}$ directly, where the asymptotic behavior of $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ can be well characterized even if $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\notin \\mathcal{C}_{1}$. Such strategy has been also used in Chang et al. $(2013,2016)$ to study the diverging rate\n\nof the conventional empirical likelihood ratio evaluated at a value not near the truth. In current setting, Condition 5(b) is applied to derive the lower bound of $f_{n}\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right\\}$ for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{2}$; see Section F. 2 for details. Condition 5(c) says that the sample covariance matrix of the estimating function and the gradient of the estimating function should behave reasonably well, which will be used to obtain the lower bound of $f_{n}\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{*}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\right\\}$ for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{3}$. See Section F. 3 for details. Condition 6 is a standard assumption concerning the prior distribution.",

To do this, we need the following two lemmas whose proofs are given in Sections J. 1 and J.2, respectively.\n\nLemma 1.

Let $\\log r=o\\left(n^{1 / 3}\\right), \\ell_{n} \\alpha_{n}=o\\left[\\min \\left\\{\\nu, n^{-1 / \\gamma}\\right\\}\\right]$, and $P_{\\nu}(\\cdot) \\in \\mathscr{P}$ be a convex function for $\\mathscr{P}$ defined in (4). Assume Conditions 2(a) and 2(b) hold. For any $c \\in\\left(C_{*}, 1\\right)$, the global maximizer $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ for $f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ w.r.t $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ satisfies $\\operatorname{supp}\\left\\{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{M}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}}(c)$ w.p.a.1.\n\nDefine $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}^{\\prime}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)} A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\right)$ with $A_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{\\eta})=\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left[\\log \\left\\{1+\\boldsymbol{\\eta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{R}_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}\\right]$. By Lemma 2, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{0}\\right| \\leq \\ell_{n}$ w.p.a.1. Pick $\\delta_{n}$ satisfying $\\delta_{n}=o\\left(\\ell_{n}^{-1 / 2} n^{-1 / \\gamma}\\right)$ and $\\ell_{n}^{1 / 2} \\alpha_{n}=o\\left(\\delta_{n}\\right)$ for $\\gamma$ defined in Condition 2(a), which can be guaranteed by $\\ell_{n} \\alpha_{n}=o\\left(n^{-1 / \\gamma}\\right)$. Let $\\Lambda_{0}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\left|\\mathcal{R}_{0}\\right|}:|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}|_{2} \\leq \\delta_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\arg \\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\Lambda_{0}} A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\right)$. Condition 2(a) implies $\\max _{i \\in[n], \\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\Lambda_{0}}\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right|=o_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)$. Then, by the Taylor expansion, we have\n\n$$\n0=A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\mathbf{0}\\right) \\leq A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}\\right)=\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{\\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2 n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)^{\\oplus 2} \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}}{\\left\\{1+C \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}^{2}}\n$$\n\nfor some $C \\in(0,1)$. By Condition 2(b) and the same arguments for deriving Lemma 1, if $\\log r=$ $o\\left(n^{1 / 3}\\right)$ and $\\ell_{n} \\alpha_{n}=o(1)$, we have $\\lambda_{\\min }\\left\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}_{\\mathcal{M}_{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{0}}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}$ is uniformly bounded away from zero w.p.a.1. Thus $0 \\leq|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}|_{2}\\left|\\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right|_{2}-4^{-1} K_{3}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}|_{2}^{2}\\left\\{1+o_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)\\right\\}$ w.p.a.1, where $K_{3}$ is specified in Condition 2(b). By the moderate deviation of self-normalized sums (Jing et al., 2003), we have $\\left|\\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right|_{\\infty}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\alpha_{n}\\right)$, which implies $\\left|\\tilde{\\mathbf{g}}_{\\mathcal{R}_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right|_{2}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\ell_{n}^{1 / 2} \\alpha_{n}\\right)$ and $|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}|_{2}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\ell_{n}^{1 / 2} \\alpha_{n}\\right)=o_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\delta_{n}\\right)$. Hence, $\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} \\in \\operatorname{int}\\left(\\Lambda_{0}\\right)$ w.p.a.1. Since $\\Lambda_{0} \\subset \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}^{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ w.p.a.1, we have $\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}=\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}$ w.p.a. 1 by the concavity of $A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\right)$ w.r.t $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$. Then $\\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}^{1}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)} A_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}, \\boldsymbol{\\eta}\\right)=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\ell_{n} \\alpha_{n}^{2}\\right)$. Let $b_{n}^{2}=\\ell_{n} \\alpha_{n}^{2}$ and $F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\max _{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})} f_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$. Due to $\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}=\\arg \\min _{\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}} F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, we have $F_{n}\\left(\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}\\right) \\leq F_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(b_{n}^{2}\\right)$.\n\nOur second step is to show that for any $\\epsilon_{n} \\rightarrow \\infty$ satisfying $b_{n}^{2} \\epsilon_{n}^{2} n^{2 / \\gamma}=o(1)$, there exists a universal constant $K>0$ independent of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ such that $\\mathbb{P}\\left\\{F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})>K b_{n}^{2} \\epsilon_{n}^{2}\\right\\} \\rightarrow 1$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ for any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ satisfying $\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}-\\left.\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{\\infty}>\\epsilon_{n} \\nu\\right.$. Thus $\\left|\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}-\\left.\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{\\infty}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(\\epsilon_{n} \\nu\\right)\\right.$. Due to $b_{n}^{2}=o\\left(n^{-2 / \\gamma}\\right)$, we can select arbitrary slowly diverging $\\epsilon_{n}$. We then have $\\left|\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{n}-\\left.\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{\\infty}=O_{\\mathrm{p}}(\\nu)\\right.$ by a standard result from probability theory. For any $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$ satisfying $\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}-\\left.\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right|_{\\infty}>\\epsilon_{n} \\nu\\right.$, let $j_{0}=\\arg \\max _{j \\in[r]}\\left|\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{g_{i, j}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}\\right|$ and $\\mu_{j_{0}}=\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{g_{i, j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}$. Define $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}=\\tau b_{n} \\epsilon_{n} \\mathbf{e}_{j_{0}}$, where $\\tau>0$ is a constant to be determined later and $\\mathbf{e}_{j_{0}}$ is an $r$-dimensional vector with the $j_{0}$-th component being 1 and other components being 0 . Without loss of generality, we assume $\\mu_{j_{0}}>0$. Condition 2(a) implies $\\max _{i \\in[n]}\\left|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right|=$ $O_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(b_{n} \\epsilon_{n} n^{1 / \\gamma}\\right)=o_{\\mathrm{p}}(1)$. Then $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}} \\in \\hat{\\Lambda}_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ w.p.a.1. Write $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}=\\left(\\tilde{\\lambda}_{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{\\lambda}_{r}\\right)^{\\top}$. By the Taylor expansion, it holds w.p.a. 1 that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\geq \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log \\left\\{1+\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}-P_{\\nu}\\left(\\left|\\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}}\\right|\\right) & \\geq \\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}} \\bar{g}_{j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})-\\frac{1}{2 n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\left\\{\\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}} g_{i, j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}^{2}}{\\left\\{1+\\bar{C} \\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}} g_{i, j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}^{2}}-C \\nu \\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}} \\\\\n& \\geq \\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}} \\bar{g}_{j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})-\\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}}^{2} \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{g_{i, j_{0}}^{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}-C \\nu \\tilde{\\lambda}_{j_{0}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor some $\\bar{C} \\in(0,1)$, which implies\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left\\{F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\leq K b_{n}^{2} \\epsilon_{n}^{2}\\right\\} \\leq \\mathbb{P}\\left\\{\\bar{g}_{j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})-\\mu_{j_{0}} \\leq b_{n} \\epsilon_{n}\\left[K \\tau^{-1}+\\tau \\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{g_{i, j_{0}}^{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}\\right]+C \\nu-\\mu_{j_{0}}\\right\\}+o(1)\n$$\n\nFrom Condition 2(a) and Jensen's inequality, there exists a universal constant $L>0$ independent of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ such that $\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{n}\\left\\{g_{i, j_{0}}^{2}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\right\\}>L\\right] \\rightarrow 0$. Taking $\\tau=\\left(K L^{-1}\\right)^{1 / 2}$, we obtain $\\mathbb{P}\\left\\{F_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\leq K b_{n}^{2} \\epsilon_{n}^{2}\\right\\} \\leq$ $\\mathbb{P}\\left\\{\\bar{g}_{j_{0}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})-\\mu_{j_{0}} \\leq 2 b_{n} \\epsilon_{n}(K L)^{1 / 2}+C \\nu-\\mu_{j_{0}}\\right\\}+o(1)$.

Then $\\bar{\\lambda}_{j_{0}}=0$ w.p.a.1, which implies $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{0}=\\mathbf{0}$ w.p.a.1. In the sequel, we will show that $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{0}$ is a local maximizer for $f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ w.p.a.1.\n\nFirstly, define $\\check{\\Lambda}_{0}^{*}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r}:\\left|\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathcal{H}}\\right|_{2} \\leq \\varepsilon, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_{\\mathcal{H}^{c}}=\\mathbf{0}\\right\\}$ for some sufficiently small constant $\\varepsilon>0$, where $j_{0} \\in \\mathcal{H} \\subset[r]$ with $1<|\\mathcal{H}| \\leq \\ell_{n}$.

Restricted on $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} \\in \\check{\\Lambda}_{0}^{*}$, by the concavity of $f_{n}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} ; \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)$ w.r.t $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$, it suffices to show that $\\check{\\mathbf{w}}=\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{0, \\mathcal{H}}=:\\left(\\breve{w}_{1}, \\ldots, \\breve{w}_{|\\mathcal{H}|}\\right)^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{H}|}$ satisfies the equation\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{0}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{H}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)}{1+\\check{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{H}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)}-\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}^{*}\n$$\n\nw.p.a.1, where $\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}^{*}=\\left(\\check{\\eta}_{1}^{*}, \\ldots, \\check{\\eta}_{|\\mathcal{H}|}^{*}\\right)^{\\top}$ with $\\check{\\eta}_{j}^{*}=\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(\\left|\\breve{w}_{j}\\right| ; \\nu\\right) \\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\breve{w}_{j}\\right)$ for $\\breve{w}_{j} \\neq 0$ and $\\check{\\eta}_{j}^{*} \\in\\left[-\\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right), \\nu \\rho^{\\prime}\\left(0^{+}\\right)\\right]$ for $\\breve{w}_{j}=0$. Recall $j_{0} \\in \\mathcal{H}$. Without loss of generality, we assume $j_{0}$ is the first component in $\\mathcal{H}$. By (J.5), we know $0=n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_{i, j_{0}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right) /\\left\\{1+\\check{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{H}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\\right\\}-\\check{\\eta}_{1}^{*}$ holds. Since $\\check{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}_{0}=\\mathbf{0}$ w.p.a.1, then $\\check{\\mathbf{w}}=\\mathbf{0}$ w.p.a.1, which implies it holds w.p.a. 1 that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{g_{i, j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)}{1+\\check{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\top} \\mathbf{g}_{i, \\mathcal{H}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)}=\\check{g}_{j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nfor any $j \\in \\mathcal{H} \\backslash\\left\\{j_{0}\\right\\}$.

  "abstract": "In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework called Bayesian\nPenalized Empirical Likelihood (BPEL), designed to address the computational\nchallenges inherent in empirical likelihood (EL) approaches. Our approach has\ntwo primary objectives: (i) to enhance the inherent flexibility of EL in\naccommodating diverse model conditions, and (ii) to facilitate the use of\nwell-established Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling schemes as a\nconvenient alternative to the complex optimization typically required for\nstatistical inference using EL. To achieve the first objective, we propose a\npenalized approach that regularizes the Lagrange multipliers, significantly\nreducing the dimensionality of the problem while accommodating a comprehensive\nset of model conditions. For the second objective, our study designs and\nthoroughly investigates two popular sampling schemes within the BPEL context.\nWe demonstrate that the BPEL framework is highly flexible and efficient,\nenhancing the adaptability and practicality of EL methods. Our study highlights\nthe practical advantages of using sampling techniques over traditional\noptimization methods for EL problems, showing rapid convergence to the global\noptima of posterior distributions and ensuring the effective resolution of\ncomplex statistical inference challenges.",
