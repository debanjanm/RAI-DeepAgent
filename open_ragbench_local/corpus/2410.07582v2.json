Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data was used to train a model. They offer valuable insights into detecting data contamination and ensuring compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, MIA for LLMs is challenging due to the massive scale of training data and the inherent ambiguity of membership in texts. Moreover, creating realistic MIA evaluation benchmarks is difficult as training and test data distributions are often unknown. We introduce EM-MIA, a novel membership inference method that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectationmaximization algorithm. Our approach leverages the observation that these scores can improve each other: membership scores help identify effective prefixes for detecting training data, while prefix scores help determine membership. As a result, EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiMIA. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows controlling task difficulty through varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. Our experiments demonstrate EM-MIA is robust across different scenarios while also revealing fundamental limitations of current MIA approaches when member and non-member distributions are nearly identical.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 1, "text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023b) have emerged as a groundbreaking development and have had a transformative impact across various domains. Vast and diverse training data are central to their success, which enables LLMs to understand and generate comprehensive language combined with the\n\n[^0]ability to generalize to perform in complex tasks. Understanding the composition of training data is crucial for assessing the strengths and limitations of LLMs (Gebru et al., 2021), addressing ethical concerns, and mitigating potential biases (Bender et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2023) and other risks (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, the exact composition of training data is often a secret ingredient of LLMs except recent efforts to make LLMs transparent like OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024).\n\nSince LLMs are trained on large-scale corpora from diverse sources, including web content, undesirable data such as test datasets (Sainz et al., 2023; Oren et al., 2023; Sainz et al., 2024), proprietary contents (Chang et al., 2023; Meeus et al., 2024c), or personally identifiable information (Mozes et al., 2023) may unintentionally be included, raising serious concerns when deploying LLMs. Membership inference attack (MIA) attempts to determine whether a particular data point has been seen during training a target model (Shokri et al., 2017). Using MIA to uncover those potential instances can serve as an effective mechanism in detecting data contamination (Magar and Schwartz, 2022) for the reliable evaluation of LLMs' ability (Zhou et al., 2023) and auditing copyright infringement (Duarte et al., 2024) and privacy leakage (Staab et al., 2023; Kandpal et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024) to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR (Voigt and Von dem Bussche, 2017) and CCPA (Legislature, 2018). Therefore, MIA has gained huge interest in the LLM community.\n\nDespite increasing demands, MIA for LLMs is challenging (Duan et al., 2024) largely due to the large scale of training data and intrinsic ambiguity of membership from the nature of languages. Furthermore, designing a proper evaluation benchmark on MIAs for LLMs that emulates realistic test scenarios is complex. While training data comes from a mix of diverse and unknown sources, test data at inference time could be from any distribution. This\n\n\n[^0]:    *Work done during an internship at AWS AI Labs\n    ${ }^{\\dagger}$ Work done while at AWS AI Labs\n\nmotivates us to develop a robust MIA method that works well across varying distributions of members and non-members with minimal assumptions.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel MIA framework, EM-MIA, which iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores using an expectationmaximization algorithm. A membership score indicates how likely each data point is a member. A prefix score indicates its effectiveness in distinguishing members from non-members when used as a prefix. We empirically observe a duality between these scores, where improved estimation of one enhances the other. By starting from a reasonable initialization, our iterative approach progressively enhances score predictions until convergence, leading to more accurate membership scores for MIA.\n\nTo comprehensively evaluate our method and different MIA approaches, we introduce a new benchmark called OLMoMIA by utilizing OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024) resources. We control difficulty levels by varying distributional overlaps using clustering techniques. Throughout the extensive experiments, we have shown that EM-MIA is a versatile MIA method and significantly outperforms previous strong baselines, though all methods, including ours, still struggle to surpass random guessing in the most challenging random split setting.\n\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows. To the best of our knowledge, EM-MIA is the first approach that iteratively refines membership and prefix scores to improve MIA for LLMs. We demonstrate that ReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024) has an over-reliance on prefix selection, while EMMIA is designed to work without labeled data or benchmark-specific prior knowledge. EM-MIA remarkably outperforms all existing strong MIA baselines for LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on WikiMIA (Shi et al., 2023), the most popular benchmark for detecting LLM pre-training data. Experiments on our OLMoMIA highlight EM-MIA's robustness across diverse distributional conditions and underscore the importance of evaluating MIA methods under varied scenarios.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 2, "text": "## 2 Background\n### 2.1 Membership Inference Attack for LLMs\n\nMembership inference attack (MIA) (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2022) aims to determine whether specific data was used to train a model: member vs. non-member. Formally, given a target language model $\\mathcal{M}$ trained on an unknown $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {train }}$,\n\nMIA predicts a membership label of each instance $x$ in a test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$ whether $x$ in $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {train }}$ or not, by computing a membership score $f(x ; \\mathcal{M})$ and applying a threshold. The trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate is controlled by the threshold. The performance is mainly evaluated with AUC-ROC and TPR@low FPR metrics (Carlini et al., 2022; Mireshghallah et al., 2022).\n\nExisting MIA methods are generally based on the assumption that models memorize or overfit their training data. The most basic approach uses the average log-likelihood (or perplexity) of text with respect to the target model, based on the observation that members typically have lower loss (Yeom et al., 2018). Likelihood Ratio Attacks (LiRAs) (Ye et al., 2022) calibrate difficulty using reference models (Carlini et al., 2022), compression methods (Carlini et al., 2021), or averaging neighbors (Mattern et al., 2023). Min-K\\% (Shi et al., 2023) focuses on tokens with lowest likelihoods, and Min-K\\%++ (Zhang et al., 2024) extends this approach with token-level probability normalization. ReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024), which we describe in detail in $\\S 2.4$, uses the ratio of conditional and unconditional log-likelihoods as the membership score.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "### 2.2 Challenges in MIA for LLMs\n\nMIA for LLMs faces several unique challenges that make it particularly difficult (Duan et al., 2024; Meeus et al., 2024b). First, due to the massive training dataset size, each instance is used in training only a few times, often just once (Lee et al., 2021), making it harder to leave detectable footprints in the model. Second, there is inherent ambiguity in defining membership for text data. Texts naturally repeat and partially overlap even after decontamination and deduplication efforts (Kandpal et al., 2022; Tirumala et al., 2024), and minor variations or paraphrases create fuzzy membership boundaries (Shilov et al., 2024; Mattern et al., 2023; Mozaffari and Marathe, 2024). Traditional MIA approaches (Shokri et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2022; Carlini et al., 2022) that rely on training shadow models are infeasible for LLMs due to prohibitive computational costs, unknown training specifications, and the difficulty of obtaining non-overlapping training data from the same distribution. These constraints have necessitated new approaches specifically designed for LLMs.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 4, "text": "### 2.3 Evaluation Challenges and Benchmarks\n\nCurrent benchmarks generally fall into two categories. Benchmarks like WikiMIA (Shi et al., 2023; Meeus et al., 2024a) use model release dates and time information of documents to determine membership, but this approach may conflate membership inference with distribution shift detection (Das et al., 2024; Meeus et al., 2024b; Maini et al., 2024). In contrast, benchmarks like MIMIR (Duan et al., 2024) use random splits to create nearly identical distributions between members and non-members. In these cases, no existing methods significantly outperform random guessing.\n\nWhile training data typically comes from diverse sources, test data at inference time could be from any distribution. This makes it crucial to evaluate the robustness of MIA methods across different distributional scenarios. The practical challenges of benchmark creation are compounded by the limited availability of true non-member data and the difficulty of controlling test conditions. There is a clear need for benchmarks that can simulate various realworld scenarios while maintaining reliable ground truth membership labels (Meeus et al., 2024b; Eichler et al., 2024).", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 5, "text": "### 2.4 ReCaLL: Assumptions and Limitations\n\nReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024) uses the ratio between the conditional log-likelihood of a target data point $x$ given a non-member prefix $p$ as a context and the unconditional log-likelihood of $x$ by an LLM $\\mathcal{M}$ as a membership score, based on the observation that the distribution of ReCaLL scores for members and non-members diverges when $p$ is a non-member prefix: formally, $\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x ; \\mathcal{M})=$ $\\mathrm{LL}(x \\mid p ; \\mathcal{M}) / \\mathrm{LL}(x ; \\mathcal{M})$ (we may omit $\\mathcal{M}$ later, for brevity), where LL is the average log-likelihood over tokens and the prefix $p^{1}$ is a concatenation of non-member data points $p_{i}: p=p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus p_{n}$. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of members drops a lot when conditioned with non-members from an in-context learning point of view (Aky\u00fcrek et al., 2022), while the log-likelihood of nonmembers does not change much.\n\nReCaLL significantly outperforms other MIA approaches by a large margin. For instance, ReCaLL exceeds 90\\% AUC-ROC on WikiMIA (Shi et al., 2023) beating previous state-of-the-art AUCROC of about $75 \\%$ from Min-K\\%++ (Zhang et al.,\n\n[^0]2024). However, there is no theoretical analysis of why and when ReCaLL works well.\n\nXie et al. (2024) randomly select non-members $p_{i}$ among non-members in a test dataset and exclude them from the test dataset without validation, based on strong assumptions that (1) the ground truth non-members are available and (2) all of them are equally effective as a prefix. However, the heldout ground truth non-members, especially from the same distribution of the test set, may not always be available at inference time. This aligns with the discussion in the previous section \u00a72.3. With recent advancements in computation and availability of crawled data, LLMs are trained on larger data set sizes (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Dubey et al., 2024). The determination of non-members is therefore increasingly difficult (Villalobos et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2024). Xie et al. (2024) generates a synthetic prefix using GPT-4o to secure non-members. However, according to their implementation, this method still relies on non-member test data as seed data.\n\nSelecting non-members from the test dataset makes ReCaLL advantageous but unfair compared to other MIAs that do not utilize any non-member test data. It partially explains why simple random selection reasonably works well. Xie et al. (2024) conduct the ablation study to demonstrate the robustness of the random prefix selection, which ironically reveals that ReCaLL's performance can be damaged when we do not have known non-member data points from the test dataset distribution. Using non-members from a different domain (e.g., GitHub vs. Wikipedia) significantly degrades ReCaLL's performance, sometimes even worse than Min-K\\%++. In other words, ReCaLL would not generalize well to test data from a distribution different from that of the prefix. The similarity between the prefix and test data also matters. Another ablation study shows a variance between different random selections, implying that random prefix selection is inconsistent and that all data points are not equally effective for the prefix.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 6, "text": "## 3 Observation: Finding a Better Prefix\n\nIn this section, we rigorously investigate how much ReCaLL's performance is sensitive to the choice of a prefix and particularly how much it can be compromised without given non-member data. We define a prefix score $r(p)$ as the effectiveness of $p$ as a prefix in discriminating memberships, partic-\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ As an extension from using a single prefix $p$, averaging the ReCaLL scores on a set of multiple prefixes is possible for an ensemble.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Histogram of prefix scores for members and non-members measured by AUC-ROC in the Oracle setting on the WikiMIA dataset (Shi et al., 2023) with a length of 128 and Pythia-6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023).\nularly when using this prefix for ReCaLL. In the Oracle setting where ground truth labels of all examples in a test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$ are available, we can calculate a prefix score by measuring the performance of ReCaLL with a prefix $p$ on a test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$ using ground truth labels and a MIA evaluation metric such as AUC-ROC. While a prefix could be any text, we calculate prefix scores for all examples in a test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$ by using each data point as a standalone prefix.\n\nAs an initial analysis, we conduct experiments using the WikiMIA (Shi et al., 2023) dataset with a length of 128 as a target dataset and Pythia6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023) as a target LM. Figure 1 displays the distribution of prefix scores measured by AUC-ROC for members and nonmembers. Consistent with the results from (Xie et al., 2024), ReCaLL works well if a prefix is a non-member and does not work well if a prefix is a member. Prefix scores of members are smaller than 0.7 , and most of them are close to 0.5 , which is the score of random guessing. Prefix scores of non-members are larger than 0.5 , and most of them are larger than 0.7 . This clear distinguishability suggests using a negative prefix score as a membership score. Appendix B includes results on using metrics for prefix scores other than AUC-ROC.\n\nWithout access to non-members (or data points with high prefix scores), ReCaLL's performance could be significantly lower. Given the wide spectrum of prefix scores for even non-members, the effectiveness of each data point varies, and the choice of data points for a prefix can be crucial, although using a concatenation of multiple data points as a prefix reduces variance. In other words, we can expect better MIA performance by carefully selecting the prefix. Ultimately, it is desirable to find an optimal prefix $p$ without any information or access to given ground truth non-member data points on the test set.\n\nContrary to the Oracle setting, labels which are what should be predicted are unknown at inference time, meaning that we cannot directly use labels to calculate prefix scores. In the next section \u00a74, we describe how our method addresses this problem by iteratively updating membership scores and prefix scores based on one another.

{"section_id": 7, "text": "## 4 Proposed Method: EM-MIA\n\nWe target the realistic MIA scenario where test data labels are unavailable. We measure a prefix score by how $\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}$ on a test dataset $D_{\\text {test }}$ aligns well with the current estimates of membership scores $f$ on $D_{\\text {test }}$ denoted as $S\\left(\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}, f, D_{\\text {test }}\\right)$. More accurate membership scores can help compute more accurate prefix scores. Conversely, more accurate prefix scores can help compute more accurate membership scores. Based on this duality, we propose an iterative algorithm to refine membership scores and prefix scores via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, called EM-MIA, to perform MIA with minimal assumptions on test data (\u00a72.4).\n\nAlgorithm 1 summarizes the overall procedure of EM-MIA. We begin with an initial assignment of membership scores using any existing off-the-shelf MIA method such as Loss (Yeom et al., 2018) or Min-K\\%++ (Zhang et al., 2024) (Line 1). We calculate prefix scores $r(p)$ using membership scores and then update membership scores $f(x)$ using prefix scores. The update rule of prefix scores (Line 3) and membership scores (Line 4) is a design choice. We repeat this process iteratively until convergence (Line 5). Since EM-MIA is a general framework, all components, including initialization, score update rules, datasets (e.g., Appendix A), and stopping criteria, are subject to modification for further improvement.\n\nUpdate Rule for Prefix Scores Our observation in $\\S 3$ shows that AUC-ROC is an effective function $S$ to calculate prefix scores given ground truth labels. Because we do not have labels, we can assign membership labels using the current membership scores $f$ and a threshold $\\tau$", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "## Algorithm 1 EM-MIA\n\nInput: Target LLM $\\mathcal{M}$, Test dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$\nOutput: Membership scores $f(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$\n1: Initialize $f(x)$ with an existing off-the-shelf MIA method\n2: repeat\n3: Update prefix scores $r(p)=S\\left(\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}, f, \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}\\right)$ for $p \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$\n4: Update membership scores $f(x)=-r(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n5: until Convergence (no significant difference in $f$ )\nto use them as pseudo labels to calculate prefix scores: $\\operatorname{AUC}-\\operatorname{ROC}\\left(\\left\\{\\left(\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x), \\mathbf{1}_{f(x)>\\tau} \\mid x \\in\\right.\\right.\\right.$ $\\left.\\left.\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}\\right)\\right\\}$ ). We can choose $\\tau$ as a specific percentile (e.g., a median ( $50 \\%$ percentile) because a test dataset is usually balanced) in the score distributions to decide the portion of members and nonmembers. Instead of approximating hard labels, we can compare the ranks of $\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x)$ and the ranks of $f(x)$ on $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$ with a measure like the average difference $\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}}\\left\\|\\operatorname{rank}\\left(\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x)\\right)-\\right.$ $\\operatorname{rank}(f(x)) \\|$ or rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's tau (Kendall, 1938) and Spearman's rho (Spearman, 1961).\n\nUpdate Rule for Membership Scores Our observation in $\\S 3$ shows that a negative prefix score can be used as a good membership score. Alternatively, we can choose candidates with top- $k$ prefix scores to construct a prefix and calculate membership scores using ReCaLL with this prefix: $f(x)=\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x)$ where $p=p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus p_{n}$ and $p_{i} \\in \\operatorname{argtopk}_{x \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}} r(x)$.

{"section_id": 9, "text": "## 5 New Benchmark: OLMoMIA\n\nEM-MIA works well and even performs almost perfectly on some benchmarks such as WikiMIA (Shi et al., 2023) (\\$7.1), while it does not work well on other datasets such as MIMIR (Duan et al., 2024) similar to other methods. We want to know why this is the case and what are the conditions for success. To answer these questions, we develop a new benchmark using OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), which is a series of fully open language models pretrained with Dolma (Soldaini et al., 2024) dataset. OLMo provides intermediate model checkpoints and an index to get which data has been used for each training step, which are valuable resources to\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2: The basic setup of OLMoMIA benchmark. The horizontal line indicates a training step. For any intermediate checkpoint at a specific step, we can consider training data before and after that step as members and non-members, respectively.\nconstruct an MIA benchmark. We will share our implementation and resulting benchmark datasets. Like us, anyone can create their own benchmark on their purpose by modifying our implementation.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the basic setup of the OLMoMIA benchmark. Specifically, we use checkpoints of OLMo-7B trained with 100k, 200k, 300k, and 400k steps as target models (c.f., one epoch is slightly larger than 450k steps). Then, we consider any training data before 100k steps as members and any training data between 400k and 450k steps as non-members. However, we should keep in mind that there could still be some ambiguity in membership despite the effort of deduplication, as discussed in $\\S 2.2$. Based on this setup, we have multiple settings with different samplings.\n\nThe basic setting is Random, where we randomly select members and non-members from each interval. This setting is similar to MIMIR (Duan et al., 2024), where members and non-members are from the training split and test split of the Pile dataset (Gao et al., 2020), respectively. MIMIR is much more challenging than WikiMIA since the training set and test set are randomly split and thus have minimal distribution shifts.\n\nBased on clustering, we control the degree of overlap between the distribution of members and non-members, resulting in different difficulties. First, we sample enough numbers of members and non-members (in our case, 50k each). Next, we map sampled data into embedding vectors. We use NV-Embed-v2 model (Lee et al., 2024), which was\n\nthe first rank on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2022) as of Aug 30, 2024, for the embedding model. Then, we perform K-means clustering (Lloyd, 1982) for members and non-members separately (in our case, we use $K=50$ ).\n\nTo prevent datasets from degeneration that have duplicates with a very minor difference, we remove data points closer than a certain distance threshold with other points within a cluster in a greedy manner to guarantee all data points in the same cluster are not too close to each other. Empirically, we observed that most pair distances measured by cosine distance range from 0.8 to 1.2 , so we set 0.6 as the minimum inter-distance for deduplication.\n\nFor the Easy setting, we pick the farthest pair of a member cluster and a non-member cluster and pick instances farthest from the opposite cluster. For the Hard setting, we pick the closest pair of a member cluster and a non-member cluster and pick instances closest to the opposite cluster. For the Medium setting, we pick the pair of a member cluster and a non-member cluster with a median distance and randomly sampled instances within each cluster.\n\nAdditionally, we merge members from Random and non-members from Hard to create the Mix-1 setting and merge members from Hard and nonmembers from Random to create the Mix-2 setting. Mix-1 aims to simulate the case where test data come from a single cluster. Thus, any cluster might be fine, but we choose Hard with no specific reason. These settings cover almost all possible inclusion relationships between members and non-members.\n\nWe provide formal equations of the above descriptions in Appendix D.

Alternatively, we may use ReCaLL-based methods that do not rely on any labels like Avg, AvgP, or Rand. For the update rule for prefix scores, we use AUCROC as a default scoring function $S$. For the update rule for membership scores, we use negative prefix scores as new membership scores. For the stopping criterion, we repeat ten iterations and stop without thresholding by the score difference since we observed that membership scores and prefix scores converge quickly after a few iterations. We also observed that EM-MIA is not sensitive to the choice of the initialization method and the scoring function $S$ and converges to similar results.

EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art performance on WikiMIA for all different models and length splits, significantly outperforming all baselines, including ReCaLL, even without any given non-member test data. EMMIA exceeds 96\\% AUC-ROC in all cases. For the largest model OPT-66B, EM-MIA gets 99\\% AUCROC for length splits 32 and 64, while ReCaLL's performance is lower than 86\\% AUC-ROC.\n\nAll baselines without ReCaLL-based approaches achieve lower than 76\\% AUC-ROC on average across different models. The relative order between ReCaLL-based baselines is consistent over different settings: RandM $<$ Avg, AvgP $<$ Rand $<$ RandNM $<$ TopPref. This trend clearly shows that ReCaLL is sensitive to the choice of the prefix. Particularly, the large gap between RandMand\n\nRand versus RandNM shows that ReCaLL is highly dependent on the availability of given nonmembers. RandNM is similar to the original ReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024) in most cases except for the OPT-66B model and LLaMA models with sequence length 128, probably because $n=12$ is not optimal for these cases. Among these, Rand does not use any labels, so it is fair to compare with other baselines, and it performs worse than Min-K\\%++ on average. This result again shows that ReCaLL is not strong enough without given non-members.\n\nTopPref consistently outperforms RandNM, indicating that random prefix selection is definitely not sufficiently good and there is room for better MIA performance by prefix optimization (Shin et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023). Although the search space of the prefix is exponentially large and the calculation of prefix scores without labels is nontrivial, a prefix score could be a good measure to choose data points to construct the prefix. EM-MIA approximates prefix scores and uses them to refine membership scores.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 16, "text": "### 7.2 OLMoMIA\n\nTable 2 and Table 4 show the experimental results on OLMoMIA ${ }^{3}$, with the metric of AUC-ROC and TPR@1\\%FPR respectively. EM-MIA achieves almost perfect scores on Easy and Medium similar to WikiMIA, gets performance comparable to random guessing performance on Hard and Random similar to MIMIR, and gets reasonably good scores on Mix-1 and Mix-2, though not perfect as on Easy and Medium. EM-MIA significantly outperforms all baselines in all settings except Hard and Random, where distributions of members and non-members heavily overlap to each other and all methods are not sufficiently better than random guessing.\n\nNone of the baselines without ReCaLL-based approaches are successful in all settings, which implies that OLMoMIA is a challenging benchmark. The relative order between ReCaLL-based baselines is again consistent over different settings: RandM $<$ Avg, AvgP, Rand $<$ RandNM $<$ TopPref, though all methods that do not use any labels fail to be successful. Interestingly, RandNM works reasonably well on Mix-1 but does not work well on Mix-2. This is because nonmembers from Mix-1 are from the same cluster\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ We report average scores over four intermediate OLMo checkpoints because there was no significant difference in the MIA performance for different checkpoints different from the expectation that earlier training data will be harder to detect.\n\n![table_0](table_0)\n\nTable 1: AUC-ROC results on WikiMIA benchmark.

On the other hand, TopPref notably outperforms RandNM, implying that the effectiveness of non-member prefixes for MIA differs.\n\nBecause benchmarking MIAs for LLMs is challenging due to the uncertainty of real-world test data distribution at inference time (\\$2.3), simulating diverse scenarios, as we did with OLMoMIA, is both beneficial and necessary compared to relying on a fixed benchmark. We encourage MIA developers and practitioners to evaluate their methods under varied conditions, as done in OLMoMIA. While we do not claim that OLMoMIA is inherently more realistic than other benchmarks, it aligns with some possible real-world scenarios, though it does not cover all cases.

EM-MIA is easily tunable with several design choices, including initialization, score update rules, and stopping criteria, allowing the application to MIA in different conditions and providing room for further improvement. We create a new benchmark for detecting pre-training data of LLMs named OLMoMIA to better understand the conditions under which EM-MIA works with a comprehensive evaluation.

{"section_id": 21, "text": "## B Metrics for Prefix Scores\n\nFigure 3 displays ROC curves of MIA when negative prefix scores measured by different metrics are used as membership scores. We use AUCROC, Accuracy, and TRP@k\\%FPR with $k \\in$ $\\{0.1,1,5,10,20\\}$ as metrics. Using AUC-ROCbased prefix scores as membership scores achieves 98.6\\% AUC-ROC, which is almost perfect and the highest among other metrics.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 22, "text": "## C Comparison with ReCaLL\n\nAs explained in $\\S 2.4$, the original ReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024) uses labeled data from the test dataset, which is unfair to compare with the above baselines and ours. More precisely, $p_{i}$ in the prefix $p=p_{1} \\oplus p_{2} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus p_{n}$ are known nonmembers from the test set $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$, and they are excluded from the test dataset for evaluation, i.e.,\n\n$\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}{ }^{\\prime}=\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }} \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{2}, \\cdots, p_{n}\\right\\}$. However, we measure the performance of ReCaLL with different prefix selection methods to understand how ReCaLL is sensitive to the prefix choice and use it as a reference instead of a direct fair comparison.\n\nSince changing the test dataset every time for different prefixes does not make sense and makes the comparison even more complicated, we keep them in the test dataset. A language model tends to repeat, so $\\mathrm{LL}\\left(p_{i} \\mid p ; \\mathcal{M}\\right) \\simeq 0$. Because $\\operatorname{LL}\\left(p_{i} \\mid p ; \\mathcal{M}\\right) \\ll 0, \\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}\\left(p_{i} ; \\mathcal{M}\\right) \\simeq 0$. It is likely to $\\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}\\left(p_{i} ; \\mathcal{M}\\right) \\ll \\operatorname{ReCaLL}_{p}(x ; \\mathcal{M})$ for $x \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }} \\backslash\\left\\{p_{1}, p_{2}, \\cdots, p_{n}\\right\\}$, meaning that ReCaLL will classify $p_{i}$ as a non-member. The effect would be marginal if $\\left|\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}\\right| \\gg n$. Otherwise, we should consider this when we read numbers in the result table.\n\nThe original ReCaLL (Xie et al., 2024) is similar to RandNM, except they report the best score after trying all different $n$ values, which is again unfair. The number of shots $n$ is an important hyperparameter determining performance. A larger $n$ generally leads to a better MIA performance but increases computational cost with a longer $p$.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 23, "text": "## D Formulation of OLMoMIA Settings\n\nAfter the filtering of removing close points, let member clusters as $C_{i}^{m}$ for $i \\in[1, K]$ and nonmember clusters as $C_{j}^{n m}$ for $j \\in[1, K]$.

Therefore, MIA accuracy is typically prioritized over computational costs as long as it is reasonably feasible. Nevertheless, maintaining MIAs' computational costs within a reasonable range is important. Computations on all our experiments with the used datasets (WikiMIA and OLMoMIA) were manageable even in an academic setting. We compare computational complexity between EMMIA and other baselines (mainly, ReCaLL) and describe how computational costs of EM-MIA can be further reduced below.\n\nEM-MIA is a general framework in that the update rules for prefix scores and membership scores can be designed differently (as described in $\\S 4$ ), and they determine the trade-off between MIA accuracy and computational costs. For the design choice described in Algorithm 1 that was used in our experiments, EM-MIA requires a pairwise computation $L L_{p}(x)$ for all pairs $(x, p)$ once, where $x, p \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$. These values are reused to calculate the prefix scores in each iteration without recomputation. The iterative process does not require additional LLM inferences. The time complexity of EM-MIA is $O\\left(D^{2} L^{2}\\right)$, where $D=\\left|\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}\\right|$ and $L$ is an average token length of each data on $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text {test }}$, by assuming LLM inference cost is quadratic to the input sequence length due to the Transformer architecture. In this case, EM-MIA does not have other tuning hyperparameters, while Min-K\\% and Min-K\\%++ have $K$ and or ReCaLL has $n$. This is more reasonable since validation data to tune them is not given.\n\nOf course, the baselines other than ReCaLL (Loss, Ref, Zlib, Min-K\\%, and Min-K\\%++) only compute a log-likelihood of each target text without computing a conditional log-likelihood with a prefix, so they are the most efficient: $O\\left(D L^{2}\\right)$ time complexity. Since ReCaLL uses a long prefix consisting of $n$ non-member data points, its time complexity is $O\\left(D(n L)^{2}\\right)=O\\left(n^{2} D L^{2}\\right)$. According to the ReCaLL paper, they sweep $n$ from 1 to 12 to find the best $n$, which means $O\\left(\\left(1^{2}+2^{2}+\\cdots+n^{2}\\right) D L^{2}\\right)=O\\left(n^{3} D L^{2}\\right)$. Also, in some cases (Figure 3 and Table 7 in their paper), they used $n=28$ to achieve a better result. In theory, it may seem EM-MIA does not scale well with respect to $D$. Nevertheless, the amount of computation and time for EM-MIA with $D \\sim 1000$ is not\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Performance of EM-MIA for each iteration with varying baselines for initialization and scoring functions $S$ on the WikiMIA dataset with a length of 128 and Pythia-6.9B model.\nsignificantly larger than ReCaLL, considering the $n$ factor.\n\nMoreover, ReCaLL requires $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ times larger memory than others including EM-MIA, so it may not be feasible for hardware with a small memory. In this sense, EM-MIA is more parallelizable, and we make EM-MIA faster with batching. Lastly, there is room to improve the time complexity of our method. We have not explored this yet, but for example, we may compute ReCaLL scores on a subset of the test dataset to calculate prefix scores as an approximation of our algorithm.

Each curve indicates the change of AUC-ROC calculated from the estimates of membership scores at each iteration during the expectation-maximization algorithm. In most combinations, the algorithm converges to a similar accuracy after 4-5 iterations. In this figure, there is only one case in which AUCROC decreases quickly and reaches a value close to 0 .

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine\nwhether specific data was used to train a model. They offer valuable insights\ninto detecting data contamination and ensuring compliance with privacy and\ncopyright standards. However, MIA for LLMs is challenging due to the massive\nscale of training data and the inherent ambiguity of membership in texts.\nMoreover, creating realistic MIA evaluation benchmarks is difficult as training\nand test data distributions are often unknown. We introduce EM-MIA, a novel\nmembership inference method that iteratively refines membership scores and\nprefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages\nthe observation that these scores can improve each other: membership scores\nhelp identify effective prefixes for detecting training data, while prefix\nscores help determine membership. As a result, EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on WikiMIA. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a\nbenchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows controlling task difficulty\nthrough varying degrees of overlap between training and test data\ndistributions. Our experiments demonstrate EM-MIA is robust across different\nscenarios while also revealing fundamental limitations of current MIA\napproaches when member and non-member distributions are nearly identical.", "updated": "2025-04-21T02:22:06Z", "published": "2024-10-10T03:31:16Z"}
