InTRODUCTION \n\nIn the paper [WW23] we provided a geometric optics description in spaces of low regularity of the transport of oscillations in solutions to linear and some semilinear second-order hyperbolic boundary problems along rays that graze the boundary of a convex obstacle to arbitrarily high finite or infinite order. The fundamental motivating example is the case where the spacetime manifold is $M=\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\backslash \\mathcal{O}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{R}_{t}$, where $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an open convex obstacle with $C^{\\infty}$ boundary, and the governing hyperbolic operator is the wave operator $\\square:=\\Delta-\\partial_{t}^{2}$.\n\nThe main theorem of [WW23], which applies to quite general second-order hyperbolic operators, obstacles, and incoming waves, showed that high frequency exact solutions with high order grazing rays are well approximated in spaces of low regularity by approximate solutions constructed from fairly explicit solutions to simple profile equations. The theorem has two main assumptions, both of a geometric nature, which need to be verified for each choice of hyperbolic operator, obstacle, and incoming wave. The first is that the grazing set, that is, the set of points on the spacetime boundary at which incoming characteristics meet the boundary tangentially, is a codimension two, $C^{1}$ submanifold of spacetime. The second is that the reflected flow map, which sends points on the spacetime boundary forward in time to points on reflected and grazing rays, is injective and has appropriate regularity properties near the grazing set. Both assumptions are in general hard to verify. In this paper we formulate general results describing when the assumptions hold, and provide explicit examples where the GS assumption fails.\n\nIn $\\S 2$ we explain how to distinguish different orders of grazing. The orders may be $2,4,6, \\ldots$ or $\\infty$. We showed in [WW23] that when the order is 2 , the reflected flow map (RFM) and grazing set (GS) assumptions always hold for very general second order hyperbolic operators, obstacles, and incoming waves. When the order of grazing is higher than two, the GS assumption can fail even for $\\square$, strictly convex obstacles, and incoming plane waves as we show in $\\S 4.5$, and the RFM assumption becomes much harder to verify even in such cases. In [WW23] we identified large classes of strictly convex obstacles in all dimensions for which both assumptions are satisfied when incoming plane waves for $\\square$ graze the obstacle to arbitrarily high finite or infinite order.\n\nPlane waves may be thought of as being produced by a point source at infinity. Much of this paper is concerned with verifying the RFM and GS assumptions for incoming spherical waves for $\\square$, which may be viewed as arising from a point source at a finite distance from the obstacle. This is done in $\\S 3$ and $\\S 4.1-4.3$. The incoming waves we consider in this paper are associated to phase functions of the form\n\n$$\n\\phi_{i}(t, x)=-t+\\psi_{i}(x)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{i}: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, is a smooth convex function that satisfies the eikonal equation\n\n$$\n\\left(\\partial_{x_{1}} \\psi_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\left|\\nabla \\psi_{i}\\right|^{2}=1, \\nabla:=\\left(\\partial_{x_{2}}, \\cdots, \\partial_{x_{n}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThese are the convex waves referred to in the title. When $\\psi_{i}(x)=\\theta \\cdot x$ for $\\theta \\in S^{n-1}$ we obtain plane waves; when $\\psi_{i}(x)=|x-b|$ we obtain spherical waves associated to a source at $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. $\\S 5$ verifies the RFM assumption for general convex incoming waves. Many examples of such waves are provided in the Remark after Assumption 5.1.\n\nWhile the RFM assumption turns out to hold for general convex waves and strictly convex obstacles, this is not the case for the GS assumption, where the dimension of the obstacle is now important. In $\\S 4.1$ we show that for 2D strictly convex obstacles the GS assumption always holds for incoming spherical waves. ${ }^{1} \\S 4.2$ verifies the GS assumption for nD obstacles with a special symmetry; these include examples of infinite order tangency. In $\\S 4.3$ we verify the GS assumption for incoming spherical waves for a large class of 3D strictly convex obstacles. Theorem 6 gives a simple sufficient condition (4.8) on the lowest order (nonconstant) homogeneous polynomial in the Taylor expansion of the function defining the obstacle for the grazing set to be a codimension two $C^{\\infty}$ submanifold of spacetime.\n\nIn $\\S 4.5$ we provide examples, both for incoming plane and spherical waves, where the GS assumption fails; in these examples the grazing set is cusped; it is the graph of a function that is continuous, but not $C^{1}$. We also give examples where the grazing set is $C^{1}$ but not twice differentiable, so the GS assumption holds, but just barely. These examples show what can happen when the obstacle does not satisfy the sufficient condition (4.8) of Theorem 6.\n\nTheorem 7 of $\\S 4.4$ provides a general result about the nature of the grazing set for strictly convex obstacles for which condition (4.8) of Theorem 6 need not hold, but where the high order grazing point is an isolated zero of the Gauss curvature of the boundary of the obstacle. The result is that, while the grazing set may not be $C^{1}$, it is at least $C^{0}$. More precisely, the spatial projection of the grazing set is a single continuous curve near the high order grazing point; branching does not occur.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising that nonsmooth grazing sets can occur even in problems where the convex obstacle has a $C^{\\infty}$ boundary and the incoming waves are plane waves or spherical waves. The examples show that for strictly convex obstacles that do not satisfy condition (4.8) of Theorem 6, the GS assumption can fail or not depending on the location of the source $b$ of spherical waves with phase $-t+|x-b|$.\n\nThe spatial projection of the grazing set for incoming spherical waves can be defined as the intersection of two smooth hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The regularity of that set is\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ In [WW23] the GS assumption was shown to hold always for incoming planar waves and 2D strictly convex obstacles.\n\ndifficult to study in general, because the normals to these two hypersurfaces always point in the same direction at a point of high order (that is, order $\\geq 4$ in the sense of Definition 2.7) grazing. Thus, the implicit function theorem cannot be applied directly; see Remark 2.13. In $\\S 4$ we introduce some methods for dealing with this failure of transversality.\n\nWe believe that the study of the reflected flow map and the grazing set are of independent interest, apart from the connection to the main theorem of [WW23]. So we have tried to write this paper so that it can be read independently of [WW23].

This definition appears to be standard. For example, it is the one given in [RV73]. For $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ as above and any subset $V \\subset U$, we say that $f$ is convex/concave on $V$ if it is convex/concave on $U$.\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ This means that if $x, y \\in U$, then the line segment $[x, y]$ is contained in $U$.\n\n2. A $C^{2}$ function on $U$ is convex/concave if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive/negative semi-definite.\n3.

We arrange by translation and rotation of $\\mathcal{O}$ so that $F$ has a max at $\\bar{x}=0$ with $F(0)=1$.

We express condition (2.3c) by saying that the wave $u^{\\epsilon}$ oscillates with the incoming phase $\\phi_{i}$ in $t<-T+\\delta$ (the past). The function $f(x, t, p, q)$ is Lipschitz in the argument $(p, q)$.\n\nThe reflected phase $\\phi_{\\tau}$ needed to describe $u^{\\epsilon}$ in the future is constructed using null bicharacteristics of $\\square$.

When Assumption 2.6 holds, the formulas (2.14) show that\n\n$$\n\\phi_{r} \\in C^{\\infty}\\left(\\mathcal{J}_{r}^{\\prime}\\right) \\text { but we just have } \\phi_{r} \\in C^{1}\\left(\\mathcal{J}_{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn fact, $\\phi_{r}$ generally fails to be in $C^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{J}_{r}\\right)$; the singularity in $\\phi_{r}$ is due to the singularity of $Z_{r}^{-1}$ at $\\left[0, s_{0}\\right] \\times G_{\\phi_{i}}$.\n2.2. Orders of grazing. To formulate the grazing set assumption GS, we first recall the classical decomposition\n\n$$\nT^{*} \\partial M \\backslash 0=E \\cup H \\cup G\n$$\n\ninto elliptic, hyperbolic, and glancing sets. If $\\sigma \\in T^{*} \\partial M \\backslash 0$, we say that $\\sigma$ belongs to $E, H$, or $G$ if the number of elements in $\\left(i^{*}\\right)^{-1}(\\sigma) \\cap p^{-1}(0)$ is zero, two, or one respectively. The sets $E$ and $H$ are conic open subsets of $T^{*} \\partial M \\backslash 0$, and $G$ is a closed conic hypersurface in $T^{*} \\partial M \\backslash 0$.\n\nBelow we let $\\beta(x, t):=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x})$ denote the defining function of $\\partial M$.\n\nDefinition 2.7 ([MS78]). Let $\\sigma=(m, \\nu) \\in G$ and suppose $\\left(i^{*}\\right)^{-1}(\\sigma) \\cap p^{-1}(0)=\\{\\rho\\}$, where $\\rho \\in T_{m}^{*} M$. We say $\\sigma \\in G^{l}$, the glancing set of order at least $l \\geq 2$, if\n\n$$\np(\\rho)=0 \\text { and } H_{p}^{j} \\beta(\\rho)=0 \\text { for } 0 \\leq j<l\n$$\n\nThus, $G=G^{2} \\supset G^{3} \\supset \\cdots \\supset G^{\\infty}$.\nWe say $\\sigma \\in G^{l} \\backslash G^{l+1}$, the set of glancing points of exact order $l$, if $\\sigma \\in G^{l}$ and $H_{p}^{l} \\beta(\\rho) \\neq 0$. Consider points $\\sigma \\in G^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}, k \\geq 1$, such that $H_{p}^{2 k} \\beta(\\rho)>0$. When $k=1$, such a point $\\sigma$ is a classical diffractive point as studied in [Mel75] or [Che96]. When $k \\geq 1$ we refer to $\\sigma$ as a grazing (or diffractive) point of order $2 k$, and we write $\\sigma \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1} \\Leftrightarrow p(\\rho)=0, H_{p}^{j} \\beta(\\rho)=0$ for $0 \\leq j<2 k$, and $H_{p}^{2 k} \\beta(\\rho)>0$.\n\nRemarks. 1. If $\\sigma \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$, let $\\gamma(s)$ denote the bicharacteristic of $p$ such that $\\gamma(0)=\\rho$. Then $\\gamma$ is tangent to $\\partial T^{*} M$ at $\\rho$ and lies $T^{*} \\dot{M}$ for small $s \\neq 0$.\n2. Gliding points of order $2 k, \\sigma \\in G_{g}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$, are defined as in (2.15) with the single change $H_{p}^{2 k} \\beta(\\rho)<0$. If $\\sigma \\in G^{l} \\backslash G^{l+1}$ for some odd $l$, we call $\\sigma$ an inflection point of order $l$.\n\nDefinition 2.8 (Grazing points of order $\\infty$ ). Let $\\sigma \\in G^{\\infty}$ and suppose $\\left(i^{*}\\right)^{-1}(\\sigma) \\cap$ $p^{-1}(0)=\\{\\rho\\}$. We say that $\\sigma$ is a diffractive point of order $\\infty$ and write $\\sigma \\in G_{d}^{\\infty}$ if the bicharacteristic $\\gamma(s)$ of $p$ such that $\\gamma(0)=\\rho$ lies $T^{*} \\dot{M}$ for small $s \\neq 0$.\n\nDefinition 2.9 (Glancing points of diffractive type). We denote by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}_{d}:=\\cup_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left(G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}\\right) \\cup G_{d}^{\\infty}\n$$\n\nthe set of glancing points of diffractive type. More simply, we refer to $\\mathcal{G}_{d}$ as the set of grazing points.\n\nFor a fixed $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ let $\\rho=(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x}), \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}),-1) \\in \\partial T^{*} M \\cap p^{-1}(0)$ and observe that $^{6}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t) \\in G_{\\phi_{i}} & \\Leftrightarrow \\bar{\\xi}_{i}(\\bar{x}) \\cdot \\nabla F(\\bar{x})-\\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x})=0 \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow 0=H_{p} \\beta(\\rho)=2 \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x})-\\nabla F(\\bar{x}) \\cdot 2 \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}) \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow i^{*} \\rho=\\left(\\bar{x}, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x}) \\nabla F(\\bar{x})+\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}),-1\\right) \\\\\n& \\quad=\\left(\\bar{x}, t, d \\phi_{0}(\\bar{x}, t)\\right):=\\sigma \\in G\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe next proposition is a simple consequence of the strict convexity of $\\mathcal{O}$.\nProposition 2.10. Let $\\beta(x, t)=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x})$ and let\n\n$$\n\\underline{\\rho}=\\left(1,0, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(0), \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0),-1\\right) \\text { and } \\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho}=\\left(0, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(0) \\nabla F(0)+\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0),-1\\right)\n$$\n\nUnder Assumptions 2.2 (strict concavity of $F$ ) and $2.4\\left((1,0, t) \\in G_{\\phi_{i}}\\right)$, we have $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in \\mathcal{G}_{d}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ For the third equivalence we used (2.8) and the definition of $G$.\n\nProof. By (2.16) with $\\bar{x}=0$ we have $H_{p} \\beta(\\underline{\\rho})=0$. For $\\gamma_{i}(s):=\\gamma_{i}(s ; 0, t)$ as in (2.5) we have\n\n$$\nH_{p}^{\\ell} \\beta\\left(\\gamma_{i}(s)\\right)=\\left(\\frac{d}{d s}\\right)^{\\ell} \\beta\\left(\\gamma_{i}(s)\\right) \\text { for } \\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nIf $H_{p}^{\\ell}(\\beta)(\\underline{\\rho})=0$ for all $\\ell \\geq 2$, then $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{\\infty}$, since strict convexity of $\\mathcal{O}$ implies $\\gamma_{i}$ lies in $T^{*} \\dot{M}$ for $s \\neq 0 .^{7}$\n\nOtherwise, let $m$ be the smallest exponent for which $H_{p}^{m} \\beta(\\underline{\\rho}) \\neq 0$. With (2.17) we see that $m=2 k$ must be even and $H_{p}^{2 k} \\beta(\\underline{\\rho})>0$, since otherwise $\\gamma_{i}$ enters $\\mathcal{O}$ for some $s \\neq 0$ small. Thus, by $(2.15) \\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$.\n\nRemark 2.11. The proof of Proposition 2.10 shows more generally that if\n\n$$\n\\sigma=(\\bar{x}, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x}) \\nabla F(\\bar{x})+\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}),-1) \\in G\n$$\n\nthen $\\sigma$ must lie in $\\mathcal{G}_{d}$ since $\\gamma_{i}(s, \\bar{x}, t)$ lies in $T^{*} \\dot{M}$ for $s \\neq 0$.\nAssumption 2.12 (Grazing set assumption (GS)). Let $\\beta, \\underline{\\sigma} \\in \\mathcal{G}_{d}$, and $\\underline{\\rho}$ be as in Proposition 2.10. There exists an open set $U \\ni(1,0, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{t}$ and a $C^{1}$ function $\\zeta: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $d \\zeta \\neq 0$ on $U$ such that:\n(a) $G_{\\phi_{i}} \\cap U=\\{(x, t) \\in U: \\zeta(x, t)=0$ and $\\beta(x, t)=0\\}$;\n(b) $H_{p} \\zeta(\\underline{\\rho}) \\neq 0$;\n(c) There exists an open set $V \\ni \\underline{\\sigma}$ in $T^{*} \\partial M$ such that $G \\cap$ Graph $d \\phi_{0} \\cap V \\subset \\mathcal{G}_{d} .^{8}$\n\nThus, the assumption requires that $G_{\\phi_{t}}$ be a $C^{1}$ codimension two submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{t}$ near $(1,0, t) .{ }^{9}$ In the results of $\\S 4$ where the GS assumption holds, conditions (b) and (c) are seen to follow from the strict convexity of $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nFor $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G$ as in (2.16) it will be convenient to have a simple reformulation of the condition that $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$ in terms of $F$. Let\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{i}(s ; 0, t)=\\left(1+2 s \\xi_{1}^{i}(0), 2 s \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0), t+2 s, \\xi_{1}^{i}(0), \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0),-1\\right)\n$$\n\nbe the incoming null bicharacteristic such that $\\gamma_{i}(0 ; 0, t)=\\underline{\\rho}$.

With $\\beta(x, t)=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x})$ we have\n\n$$\n\\beta\\left(\\gamma_{i}(s)\\right)=2 s \\xi_{1}^{i}(0)-\\left[p_{2}\\left(2 s \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0)\\right)+\\cdots+p_{2 k}\\left(2 s \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0)\\right)+O\\left(s^{2 k+1}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Recall Remark $2.5(1)$.\n    ${ }^{8}$ Recall $\\phi_{0}=\\phi_{i} \\circ i: \\partial M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n    ${ }^{9}$ Part (b) implies $d \\zeta \\wedge d \\beta \\neq 0$ at $(1,0, t)$.\n    ${ }^{10}$ Strict concavity of $F$ implies $p_{1}(\\bar{x})=0$.\n\nA direct computation using $H_{p}^{j} \\beta\\left(\\gamma_{i}(s)\\right)=\\left(\\frac{d}{d s}\\right)^{j} \\beta\\left(\\gamma_{i}(s)\\right)$ shows that\n(a) $H_{p}^{j} \\beta(\\underline{\\rho})=0$ for $1 \\leq j<2 k$ and $H_{p}^{2 k} \\beta(\\underline{\\rho})>0$ if and only if\n(b) $\\xi_{1}^{i}(0)-\\nabla F(0) \\cdot \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0)=\\xi_{1}^{i}(0)=0, p_{j}\\left(\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0)\\right)=0$ for $1<j<2 k$,\nand $p_{2 k}\\left(\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(0)\\right)<0$.\nRemark 2.13. When $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+|x-b|$ with $b=(1, \\bar{b}), \\bar{b} \\neq 0$, the set $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is the intersection of the smooth hypersurfaces $S_{1}=\\left\\{x: \\mathcal{H}_{1}(x):=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x})=0\\right\\}$ and $S_{2}=\\left\\{x: \\mathcal{H}_{2}(x):=x_{1}-1-\\nabla F(\\bar{x}) \\cdot(\\bar{x}-\\bar{b})=0\\right\\}$. A normal vector to $S_{1}$ (resp. $S_{2}$ ) at $x=(1,0)$ is $n_{1}=(1,0)$ (resp. $n_{2}=\\left(1, \\nabla^{2} F(0) \\bar{b}\\right)$ ). Writing $F$ as in (2.18), we see that $\\nabla^{2} F(0) \\bar{b}=\\nabla^{2} p_{2}(0) \\bar{b}$. We claim ${ }^{11}$\n\n$$\np_{2}(\\bar{b}) \\neq 0 \\Leftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\nabla^{2} p_{2}(0) \\bar{b}, \\bar{b}\\right\\rangle \\neq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\nabla^{2} p_{2}(0) \\bar{b} \\neq 0\n$$\n\nWith (2.20) this implies that $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are linearly independent if and only if $\\underline{\\sigma}=$ $\\left(0, t,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right) \\in G_{d}^{2} \\backslash G^{3}$. This is the only case where the implicit function theorem can be applied directly to $\\mathcal{H}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{2}$ to show that the GS assumption holds for incoming spherical waves.\n\nWhen $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+\\bar{\\theta} \\cdot \\bar{x}$, the set $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is defined by $\\nabla F(\\bar{x}) \\cdot \\bar{\\theta}=0$. The argument for (2.21) shows that $\\nabla^{2} F(0) \\bar{\\theta} \\neq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\underline{\\sigma}=(0, t, \\bar{\\theta},-1) \\in G_{d}^{2} \\backslash G^{3}$, so this is the only case where the implicit function theorem applies directly to verify the GS assumption for incoming plane waves.\n2.3. Main results. $\\S 3$ proves a strengthened, global version of the reflected flow map assumption (RFM) for spherical incoming waves.\n\nTheorem 1. Let the convex obstacle $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be as Assumption 2.2, and consider incoming waves associated to the spherical phase function $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+|x-b|$, where $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\backslash \\overline{\\mathcal{O}}$. In the definition of the grazing set $G_{\\phi_{i}}$ and the illuminable region $I_{-}$, Definition 3.2, allow $R$ and $T$ to be any positive numbers. Then the RFM assumption, Assumption 2.6, holds with $s_{0}$ any positive number.\n\nThe main result of $\\S 5$ is a verification of the RFM assumption for general convex incoming waves.\n\nTheorem 2. Let the convex obstacle $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be as (2.2), and consider incoming waves associated to any incoming phase function of the form $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+\\psi_{i}$, where $\\psi_{i}: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is $C^{\\infty}$, convex, and satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left(\\partial_{x_{1}} \\psi_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\left|\\nabla \\psi_{i}\\right|^{2}=1\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ The first equivalence follows from the Taylor expansion of $p_{2}$. To see $\\Leftarrow$ in the second equivalence observe that if $p_{2}(\\bar{b})=0$, then $p_{2}(\\bar{x})$ has the form $c_{1}\\left(\\bar{b}^{\\perp} \\cdot \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}$ or $c_{2}\\left(\\bar{b}^{\\perp} \\cdot \\bar{x}\\right)(\\ell \\cdot \\bar{x})$ for some $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ such that $\\ell \\cdot \\bar{b} \\neq 0$ and real $c_{i}$. If the second form holds with $c_{2} \\neq 0$, then $F$ is not strictly concave, so $p_{2}=c_{1}\\left(\\bar{b}^{\\perp} \\cdot \\bar{x}\\right)^{2}$ for some $c_{1} \\leq 0$ and hence $\\nabla^{2} p_{2}(0) \\bar{b}=0$.\n\non some $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$-open set $\\Omega \\ni(1,0)$. Then the RFM assumption, Assumption 2.6, holds with $s_{0}$ and $T$ any positive numbers provided $R$ is taken sufficiently small. ${ }^{12}$\n\nUnlike the RFM assumption the GS assumption becomes more difficult to study and is more likely to fail as the dimension $n$ of the obstacle increases. We know from [WW23] that for 2D strictly convex obstacles the GS assumption always holds for incoming plane waves, and we show in $\\S 4.1$ that is also true for incoming spherical waves.\n\nOne might hope that the GS assumption is always satisfied for strictly convex obstacles of dimension $n \\geq 3$; after all, the obstacles have $C^{\\infty}$ boundaries and the incoming waves are planar or spherical. But this is not the case. For both plane and spherical waves we provide examples in section $\\S 4.5$ where the GS assumption fails for 3D convex obstacles. There is reason to expect the situation to be worse for $n \\mathrm{D}$ obstacles when $n \\geq 4$. In Proposition 4.4 of section $\\S 4.2$ we identify a class of $n$-dimensional obstacles with special symmetry for which the GS assumption holds. Along with the 2D case, these $n D$ examples include cases of infinite order tangency.\n\nWe are mainly concerned in $\\S 4.3$ to provide large classes of examples where the GS assumption holds in dimension $n=3$. Our main positive result on the GS assumption for 3D obstacles is the following theorem, which is stated more carefully as Theorem 6 of $\\S 4.3$.\n\nTheorem 3. Let the obstacle be defined as in Assumption 2.2 by $x_{1}=F(\\bar{x})$. Suppose for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that\n\n$$\nF(\\bar{x})=1-G_{2 k}(\\bar{x})+r(\\bar{x})\n$$\n\nwhere $G_{2 k}$ is a homogeneous real polynomial of degree $2 k$ in $\\bar{x}=\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} G_{2 k}(\\bar{x})>0 \\text { for } \\bar{x} \\neq 0\n$$\n\nand $r(x)=O\\left(|\\bar{x}|^{2 k+1}\\right)$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ remainder term. Take the incoming phase to be $\\phi_{i}=$ $-t+|x-b|, b=(1, \\bar{b})$ with $\\bar{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$. Then the point $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*}\\left(1,0, t, 0,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right) \\in$ $G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$ and the GS assumption, Assumption 2.12, is satisfied.\n\nThe next theorem, stated more carefully as Theorem 7 of $\\S 4.4$, rules out branching for a class of convex obstacles and spherical incoming waves for which grazing can occur to any finite or infinite order at $x=(1,0)$; condition 2.23 need not hold. Branching occurs when $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ consists of more than two smooth curves which meet and terminate at $x=(1,0)$. In any such case the GS assumption fails of course.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ Here again $R$ and $T$ are the parameters appearing in Definition 3.2.\n\nTheorem 4. Let the obstacle $\\mathcal{O}$ be defined as in Assumption 2.2 by $x_{1}=F(\\bar{x})$, and assume that ${ }^{13}$\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} F(\\bar{x})<0 \\text { for } \\bar{x} \\neq 0 \\text { when } \\bar{x} \\text { is near } 0\n$$\n\nThen branching does not occur for incoming spherical waves. The set $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is a single continuous curve through $x=(1,0)$.\n\nEven when branching does not occur, the GS assumption may fail when the set $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ has a cusp; such examples are given in $\\S 4.5$ for both spherical and planar incoming waves. These examples illustrate different ways the conclusion of Theorem 3 can fail if (2.23) does not hold, that is, if the lowest order nonconstant homogeneous polynomial in the Taylor expansion of $F(\\bar{x})$ at $\\bar{x}=0$ does not satisfy (2.23).\n2.4. Applications. The results of this paper extend the range of application of the main result of [WW23]. That result, Theorem 2 of [WW23], gives an explicit geometric optics description of solutions to the initial boundary value problem (2.3a)-(2.3c) whenever the RFM and GS assumptions are satisfied by the obstacle $\\mathcal{O}$ and incoming phase $\\phi_{i}$. In [WW23] we verified these assumptions for some families of convex obstacles $\\mathcal{O}$, but only for planar incoming waves associated to linear phases $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+\\theta \\cdot x$, $|\\theta|=1$. The results of $\\S \\S 3,4.1-4.3$ of this paper show that both assumptions hold for certain families of convex obstacles with grazing points of arbitrarily high order, when the incoming phases are the nonlinear phases that describe spherical waves, $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+|x-b| .^{14}$\n\nWe now restate, somewhat informally, the main result of [WW23] for the problems considered here, referring the reader to that paper for a more precise and general formulation.\n\nTheorem 5 ([WW23, Theorem 2]). Consider the initial boundary value problem (2.3a) (2.3c) under the RFM assumption, Assumptions 2.6. Suppose the initial oscillatory profile $U_{1}\\left(x, t, \\theta_{i}\\right)$ is supported near a characteristic of $\\phi_{i}$ that grazes $\\partial M$ (possibly to high order) at the point $\\left(x_{1}, \\bar{x}, t\\right)=(1,0,0) \\in G_{\\phi_{i}}$. Assume that the GS assumption, Assumption 2.12, is satisfied near $\\underline{\\sigma}=\\left(0,0, d \\phi_{i}(0,0)\\right) \\in \\mathcal{G}_{d}$. Then if $T>0$ is small enough, the solution $u^{\\epsilon} \\in H^{1}\\left(M_{T}\\right)$ satisfies\n\n$$\n\\left.u^{\\epsilon}(x, t)\\right|_{M_{T}} \\sim_{H^{1}} u(x, t)+\\epsilon U_{r}\\left(x, t, \\phi_{r} / \\epsilon\\right)+\\epsilon U_{i}\\left(x, t, \\phi_{i} / \\epsilon\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $U_{k}\\left(x, t, \\theta_{k}\\right)$ for $k=r, i$ is periodic in $\\theta_{k}$ with mean zero, and the functions\n\n$$\nu \\in H^{1}\\left(M_{T}\\right), \\partial_{\\theta_{r}} U_{r} \\in L^{2}\\left(M_{T} \\times \\mathbb{T}\\right), \\partial_{\\theta_{i}} U_{i} \\in L^{2}\\left(M_{T} \\times \\mathbb{T}\\right)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ These conditions mean that $\\partial \\mathcal{O}$ is strictly convex with $x=(1,0)$ being an isolated zero of the Gauss curvature.\n    ${ }^{14}$ When $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2} \\backslash G^{3}$, the results of [Che96] and [WW23] show that the RFM and GS assumptions are satisfied for any incoming characteristic phase; moreover, the grazing set is $C^{\\infty}$, not just $C^{1}$.\n\nare constructed to satisfy the profile equations [WW23, (4.4)-(4.6)].\nRemarks. 1. The meaning of \" $\\sim_{H^{1}}$ \" in (2.25) is explained in [WW23, Definition 1.3]. Roughly, it means that the leading part of $u^{\\epsilon}$ has the given form up to an error that is small in $H^{1}$ when the wavelength $\\epsilon$ is small.\n2. The profile equations referred to in the theorem are a coupled system for the functions $u, U_{r}, U_{i}$ in (2.26) in which the equations for $U_{r}, U_{i}$ describe transport along the characteristic vector fields associated to $\\phi_{r}$ and $\\phi_{i}$ :\n\n$$\nT_{\\phi_{k}}=2 \\nabla_{x} \\phi_{k} \\partial_{x}-2 \\partial_{t} \\phi_{k} \\partial_{t}, \\quad k=r, i\n$$\n\n3. We have seen that the RFM assumption allows us to construct the reflected phase $\\phi_{r}$ as a $C^{1}$ function on $\\mathcal{J}_{r}$, the range of $Z_{r}$ as in (2.10). The GS assumption implies that the union of the forward and backward flowouts of the grazing set $G_{\\phi_{i}}$ under $T_{\\phi_{i}}$ is a $C^{1}$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}_{x, t}^{n+1}$. We write this union as $S B=S B_{+} \\cup S B_{-}$and refer to $S B_{+}$, the forward flowout, as the \"shadow boundary\".

Writing $F$ as in (2.18) and noting that $p_{j}(\\bar{\\xi}(0))=0 \\Leftrightarrow p_{j}=0$, we see that $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$ for some $k$, (resp. $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{\\infty}$ ) if and only if $F$ has the form\n(a) $F\\left(x_{2}\\right)=1+c_{2 k} x_{2}^{2 k}+r\\left(x_{2}\\right)$, where $c_{2 k}<0$ and $r\\left(x_{2}\\right)=O\\left(\\left|x_{2}\\right|^{2 k+1}\\right)$,\n(b) respectively, $F\\left(x_{2}\\right)=1+r\\left(x_{2}\\right)$, where $r\\left(x_{2}\\right)=O\\left(\\left|x_{2}\\right|^{\\infty}\\right) \\leq 0$.\n\nWe have $\\left(F\\left(x_{2}\\right), x_{2}, t\\right) \\in G_{\\phi_{i}} \\Leftrightarrow F\\left(x_{2}\\right)-1-F^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{2}-b_{2}\\right)=0$. In cases (a), (b) this means\n(a) $0=c_{2 k} x_{2}^{2 k}-2 k c_{2 k} x_{2}^{2 k-1}\\left(x_{2}-b_{2}\\right)+O\\left(|x|^{2 k}\\right)=x^{2 k-1}\\left[-2 k c_{2 k}\\left(x_{2}-b_{2}\\right)+O\\left(\\left|x_{2}\\right|\\right]\\right)$\n(b) $0=r\\left(x_{2}\\right)-r^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{2}-b_{2}\\right)$.\n\nClearly, (a) holds for small $x_{2}$ if and only if $x_{2}=0$. In case (b) the strict concavity of $F$ implies\n\n$$\n0 \\leq r(0)-r\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\leq r^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\left(-x_{2}\\right) \\Leftrightarrow 0 \\leq-r\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\leq r^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\left(-x_{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor $x_{2} \\neq 0$ small this implies $\\left|r^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\right| \\geq\\left|r\\left(x_{2}\\right)\\right| /\\left|x_{2}\\right|$. Since $r^{\\prime}\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\neq 0$ for $x_{2} \\neq 0$ small and $x_{2}-b_{2} \\sim 1$, we see that (b) holds for $x_{2} \\neq 0$ small if and only if $x_{2}=0 .{ }^{17}$\n2. Condition (b) in the GS assumption holds, since $\\underline{\\rho}=\\left(1,0, t, 0,-b_{2} /\\left|b_{2}\\right|,-1\\right)$ and $H_{p} \\zeta(\\underline{\\rho})=2\\left(-b_{2} /\\left|b_{2}\\right|\\right) \\partial_{x_{2}}\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\neq 0$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ Here we use that $r^{\\prime}$ is strictly decreasing, since $F$ is strictly concave.\n\n3. Condition (c) in the GS assumption is a consequence of the strict convexity of $\\mathcal{O}$ near $(1,0)$. Indeed, points in the graph of $d \\phi_{0}$ near $\\underline{\\sigma}$ have the form $\\left(\\bar{x}, t^{\\prime}, \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x}) \\nabla F(\\bar{x})+\\right.$ $\\left.\\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}),-1\\right)$ for $\\left(\\bar{x}, t^{\\prime}\\right)$ near $(0, t)$, so condition (c) follows directly from Remark 2.11.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 8, "text": "# 4.2.

Suppose $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}, n \\geq 2$ is defined by a function $F$ as in Assumption 4.2. Let $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-b|$, where $b=(1, \\bar{b}), \\bar{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\backslash\\{0\\}$. The GS assumption, Assumption 2.12, is satisfied if we take $\\beta=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x}), \\zeta$ as in (4.6), and $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho}$, where $\\underline{\\rho}=\\left(1,0, t, 0,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right)$.\n\nProof. 1. We have $\\underline{\\sigma}:=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho} \\in \\mathcal{G}_{d}$, where $\\underline{\\rho}=\\left(1,0, t, 0,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right)$.

A computation similar to (2.20) shows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1} & \\Leftrightarrow h^{(j)}(0)=0 \\text { for } j=1, \\ldots, k-1 \\text { and } h^{(k)}(0)>0 \\\\\n\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{\\infty} & \\Leftrightarrow h^{(j)}(0)=0 \\text { for all } j\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBoth cases give $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in \\mathcal{G}_{d}$.\n2. To verify Assumption 2.12 we recall that the grazing set is determined by $\\mathcal{H}(\\bar{x})=$ 0 . From (4.4) (b) and the properties of $h$ we see that this is equivalent to $\\zeta(\\bar{x})=0$, where\n\n$$\n\\zeta(\\bar{x}):= \\begin{cases}\\frac{-h\\left(|\\Lambda \\bar{x}|^{2}\\right)}{h^{\\prime}\\left(|\\Lambda \\bar{x}|^{2}\\right)}+2|\\Lambda \\bar{x}|^{2}-2 \\Lambda \\bar{x} \\cdot \\Lambda \\bar{b}, \\bar{x} \\neq 0 \\\\ 0, \\bar{x}=0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe claim that for $\\bar{x}$ small $\\zeta$ is $C^{1}$ and $\\partial_{\\bar{x}} \\zeta(0)=-2 \\Lambda^{T} \\Lambda \\bar{b} \\neq 0$. The claim holds if $f(\\bar{x}):= \\begin{cases}\\frac{h\\left(|\\Lambda \\bar{x}|^{2}\\right)}{h^{\\prime}\\left(|\\Lambda \\bar{x}|^{2}\\right)}, \\bar{x} \\neq 0 & \\text { satisfies } f \\in C^{1} \\text { for } \\bar{x} \\text { small with } \\nabla f(0)=0 . \\text { That follows } \\\\ 0, \\bar{x}=0 & \\text { easily from the assumptions on } h .\\end{cases}$\n3. We have $H_{p} \\zeta(\\underline{\\rho})=-2 \\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|} \\cdot \\partial_{\\bar{x}} \\zeta(0)=4|\\Lambda \\bar{b}|^{2} /|\\bar{b}| \\neq 0$, so condition (b) of the GS assumption holds. Condition (c) is a consequence of strict convexity as in the proof of Proposition 4.1.\n4.3. A class of 3D obstacles for which the GS assumption holds. The next Theorem is our main positive result on the grazing set assumption for 3D obstacles and incoming spherical waves. It shows that for obstacles defined by $x_{1}<F(\\bar{x})$, the GS assumption is satisfied by incoming spherical waves with phase $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+|x-b|$, where $b=(1, \\bar{b}), \\bar{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$, whenever $F(\\bar{x})$ has a Taylor expansion at 0 of the form (4.7) with $\\nabla^{2} G_{2 k}(\\bar{x})>0$ for $\\bar{x}>0$. These obstacles are more general then those considered in the $n$-dimensional result, Proposition 4.4.\n\nIt will be convenient below sometimes to write $\\bar{x}=\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)=(u, v)$.\nTheorem 6. Suppose for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that\n\n$$\nF(\\bar{x})=1-G_{2 k}(\\bar{x})+r(\\bar{x})\n$$\n\nwhere $G_{2 k}$ is a homogeneous real polynomial of degree $2 k$ in $\\bar{x}=\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)$ such that\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} G_{2 k}(\\bar{x})>0 \\text { for } \\bar{x} \\neq 0\n$$\n\nand $r(x)=O\\left(|\\bar{x}|^{2 k+1}\\right)$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ remainder term. Define the obstacle $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as in Assumption 2.2 by $x_{1}=F(\\bar{x})$, and take the incoming phase to be $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-b|$, $b=(1, \\bar{b})$ with $\\bar{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\backslash\\{0\\}$. The GS assumption, Assumption 2.12, is satisfied if we take $\\beta=x_{1}-F(\\bar{x})$ and $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho}$, where $\\underline{\\rho}=\\left(1,0, t, 0,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right)$; the function $\\zeta$ has\n\nthe form $x_{2}-u\\left(x_{3}\\right)$ for some $C^{\\infty}$ function $u(\\cdot)$ or the form $x_{3}-v\\left(x_{2}\\right)$ for some $C^{\\infty}$ function $v(\\cdot)$.\n\nRemark 4.5. Examples presented in $\\S 4.5$ show that even for strictly concave functions $F$ satisfying Assumption 4.7, if the lowest order (nonconstant) homogeneous polyno$\\operatorname{mial}-G_{2 k}$ in the Taylor expansion of $F(\\bar{x})$ at $\\bar{x}=0$ fails to satisfy (4.8), then some or all of the conclusions of Theorem 6 can fail.\n(a) For example, if $b=(1,-1,0)$ and $F(\\bar{x})=1-\\left(x_{2}^{4}+x_{3}^{4}\\right)$, so $k=2$ and $G_{4}(\\bar{x})=$ $x_{2}^{4}+x_{3}^{4}$, then the grazing set is $C^{1}$ but not $C^{2}$; see $\\S 4.5 .2$. In this case $F$ and $-G_{4}$ are strictly concave, but (4.8) does not hold.\n(b) If $b=(1,-1,0)$ and $F(\\bar{x})=1-\\left(x_{2}^{4}+x_{3}^{2}\\right)$, so $k=1$ and $G_{2}(\\bar{x})=x_{3}^{2}$, the grazing set has a cusp; see $\\S 4.5 .1$. In this case $F$ is strictly concave, but $-G_{2}(\\bar{x})$ is not strictly concave.\n(c) Part of the conclusion of the theorem is that one obtains a $C^{\\infty}$ grazing set for all nonzero choices of $b$ in the plane $x_{1}=1$. When the condition (4.8) fails, the grazing set can be $C^{\\infty}$ for some choices of $b$ in the plane $x_{1}=1$ and cusped for other choices. See Remark 4.11.\n\nIn these examples $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*}\\left(1,0, t, 0,-\\frac{\\bar{b}}{|\\bar{b}|},-1\\right) \\in G_{d}^{4} \\backslash G^{5}$.\nProof of Theorem 6. 1. The case $r=0$. We first treat the case $r=0$, which occupies most of the proof. Switching to $\\bar{x}=(u, v)$ notation and writing $G=G_{2 k}$ in the rest of this proof, we note that the condition\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} G(u, v)>0 \\text { for }(u, v) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nimplies $G(u, v)>0$ for $(u, v) \\neq 0$. Thus, $G(\\bar{b})>0$, so (2.20) shows that $\\underline{\\sigma} \\in G_{d}^{2 k} \\backslash G^{2 k+1}$.\n2. The grazing set is defined by the equation\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(u, v):=F(u, v)-1-\\nabla F(u, v) \\cdot[(u, v)-\\bar{b}]=0\n$$\n\nor equivalently, since $\\nabla G(u, v) \\cdot(u, v)=2 k G(u, v)$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(u, v)=(2 k-1) G(u, v)+\\nabla G(u, v) \\cdot(-\\bar{b})=0\n$$\n\n3. Set $g(u, v):=\\nabla G(u, v) \\cdot \\bar{b}$, a homogeneous polynomial of degree $2 k-1$. To understand the zero set of $\\mathcal{H}$ near $(0,0)$, we first study the zero set of $g$. The homogeneity implies that the real zero set of $g$ is a union of at most $2 k-1$ lines through the origin. We claim that (4.9) implies there is only one line. To see this fix $\\epsilon>0$ small and define the level curve\n\n$$\nC_{\\epsilon}:=\\{(u, v): G(u, v)=\\epsilon\\}\n$$\n\nThis is a compact strictly convex $C^{\\infty}$ curve enclosing 0 with positive curvature at all points. ${ }^{18}$ Now on $C_{\\epsilon}$ we have $g(u, v)=0 \\Leftrightarrow \\nabla G(u, v)=a \\bar{b}^{*}$ for some $a \\neq 0$, and the positive curvature of $C_{\\epsilon}$ implies this can happen at only two points of $C_{\\epsilon}$. Thus, the zero set of $g$ must consist of just one line through the origin. The line has the form $v=0$ or $u=\\alpha v$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In the rest of this proof we treat the case $u=\\alpha v$; the other case is treated similarly.\n4. For $v \\neq 0$ divide $g(u, v)$ by $v^{2 k-1}$ to obtain\n\n$$\ng(u, v)=\\left.v^{2 k-1} \\tilde{g}(z)\\right|_{z=\\frac{u}{v}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tilde{g}(z)$ is a (real) polynomial in $z$ of degree $2 k-1$ such that $\\tilde{g}(\\alpha)=0$ for $\\alpha$ as in step 3. ${ }^{19}$ We claim $\\alpha$ is a simple root of $\\tilde{g}$, and this is the key to the proof. Indeed, for some smooth polynomial $h$ of degree $2 k-2$ we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& g(u, v)=(u-\\alpha v) h(u, v) \\Rightarrow \\\\\n& \\quad \\nabla g(u, v) \\cdot \\bar{b}=((1,-\\alpha) \\cdot \\bar{b}) h(u, v)+(u-\\alpha v) \\nabla h(u, v)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBut $\\nabla g(u, v) \\cdot \\bar{b}=\\nabla^{2} G(u, v) \\bar{b} \\cdot \\bar{b}>0$ for $(u, v) \\neq 0$. Evaluating (4.13) at any point $(u, v) \\neq 0$ such that $u=\\alpha v$ we can conclude that\n\n$$\n(1,-\\alpha) \\cdot \\bar{b} \\neq 0 \\text { and } h(\\alpha v, v) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nNow $\\tilde{g}(z)=(z-\\alpha) \\tilde{h}(z)$ for some polynomial $\\tilde{h}$ of degree $2 k-2$, so (4.14) implies $\\tilde{h}(\\alpha) \\neq 0$.\n5. Zeros of $\\mathcal{H}$. For $v \\neq 0$ setting $z=\\frac{u}{v}$ we can rewrite (4.11) as\n\n$$\n-\\mathcal{H}(u, v)=g(u, v)+(1-2 k) G(u, v)=v^{2 k-1}\\left[\\tilde{g}(z)+G^{*}(u, v ; z)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $G^{*}(u, v ; z)$ is a polynomial of degree $2 k-1$ in $z$, each of whose coefficients is a real multiple of either $u$ or $v .{ }^{20}$ Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\tilde{g}(z)+G^{*}(u, v ; x):=p(u, v ; z)\n$$\n\nwhere $p(u, v ; z)$ is a polynomial of degree $2 k-1$ in $z$, each of whose coefficients $p_{i}(u, v)$ has the form $c_{i}+d_{i} u$ or $e_{i}+f_{i} v$ for some real constants $c_{i}, d_{i}, e_{i}, f_{i}$; in particular,\n\n$$\np(0,0 ; z)=\\tilde{g}(z)\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ Compactness follows from $G(u, v) \\geq C \\mid(u, v) \\mid{ }^{2 k}$, and the other properties follow from (4.9).\n    ${ }^{19}$ When the line in step 3 has the form $v=0$, divide $g(u, v)$ by $u^{2 k-1}$ for $u \\neq 0$ to obtain $\\tilde{g}(z)$ and set $z=\\frac{u}{u}$.\n    ${ }^{20}$ For example, if $k=2$ and $G(u, v)=u^{4}+u^{2} v^{2}+v^{4}$, then\n\n    $$\n    -3 G(u, v)=v^{3}\\left(-3 u z^{3}-3 u z-3 v\\right)=v^{3} G^{*}(u, v ; z)\n    $$\n\nNow $p(0,0 ; \\alpha)=0$ and by step $4 \\partial_{z} p(0,0 ; \\alpha) \\neq 0$. Thus, the implicit function theorem implies that there is a $C^{\\infty}$ function $z(u, v)$ defined near $(u, v)=0$ with $z(0,0)=\\alpha$ such that\n\n$$\np(u, v ; z)=0 \\Leftrightarrow z=z(u, v)\n$$\n\nWith (4.15) this implies that for $(u, v)$ near 0 ,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(u, v)=0 \\Leftrightarrow p(u, v ; z(u, v))=0\n$$\n\nThus, the zero set of $\\mathcal{H}$ near $(u, v)=0$ is given by $\\zeta^{*}(u, v)=0$, where $\\zeta^{*}(u, v)=$ $u-z(u, v) v$. Since $\\partial_{u} \\zeta^{*}(0,0) \\neq 0$, another application of the implicit function theorem shows that this zero set is given by $\\zeta(u, v)=0$ where\n\n$$\n\\zeta(u, v)=u-u(v)\n$$\n\nfor some $C^{\\infty}$ function $u(v)$ such that $u(0)=0$.\n6. Conditions (b) and (c) of the GS assumption are both consequences of strict convexity. We have $H_{p}=2 \\xi_{1} \\partial_{x_{1}}+2 \\bar{\\xi} \\partial_{\\bar{x}}-2 \\tau \\partial_{t}$, so with $\\underline{p}=(1,0, t, 0,-\\bar{b},-1)$ we obtain\n\n$$\nH_{p} \\zeta(\\underline{p})=-2 \\bar{b} \\cdot \\partial_{\\bar{x}} \\zeta(0)=-2 \\bar{b} \\cdot(1,-\\alpha) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nby (4.14). This gives (b). Condition (c) is a consequence of strict convexity as in the proof of Proposition 4.1.\n7. The general case $r(\\bar{x}) \\neq 0$. The above argument goes through almost without change. In place of (4.11) we now have\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(u, v)=(2 k-1) G(u, v)+\\nabla G(u, v) \\cdot(-\\bar{b})+[r(u, v)-\\nabla r(u, v) \\cdot((u, v)-\\bar{b})]=0\n$$\n\nThe term in brackets is a sum of terms of the form $b_{\\alpha}(u, v)(u, v)^{\\alpha}$ where $\\alpha=\\left(\\alpha_{u}, \\alpha_{v}\\right)$ is a multi-index of order $2 k$ and $b_{\\alpha}(u, v)$ is $C^{\\infty}$. We define $p(u, v ; z)$ as in (4.16), where $p(u, v ; z)$ is a polynomial of degree $2 k-1$ in $z$, each of whose coefficients $p_{i}(u, v)$ now has the form $c_{i}+d_{i}(u, v) u$ or $e_{i}+f_{i}(u, v) v$ for some constants $c_{i}, e_{i}$ and $C^{\\infty}$ functions $d_{i}(u, v), f_{i}(u, v)$. The polynomial $\\tilde{g}$ is unchanged, so the application of the implicit function theorem works just as before, as does the rest of the proof.\n\nRemark 4.6. Proposition 8.4 of [WW23] showed by a different argument that for incoming plane waves associated to phases $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+\\bar{x} \\cdot \\bar{\\theta}, \\bar{\\theta} \\in S^{n-2}$ and obstacles $\\mathcal{O}$ satisfying the conditions of Theorem 6 , the GS assumption always holds with a grazing set that is at least $C^{1}$. The proof of Theorem 6 implies that the grazing set is actually $C^{\\infty}$. To obtain this conclusion recall that for incoming plane waves the function $\\mathcal{H}$ as in (4.11) that defines $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is $\\nabla G(u, v) \\cdot \\bar{\\theta}$. One can then repeat steps 3-7 of the above proof for this new choice of $g(u, v)$ with the minor change that the\n\nfunction $G^{*}(u, v ; z)$ as in (4.16) is now completely determined by the higher order term $r(\\bar{x})$ in expansion of $F(\\bar{x})$.\n4.4. Branching does not occur in 3D near an isolated zero of Gauss curvature. In this section we show that for a much more general class of 3D obstacles than was considered in $\\S 4.3$, branching does not occur. That is, $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is at least a single continuous curve passing through $x=(1,0)$. Branching occurs when the set $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ consists of more than two smooth curves that meet and terminate at $\\bar{x}=0$. Observe that each curve in $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ lifts under the map $\\bar{x} \\mapsto(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x})$ to a curve in $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$. We now consider strictly convex obstacles for which the condition 4.8 in Theorem 6 need not hold. Examples below show that the GS assumption can fail for such obstacles.\n4.4.1. No branching. We write $x=\\left(x_{1}, \\bar{x}\\right)$, where $\\bar{x}=\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)$.\n\nAssumption 4.7. We take $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $F$ as in Assumption 2.2 and require that\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} F(\\bar{x})<0 \\text { for } \\bar{x} \\neq 0 \\text { when } \\bar{x} \\text { is near } 0\n$$\n\nRemark 4.8. Assumption 4.7 is equivalent to the statement that the boundary of $\\mathcal{O}$ is strictly convex with $x=(F(0), 0)=(1,0)$ being an isolated zero of the Gauss curvature.\n\nWe take a spherical incoming phase $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-b|$, where $b=(1, \\bar{b})$ with $\\bar{b} \\neq 0$. The grazing set near $x=(1,0)$ is\n\n$$\nG_{\\phi_{i}}=\\{(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t) \\mid F(\\bar{x})-1-\\nabla F(\\bar{x}) \\cdot(\\bar{x}-\\bar{b})=0, \\bar{x} \\text { near } 0, t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\n$$\n\nWe claim that for $F$ as above, the set\n\n$$\n\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}:=\\{\\bar{x} \\text { near } 0 \\mid \\mathcal{H}(\\bar{x}):=F(\\bar{x})-1-\\nabla F(\\bar{x}) \\cdot(\\bar{x}-\\bar{b})=0\\}\n$$\n\nconsists of a single continuous curve through $\\bar{x}=0$.\nTheorem 7 (No branching). Let $F$ satisfy Assumption 4.7 and take $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+$ $|x-b|$, where $b=(1, \\bar{b})$ with $\\bar{b} \\neq 0$. Near $\\bar{x}=0$ the set $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}} \\backslash\\{0\\}$ consists of two $C^{\\infty}$ curves, one in $x_{3}>0$ and one in $x_{3}<0$. The set $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is near $\\bar{x}=0$ a single continuous curve through $\\bar{x}=0$.\n\nProof. 1. Smoothness of $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ away from $\\bar{x}=0$. For $\\bar{x}$ near $0, \\bar{x} \\neq 0$ we compute\n\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathcal{H}(\\bar{x})=\\nabla F(\\bar{x})-\\nabla^{2} F(\\bar{x})(\\bar{x}-\\bar{b})-\\nabla F(\\bar{x})=-\\nabla^{2} F(\\bar{x})(\\bar{x}-\\bar{b}) \\neq 0\n$$\n\nsince $\\nabla^{2} F<0$ for $\\bar{x} \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is $C^{\\infty}$ away from $\\bar{x}=0$.\nIn steps 2-7 we first consider the case $b=(1,-1,0)$.\n2. The curve $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$.

This ray intersects $x_{1}=F\\left(x_{2}, 0\\right)$ at $A^{*}$ and at a second point $B^{*}=\\left(F\\left(x_{2}^{* *}, 0\\right), x_{2}^{* *}\\right)$ in $x_{2}>0$. Let $P\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ denote the half-plane in $x$-space consisting of all points that project to this ray under $\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)$.

Nonvanishing curvature of $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$. Let $Q=(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}) \\in C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ be a point where $K_{x_{2}}(\\bar{x}) \\neq 0 .{ }^{21}$ Near $\\bar{x}$ the curve $\\pi_{\\bar{x}} C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ is the graph of a $C^{\\infty}$ function $x_{2}=$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ Points where $K_{x_{3}}(\\bar{x}) \\neq 0$ are treated similarly.\n\n$x_{2}\\left(x_{3}\\right)$.

Grazing points on $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$. We now show that $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ contains one grazing point in $x_{3}>0$ and one in $x_{3}<0$. The directed infinite ray from $(1,-1)$ toward $A^{*}$ described in step 2, ray $\\left(A^{*}\\right)$, makes an angle of $\\theta=0$ with the $x_{1} x_{2}$ plane. Keeping $b=(1,-1,0)$ fixed, we now increase the angle $\\theta$ that $\\operatorname{ray}\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ makes with the $x_{1} x_{2}$ plane, always keeping the rotated ray, $\\operatorname{ray}(\\theta)$, in the plane $P\\left(A^{*}\\right)$. As $\\theta$ increases let $A(\\theta)$ denote the point closer to $b$ at which $\\operatorname{ray}(\\theta)$ intersects $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$. Strict convexity of $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ implies that $\\operatorname{ray}(\\theta) \\cap C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ contains either two points, one point, or zero points.\n\nDenote by $\\alpha(\\theta)$ the counterclockwise angle, viewed from the positive $x_{1}$ axis, that the tangent vector to $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ at $A(\\theta)$ makes with $\\operatorname{ray}\\left(A^{*}\\right)=\\operatorname{ray}(0) .{ }^{23}$ We have $\\alpha(0)>0$ and by strict convexity of $C\\left(A^{*}\\right), \\alpha(\\theta)$ strictly decreases as $\\theta$ increases from 0 . The strict monotonicity of $\\alpha(\\theta)$ implies that if there is a positive angle $\\theta$, call it $\\theta_{g}$, where $\\theta_{g}=\\alpha\\left(\\theta_{g}\\right)$, then $\\theta_{g}$ is unique. The point $A\\left(\\theta_{g}\\right)$ is then the unique grazing point on $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ in $x_{3}>0$.\n\nTo see that $\\theta_{g}$ exists, define\n\n$$\n\\theta_{g}=\\sup \\left\\{\\theta \\in[0,2 \\pi): \\operatorname{ray}(\\theta) \\cap C\\left(A^{*}\\right) \\text { contains exactly two points }\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIndeed, the sup exists since $\\pi$ is an upper bound and $\\operatorname{ray}(0) \\cap C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ (resp. $\\operatorname{ray}(\\pi) \\cap$ $\\left.C\\left(A^{*}\\right)\\right)$ contains exactly two (resp. zero) points. Moreover, if $\\operatorname{ray}\\left(\\theta_{g}\\right) \\cap C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ contains two points or zero points, then by continuity $\\theta_{g}$ can't be the sup. Thus, $\\operatorname{ray}\\left(\\theta_{g}\\right) \\cap C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ contains exactly one point, so $\\theta_{g}=\\alpha\\left(\\theta_{g}\\right)$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{22}$ We have $F_{x_{2}}\\left(x_{2}^{*}, 0\\right)=\\int_{0}^{1} F_{x_{2} x_{2}}\\left(s\\left(x_{2}^{*}, 0\\right)\\right) d s \\cdot x_{2}^{*}>0$, so $K_{x_{2}}\\left(x_{2}^{*}, 0\\right)>0$ by (4.26). This implies $x_{2}^{\\prime \\prime}>0$ at $\\left(x_{2}^{*}, 0\\right)$ by (4.31).\n    ${ }^{23}$ At $A(0)$ take the tangent vector to $C\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ with positive $x_{3}$-component; recall (4.33). As $\\theta$ increases from 0 choose the tangent vectors continuously.\n\n6. No branching. With (4.25) we see that $P\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ contains exactly two points of $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$, one in $x_{3}>0$ and one in $x_{3}<0$. Moreover,\n\n$$\n\\cup_{A^{*} \\text { near }(1,0), x_{2}^{*} \\leq 0}\\left(P\\left(A^{*}\\right) \\cap \\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nis equal to the set of points in $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ near $(1,0,0)$. Step $\\mathbf{1}$ implies that as $x_{2}^{*} \\nearrow 0$, the points of $P\\left(A^{*}\\right) \\cap \\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ trace out two curves that are $C^{\\infty}$ away from $(1,0,0)$. The curves approach $(1,0,0)$ continuously as $x_{2}^{*} \\nearrow 0$, since $P\\left(A^{*}\\right)$ approaches the plane $x_{1}=0$.\n7. General $\\bar{b}$. First observe that the above argument applies equally well when $\\bar{b}=(-1,0)$ is replaced by $\\bar{b}=(a, 0), a<0$. Suppose now that $b=(1, \\bar{b})$ with $\\bar{b} \\neq 0$ in $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-b|$. We can rotate $\\bar{x}$ coordinates keeping the $x_{1}$-coordinate unchanged, so that the rotated $\\bar{b}$ equals $(a, 0)$ for some $a<0$. Assumption 4.7 continues to hold in the new coordinates, so we can apply the above argument to rule out branching for any choice of $\\bar{b} \\neq 0$.\n\nRemark 4.9 (Plane waves). The no branching result holds for incoming plane waves by a much simpler argument. Consider the incoming phase $\\phi_{i}(x, t)=-t+\\bar{x} \\cdot \\bar{\\theta}$, where $|\\bar{\\theta}|=1$. The Gauss map $n: \\partial \\mathcal{O} \\rightarrow S^{2}$ is the map given by\n\n$$\n(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}) \\rightarrow(1,-\\nabla F(\\bar{x})) /|(1,-\\nabla F(\\bar{x}))|\n$$\n\nLet $C_{\\bar{\\theta}} \\subset S^{2}$ be the great circle consisting of vectors orthogonal to $(0, \\bar{\\theta})$ and note that $n(1,0)=(1,0) \\in C_{\\bar{\\theta}}$. The grazing set $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is the preimage $n^{-1}\\left(C_{\\bar{\\theta}}\\right)$. Assumption 4.7 implies that near $(1,0)$, the map $n$ is one-one and continuous with a continuous inverse, so $\\pi_{x} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ is a continuous curve near $(1,0) .{ }^{24}$\n4.5. Examples where the grazing set assumption fails or just barely holds. We now present examples showing that there exist smooth strictly convex obstacles $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ satisfying Assumption 2.2 for which the GS assumption fails for incoming spherical waves; the grazing set is continuous but not differentiable at a high-order grazing point. It has a cusp. In another example the GS assumption holds, but just barely; it is $C^{1}$ but not $C^{2}$.\n\nWe also give examples for incoming planar waves where the GS assumption fails or holds just barely. ${ }^{25}$\n4.5.1. Cusped grazing sets: examples where the grazing curve is continuous but not differentiable at $v=0$; spherical waves. The simplest example is probably $F(u, v)=$ $1-G(u, v)$, where $G(u, v)=u^{4}+v^{2}$. In this case the obstacle $\\mathcal{O}$ defined as in Assumption 2.2 is strictly convex near $x=(1,0)$, but we don't have $\\nabla^{2} G(u, v)>0$ for\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ Thanks to Mohammad Ghobi for this observation.\n    ${ }^{25}$ At the time of writing [WW23] we did not have such examples for incoming planar waves.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1. Light Source at $(1,-1,0)$. First row: Cusped grazing set for the obstacle given by $x_{1}=1-\\left(x_{2}^{4}+x_{3}^{2}\\right)$.

Again we take the incoming phase to be $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-b|$, where $b=(1, \\bar{b})$, $\\bar{b}=(-1,0)$.\n\nWith $\\underline{\\rho}=(1,0, t, 0,-\\bar{b},-1)$ we have $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho} \\in G_{d}^{4} \\backslash G^{5}$. The equation (4.10) is\n\n$$\n3 u^{4}+4 u^{3}+v^{2}=0\n$$\n\nwhich is readily seen to define $u$ as a function of $v$. The equation implies\n\n$$\nu=-v^{2 / 3}(4+3 u)^{-1 / 3} \\Rightarrow|u| \\sim v^{2 / 3}\n$$\n\nfor $(u, v)$ small. Expanding we obtain\n\n$$\nu=-4^{-1 / 3} v^{2 / 3}+O\\left(v^{4 / 3}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich implies $u^{\\prime}(0)$ does not exist. See Figure 1.\nHere is another example of a cusped grazing set, but now $\\nabla^{2} G(u, v)>0$ for $(u, v) \\neq$ 0 , Take $F(u, v)=1-G(u, v)$, where $G(u, v)=u^{4}+u^{2} v^{2}+v^{2}$. The function $F$ satisfies Assumption 4.7. For $\\underline{\\rho}$ as above we again have $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*} \\underline{\\rho} \\in G_{d}^{4} \\backslash G^{5}$. Now the equation $(4.10)$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{H}(u, v)=3\\left(u^{4}+u^{2} v^{2}\\right)+4 u^{3}+2 u v^{2}+v^{2}=0 \\\\\n& \\Leftrightarrow u^{3}(4+3 u)=-v^{2}\\left(1+2 u+3 u^{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhic implies that points in the zero set of $\\mathcal{H}$ satisfy ${ }^{26}$\n\n$$\nu=-4^{-1 / 3} v^{2 / 3}+O\\left(v^{4 / 3}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom (4.37) it is clear that the limit defining $u^{\\prime}(0)$ does not exist. We can get more information if we rewrite (4.36) as\n\n$$\nu\\left[\\left(4 u^{2}+2 v^{2}\\right)+3\\left(u^{3}+u v^{2}\\right]:=u B(u, v)=-v^{2}\\right.\n$$\n\nand note that $B(u, v) \\gtrsim u^{2}+v^{2} \\sim v^{4 / 3}$ for $(u, v)$ small. Now differentiate (4.38) with respect to $v$, divide by $B$, and use $\\left|v / u^{2}\\right| \\sim v^{-1 / 3}$ to obtain $\\left|u^{\\prime}(v)\\right| \\sim|v|^{-1 / 3}$ for $v \\neq 0$. One can analyze $u^{\\prime \\prime}(v)$ in a similar way to see that $0<u^{\\prime \\prime} \\sim v^{-4 / 3}$ for $v \\neq 0$, so the graph of $u=u(v)$ is concave up viewed from the positive $u$-axis. Thus, $u(v)$ \"behaves\" near $v=0$ just like the function $w(v)=v^{2 / 3}$. See Figure 1.\n\nRemark 4.10. The apparent smoothness of the projection $\\pi_{x_{1}, x_{3}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ in the second column Figure 1 might seem surprising. This is simply explained using (4.35) by observing that this projection is the graph of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{1} & =F\\left(x_{2}\\left(x_{3}\\right), x_{3}\\right)=1-\\left[x_{3}^{8 / 3}\\left(4+3 x_{2}\\left(x_{3}\\right)\\right)^{-4 / 3}+x_{3}^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& =1-x_{3}^{2}\\left[1+x_{3}^{2 / 3}\\left(4+3 x_{2}\\left(x_{3}\\right)\\right)^{-4 / 3}\\right] \\approx 1-x_{3}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA similar explanation accounts for the regularity of $\\pi_{x_{1}, x_{3}} G_{\\phi_{i}}$ in the remaining figures.\nEffect of changing source location on regularity of the grazing set. It is clear that the grazing set depends on source location. Here we show that the regularity of the grazing set can also depend on source location.\n\nAgain take $F=1-G(u, v)$ where $G(u, v)=u^{4}+v^{2}$, but now put the source at $c=(1,0,1):=(1, \\bar{c})$, so the incoming phase is $\\phi_{i}=-t+|x-c|$ and\n\n$$\n\\sigma^{*}=i^{*}(1,0, t, 0,-\\bar{c},-1) \\in G_{d}^{4} \\backslash G^{5}\n$$\n\nThe equation (4.10) is now\n\n$$\n3 u^{4}+v^{2}-2 v=0\n$$\n\nwhich implies the grazing set is given near $(u, v)=0$ by $v=2-\\sqrt{4-12 u^{4}}$, a $C^{\\infty}$ function. Recall that when $b=(1,-1,0)$ we get a cusped grazing set for this obstacle. ${ }^{27}$\n\nRemark 4.11. This dependence of the regularity of the grazing set on source location in the plane $x_{1}=1$ reflects the failure of condition (4.8) in Theorem 6 to hold. Indeed, while $F(u, v)=1-\\left(u^{4}+v^{2}\\right)$ is strictly concave, the function $(u, v) \\rightarrow-v^{2}$ is not.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ To see that (4.36) defines a function $u=u(v)$ near $(u, v)=0$, suppose $0=\\mathcal{H}\\left(u_{1}, v\\right)-\\mathcal{H}\\left(u_{2}, v\\right)$, where $u_{1}>u_{2}$. Factor out $u_{1}-u_{2}>0$ and use (4.37) to deduce that the second factor is also positive, contradiction.\n    ${ }^{27}$ The grazing set for $b=(1,1,0)$ has a cusp similar to that for $b=(1,-1,0)$.\n\n4.5.2. A grazing set that is $C^{1}$ but not twice differentiable for incoming spherical waves. Take $F(u, v)=1-G(u, v)$, where $G(u, v)=u^{4}+v^{4}$. The incoming phase is $\\phi_{i}=$ $-t+|x-b|$, where $b=(1,-1,0)$. Here again $\\underline{\\sigma}=i^{*}(1,0, t, 0,-\\bar{b},-1) \\in G_{d}^{4} \\backslash G^{5}$. In this case $-G$ is strictly concave but the assumption (4.8) of Theorem 6 fails; we only have $-\\nabla^{2} G \\geq 0$ for $(u, v) \\neq 0$. The grazing curve is now\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{H}(u, v)=3\\left(u^{4}+v^{4}\\right)+4 u^{3}=0 \\\\\n& \\Rightarrow u=-3^{1 / 3} v^{4 / 3}(4+3 u)^{-1 / 3} \\Rightarrow u \\sim v^{4 / 3} \\text { for }(u, v) \\text { near } 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOne checks as in $\\S 4.5 .1$ that this equation determines $u$ as a function of $v$ near $(u, v)=0$. The second line of (4.40) implies $u^{\\prime}(0)=0$ and the implicit function theorem shows that in $v \\neq 0$ the function $u(v)$ is $C^{1}$, so now we have $u(v)$ is differentiable near $v=0$.\n\nTo see that $u$ is $C^{1}$ near $v=0$ rewrite $\\mathcal{H}(u, v)=0$ as $u\\left(4 u^{2}+3 u^{3}\\right)=-3 v^{4}$ and differentiate with respect to $v$ obtaining\n\n$$\nu^{\\prime}\\left(4 u^{2}+3 u^{3}\\right)+u\\left(8 u u^{\\prime}+9 u^{2} u^{\\prime}\\right)=u^{\\prime}\\left(12 u^{2}+12 u^{3}\\right)=-12 v^{3}\n$$\n\nFor $v \\neq 0$ small divide by $12 u^{2}+12 u^{3}$ and use (4.40) to see that\n\n$$\n\\left|u^{\\prime}(v)\\right| \\sim\\left|v^{3} / u^{2}\\right| \\sim v^{1 / 3}\n$$\n\nThus $u$ is $C^{1}$ near 0 .\nFrom (4.42) it is clear that the limit defining $u^{\\prime \\prime}(0)$ does not exist. We can get more information by differentiating (4.41) with respect to $v$ to obtain\n\n$$\n\\left|u^{\\prime \\prime}(v)\\right| \\sim v^{-2 / 3} \\text { for } v \\neq 0\n$$\n\nRemark 4.12. In the above example the function $g(u, v)$ as in (4.12) is\n\n$$\ng(u, v)=4 u^{3}=\\left.v^{3} \\tilde{g}(z)\\right|_{z=\\frac{u}{v}}, \\text { where } \\tilde{g}(z)=4 z^{3}\n$$\n\nso $\\tilde{g}$ now has a triple root. This and the failure of $\\zeta=u-u(v)$ to be $C^{\\infty}$ (or even $C^{2}$ ) reflect the fact that $\\nabla^{2}\\left(u^{4}+v^{4}\\right)$ fails to be positive definite for $(u, v) \\neq 0$; it is only positive semidefinite for $(u, v) \\neq 0$.\n\nTo conclude $\\S 4$ we return for a moment to the case of incoming plane waves to provide a couple of examples we had not found at the time of writing of [WW23].\n4.5.3.

{"section_id": 9, "text": "# 5. THE REFLECTED FLOW MAP FOR GENERAL CONVEX INCOMING WAVES \n\nWe show in this section that the computations of section 3 can be generalized to a larger class of incoming waves. Suppose $\\mathcal{O}$ is a convex obstacle given by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}:=\\left\\{\\left(x_{1}, \\bar{x}\\right) \\mid x_{1}<F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $F: \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a $C^{\\infty}$ strictly concave function. We can arrange by translation and rotation of $\\mathcal{O}$ so that $F$ has a max at $\\bar{x}=0$ with $F(0)=1$. The tangent plane to $\\partial \\mathcal{O}$ at $\\left(x_{1}, \\bar{x}\\right)=(1,0)$ is then $x_{1}=1$.\n\nWe consider incoming phases of the form\n\n$$\n\\phi_{i}(x)=-t+\\psi_{i}(x),\\left(\\partial_{x_{1}} \\psi_{i}\\right)^{2}+\\left|\\nabla \\psi_{i}\\right|^{2}=1\n$$\n\nwhere $\\psi_{i}$ is a convex function. In what follows the notation $\\nabla$ always means $\\nabla_{\\bar{x}}$.\nAssumption 5.1. Let $F$ and $\\mathcal{O}$ be as just described. Assume there exists $r>0$, an $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$-open set $\\Omega \\ni(1,0)$, and a $C^{\\infty}$ function $\\psi: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { (a) } \\Omega \\cap \\partial \\mathcal{O}=\\{(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}): \\bar{x} \\in B(0, r)\\} \\\\\n& \\text { (b) }\\left|\\nabla \\psi_{i}\\right|=1 \\text { and } \\psi_{i} \\text { is convex on } \\Omega\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRemark. We can obtain a large supply of functions $\\psi_{i}$ satisfying the conditions of Assumption 5.1 as follows. Let $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be any open convex set with $C^{\\infty}$ boundary $\\partial \\mathcal{C}$. It is well-known that the distance-to-the-boundary function $\\psi_{i}(x)=-\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\partial C)$ is smooth, convex, and satisfies $\\left|\\nabla \\psi_{i}\\right|=1$ for points of $\\mathcal{C}$ sufficiently near $\\partial \\mathcal{C}$. When $\\partial \\mathcal{C}$ is a plane, the incoming waves determined by (5.1) are plane waves; when $\\partial \\mathcal{C}$ is a sphere, the incoming waves are spherical waves, and so on.\n\nIf the incoming bicharacteristics $\\gamma_{i}$ hit the cotangent bundle on the space-time boundary at $\\left(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t, \\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x}), \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x}),-1\\right)$, then there must hold\n\n$$\n\\xi_{1}^{i}(\\bar{x})=\\partial_{x_{1}} \\psi_{i}(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}), \\bar{\\xi}^{i}(\\bar{x})=\\nabla \\psi_{i}(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x})\n$$\n\nThe grazing set and the illuminable set are\n\n$$\nG_{\\phi_{i}}=\\left\\{(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t) \\mid\\left\\langle\\bar{\\xi}^{i}, \\nabla F\\right\\rangle-\\xi_{1}^{i}=0\\right\\}, I_{-}=\\left\\{(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}, t) \\mid\\left\\langle\\bar{\\xi}^{i}, \\nabla F\\right\\rangle-\\xi_{1}^{i}>0\\right\\}\n$$\n\nFix any $T>0$ and any $r_{1}<r$ for $r$ as in Assumption 5.1. In (5.3) and the rest of this section we take $\\bar{x} \\in \\overline{B\\left(0, r_{1}\\right)}$ and $t \\in[-T, T]$.\nLemma 5.2. Let $\\Psi(\\bar{x}):=\\psi_{i}(F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x})$. If the incoming phase satisfies Assumption 5.1, then:\n\n1. The matrix\n\n$$\n\\nabla^{2} \\Psi-\\xi_{1}^{i} \\nabla^{2} F=\\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\xi}^{i}}{\\partial \\bar{x}}+\\nabla F \\otimes \\nabla \\xi_{1}^{i}\n$$\n\nis symmetric and positive semi-definite.\n2. The incoming directions $\\xi^{i}$ are non-focusing: for $\\bar{x}^{*}, \\bar{x}$ in the $\\bar{x}$-projection of $G_{\\phi_{i}} \\cup I$, the following holds\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\left(F\\left(\\bar{x}^{*}\\right)-F(\\bar{x}), \\bar{x}^{*}-\\bar{x}\\right), \\xi^{i}\\left(\\bar{x}^{*}\\right)-\\xi^{i}(\\bar{x})\\right\\rangle \\geq 0\n$$\n\nProof. 1.
