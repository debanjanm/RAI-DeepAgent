      "text": "## 1. Introduction\n\nMean field game (MFG) theory concerns the study and analysis of dynamic games involving a large number of indistinguishable agents who are asymptotically negligible. In such games, each agent is weakly coupled with other agents through the empirical distribution of their states or control inputs. The mathematical limit of this distribution, as the number of agents approaches infinity, is referred to as the mean field distribution. In these games, the behavior of agents in large populations, along with the resulting equilibrium, may be approximated by the solution of corresponding infinite-population games (see, e.g., [1-6]).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ D.

Liu would like to acknowledge the support of GERAD and IVADO through, respectively, Doctoral Scholarship 2023-2024, and the NSERC-CREATE Program on Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance and Business Analytics (Fin-ML CREATE).\n\nOriginally developed in finite-dimensional spaces, MFGs have become pivotal in addressing large-scale problems involving numerous interacting agents, and have found extensive applications in economics and finance (see, e.g. [7-13]).\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where Euclidean spaces do not adequately capture the essence of a problem such as non-Markovian systems. A clear and intuitive example is systems involving time delays. For instance, consider the interbank market model initially introduced in [7], where the logarithmic monetary reserve (state) of each bank is driven by its rate of borrowing or lending (control action). An extension of this model, studied in [14], incorporates a scenario where each bank must make a repayment after a specific period, drawing inspirations from [15]. This modification introduces delayed control actions into the state dynamics. Consequently, the state process is lifted to an infinite-dimensional function space (for Markovian lifting of stochastic delay equations see e.g. [16]). However, due to a gap in the literature on infinite-dimensional MFGs, [14] merely assumes the existence of the mean field in the infinite-population model.\n\nBeyond practical motivations, investigating MFGs in infinite-dimensional spaces offers an interesting mathematical perspective due to the distinctive treatment required compared to Euclidean spaces. In such spaces, the evolution of a stochastic process is governed by an infinite-dimensional stochastic equation (see e.g. [16, 17]). These equations, also termed stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), form a powerful mathematical framework for modeling dynamical systems with infinite-dimensional states and noises. In other words, these equations describe the evolution of random processes in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The extension to infinite dimensions becomes essential when dealing with phenomena that exhibit spatial or temporal complexities at various scales, such as fluid dynamics and quantum field theory.\n\nSingle-agent optimal control problems in Hilbert spaces have been well-studied in the past (see, e.g., [18-22] for the LQ setting.). Recent works [23, 24] develop a framework in which optimal control problems over large-size networks are approximated by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations driven by $Q$-noise processes in $L^{2}[0,1]$. Moreover, McKean-Vlasov control problems in Hilbert spaces have recently been studied in [25]. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few works related to mean field games in Hilbert spaces. Besides [14] (where the noise processes are real Brownian motions), the contemporaneous work [26] studies a limiting mean field game system involving a constant volatility and a cylindrical Wiener process in Hilbert spaces, where the existence and uniqueness of the solution on both small and arbitrary time intervals are discussed.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive study of LQ MFGs in Hilbert spaces, where the state equation of each agent is modeled by an infinite-dimensional stochastic equation (for classic LQ MFGs with $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$-valued state and control processes extensively studied in the literature we refer to $[2,27-37]$ ). Specifically, we consider an $N$-player game where the dynamics of agents are modeled by coupled linear stochastic evolution equations in a Hilbert space, with coupling occurring through the empirical average of the states. Each agent aims to minimize a quadratic cost functional, which is also affected by the empirical average of states. The contributions of the current paper can be summarized as follows.\n(i) We study a general $N$-player LQ game. In particular, the state equation of each agent is influenced by the average state in the drift coefficient and incorporates Hilbert space-valued $Q$-Wiener processes and an unbounded system operator. Additionally, the volatility of each agent involves the state, control, and average state processes, resulting in stochastic volatility and multiplicative noise.\n(ii) To ensure the well-posedness of the Hilbert space-valued $N$-player game described above, we establish regularity results for a system of $N$ coupled semilinear stochastic evolution equations\n\nin Hilbert spaces. The dynamics of the $N$-player game studied falls as a special case within this system.\n(iii) We study the limiting problem where the number of agents goes to infinity. Establishing a Nash equilibrium for this model involves identifying a unique fixed point within an appropriate function space. To achieve this, we develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence. The model studied in [26] can be viewed as a special case of the limiting MFG model addressed in the current paper (see Section 4.2). However, due to the different methodologies used, our required conditions and results regarding the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point differ from those established in [26].\n(iv) We study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting mean field game, demonstrating that the Nash equilibrium strategies obtained in the limiting case form an $\\epsilon$ Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within $\\epsilon=o(1 / \\sqrt{N})$ when agents follow these strategies.\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the notations and some preliminaries in infinite-dimensional stochastic calculus to ensure the paper is self-contained and accessible. Section 3 presents the regularity results for coupled stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. Section 4 addresses MFGs in Hilbert spaces including optimal control in the limiting case, the fixed-point argument, and both Nash and $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. Finally, Section 5 examines a toy model inspired by the model presented in [14] and discusses potential extensions.",

      "text": "# 2. Preliminaries in Infinite-Dimensional Stochastic Calculus\n### 2.1. Notations and Basic Definitions\n\nWe denote by $\\left(H,\\langle\\cdot\\rangle_{H}\\right)$ and $\\left(V,\\langle\\cdot\\rangle_{V}\\right)$ two separable Hilbert spaces (we drop the letter subscripts in the notation when they are clear from the context). By convention, we use $|\\cdot|$, to denote the norm in usual normed spaces and $\\|\\cdot\\|$, to denote the operator norm in operator spaces. Moreover, we denote the space of all bounded linear operators from $V$ to $H$ by $\\mathcal{L}(V, H)$, which is a Banach space equipped with the norm $\\|\\mathrm{T}\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(V, H)}=\\sup _{|x|_{V}=1}|\\mathrm{~T} x|_{H}$. Let $\\left\\{e_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ denote an orthonormal basis of $V$, where $\\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of natural numbers. The space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators from $V$ to $H$, denoted $\\mathcal{L}_{2}(V, H)$, is defined as $\\mathcal{L}_{2}(V, H):=\\left\\{\\mathrm{T} \\in \\mathcal{L}(V, H): \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left|\\mathrm{T} e_{i}\\right|_{H}^{2}<\\infty\\right\\}$, where $\\left|\\mathrm{T} e_{i}\\right|_{H}=\\sqrt{\\left\\langle\\mathrm{T} e_{i}, \\mathrm{~T} e_{i}\\right\\rangle_{H}}$. Note that $\\mathcal{L}_{2}(V, H)$ is a separable Hilbert space equipped with the inner product $\\langle\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{S}\\rangle_{2}:=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left\\langle\\mathrm{T} e_{i}, \\mathrm{~S} e_{i}\\right\\rangle_{H}$ for all $\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{S} \\in \\mathcal{L}_{2}(V, H)$. This inner product does not depend on the choice of the basis.\n\nMoreover, an operator $\\mathrm{T} \\in \\mathcal{L}(V, H)$ is called trace class if T admits the representation $\\mathrm{T} x=$ $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} b_{i}\\left\\langle a_{i}, x\\right\\rangle_{V}$, where $\\left\\{a_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\left\\{b_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ are two sequences in $V$ and $H$, respectively, such that $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left|a_{i}\\right|_{V}\\left|b_{i}\\right|_{H}<\\infty$. We denote the set of trace class operators from $V$ to $H$ by $\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V, H)$, which is a separable Banach space equipped with the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V, H)}$ defined as\n\n$$\n\\|\\mathrm{T}\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V, H)}:=\\inf \\left\\{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left|a_{i}\\right|_{V}\\left|b_{i}\\right|_{H}:\\left\\{a_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in V,\\left\\{b_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\in H \\text { and } \\mathrm{T} x=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} b_{i}\\left\\langle a_{i}, x\\right\\rangle_{V}, \\forall x \\in V\\right\\}\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)$ denotes the space of operators acting on $H$, which may be equivalently expressed as $\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V, V)$. For an operator $Q \\in \\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)$, the trace of $Q$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(Q)=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left\\langle Q e_{i}, e_{i}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe series converges absolutely, i.e., $\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\left|\\left\\langle Q e_{i}, e_{i}\\right\\rangle\\right|<\\infty$. Furthermore, it can be shown that $|\\operatorname{tr}(Q)| \\leq\\|Q\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)}$. For more details on Hilbert-Schmidt and trace class operators, we refer the reader to [38], [16] and [39].\n\nWe use $\\mathrm{T}^{*}$ to denote an adjoint operator which is the unique operator that satisfies $\\langle\\mathrm{T} x, y\\rangle=$ $\\left\\langle x, \\mathrm{~T}^{*} y\\right\\rangle$ for a linear operator T and all vectors $x$ and $y$ in the appropriate spaces.\n\nLet $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mu)$ be a measure space and $\\left(\\mathcal{X},\\left|\\cdot\\right|_{\\mathcal{X}}\\right)$ be a Banach space. We denote by $L^{p}(\\mathcal{S} ; \\mathcal{X}), 1 \\leq$ $p \\leq \\infty$, the corresponding Bochner spaces, which generalize the classic $L^{p}(\\mathcal{S} ; \\mathbb{R})$ spaces. For details on Bochner spaces, we refer to [40]. We fix the time interval $\\mathcal{T}=[0, T]$ with $T>0$. We denote $C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$ as the set of all continuous mappings $h: \\mathcal{T} \\rightarrow H$, a Banach space equipped with the supremum norm, and $C_{s}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{L}(H))$ as the set of all strongly continuous mappings $f: \\mathcal{T} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(H)$.\nDefinition 2.1 ( $Q$-Wiener Process [16]), Let $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ be a fixed complete probability space. Additionally, $Q \\in \\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)$ and is a positive operator, i.e. $Q$ is self-adjoint and $\\langle Q x, x\\rangle \\geq 0, \\forall x \\in V$. Then, a $V$-valued stochastic process $W=\\{W(t): t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\}$ is called a $Q$-Wiener process if\n(i) $W(0)=0, \\mathbb{P}-$ a.s.,\n(ii) $W$ has continuous trajectories,\n(iii) $W$ has independent increments,\n(iv) $\\forall s, t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ such that $0<s<t$, the increment $W(t)-W(s)$ is normally distributed. More specifically, $W(t)-W(s) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,(t-s) Q)$.\n\nA $V$-valued $Q$-Wiener process $W$ may be constructed as\n\n$$\nW(t)=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\sqrt{\\lambda_{j}} \\beta_{j}(t) e_{j}, \\quad t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left\\{\\beta_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of mutually independent real-valued Brownian motions defined on a given filtered probability space. Moreover, $\\left\\{e_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a complete orthonormal basis of $V$ and $\\left\\{\\lambda_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of positive numbers that diagonalize the operator $Q$. Moreover, $\\left\\{\\lambda_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of positive numbers, and $\\left\\{e_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a complete orthonormal basis of $V$ that, together, diagonalize the operator $Q$. In other words, for each $j \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\lambda_{j}$ is an eigenvalue of $Q$ corresponding to the eigenvector $e_{j}$ such that\n\n$$\nQ e_{j}=\\lambda_{j} e_{j}\n$$\n\nNote that in this case, we have $\\operatorname{tr}(Q)=\\|Q\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)}$ since $Q$ is a positive operator. Moreover, the series in (2.1) converges in $L^{2}(\\Omega, C(\\mathcal{T}, V))[17]$.\n\nConsider the probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ where the filtration $\\mathcal{F}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$ satisfies the usual condition. Similarly to the literature (see e.g. $[16,17,39]$ ), we assume that $W$, defined in (2.1), is a $Q$-Wiener process with respect to $\\mathcal{F}$, i.e. $W(t)$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable, and $W(t+h)-W(t)$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{t}, \\forall h \\geq 0, \\forall t, t+h \\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nWe denote by $V_{Q}=Q^{\\frac{1}{2}} V$ the separable Hilbert space endowed with the inner product\n\n$$\n\\langle u, v\\rangle_{V_{Q}}=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{j}}\\left\\langle u, e_{j}\\right\\rangle_{V}\\left\\langle v, e_{j}\\right\\rangle_{V}, \\quad u, v \\in V_{Q}\n$$\n\nNote that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{L}(V, H) \\subseteq \\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right) \\\\\n& \\|\\mathrm{T}\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right)}^{2} \\leq \\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|\\mathrm{T}\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(V, H)}^{2}, \\quad \\forall \\mathrm{~T} \\in \\mathcal{L}(V, H)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBelow, we introduce certain spaces of stochastic processes defined on a filtered probability space $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathcal{G}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{G}_{t}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ with values in a Banach space $\\left(\\left.\\mathcal{X},\\right|_{\\left.\\mathcal{X}\\right)}\\right.$.\n\n- $\\mathcal{M}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X})$ denotes the Banach space of all $\\mathcal{X}$-valued progressively measurable processes $x(t)$ satisfying\n\n$$\n|x|_{\\mathcal{M}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X})}:=\\left(\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}|x(t)|_{\\mathcal{X}}^{2} d t\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}<\\infty\n$$\n\n- $\\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X})$ denotes the Banach space of all $\\mathcal{X}$-valued progressively measurable processes $x(t)$ satisfying\n\n$$\n|x|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X})}=\\left(\\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}|x(t)|_{\\mathcal{X}}^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}<\\infty\n$$\n\nObviously, $\\mathcal{H}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{X})$. Furthermore, $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{X})$ denotes the Borel sigma-algebra on the space $\\mathcal{X}$.",

      "text": "# 3. Coupled Controlled Stochastic Evolution Equations in Hilbert Space \n\nIn classical mean field games (MFGs), the dynamics of the relevant $N$-player game is modeled as a system of finite-dimensional SDEs, the regularities of which are well-studied in the literature. However, in this paper, the dynamics of the $N$-player game will be modeled as $N$ coupled infinitedimensional stochastic equations. To be more specific, the state of each agent satisfies an infinitedimensional stochastic equation which is involved with the states of all agents. The well-posedness of such a system has not been rigorously established in the literature. Thus, we aim to address it in this section. For this purpose, we first discuss the existence of a sequence of independent $Q$-Wiener processes. Next, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to a system of $N$ coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic equations.\n\nMore precisely, in the classic setup of MFGs, the individual idiosyncratic noises form a sequence of independent real-valued Brownian motions. In the current context, however, we require a sequence of independent $Q$-Wiener processes. The following proposition examines the existence of such a sequence.\n\nProposition 3.1. Let $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $Q$ be a positive trace class operator on the separable Hilbert space $V$. Then, there exists a sequence of independent $V$-valued $Q$-Wiener processes $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ defined on the given probability space.\n\nProof. Let $W,\\left\\{\\beta_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be the processes defined in (2.1), and the corresponding natural filtrations be defined as $\\mathcal{F}^{W}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{W}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{\\beta}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$, where $\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{W}=\\sigma(W(s), 0 \\leq s \\leq t)$, $\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta}=\\sigma\\left(\\beta_{j}(s), 0 \\leq s \\leq t, j \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right)=\\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\sigma\\left(\\beta_{j}(s), 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\right)\\right)$. Subsequently, the augmented filtrations $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}^{W}=\\left\\{\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}_{t}^{W}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$ and $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}^{\\beta}=\\left\\{\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}_{t}^{\\beta}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$ consist of $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}_{t}^{W}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{W} \\cup \\mathcal{N}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta} \\cup \\mathcal{N}\\right)$. It is evident that $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}_{t}^{W}=\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta}$. By applying the enumeration of $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ to the sequence of mutually independent Brownian motions $\\left\\{\\beta_{j}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, we can obtain infinitely many distinct sequences of Brownian motions $\\left\\{\\beta_{j}^{i}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}=\\left\\{\\beta_{1}^{i}, \\beta_{2}^{i}, \\ldots, \\beta_{j}^{i}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, each sequence indexed by $i$. The real-valued Brownian motions $\\beta_{j}^{i}$ are mutually independent for all indices $i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Now we construct a sequence of Q-Wiener processes $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, where $W_{i}(t)$ is defined by\n\n$$\nW_{i}(t)=\\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\sqrt{\\lambda_{j}} \\beta_{j}^{i}(t) e_{j}, \\quad t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n$$\n\nFor our purpose, it is enough to show that the augmented filtrations $\\left\\{\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ are independent. Recall that $\\mathcal{F}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}: t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$, where $\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}=\\sigma\\left(\\bigcup_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\sigma\\left(\\beta_{j}^{i}(s), 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\right)\\right)$ and $\\left\\{\\beta_{j}^{i}\\right\\}_{j, i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ are independent Brownian motions. Then the independence of $\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}, \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, follows from the standard results in measure theory (see for instance [44, Proposition 10.1.7]), and hence $\\left\\{\\overline{\\mathcal{F}}_{t}^{\\beta^{\\prime}}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}, \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ are also independent.\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the sequence of processes $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, constructed in Proposition 3.1, are (mutually independent) $Q$-Wiener processes with respect to $\\mathcal{F}$. This measurability arises because each $W_{i}$ is constructed using a subsequence of real-valued Brownian motions generating the original $Q$-Wiener process $W$ given by (2.1). Usually, this \"universal\" filtration $\\mathcal{F}$ is larger than necessary. Below, we construct a reduced filtration.\nReduced Filtration $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}=\\left\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}^{[N]}, t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$ : Consider a set $\\mathcal{N}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, N\\}$ and let $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$ be $N$ independent $Q$-Wiener processes constructed in Proposition 3.1. A reduced filtration $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$ may be constructed under which these processes are independent $Q$-Wiener processes. Note that the processes $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$ are constructed as described in (3.1) using $N$ sequences of mutually independent Brownian motions $\\left\\{\\beta_{j}^{i}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}, i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$. These $N$ sequences may be combined to form a new sequence of mutually independent Brownian motions. We then construct a new $Q$-Wiener process $W^{N}$ using this resulting sequence as in (2.1) and define $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$ as the normal filtration that makes $W^{N}$ a $Q$ Wiener process. Clearly, this filtration only makes the processes $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$ independent $Q$-Wiener processes and can be smaller than $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nWe are now ready to introduce a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic equations defined on $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathcal{F}^{[N]}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$ describing the temporal evolution of the vector process $\\mathbf{x}=\\{\\mathbf{x}(t)=$ $\\left.\\left(x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), \\ldots, x_{N}(t)\\right), t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$. Note that $\\mathbf{x}$ is an $H^{N}$-valued stochastic process, where $H^{N}$ denotes the $N$-product space of $H$, equipped with the product norm $|\\mathbf{x}(t)|_{H^{N}}=\\left(\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}\\left|x_{i}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. Subsequently, $\\mathcal{M}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$ are defined as the spaces of all $H^{N}$-valued progressively measurable processes $\\mathbf{x}$, respectively, satisfying $|\\mathbf{x}|_{\\mathcal{M}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}<\\infty$ and $|\\mathbf{x}|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}<\\infty$.\n\nThe differential form of a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic equations can be represented by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& d x_{i}(t)=\\left(A x_{i}(t)+F_{i}\\left(t, \\mathbf{x}(t), u_{i}(t)\\right)\\right) d t+B_{i}\\left(t, \\mathbf{x}(t), u_{i}(t)\\right) d W_{i}(t) \\\\\n& x_{i}(0)=\\xi_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere, as defined in (2.6), $A$ is a $C_{0}$-semigroup generator. Moreover, the control action $u_{i}, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, is a $U$-valued progressively measurable process, and the initial condition $\\xi_{i}, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, is $H$-valued and $\\mathcal{F}_{0}^{[N]}$-measurable. Moreover, $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$ is a set of mutually independent $Q$-Wiener processes, each constructed as in Proposition 3.1 and applied to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$. Furthermore, the family of maps $F_{i}: \\mathcal{T} \\times H^{N} \\times U \\rightarrow H$ and $B_{i}: \\mathcal{T} \\times H^{N} \\times U \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right), \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, are defined for all $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\nA3.1. For each $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, the initial condition $\\xi_{i}$ belongs to $L^{2}(\\Omega ; H)$ and is $\\mathcal{F}_{0}^{[N]}$-measurable.\nWe focus on the solution of (3.2) in a mild sense, which is defined below.\nDefinition 3.1. (Mild Solution of Coupled Infinite-Dimensional SDEs) A process $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$, where $\\boldsymbol{x}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\\left(x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), \\ldots, x_{N}(t)\\right), t \\in \\mathcal{T}\\right\\}$, is said to be a mild solution of (3.2) if, for each $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, the process $x_{i}$ is defined $\\mathbb{P}$-almost surely by the integral equation\n\n$$\nx_{i}(t)=S(t) \\xi_{i}+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{i}\\left(r, \\boldsymbol{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B_{i}\\left(r, \\boldsymbol{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d W_{i}(r), \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n$$\n\nwhere $S(t)$ is the $C_{0}$-semigroup generated by $A$.\n\nWe make the following assumptions on the system of coupled stochastic evolution systems described by (3.2) for every $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$.\nA3.2. $u_{i} \\in \\mathcal{M}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; U)$.\nA3.3. The mapping $F_{i}: \\mathcal{T} \\times H^{N} \\times U \\rightarrow H$ is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{T}) \\otimes \\mathcal{B}\\left(H^{N}\\right) \\otimes \\mathcal{B}(U) / \\mathcal{B}(H)$-measurable.\nA3.4. The mapping $B_{i}: \\mathcal{T} \\times H^{N} \\times U \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right)$ is $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{T}) \\otimes \\mathcal{B}\\left(H^{N}\\right) \\otimes \\mathcal{B}(U) / \\mathcal{B}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right)\\right)$ measurable, where the Hilbert space $V_{Q}$ is as defined in Section 2.\nA3.5. There exists a constant $C$ such that, for every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}, u \\in U$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y} \\in H^{N}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|F_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{x}, u)-F_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{y}, u)\\right|_{H}+\\left\\|B_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{x}, u)-B_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{y}, u)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}} \\leq C|\\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{y}|_{H^{N}} \\\\\n\\left|F_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{x}, u)\\right|_{H}^{2}+\\left\\|B_{i}(t, \\boldsymbol{x}, u)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}}^{2} \\leq C^{2}\\left(1+|\\boldsymbol{x}|_{H^{N}}^{2}+|u|_{U}^{2}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe following theorem establishes the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the coupled stochastic evolution equations given by (3.2). This result extends Theorem 7.2 in [16], which addresses the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution for a single stochastic evolution equation without coupling.\nTheorem 3.2. (Existence and Uniqueness of a Mild Solution) Under A3.2-A3.5, the set of coupled stochastic evolution equations given by (3.2) admits a unique mild solution in the space $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$.\nProof. The existence and uniqueness of a mild solution can be established through the classic fixedpoint argument for a mapping from $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$. To this end, for any given element $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$, the operator $\\Gamma$ is defined component-wise as\n\n$$\n\\Gamma \\mathbf{x}(t)=\\left(\\Gamma_{1} \\mathbf{x}(t), \\Gamma_{2} \\mathbf{x}(t), \\ldots, \\Gamma_{N} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere each component $\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)$ is represented by the integral equation\n\n$$\n\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)=S(t) \\xi_{i}+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d W_{i}(r)\n$$\n\nWe show that $\\Gamma$ indeed maps $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$ into itself. The measurability of (3.4) as an $H$-valued process is established using the standard argument found in [16] and [17], based on our assumptions. This is because $F_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ are progressively measurable processes, valued in $H$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{2}\\left(V_{Q}, H\\right)$, respectively. We use the inequality $|a+b+c|^{2} \\leq 3|a|^{2}+3|b|^{2}+3|c|^{2}$, for each $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} \\leq & 3 \\mathbb{E}\\left|S(t) \\xi_{i}\\right|_{H}^{2}+3 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d r\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& +3 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d W_{i}(r)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the Bochner integral in (3.5), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d r\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] & \\leq T \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\left|S(t-r) F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right|_{H}^{2} d r\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq T \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\|S(t-r)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(H)}^{2}\\left|F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right|_{H}^{2} d r\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq T M_{T}^{2} C^{2} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\left|(\\mathbf{x}(r))_{H^{N}}^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(r)\\right|_{U}^{2}+1\\right) d r\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality results from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For the stochastic integral in (3.5), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right) d W_{i}(r)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] & \\leq C^{\\prime} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\left\\|B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}}^{2} d r\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq C^{2} C^{\\prime} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(|\\mathbf{x}(r)|_{H^{N}}^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(r)\\right|_{U}^{2}+1\\right) d r\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality is obtained by the standard approximation technique for stochastic convolutions (see e.g. [16, Theorem 4.36] and [17, Corollary 3.2]) in the current context for every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ and $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$. Note that the constant $C^{\\prime}$ only depends on $T$ and $M_{T}$ (defined in (2.7)). Substituting (3.6) and (3.7) in (3.5), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} & \\leq 3 \\mathbb{E}\\left|S(t) \\xi_{i}\\right|_{H}^{2}+3\\left(C^{2} C^{\\prime}+T M_{T}^{2} C^{2}\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(|\\mathbf{x}(r)|_{H^{N}}^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(r)\\right|_{U}^{2}+1\\right) d r\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq 3 \\mathbb{E}\\left|S(t) \\xi_{i}\\right|_{H}^{2}+3\\left(C^{2} C^{\\prime}+T M_{T}^{2} C^{2}\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\left(|\\mathbf{x}(r)|_{H^{N}}^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(r)\\right|_{U}^{2}+1\\right) d r\\right], \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} \\leq & 3 M_{T}^{2} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|\\xi_{i}\\right|_{H}^{2}+3\\left(C^{2} C^{\\prime}+T M_{T}^{2} C^{2}\\right) \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\left(\\left|u_{i}(r)\\right|_{U}^{2}\\right) d r\\right] \\\\\n& +3 N\\left(C^{2} C^{\\prime}+T M_{T}^{2} C^{2}\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\left(|\\mathbf{x}(r)|_{H^{N}}^{2}+1\\right) d r\\right], \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom (3.9), we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\Gamma \\mathbf{x}\\right|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}=\\left(\\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}<\\infty\n$$\n\nThus, the transformation $\\Gamma$ is well-defined and maps $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$ into itself. The remaining part of the proof is to show that the mapping $\\Gamma$ is a contraction, that is, for any two elements $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in$ $\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)$, it holds that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\Gamma \\mathbf{y}-\\Gamma \\mathbf{x}\\right|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}<\\left|\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{x}\\right|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}\n$$\n\nUsing the inequlity $|a+b|^{2} \\leq 2|a|^{2}+2|b|^{2}$, for each $i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{y}(t)-\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} \\leq & 2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)-F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{y}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right) d r\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& +2 \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)-B_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{y}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right) d W_{i}(r)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the first term on the RHS of (3.10), $\\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)-F_{i}\\left(r, \\mathbf{y}(r), u_{i}(r)\\right)\\right) d r\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] & \\leq C^{2} M_{T}^{2} T \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}|\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\mathbf{y}(t)|_{H^{N}}^{2} d t\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq C^{2} M_{T}^{2} T^{2} \\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}|\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\mathbf{y}(t)|_{H^{N}}^{2} \\\\\n& \\leq C^{2} M_{T}^{2} T^{2}|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T}, H^{N}\\right)}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the second term on the RHS of (3.10) we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B_{i}(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r))-B_{i}(r, \\mathbf{y}(r), u_{i}(r))\\right) d W_{i}(r)\\right|_{H}^{2}\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq C^{\\prime} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\left\\|B_{i}(r, \\mathbf{x}(r), u_{i}(r))-B_{i}(r, \\mathbf{y}(r), u_{i}(r))\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}}^{2} d r\\right] \\\\\n& \\leq M_{T}^{2} C^{\\prime} C^{2} T\\left(\\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}|\\mathbf{x}(t)-\\mathbf{y}(t)|_{H^{N}}^{2}\\right) \\\\\n& \\leq M_{T}^{2} C^{\\prime} C^{2} T|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}^{2}, \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBased on (3.10) to (3.12), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{y}(t)-\\Gamma_{i} \\mathbf{x}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} \\leq 2 N M_{T}^{2} C^{2} T\\left(C^{\\prime}+T\\right)|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}^{2}, \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}\n$$\n\nand subsequently\n\n$$\n\\left|\\Gamma \\mathbf{y}-\\Gamma \\mathbf{x}\\right|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}^{2} \\leq 2 N M_{T}^{2} C^{2} T\\left(C^{\\prime}+T\\right)|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}\\left(\\mathcal{T} ; H^{N}\\right)}^{2}\n$$\n\nBy employing the same argument as in Theorem 7.2 of [16], if $T$ is sufficiently small, then the mapping $\\Gamma$ is a contraction.

An alternative approach to prove Theorem 3.2 could involve formulating the set of $N$ stochastic evolution equations as a single $H^{N}$-valued equation. This requires defining appropriate operators between the associated spaces and verifying that a valid $H^{N}$-valued Wiener process can be constructed using $\\left\\{W_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$. Such a reformulation also involves technical considerations. Following this, the existence and uniqueness of the solution may be established by adapting existing results related to single stochastic evolution equations.",

Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games\n### 4.1. $N$-Player Game in Hilbert Space\n\nWe consider a differential game in Hilbert spaces defined on $\\left(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\mathcal{F}^{[N]}, \\mathbb{P}\\right)$, where $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$ is constructed in Section 3. This game involves $N$ asymptotically negligible (minor) agents, whose dynamics are governed by a system of coupled stochastic evolution equations, each given by the linear form of (3.2). More precisely, the dynamics of a representative agent indexed by $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd x_{i}(t) & =\\left(A x_{i}(t)+B u_{i}(t)+F_{1} x^{(N)}(t)\\right) d t+\\left(D x_{i}(t)+E u_{i}(t)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(t)+\\sigma\\right) d W_{i}(t) \\\\\nx_{i}(0) & =\\xi_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the agents are coupled through the term $x^{(N)}(t):=\\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} x_{i}(t)\\right)$, which represents the average state of the $N$ agents. We assume that all agents are homogeneous and share the same operators. Specifically, $F_{1} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H), F_{2} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H ; \\mathcal{L}(V ; H))$ and $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{L}(V ; H)$ and all other operators are as defined in (2.6). In addition to A3.1, we impose the following assumption for the initial conditions.\n\nA4.1. The initial conditions $\\left\\{\\xi_{i}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}$ are i.i.d. with $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\xi_{i}\\right]=\\bar{\\xi}$.\n\nA4.2. (Filtration $\\mathcal{G}$ Admissible Control) The filtration available to agent $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, is $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$. Subsequently, the set of admissible control actions for agent $i$, denoted by $\\mathcal{U}^{[N]}$, is defined as the collection of $\\mathcal{F}^{[N]}$-adapted control laws $u^{i}$ that belong to $\\mathcal{M}^{2}(\\mathcal{T} ; U)$.\n\nClearly, the system described by (4.1) satisfies the assumptions A3.2-A3.5 and its well-posedness is ensured by Theorem 3.2 .\n\nMoreover, agent $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, aims to minimize the cost functional\n\n$$\nJ_{i}^{[N]}\\left(u_{i}, u_{-i}\\right)=\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left(\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{i}(t)-\\widehat{F}_{1} x^{(N)}(t)\\right)\\right|^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}\\right) d t+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{i}(T)-\\widehat{F}_{2} x^{(N)}(T)\\right)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $M$ and $G$ are positive operators on $H$, and $\\widehat{F}_{1}, \\widehat{F}_{2} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H)$. We note that a positive operator can be added to the quadratic term associated with the control process in the cost functional. However, this operator must satisfy specific conditions to ensure that its inverse is also a welldefined positive operator. To avoid further complexity in the notation, we use the identity operator in this work.\n\nIn general, solving the $N$-player differential game described in this section becomes challenging, even for moderate values of $N$ and for finite-dimensional cases. The interactions between agents lead to a large-scale optimization problem, where each agent needs to observe the states of all other interacting agents. To address the dimensionality and the information restriction, following the classical MFG methodology, we investigate the limiting problem as the number of agents $N$ tends to infinity. In this limiting model, the average behavior of the agents, known as the mean field, can be mathematically characterized, simplifying the problem. Specifically, in the limiting case, a generic agent interacts with the mean field, rather than a large number of agents. Furthermore, the mean field happens to coincide with the mean state of the agent. In the subsequent sections, we develop the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a Nash equilibrium for the limiting game in Hilbert spaces. We then demonstrate that this equilibrium yields an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the original $N$-player game.",

      "text": "# 4.2.1. Mappings Associated with Riesz Representations \n\nIn this section, we introduce multiple mappings and their associated Riesz representations that will be used throughout the remainder of the paper. These mappings are the same as those defined in [18]. However, since the solution of the limiting problem heavily relies on these mappings, we include more details here. We note that in the special case where the state and control processes do not appear in the diffusion coefficient of each agent, these mappings are not required for the analysis.\n\nRecall that $Q$ is a positive trace class operator on the Hilbert space $V$. For any $\\mathcal{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H)$, it can be easily verified that the following expressions are bounded bilinear functionals on their corresponding product spaces:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D x) Q\\right), & \\forall x \\in H, u \\in U \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((D x)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D y) Q\\right), & \\forall x, y \\in H \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(E v) Q\\right), & \\forall u, v \\in U\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nMoreover, for any $\\mathcal{P} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H ; V)$, the expressions below are bounded linear functionals on $H$ and $U$, respectively:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathcal{P}(D x) Q), & \\forall x \\in H \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathcal{P}(E u) Q), & \\forall u \\in U\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nDefinition 4.1. (Riesz Mappings) Using the Riesz representation theorem the mappings $\\Delta_{1}$ : $\\mathcal{L}(H) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(H ; U), \\Delta_{2}: \\mathcal{L}(H) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(H)$ and $\\Delta_{3}: \\mathcal{L}(H) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{L}(U)$ are defined such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\operatorname{tr}((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D x) Q)=\\left\\langle\\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R}) x, u\\right\\rangle, & \\forall x \\in H, \\forall u \\in U, & \\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R}) \\in \\mathcal{L}(H ; U) \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((D x)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D y) Q\\right)=\\left\\langle\\Delta_{2}(\\mathcal{R}) x, y\\right\\rangle, & \\forall x, y \\in H, & \\Delta_{2}(\\mathcal{R}) \\in \\mathcal{L}(H) \\\\\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(E v) Q\\right)=\\left\\langle\\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R}) u, v\\right\\rangle, & \\forall u, v \\in U, & \\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R}) \\in \\mathcal{L}(U)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the mappings $\\Gamma_{1}: \\mathcal{L}(H ; V) \\rightarrow H$ and $\\Gamma_{2}: \\mathcal{L}(H ; V) \\rightarrow U$ are defined such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathcal{P}(D x) Q)=\\left\\langle\\Gamma_{1}(\\mathcal{P}), x\\right\\rangle, \\quad \\forall x \\in H, \\quad \\Gamma_{1}(\\mathcal{P}) \\in H \\\\\n& \\operatorname{tr}(\\mathcal{P}(E u) Q)=\\left\\langle\\Gamma_{2}(\\mathcal{P}), u\\right\\rangle, \\quad \\forall u \\in U, \\quad \\Gamma_{2}(\\mathcal{P}) \\in U\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn the following proposition, we establish the linearity and boundness of the introduced Riesz mappings.\nTheorem 4.1. The mappings $\\Delta_{k}, k=1,2,3$, and $\\Gamma_{k}, k=1,2$, are linear and bounded. Specifically, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Gamma_{1} \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{L}(H ; V) ; H) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\Gamma_{1}\\right\\| \\leq R_{1} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{1}=\\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|D\\|, \\\\\n& \\Gamma_{2} \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{L}(H ; V) ; U) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\Gamma_{2}\\right\\| \\leq R_{2} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{2}=\\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|E\\|, \\\\\n& \\Delta_{1} \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{L}(H) ; \\mathcal{L}(H ; U)) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\Delta_{1}\\right\\| \\leq R_{3} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{3}=\\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|D\\|\\|E\\|, \\\\\n& \\Delta_{2} \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{L}(H) ; \\mathcal{L}(H)) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\Delta_{2}\\right\\| \\leq R_{4} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{4}=\\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|D\\|^{2}, \\\\\n& \\Delta_{3} \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{L}(H) ; \\mathcal{L}(U)) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left\\|\\Delta_{3}\\right\\| \\leq R_{5} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{5}=\\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\|E\\|^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, for any positive operator $\\mathcal{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H)$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(I+\\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R})\\right)^{-1}\\left(B^{*} \\mathcal{R}+\\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R})\\right)\\right\\| \\leq R_{6}\\|\\mathcal{R}\\|, \\quad \\text { with } \\quad R_{6}=\\|B\\|+R_{3}\n$$\n\nProof. We present the demonstration only for the Riesz mapping $\\Delta_{1}$ and the demonstrations for other Riesz mappings follow by a similar argument. To verify the linear property, consider $\\mathcal{R}_{1}, \\mathcal{R}_{2} \\in$ $\\mathcal{L}(H)$ and $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For all $x \\in H$ and $u \\in U$, it is straightforward to check that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*}\\left(a \\mathcal{R}_{1}+b \\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right)(D x) Q\\right)=a \\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\right)(D x) Q\\right)+b \\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right)(D x) Q\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, for all $x \\in H$ and $u \\in U$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\Delta_{1}\\left(a \\mathcal{R}_{1}+b \\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right) x, u\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\left(a \\Delta_{1}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\right)+b \\Delta_{1}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right)\\right) x, u\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nfrom which we conclude that $\\Delta_{1}\\left(a \\mathcal{R}_{1}+b \\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right)=a \\Delta_{1}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{1}\\right)+b \\Delta_{1}\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{2}\\right)$. Next, by simple calculations, for all $x \\in H$, for all $u \\in U$, and $\\mathcal{R} \\in \\mathcal{L}(H)$, we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D x) Q\\right)\\right| \\leq\\left\\|(E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D x)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(V, H)}\\|Q\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{1}(V)} \\leq R_{3}\\|\\mathcal{R}\\|\\left|x\\right|_{H}|u|_{U}\n$$\n\nThus, by the Riesz representation theorem, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R})\\right\\|=\\sup _{|x|_{H}=1,|u|_{U}=1}\\left|\\operatorname{tr}\\left((E u)^{*} \\mathcal{R}(D x) Q\\right)\\right| \\leq R_{3}\\|\\mathcal{R}\\|\n$$\n\nwhich implies that $\\left\\|\\Delta_{1}\\right\\| \\leq R_{3}$. For the second part, we can easily verify that if $\\mathcal{R}$ is a positive operator on $H$, then $\\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R})$ is also a positive operator on $U$. Consequently, it follows that $\\left\\|\\left(I+\\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R})\\right)^{-1}(t)\\right\\| \\leq 1, \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left(I+\\Delta_{3}(\\mathcal{R})\\right)^{-1}\\left(B^{*} \\mathcal{R}+\\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R})\\right)\\right\\| \\leq\\left\\|B^{*} \\mathcal{R}+\\Delta_{1}(\\mathcal{R})\\right\\| \\leq R_{6}\\|\\mathcal{R}\\|\n$$",

      "text": "# 4.2.2. Optimal Control of Individual Agents \n\nIn this section, we address the optimal control problem for a representative agent described by (4.5)-(4.6). Infinite-dimensional LQ optimal control problems have been studied in works such as [18-20]. We address our specific problem by presenting the results in a compact and self-contained manner, relying on the existing literature. Due to the symmetry among all agents, we drop the index $i$.\n\nTheorem 4.2 (Optimal Control Law). Consider the mappings $\\Delta_{k}, k=1,2,3$, and $\\Gamma_{k}, k=1,2$, given in Definition 4.1, and suppose 4.1 holds. Then, the optimal control law $u^{\\circ}$ for the Hilbertspace valued system described by (4.5)-(4.6) is given by\n\n$$\nu^{\\circ}(t)=-K^{-1}(T-t)\\left[L(T-t) x(t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(p^{*}(t) \\Pi(T-t)\\right)+B^{*} q(T-t)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nK(t)=I+\\Delta_{3}(\\Pi(t)), \\quad L(t)=B^{*} \\Pi(t)+\\Delta_{1}(\\Pi(t)), \\quad p(t)=F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma\n$$\n\nwith $\\Pi \\in C_{s}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{L}(H))$, such that $\\Pi(t)$ is a positive operator $\\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, and $q \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$, each satisfying, respectively, the operator differential Riccati equation and the linear evolution equation, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{d}{d t}\\langle\\Pi(t) x, x\\rangle=2\\langle\\Pi(t) x, A x\\rangle-\\left\\langle L^{*}(t) K^{-1}(t) L(t) x, x\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle\\Delta_{2}(\\Pi(t)) x, x\\right\\rangle+\\langle M x, x\\rangle \\\\\n\\Pi(0)=G, \\quad x \\in \\mathcal{D}(A) \\\\\n\\dot{q}(t)=\\left(A^{*}-L^{*}(t) K^{-1}(t) B^{*}\\right) q(t)+\\Gamma_{1}\\left(p^{*}(T-t) \\Pi(t)\\right)-L^{*}(t) K^{-1}(t) \\Gamma_{2}\\left(p^{*}(T-t) \\Pi(t)\\right) \\\\\n+\\left(\\Pi(t) F_{1}-M \\widehat{F}_{1}\\right) g(T-t), \\quad q(0)=-G \\widehat{F}_{2} g(T)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nProof. Similar to finite-dimensional LQ control problems, the optimal control law involves a Riccati equation but in the operator form, and an offset equation which is an $H$-valued deterministic evolution equation. Consider the operator differential Riccati equation given by (4.21). We refer to [19] for the existence and uniqueness of the solution $\\Pi(t)$ to (4.21), as our problem falls within the framework studied in [19]. Specifically, from (2.9), the mild solution of (4.5) is in the same form as that of [19, eq. (2.1)]. Note that the deterministic terms in the model (4.5)-(4.6), i.e. $F_{1} g(t)$, $F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma, \\widehat{F}_{1} g(t)$ and $\\widehat{F}_{2} g(T)$, do not affect the Riccati equation (4.21). Moreover, it can be easily verified that $D_{j}$ and $E_{j}$ introduced in Remark 1 satisfy the conditions specified by [19, eq. (2.3)] and [19, eq. (2.5)], respectively. The solution $\\Pi(t)$ is a positive operator on $H$ for each $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, and is strongly continuous on $\\mathcal{T}$. Moreover, it is uniformly bounded over the interval $\\mathcal{T}$, such that $\\|\\Pi(t)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(H)} \\leq C$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$. For the case where $E=0$ in (4.5), we refer to works such as [18], [20] and [45]. Next, consider the (deterministic) linear evolution equation given by (4.22). Given that $\\Pi(t)$ and $F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma$ are bounded on the interval $\\mathcal{T}$, the terms $\\Gamma_{1}\\left(\\left(F_{2} g(T-t)+\\sigma\\right)^{*} \\Pi(t)\\right)$ and $\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} g(T-t)+\\sigma\\right)^{*} \\Pi(t)\\right)$ are also bounded over $\\mathcal{T}$. Consequently, the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to (4.22) follow from the established results for linear evolution equations [46]. Specifically, this solution lies within the space $C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$.\n\nNow, we begin to solve the corresponding control problem, described by (4.5)-(4.6). The mild solution of (2.6) is expressed as\n\n$$\nx(t)=S(t) \\xi+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B u(r)+F_{1} g(r)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(D x(r)+E u(r)+F_{2} g(r)+\\sigma\\right) d W(r)\n$$\n\nWe introduce a standard approximating sequence given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd x_{n}(t) & =\\left(A x_{n}(t)+J_{n}\\left(B u(t)+F_{1} g(t)\\right)\\right) d t+J_{n}\\left(D x_{n}(t)+E u(t)+F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma\\right) d W(t) \\\\\nx_{n}(0) & =J_{n} \\xi\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $J_{n}=n R(n, A)$, with $R(n, A)=(A-n I)^{-1}$ being the resolvent operator of $A$, is the Yosida approximation of $A$. For more details on Yosida approximation we refer to $[16,39]$.\n\nThen, the following two standard results hold for (4.23) and (4.24) (see e.g. [18, 43]). Firstly, the approximating $\\operatorname{SDE}(4.24)$ admits a strong solution, represented as\n$x_{n}(t)=J_{n} \\xi+\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(A x_{n}(r)+J_{n}\\left(B u(r)+F_{1} g(r)\\right)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} J_{n}\\left(D x_{n}(r)+E u(r)+F_{2} g(r)+\\sigma\\right) d W(r)$.\nThis means that for each $n$, there exists an adapted process $x_{n}$ that satisfies the integral form of the approximating SDE almost surely for all $t$ in the interval $\\mathcal{T}$. Secondly, the sequence of solutions $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to the mild solution $x$ of the original SDE in the mean square sense uniformly over the interval $\\mathcal{T}$, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{0 \\leq t \\leq T} \\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{n}(t)-x(t)\\right|^{2}=0\n$$\n\nThe rest of the proof follows the standard methodology as in [18], summarized in the following two steps:\n(i) Apply It\u00f4's lemma ([18, Theorem 2.1]) to $\\left(\\left\\langle\\Pi(T-t) x_{n}(t), x_{n}(t)\\right\\rangle+2\\left\\langle q(T-t), x_{n}(t)\\right\\rangle\\right)$, integrate from 0 to $T$, and substitute the corresponding terms using (4.21)-(4.22), (4.25) and Definition 4.1. Then take the expectation of both sides of the resulting equation.\n(ii) Take the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ of both sides of the expression derived in step (i) and use the convergence property (4.26).\nNote that, compared to finite-dimensional LQ control problems (see e.g. [47, Section 6.6]), we must additionally implement step (ii). This is necessary because, in general, It\u00f4's lemma applies only to the strong solutions of infinite-dimensional stochastic equations.\n\nFinally, by some standard algebraic manipulations, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nJ(u)= & \\mathbb{E}\\langle\\Pi(T) \\xi, \\xi\\rangle+2 \\mathbb{E}\\langle q(T), \\xi\\rangle+2\\left\\langle G \\widehat{F}_{2} g(T), \\widehat{F}_{2} g(T)\\right\\rangle+\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T}\\left|K^{\\frac{1}{2}}(T-t)\\right| u(t)\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+K^{-1}(T-t) L(T-t) x(t)+K^{-1}(T-t)\\left(B^{*} q(T-t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\right)\\right)\\right]\\right|^{2} d t] \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{T}\\left[\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\left(F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\left(F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma\\right) Q\\right)+\\left\\langle M \\widehat{F}_{1} g(t), \\widehat{F}_{1} g(t)\\right\\rangle+2\\left\\langle q(T-t), F_{1} g(t)\\right\\rangle\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.-\\left|K^{-\\frac{1}{2}}(T-t)\\left(B^{*} q(T-t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} g(t)+\\sigma\\right)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\right)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the above equation holds for any initial condition $\\xi$ in $L^{2}(\\Omega ; H)$. Therefore, the optimal control law is given by (4.19)-(4.20).",

For this purpose, we first establish bounds on $\\mathcal{T}$ for relevant operators and processes that appear in the mapping $\\Upsilon$ characterized by (4.29). We start with the operator $\\Pi(t)$ which satisfies (4.21). The following lemma establishes a uniform bound for $\\Pi(t)$ across $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nProposition 4.3 (Bound of $\\Pi$ ). Let $\\Pi \\in C_{s}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{L}(H))$ be the unique solution of the operator differential Riccati equation (4.21), then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\|\\Pi(t)\\|_{\\mathcal{L}(H)} \\leq C_{1}, \\quad \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T} \\\\\nC_{1}:=2 M_{T}^{2} \\exp \\left(8 T M_{T}^{2}\\|D\\|^{2} \\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\right)\\left(\\|G\\|+T\\|M\\|\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nProof. For the purpose of illustration, without loss of generality, we introduce a simpler model for which the optimal control law involves the same operator Riccati differential equation as (4.21). For this specialized model, the dynamics are given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd y(t) & =(A y(t)+B u(t)) d t+(D y(t)+E u(t)) d W(t) \\\\\ny(0) & =\\theta \\in \\mathcal{D}(A)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand the cost functional by\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left(\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(t)\\right|^{2}+|u(t)|^{2}\\right) d t+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(T)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere all the operators are as defined in (4.5)-(4.6). The strong solution of the corresponding approximating sequence is given by\n\n$$\ny_{n}(t)=\\theta+\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(A y_{n}(r)+J_{n}(B u(r))\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} J_{n}\\left(D y_{n}(r)+E u(r)\\right) d W(r)\n$$\n\nApplying It\u00f4's lemma to $\\left\\langle\\Pi(t-r) y_{n}(r), y_{n}(r)\\right\\rangle$, for $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, integrating with respect to $r$ from 0 to $t$, taking the expectation of both sides of the resulting equation and then taking the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we obtain for any admissible control $u$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle\\Pi(t) \\theta, \\theta\\rangle & =\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(r)\\right|^{2}+|u(r)|^{2}\\right) d r+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(t)\\right|^{2}-\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|u(r)+K^{-1} L(T-r) y(r)\\right|^{2} d r \\\\\n& \\leq \\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(r)\\right|^{2}+|u(r)|^{2}\\right) d r+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}} y(t)\\right|^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSetting $u(t)=0, \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\langle\\Pi(t) \\theta, \\theta\\rangle \\leq \\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}} y_{0}(r)\\right|^{2} d r+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}} y_{0}(t)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{0}(t)$ is the mild solution to (4.33) under $u(t)=0$, satisfying\n\n$$\ny_{0}(t)=S(t) \\theta+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) D y_{0}(r) d W(r)\n$$\n\nBy performing similar computations as in (3.7), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|y_{0}(t)\\right|^{2} & \\leq 2 M_{T}^{2}|\\theta|^{2}+2 \\mathbb{E}\\left|\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) D y_{0}(r) d W(r)\\right|^{2} \\leq 2 M_{T}^{2}|\\theta|^{2}+8 M_{T}^{2} \\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left\\|D y_{0}(r)\\right\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_{2}}^{2} d r \\\\\n& \\leq 2 M_{T}^{2}|\\theta|^{2}+8 M_{T}^{2}\\|D\\|^{2} \\operatorname{tr}(Q) \\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|y_{0}(r)\\right|^{2} d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen, applying Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality, for every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|y_{0}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq 2 M_{T}^{2}|\\theta|^{2} \\exp \\left(16 T M_{T}^{2}\\|D\\|^{2} \\operatorname{tr}(Q)\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, from (4.34) and (4.35), for every $x \\in H$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\langle\\Pi(t) \\theta, \\theta\\rangle \\leq \\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{t}\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}} y_{0}(r)\\right|^{2} d r+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}} y_{0}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq|\\theta|^{2} C_{1}, \\quad \\forall \\xi \\in H\n$$\n\nwhere $C_{1}$ is given by (4.32). Then, the conclusion follows from the spectral property of self-adjoint operators and the fact that $\\mathcal{D}(A)$ is dense in $H$.\n\nFurthermore, the Riesz mappings $\\Delta_{k}, k=1,2,3$, and $\\Gamma_{k}, k=1,2$, given in Definition 4.1 and associated with $\\Pi(t)$, appear in (4.29). We can easily apply the results of Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.3 to establish the bounds for these operators. This in turn facilitates the determination of bounds for the operators $K^{-1}(t)$ and $K^{-1}(t) L(t)$, both of which are present in (4.29) and defined in (4.20). For instance, for every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we have $\\left\\|\\Delta_{1}(\\Pi(t))\\right\\| \\leq C_{1} R_{3}$, where $R_{3}$ is given by (4.10), and hence\n\n$$\n\\left\\|K^{-1}(t) L(t)\\right\\| \\leq\\left\\|K^{-1}(t)\\right\\|\\|L(t)\\| \\leq\\|L(t)\\| \\leq C_{1} R_{6}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{6}$ is given by (4.13).\nNow, we establish that the variations of the solution $q \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$ to the the linear evolution equation given by (4.22) are bounded with respect to the variations in the input $g \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$.\n\nLemma 4.4 (Bounded Variations of $q(t)$ wrt Variations of Input $g(t)$ ). Consider the processes $\\Pi \\in C_{s}(\\mathcal{T} ; \\mathcal{L}(H))$ and $q \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$, respectively, satisfying (4.21) and (4.22). Moreover, let $g_{1}, g_{2} \\in$ $C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$ be two processes on $\\mathcal{T}$.

Finally, by applying Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality to (4.41), we obtain (4.37).\n\nSo far, we have demonstrated that all the operators and deterministic processes appearing in the mapping $\\Upsilon$, characterized by (4.29)-(4.30), are bounded. We may now establish the condition under which this mapping admits a unique fixed point.\n\nTheorem 4.5 (Contraction Condition). The mapping $\\Upsilon: g \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H) \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{E}\\left[x^{\\circ}(.)\\right] \\in C(\\mathcal{T} ; H)$, described by (4.29), admits a unique fixed point if\n\n$$\nC_{4} e^{T M_{T}\\|B\\| C_{1} R_{6}}<1\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nC_{4}:=T M_{T}\\left(M_{T}\\|B\\|^{2}\\left(T C_{2}+\\|G\\|\\left\\|\\widehat{F}_{2}\\right\\|\\right) e^{M_{T} T C_{3}}+C_{1} R_{2}\\|B\\|\\left\\|F_{2}\\right\\|+\\left\\|F_{1}\\right\\|\\right)\n$$\n\nProof.

For this purpose, we do not impose additional assumptions on the operators involved in (4.5) and (4.6), and nor on the $C_{0}$-semigroup $S(t), t \\in \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nProposition 4.6 (Contraction Condition Feasibility). There exists $T>0$ such that the contraction condition (4.42) holds.\n\nProof. From (2.7), the $C_{0}$-semigroup $S(t) \\in \\mathcal{L}(H), t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, is uniformly bounded by a constant $M_{T}=M_{A} e^{\\alpha T}$. This constant depends only on $T$, given fixed values of $M_{A}$ and $\\alpha$. Hence, we can treat $M_{T}$, along with $C_{i}, i=1,2,3$, as real-valued functions of $T$. It is evident that $M_{T} \\downarrow M_{A}$ as $T \\downarrow 0$. In addition, we can easily verify that, as $T \\downarrow 0$, each $C_{i}, i=1,2,3$, monotonically decreases to a positive constant and that $C_{4} \\downarrow 0$. Hence, $C_{4} e^{T M_{T}\\|B\\| C_{1} R_{6}} \\downarrow 0$ as $T \\downarrow 0$. Then from the continuity of the real valued function $C_{4} e^{T M_{T}\\|B\\| C_{1} R_{6}}$ with respect to $T$, we conclude that there exists $T>0$ such that the contraction condition (4.43) holds.\n\nRemark 4 (Contraction Condition Feasibility for Fixed $T$ ). proposition 4.6 states that for a sufficiently small $T$ the contraction condition (4.42) holds. This result is consistent with the findings in the finite-dimensional case (see e.g. [2, 27]). Moreover, for any fixed $T>0$ the condition (4.42) may be satisfied if, for example, $F_{1}, F_{2}, \\widehat{F}_{1}$, and $\\widehat{F}_{2}$ are sufficiently small.",

Hence, agent $i$ cannot improve its cost by deviating from the optimal strategy (4.51)-(4.52) and the set of these strategies yields a Nash equilibrium for the limiting system. In other words, the Nash equilibrium property, as defined in (4.56), holds trivially for the set of strategies $\\left\\{u_{i}^{\\circ}\\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ because the limiting cost functional of agent $i$, given by (4.4), is independent of the strategies of other agents.\n\nSubsequently, the equilibrium state of agent $i$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{i}^{\\circ}(t)= & S(t) \\xi_{i}-\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x_{i}^{\\circ}(r)+B \\tau(r)-F_{1} \\bar{x}(r)\\right) d r \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left[\\left(D-E K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r)\\right) x_{i}^{\\circ}(r)-E \\tau(r)+F_{2} \\bar{x}(r)+\\sigma\\right] d W_{i}(r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau(t)=K^{-1}(T-t)\\left[B^{*} q(T-t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} \\bar{x}(t)+\\sigma\\right)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\right)\\right]$.

Due to the symmetric properties (exchangeability) of agents, we study the case where agent $i=1$ deviates from the Nash equilibrium strategies. Specifically, we suppose that any agent $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $i \\neq 1$, employs the feedback strategy $u_{i}^{\\circ}$ given by (4.51)-(4.52) and agent $i=1$ is allowed to choose an arbitrary strategy $u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{[N]}$. Here, we use the notation $x_{i}^{[N]}(t)$ to indicate the state of agent $i$ in the $N$-player game. In this context, the dynamics of agent $i=1$ and agent $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $i \\neq 1$, in the $N$-player game are, respectively, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{1}^{[N]}(t)= & S(t) \\xi_{1}+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B u_{1}(r)+F_{1} x^{(N)}(r)\\right) d r \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(D x_{1}^{[N]}(r)+E u_{1}(r)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(r)+\\sigma\\right) d W_{1}(r) \\\\\nx_{i}^{[N]}(t)= & S(t) \\xi_{i}+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B u_{i}^{\\circ}(r)+F_{1} x^{(N)}(r)\\right) d r \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(D x_{i}^{[N]}(r)+E u_{i}^{\\circ}(r)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(r)+\\sigma\\right) d W_{i}(r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x^{(N)}(t):=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} x_{i}^{[N]}(t)$ is the average state of $N$ agents. For the case where agent $i=1$ employs the Nash equilibrium strategy $u_{1}^{\\circ}$, given by (4.51)-(4.52), we denote its state by $x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(t)$ and the corresponding average state of $N$ agents by $x^{(N), \\circ}(t)$. We note that for any control law $u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{[N]}$, the coupled system described by (4.59)-(4.60) satisfies A3.2-A3.5. Thus, the well-posedness of the system is ensured.\n\nFurthermore, we recall that the cost functional of agent $i=1$ in the $N$-player game is given by\n\n$$\nJ^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}, u_{-1}\\right):=\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{[N]}(t)-\\widehat{F}_{1} x^{(N)}(t)\\right)\\right|^{2}+\\left|u_{1}(t)\\right|^{2} d t+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{[N]}(T)-\\widehat{F}_{2} x^{(N)}(T)\\right)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nThe $\\epsilon$-Nash property indicates that\n\n$$\nJ^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right) \\leq J^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right)+\\epsilon_{N}, \\quad \\forall u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{[N]}\n$$\n\nwhere the sequence $\\left\\{\\epsilon_{N}\\right\\}_{N \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ converges to zero. To establish this property, we begin by the following lemma. We note that, by an abuse of notation, the constant $C$ may vary from one instant to another in this section.\n\nLemma 4.8.

A similar argument is presented in [16, Theorem 9.1].

From theorem 4.7, recall that $\\tau(t)=K^{-1}(T-t)\\left[B^{*} q(T-t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} \\bar{x}(t)+\\sigma)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\right)\\right]\\right.$, and\n\n$$\n\\bar{x}(t)=S(t) \\bar{\\xi}-\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) \\bar{x}(r)+B \\tau(r)-F_{1} \\bar{x}(r)\\right) d r\n$$\n\nMoreover, from (4.60) and (4.59) subject to $\\forall u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{[N]}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{(N)}(t)= & S(t) x^{(N)}(0)-\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x^{(N)}(r)+B \\tau(r)-F_{1} x^{(N)}(r)\\right) d r \\\\\n& +\\frac{1}{N}\\left[\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\Xi_{i}(t)\\right]+\\frac{1}{N} \\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B\\left(u_{1}(r)+K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x_{1}^{[N]}(r)\\right)+B \\tau(r)) d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the stochastic convolution processes $\\Xi_{1}(t)$ and $\\Xi_{i}(t), i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $i \\neq 1$, are, respectively, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Xi_{1}(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(D x_{1}^{[N]}(r)+E u_{1}(r)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(r)+\\sigma\\right) d W_{1}(r) \\\\\n& \\Xi_{i}(t)=\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left[\\left(D-E K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r)\\right) x_{i}^{[N]}(r)-E \\tau(r)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(r)+\\sigma\\right] d W_{i}(r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, define $y^{N}(t):=\\bar{x}(t)-x^{(N)}(t)$. Then, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny^{N}(t)= & S(t) y^{N}(0)-\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(B K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r)-F_{1}\\right) y^{N}(r) d r-\\frac{1}{N}\\left[\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\Xi_{i}(t)\\right] \\\\\n& -\\frac{1}{N} \\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B\\left(u_{1}(r)+K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x_{1}^{[N]}(r)+B \\tau(r)\\right) d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, from the above equation we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|y^{N}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq & C\\left|y^{N}(0)\\right|^{2}+C \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left|y^{N}(r)\\right|^{2} d r+\\frac{C}{N^{2}}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\Xi_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}\\right. \\\\\n& \\left.+\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left|u_{1}(r)+K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x_{1}^{[N]}(r)+B \\tau(r)\\right|^{2} d r\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $\\Xi_{i}(t), i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, are driven by independent $Q$-Wiener processes, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}} \\Xi_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}\\left|\\Xi_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}\\right]\n$$\n\nMore specifically, in the above equation, we use the property that $\\mathbb{E}\\left\\langle\\Xi_{i}(t), \\Xi_{j}(t)\\right\\rangle_{H}=0$ for $i \\neq j$ and for all $i, j \\in \\mathcal{N}$, and for every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$. A straightforward method to verify this property is to demonstrate that it holds for stochastic integrals of elementary processes. This can be achieved by applying the same techniques used to prove the It\u00f4 isometry (see, e.g., [16, Proposition 4.20] and [17, Proposition 2.1]).\n\nFrom (4.71) and using the standard approximation technique for stochastic convolutions, and given that all operators are uniformly bounded on $\\mathcal{T}, \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{N}$ and $i \\neq 1$, and $\\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Xi_{i}(t)\\right|^{2} & \\leq C \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\|\\left(D-E K^{-1} L(T-r)\\right) x_{i}^{[N]}(r)-E \\tau(r)+F_{2} x^{(N)}(r)+\\sigma\\right\\|^{2} d r \\\\\n& \\leq C \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{i}^{[N]}(r)\\right|^{2}+\\mathbb{E}\\left|x^{(N)}(r)\\right|^{2}+1\\right) d r\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for $\\Xi_{1}(t), \\forall t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\Xi_{1}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq C \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{1}^{[N]}(r)\\right|^{2}+\\mathbb{E}\\left|x^{(N)}(r)\\right|^{2}+1\\right) d r\n$$\n\nSubsequently, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}\\left|\\Xi_{i}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq C\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}}\\left|x_{i}^{[N]}(r)\\right|^{2}\\right] d r+N \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left|x^{(N)}(r)\\right|^{2} d r+N\\right) \\leq C N\n$$\n\nMoreover, for the last term on the RHS of (4.73), we have\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left|u_{1}(r)+K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r) x_{1}^{[N]}(r)+B \\tau(r)\\right|^{2} d r \\leq C \\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{1}^{[N]}(r)\\right|^{2}+1\\right) d r \\leq C N\n$$\n\nFrom (4.73) and (4.77)-(4.78), we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left|y^{N}(t)\\right|^{2} \\leq \\frac{C}{N}+C \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbb{E}\\left|y^{N}(r)\\right|^{2} d r\n$$\n\nThen, by Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality, the property (4.68) follows.\nProposition 4.10 (Error Bounds for Agent $i=1$ ). Let $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{1}^{[N]}(t)$, respectively, denote the state of agent $i=1$ in the limiting game and the $N$-player game satisfying (4.3) and (4.59). Moreover, let $J^{\\infty}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}\\right)$ and $J^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right)$, respectively, denote the cost functional of agent $i=1$ in the limiting game and the $N$-player game given by (4.4) and (4.61).\n(i) If agent $i=1$ employs the control law $u_{1}^{\\circ}$ given by (4.51), we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{1}^{\\circ}(t)-x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} \\leq \\frac{C}{N} \\\\\n& \\left|J^{\\infty}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}\\right)-J^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right)\\right| \\leq \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{N}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(ii) If agent $i=1$ employs any $u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{N}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sup _{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}\\left|x_{1}(t)-x_{1}^{[N]}(t)\\right|_{H}^{2} & \\leq \\frac{C}{N} \\\\\n\\left|J^{\\infty}\\left(u_{1}\\right)-J^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right)\\right| & \\leq \\frac{C}{\\sqrt{N}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nProof. From (4.3), (4.53) and (4.59), for the case where agent $i=1$ employs the control law $u_{1}^{\\circ}$ given by (4.51)-(4.52), by direct computation, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{1}^{\\circ}(t)-x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(t) & =-\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) B K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r)\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}(r)-x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(r)\\right) d r \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{1}\\left(\\bar{x}(r)-x^{(N), \\circ}(r)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{2}\\left(\\bar{x}(r)-x^{(N), \\circ}(r)\\right) d W_{1}(r) \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r)\\left(D-E K^{-1}(T-r) L(T-r)\\right)\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}(r)-x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(r)\\right) d W_{1}(r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, for the case where agent $i=1$ employs an arbitrary control law $u_{1} \\in \\mathcal{U}^{[N]}$, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{1}(t)-x^{[N]}(t)= & \\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{1}\\left(\\bar{x}(r)-x^{(N)}(r)\\right) d r+\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) D\\left(x_{1}(r)-x_{1}^{[N]}(r)\\right) d W_{1}(r) \\\\\n& +\\int_{0}^{t} S(t-r) F_{2}\\left(\\bar{x}(r)-x^{(N)}(r)\\right) d W_{1}(r)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe rest of the proof for (4.80) and (4.82) follows the method used in Theorem 4.9 by taking square norms, expectation, applying Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality (see (4.73)), and leveraging the results of Theorem 4.9.\n\nFor the property (4.81), a simple computation shows that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\left|J^{\\infty}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}\\right)-J^{[N]}\\left(u_{1}^{\\circ}, u_{-1}^{\\circ}\\right)\\right| \\leq I_{1}^{N}+I_{2}^{N} \\\\\nI_{1}^{N}=\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left|\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}(t)-\\widehat{F}_{1} \\bar{x}(t)\\right)\\right|^{2}-\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(t)-\\widehat{F}_{1} x^{(N), \\circ}(t)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right| d t \\\\\n+\\mathbb{E}\\left|\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{\\circ}(T)-\\widehat{F}_{2} \\bar{x}(T)\\right)\\right|^{2}-\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(T)-\\widehat{F}_{2} x^{(N), \\circ}(T)\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right| \\\\\nI_{2}^{N}=\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left||K^{-1}(T-t) L(T-t) x_{1}^{\\circ}(t)+\\tau(t)\\right|^{2}-\\left|K^{-1}(T-t) L(T-t) x_{1}^{[N], \\circ}(t)+\\tau(t)\\right|^{2} \\mid d t\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau(t)=K^{-1}(T-t)\\left[B^{*} q(T-t)+\\Gamma_{2}\\left(\\left(F_{2} \\bar{x}(t)+\\sigma\\right)^{*} \\Pi(T-t)\\right)\\right]$.

A Toy Model\n\nWe now study a toy model inspired by the model presented in [14], where the dynamics of a representative agent indexed by $i, i \\in \\mathcal{N}$, is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd x_{i}(t) & =\\left(A x_{i}(t)+B u_{i}(t)\\right) d t+\\sigma d W_{i}(t) \\\\\nx_{i}(0) & =\\xi\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMoreover, agent $i$ aims to minimize the cost functional\n\n$$\nJ^{[N]}\\left(u_{i}, u_{-i}\\right)=\\mathbb{E} \\int_{0}^{T}\\left(\\left|M^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{i}(t)-x^{(N)}(t)\\right)\\right|^{2}+\\left|u_{i}(t)\\right|^{2}\\right) d t+\\mathbb{E}\\left|G^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(x_{i}(T)-x^{(N)}(T)\\right)\\right|^{2}\n$$\n\nAccording to (4.1)-(4.2), we have $F_{1}=F_{2}=D=E=0$, and $\\tilde{F}_{1}=\\tilde{F}_{2}=I$ for the above model.

  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field\ngames (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to\nscenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional\nstochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of\neach agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled\nthrough the average state of the population which appears in their linear\ndynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each\nagent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process,\nand an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is\nstochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first\nstudy the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear\ninfinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation\nof MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described\nabove and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$,\napproaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash\nCertainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for\nthe limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game\nand the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges\nto the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form\nan $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.",
