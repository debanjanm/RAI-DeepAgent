InTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF RESULTS\n\nIn [56], Streets and Tian introduced the notion of Hermitian-symplectic metric, which is a Hermitian metric $g$ on a compact complex manifold $M^{n}$ such that its K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$ is the $(1,1)$-part of a closed 2 -form. In other words, there exists a global $(2,0)$-form $\\alpha$ on $M^{n}$ so that $\\Omega=\\alpha+\\omega+\\bar{\\alpha}$ is closed. Equivalently, this means a compact complex manifold $M^{n}$ admitting a symplectic form (i.e., non-degenerate closed 2 -form) $\\Omega$ so that $\\Omega(x, J x)>0$ for any non-zero tangent vector $x$. For this reason, a Hermitian-symplectic structure is sometimes also called a symplectic structure taming a complex structure $J$ ([25]).\n\nHermitian-symplectic metrics are interesting in many aspects. First of all, it is a natural mix of Hermitian and symplectic structures, two of the classic objects of study in geometry. Secondly, from the definition, it is easy to see that any Hermitian-symplectic metric would satisfy $\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\omega=0$, namely, it is pluriclosed (also known as SKT in some literature, meaning strong K\u00e4hler with torsion), a type of special Hermitian metrics that are extensively studied (see for\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C55 (primary).\n    Key words and phrases.

Thirdly, Hermitian-symplectic metrics play a big role in the Hermitian curvature flow theory of Streets and Tian [57]. For instance, the recent work of Ye [68] shows that the Hermitian-symplectic property is preserved under the pluriclosed flow of Streets and Tian, which evolves a Hermitian metric in the direction of the (1,1)-part of its first Bismut Ricci curvature tensor. Hermitian-symplectic metrics also enjoy some nice properties, for instance, they are stable under small deformations, proved by S. Yang in [66], and pluriclosed or Hermitian-symplectic metrics play a role in the theory of generalized complex geometry initiated by Hitchin which has been an active research area in recent years. See $[10,18,26,35,42,47,55,58]$ and the references therein for more on the topic.\nConjecture 1 (Streets-Tian [56]). If a compact complex manifold admits a Hermitiansymplectic metric, then it must admit a K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nIn other words, compact non-K\u00e4hlerian manifolds do not admit any Hermitian-symplectic metric. There are plenty of examples of Hermitian-symplectic metrics that are not K\u00e4hler, but so far all such examples live on K\u00e4hlerian manifolds, so the point of the conjecture is the hope that non-K\u00e4helrian manifolds would not support such metrics and one might even be able to 'deform' a given Hermitian-symplectic metric into a K\u00e4hler one.\n\nThe case of complex dimension 2 (real dimension 4) is rather special, and Streets-Tian Conjecture is known to be true ( $[50,56]$ ). See also [24] for a related more general conjecture in real dimension 4. In complex dimension 3 or higher, the conjecture is only known in some special cases. In the beautiful work [62], Verbitsky showed that any non-K\u00e4hlerian twistor space does not admit any pluriclosed metric. In [19], Chiose proved that any Fujiki $\\mathcal{C}$ class manifold (namely, compact complex manifolds bimeromorphic to compact K\u00e4hler manifolds) does not admit any pluriclosed metric. In [41], Fu, Li, and Yau proved that an important construction of a special type of non-K\u00e4hler Calabi-Yau threefolds does not admit any pluriclosed metric. So in particular, we know that Streets-Tian Conjecture holds for all twistor spaces, all Fujiki $\\mathcal{C}$ class manifolds, and all the special non-K\u00e4hler Calabi-Yau threefolds of Fu-Li-Yau.\n\nIn their recent work [7], Angella and Otiman showed that any (non-K\u00e4hler) Vaisman manifold does not admit Hermitian-symplectic metrics (as well as a number of other interesting special types of Hermitian metrics). Note that Vaisman manifolds are a special type of locally conformally K\u00e4hler manifolds. To be more precise, a Hermitian manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is Vaisman, if its K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$ satisfies $d \\omega=\\psi \\wedge \\omega$ for a closed 1-form $\\psi$, and $\\psi$ is parallel under the Levi-Civita connection. The book [52] forms an encyclopedia for locally conformally K\u00e4hler and Vaisman manifolds.\n\nRecall that a Hermitian metric is said to be Chern K\u00e4hler-like, it the Chern curvature tensor obeys all K\u00e4hler symmetries, namely, $R_{i j k \\bar{\\ell}}=R_{k j i \\bar{\\ell}}$ for any indices. The notion was introduced in [65] for Chern and Levi-Civita connections and was generalized to any metric connections on a Hermitian manifold by [6]. Chern flat metrics are special examples of Chern K\u00e4hler-like metrics. Recall that a Hermitian manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is said to be astheno-K\u00e4hler, if its K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$ satisfies $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\omega^{n-2}\\right)=0$. The notion was introduced by Jost and Yau in [48]. The first result of this article is the following observation:\nProposition 1. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold. If $g$ is Chern K\u00e4hler-like but not K\u00e4hler, then $M^{n}$ cannot admit any Hermitian-symplectic metric or any astheno-K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nIn particular Streets-Tian conjecture holds for all compact Chern K\u00e4hler-like manifolds. Note that when $g$ is Chern flat ([16]), the result is due to Di Scala-Lauret-Vezzoni [22, Proposition 3.3], which states that any compact non-K\u00e4hler Chern flat manifold does not admit any pluriclosed metric. The Chern flat case is also a consequence of the result of Fino-Kasuya-Vezzoni [29, Corollary 3.2] which states that compact Chern flat manifolds cannot admit any pluriclosed metric unless the complex Lie group is nilpotent (and Streets-Tian Conjecture is already established in the nilpotent case). Here we give a simple and elementary argument which covers the slightly more general Chern K\u00e4hler-like case.\n\nNext let us recall that Bismut torsion parallel (or BTP for brevity) manifolds are Hermitian manifolds whose Bismut connection ([14]) has parallel torsion. We refer the readers to [71, 72]\n\nfor more discussions on this interesting type of special Hermitian manifolds. By the result of Andrada and Villacampa [4], Vasiman manifolds are always BTP. But Vaisman manifolds only form a relatively small subset in the set of BTP manifolds. The latter contains other examples such as Bismut K\u00e4hler-like manifolds (including all Bismut flat manifolds) and complex nilmanifolds that are BTP, when the dimension is 3 or higher. See $[67,69,70]$ for more discussions on such metrics. The second result of this article is the following proposition which confirms the Streets-Tian Conjecture for all non-balanced BTP manifolds.\n\nProposition 2. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold. If $g$ is non-balanced and is Bismut torsion parallel, then $M^{n}$ cannot admit any Hermitian-symplectic metric.\n\nRecall that a Hermitian metric $g$ is said to be balanced if its K\u00e4hler form satisfies $d\\left(\\omega^{n-1}\\right)=0$. A large and interesting type of compact complex manifolds are the Lie-complex manifolds, meaning compact quotients of Lie groups by discrete subgroups, where the complex structure (when lifted onto the universal covers) is left-invariant. When a Lie group $G$ admits a compact quotient, it will admit a bi-invariant measure ([51]). So by the averaging trick of Fino and Grantcharov [27, 25], if a Lie-complex manifold $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic (or pluriclosed) metric, then it will admit a left-invariant Hermitian-symplectic (or pluriclosed) metric. So in order to verify Streets-Tian Conjecture on $M$, it suffices to consider left-invariant metrics on $G$, thus it reduces to the study of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on the corresponding Lie algebras.\n\nAn important supporting evidence to Streets-Tian Conjecture is the following theorem of Enrietti, Fino and Vezzoni [25] (see also [12] for an important supplement by Arroyo-Nicolini), which states that any complex nilmanifold cannot admit a Hermitian-symplectic metric, unless it is a complex torus.\n\nTheorem 1 (Enrietti-Fino-Vezzoni [25]). Let $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ be a complex nilmanifold, namely, a compact quotient of a nilpotent Lie group by a discrete subgroup where the complex structure (when lifted onto $G$ ) is left-invariant. If $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric, then $G$ must be abelian (hence $M$ is a complex torus).\n\nSo Streets-Tian Conjecture holds for all complex nilmanifolds. In [29], Fino, Kasuya, Vezzoni confirmed Streets-Tian Conjecture for several special types of Lie-complex manifolds. In particular, their Theorem 1.1 implies that the conjecture holds for all Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds, an interesting class of non-K\u00e4hler manifolds which are high dimensional analogues of Inoue surfaces. Their Theorems 1.2 through 1.4 state the following:\nTheorem 2 (Fino-Kasuya-Vazzoni [29]). Let $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ be a complex solvmanifold, namely, a compact quotient of a solvable Lie group by a discrete subgroup and the complex structure (when lifted onto $G$ ) is left-invariant. Assume that the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ satisfies one of the following:\n(i) $\\mathfrak{g}$ contains a $J$-invariant nilpotent complement.\n(ii) $J$ is abelian.\n(iii) $\\mathfrak{g}$ is almost abelian, either with $\\operatorname{dim}(\\mathfrak{g})=6$ or not of type (I).\n\nThen Streets-Tian Conjecture holds on $M^{n}$. More precisely, if $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric, then $G$ must be abelian (hence $M$ is a complex torus).\n\nRecall that for a given solvable Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, a nilpotent subalgebra $\\mathfrak{c} \\subset \\mathfrak{g}$ is called a nilpotent complement, if $\\mathfrak{c}+\\mathfrak{n}=\\mathfrak{g}$ (not necessarily a direct sum), where $\\mathfrak{n}$ is the nilradical of $\\mathfrak{g}$. A complex structure $J$ on a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is said to be abelian, if $[J x, J y]=[x, y], \\forall x, y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. In this case $\\mathfrak{g}$ is necessarily 2 -step solvable ([2, Lemma 2.1]).\n\nA Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is said to be almost abelian if it contains an abelian ideal of codimension 1. The Hermitian geometry of almost abelian groups has been an active topic in recent years, see for instance $[3,11,15,20,30,32,46,49,53,61]$. Here by ' $\\mathfrak{g}$ is not of type (I)' we mean there exists $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ such that $\\operatorname{ad}_{x}$ has an eigenvalue with non-zero real part. The extra assumption in part (iii) of Theorem 2 was removed by Fino and Paradiso in [33, Proposition 6.], so Streets-Tian Conjecture holds for all almost abelian groups.\n\nIn [28], utilizing the symplectic reduction theory on Lie algebras, Fino and Kasuya proved the following beautiful theorem:\n\nTheorem 3 (Fino-Kasuya [28]). Let $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ be a complex solvmanifold, namely, a compact quotient of a solvable Lie group by a discrete subgroup and the complex structure (when lifted onto $G$ ) is left-invariant. Assume that $G$ is completely solvable. If $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitiansymplectic metric, then $G$ must be abelian (hence $M$ is a complex torus).\n\nRecall that a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is said to be completely solvable, if $\\operatorname{ad}_{x}$ has only real eigenvalues for any $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. Clearly, completely solvable Lie algebras are always solvable, and nilpotent Lie algebras are completely solvable.\n\nAs a natural generalization to almost abelian Lie algebras, we consider Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$ which contain an abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of codimension 2 . The complex structures on $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be divided into two subsets: those with $J \\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{a}$ and those with $J \\mathfrak{a} \\neq \\mathfrak{a}$. The second result of this article is to confirm Streets-Tian Conjecture for Lie-complex manifolds where $\\mathfrak{g}$ contains an abelian ideal of codimension 2 that is $J$-invariant:\n\nProposition 3. Let $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ be a compact complex manifold which is the quotient of a Lie group $G$ by a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$, where the complex structure $J$ of $M$ (when lifted onto $G$ ) is left-invariant. Assume that the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ contains an abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of codimension 2 with $J \\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{a}$. If $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric, then it must admit a (left-invariant) K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nNote that when $\\mathfrak{g}$ contains an abelian ideal of codimension 2 , then it is always solvable of step at most 3 , but it is not always 2 -step solvable or completely solvable. The approach is based on our previous work [46]. The $J \\mathfrak{a} \\neq \\mathfrak{a}$ case is more complicated algebraically, and in [17] we were able to prove Fino-Vezzoni Conjecture (see below) for such Lie algebras, based on some partial description of balanced and pluriclosed metrics on such Lie algebras.\n\nLie-complex manifolds form a large set of compact complex manifolds, with adequate algebraic diversity. By focusing on the above type of special solvable Lie algebras and taking an elementary-style explicit approach, we want to better understand the algebraic complexity and subtlety in Streets-Tian Conjecture, and we hope it may shed some light towards the quest of the conjecture on other types of Lie-complex manifolds or more general non-K\u00e4hlerian manifolds.\n\nFinally let us address the apparent resemblance between Streets-Tian Conjecture and the Fino-Vezzoni Conjecture ( $[36,37]$ ), which states that a compact complex manifold admitting both a pluriclosed metric and a balanced metric must be K\u00e4hlerian. Sadly, even the 'intersection' of the two conjectures is still open to the best of our knowledge:\n\nConjecture 2 (Streets-Tian $\\cap$ Fino-Vezzoni). If a compact complex manifold admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric and a balanced metric, then it must be K\u00e4hlerian.\n\nWe mention this statement in the hope that, at least for some Lie-complex manifolds $G / \\Gamma$, this weaker statement might be easier to verify than Streets-Tian or Fino-Vezzoni conjectures.\n\nFinally, a referee brought the following two results to our attention, which are closely related to the Streets-Tian conjecture. One is by Angella, Otal, Ugarte, Villacampa [5, Proposition 2.2], which states that the Streets-Tian conjecture holds for any complex solvmanifold $M=G / \\Gamma$ with left-invariant complex structure of splitting type on $G=\\mathbb{C} \\ltimes \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$. The other one is due to Dinew and Popovici [23], in which they introduced an energy functional acting on the metrics in the Aeppli cohomology class of a Hermitian-symplectic metric, and their Theorem 1.4 states that in complex dimension $n=3$ the critical points of the functional (if exists) are K\u00e4hler metrics.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2. Non-balanced Bismut torsion Parallel manifolds \n\nThe goal of this section is to prove Propositions 1 and 2. We will follow the notations in [63] and [46]. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold and $\\omega$ be its K\u00e4hler form. Denote by $\\nabla$ the Chern connection, and by $T, R$ its torsion and curvature tensor, respectively.

In particular, Chern flat manifolds are Chern K\u00e4hler-like. We are now ready to prove Proposition 1, which says that any compact Chern K\u00e4hler-like manifold, if the metric itself is not K\u00e4hler, cannot admit any Hermitian-symplectic or astheno-K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nProof of Proposition 1. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold. Assume that $g$ is Chern K\u00e4hler-like and is not K\u00e4hler. As $g$ is Chern K\u00e4hler-like, its K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$ satisfies the condition $\\sqrt{-1} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\omega={ }^{t} \\tau \\wedge \\bar{\\tau}$ by (1). If $g_{0}$ is a Hermitian-symplectic metric on $M^{n}$, then by definition we would have a global $(2,0)$-form $\\alpha$ on $M^{n}$ so that the 2 -form $\\Omega=\\alpha+\\omega_{0}+\\bar{\\alpha}$ is closed, where $\\omega_{0}$ is the K\u00e4hler form of $g_{0}$. If we take the $(n-2, n-2)$-part of $\\Omega^{n-2}$, we get\n\n$$\n\\left(\\Omega^{n-2}\\right)^{n-2, n-2}=\\omega_{0}^{n-2}+C_{n-2}^{2} C_{2}^{1} \\omega_{0}^{n-4} \\alpha \\bar{\\alpha}+C_{n-2}^{4} C_{4}^{2} \\omega_{0}^{n-6}(\\alpha \\bar{\\alpha})^{2}+\\cdots \\geq \\omega_{0}^{n-2}\n$$\n\nSince $\\Omega^{n-2}$ is closed, we have\n\n$$\n0=\\int_{M} \\sqrt{-1} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\omega \\wedge \\Omega^{n-2}=\\int_{M}{ }^{t} \\tau \\wedge \\bar{\\tau} \\wedge\\left(\\Omega^{n-2}\\right)^{n-2, n-2} \\geq \\int_{M}{ }^{t} \\tau \\wedge \\bar{\\tau} \\wedge \\omega_{0}^{n-2}>0\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction, so $M^{n}$ cannot admit any Hermitian-symplectic metric. Similarly, if $M^{n}$ admits an astheno-K\u00e4hler metric $g_{1}$ in the sense of Jost-Yau [48], namely, its K\u00e4hler form $\\omega_{1}$ obeys $\\partial \\bar{\\partial}\\left(\\omega_{1}^{n-2}\\right)=0$, then we would have\n\n$$\n0=\\int_{M} \\sqrt{-1} \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\omega \\wedge \\omega_{1}^{n-2}=\\int_{M}{ }^{t} \\tau \\wedge \\bar{\\tau} \\wedge \\omega_{1}^{n-2}>0\n$$\n\nagain a contradiction. So $M^{n}$ does not admit any astheno-K\u00e4hler metric either. This completes the proof of the proposition.\n\nAs we have mentioned in the introduction, the important special case of the above is when $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is Chern flat. In this case the result is due to Di Scala-Lauret-Vezzoni in [22, Proposition 3.3]. The Chern flat case is also a consequence of the result of Fino-Kasuya-Vezzoni [29, Corollary 3.2] which states that compact Chern flat manifolds can not admit any pluriclosed metric unless the complex Lie group is nilpotent, and in the nilpotent case the Streets-Tian Conjecture is already established.\n\nNext let us recall the definition of Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds. Given a Hermitian manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$, Bismut [14] proved that there exists a unique connection $\\nabla^{b}$ on $M^{n}$ that is compatible with both the metric $g$ and the almost complex structure $J$, and whose torsion $T^{b}$ (when lowered into a tensor of type $(3,0)$ by the metric) is totally skew-symmetric. Denote by $H$ this 3 -form, namely,\n\n$$\nH(x, y, z)=\\left\\langle T^{b}(x, y), z\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nfor any vector fields $x, y, z$ on $M$, where $g=\\langle$,$\\rangle is the metric. As is well-known, d H=0$ if and only if $\\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\omega=0$. So Bismut connection is very natural to use when exploring Hermitian geometric questions involving pluriclosed metrics, etc..\n\nAs introduced in [71, 72], we will call Hermitian manifolds satisfying $\\nabla^{b} T^{b}=0$ Bismut torsion parallel manifolds, or BTP manifolds for brevity. When $n=2$, compact BTP surfaces are exactly Vaisman surfaces, which are fully classified by Belgun [13] in 2000. When $n \\geq 3$, BTP manifolds form a relatively rich class of special Hermitian manifolds which includes all Bismut flat manifolds (and more generally, all Bismut K\u00e4hler-like manifolds), all Vaisman manifolds, plus other examples. A detailed description/classification of such manifolds in dimension 3 is given in $[71,72]$, but for higher dimensions this is still widely unknown. Here for our purpose of verifying the Streets-Tian Conjecture, let us first collect some basic properties for BTP manifolds that will be used later.\n\nRecall that Gauduchon's torsion 1-form ([43]) of a given Hermitian manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ is the global $(1,0)$-form $\\eta$ defined by $\\partial\\left(\\omega^{n-1}\\right)=-\\eta \\wedge \\omega^{n-1}$. Under a local unitary frame $e$, we have $\\eta=\\sum_{i} \\eta_{i} \\varphi_{i}, \\eta_{i}=\\sum_{k} T_{k i}^{k}$ where $\\varphi$ is the local unitary coframe dual to $e$ and $T_{i k}^{j}$ are Chern torsion components under $e$ defined by\n\n$$\nT\\left(e_{i}, e_{k}\\right)=\\sum_{i} T_{i k}^{j} e_{j}, \\quad \\forall 1 \\leq i, k \\leq n\n$$\n\nAs mentioned before, a Hermitian metric $g$ is said to be balanced if $d\\left(\\omega^{n-1}\\right)=0$, or equivalently, if $\\eta=0$. It is a natural generalization to the K\u00e4hler condition which is $d \\omega=0$, and balanced manifolds form an important class of special Hermitian manifolds and have been extensively studied in the past a few decades. When $n \\geq 3$, BTP metrics can be balanced, although the 'majority' of them tend to be non-balanced. Non-balanced BTP manifolds include Bismut K\u00e4hler-like and Vaisman as disjoint subsets. A distinctive property enjoyed by all non-balanced BTP manifolds is the following\nLemma 1 ([72]). Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a non-balanced BTP manifold. Then given any $p \\in M$, there exists a local unitary frame $e$ in a neighborhood of $p$ such that\n\n$$\n\\eta=\\lambda \\varphi_{n}, \\quad \\partial \\eta=0, \\quad \\bar{\\partial} \\eta=-\\lambda \\sum_{k} \\bar{a}_{k} \\varphi_{k} \\bar{\\varphi}_{k}, \\quad T_{i j}^{n}=0, \\quad T_{i n}^{j}=a_{i} \\delta_{i j}, \\quad \\forall 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ is the coframe dual to $e$ and $\\lambda, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are global constants on $M^{n}$ satisfying $\\lambda>0$, $a_{n}=0, a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=\\lambda$.\n\nA local unitary frame $e$ satisfying the conditions in Lemma 1 is called an admissible frame for the non-balanced BTP manifold $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$. By rearranging the order of $e_{i}$, we may assume that $a_{1} \\cdots a_{r} \\neq 0$ and $a_{r+1}=\\cdots=a_{n}=0$, where $1 \\leq r \\leq n-1$ is an integer depends only on $g$ (the rank of the $\\phi$-tensor [72]). We have\n\n$$\n\\left(-\\sqrt{-1} d \\varphi_{n}\\right)^{r}=r!\\bar{a}_{1} \\cdots \\bar{a}_{r} \\Phi, \\quad \\Phi=\\left(\\sqrt{-1} \\varphi_{1} \\bar{\\varphi}_{1}\\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge\\left(\\sqrt{-1} \\varphi_{r} \\bar{\\varphi}_{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 2.\nProof of Proposition 2. Let $\\left(M^{n}, g\\right)$ be a compact, non-balanced BTP manifold. By Lemma 1 we know that locally there always exist admissible frames. Note that although $e$ and $\\varphi$ are local (co)frames, $\\varphi_{n}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\eta=\\frac{1}{|\\bar{\\eta}|} \\eta$ is global, and $\\Phi$ is also global by formula (2). If $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric $g_{0}$, then there exists a $(2,0)$-form $\\alpha$ so that $\\Omega=\\alpha+\\omega_{0}+\\bar{\\alpha}$ is closed, where $\\omega_{0}$ is the K\u00e4hler form of $g_{0}$.

Hermitian-symplectic metrics on Lie algebras \n\nIn this section, let us give the description of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on a general Lie algebra. Let us start with Lie-complex manifolds, which means a compact complex manifold $M^{n}$ such that $M=G / \\Gamma$ where $G$ is a Lie group, $\\Gamma \\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, and the complex structure $J$ when lifted onto $G$ is left-invariant. In the past decades, the Hermitian geometry of Lie-complex manifolds were studied from various angles by A. Gray, S. Salamon, L. Ugarte, A. Fino, L. Vezzoni, F. Podest\u00e0, D. Angella, A. Andrada, and others. There is a vast amount of literature on this topic, here we will just mention a small sample: [9], [21], [25], [31], [34], [37], [44], [54], [61], [64], and interested readers could start their exploration there. For more general discussions on non-K\u00e4hler Hermitian geometry in general, see for example [1], [8], [40], [59], [60] and the references therein.\n\nHere for our purpose of exploring the Streets-Tian Conjecture, first let us recall the averaging trick of Fino-Grantcharov and Ugarte [27, 61], which allows one to reduce the consideration to invariant metrics. Since the Lie group $G$ has compact quotient, it admits a bi-invariant measure [51]. If $g$ is a Hermitian metric with K\u00e4hler form $\\omega$, then by averaging $\\omega$ over $M$, one gets an invariant Hermitian metric $\\tilde{g}$ with K\u00e4hler form $\\tilde{\\omega}$. Clearly, if $g$ is pluriclosed, then so would be $\\tilde{g}$. Similarly, if $g$ is a Hermitian-symplectic metric on $M$, then there would be $(2,0)$-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ so that $\\Omega=\\alpha+\\omega+\\bar{\\alpha}$ is a closed. By averaging $\\Omega$, we get an invariant closed 2 -form $\\tilde{\\Omega}$. Clearly its (1,1)-part is necessarily positive, thus giving an invariant Hermitian-symplectic metric. If $g$ is balanced, on the other hand, then $\\omega^{n-1}$ is closed. By averaging it over, we get an invariant closed $(n-1, n-1)$-form $\\Psi$, which is clearly strictly positive. Since any strictly positive $(n-1, n-1)$-form on a complex $n$-manifold would equal to $\\omega_{0}^{n-1}$ for a unique positive $(1,1)$-form $\\omega_{0}$, we get an invariant balanced metric as well. We refer the readers to [25, Lemma $3.2]$ ) and $[27,61]$ for more details. The point is:\n\nIn order to verify Streets-Tian Conjecture or Fino-Vezzoni Conjecture for Lie-complex manifolds, it suffices to consider invariant metrics.\n\nDenote by $\\mathfrak{g}$ the Lie algebra of $G$. Left invariant metrics on $G$ correspond to inner products on $\\mathfrak{g}$, and left-invariant complex structures on $G$ correspond to complex structure on $\\mathfrak{g}$, namely, linear (vector space) isomorphisms $J: \\mathfrak{g} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying $J^{2}=-I$ and the integrability condition\n\n$$\n[x, y]-[J x, J y]+J[J x, y]+J[x, J y]=0, \\quad \\forall x, y \\in \\mathfrak{g}\n$$\n\nThe compatibility between a metric $g=\\langle$,$\\rangle and a complex structure J$ means as usual that $\\langle J x, J y\\rangle=\\langle x, y\\rangle$ for any $x, y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, in other words $J$ is an orthogonal transformation.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}^{\\mathbb{C}}$ be the complexification of $\\mathfrak{g}$, and write $\\mathfrak{g}^{1,0}=\\{x-\\sqrt{-1} J x \\mid x \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}^{\\mathbb{C}}$. The integrability condition (3) means that $\\mathfrak{g}^{1,0}$ is a complex Lie subalgebra of $\\mathfrak{g}^{\\mathbb{C}}$. Extend $g=\\langle$,$\\rangle bi-linearly over \\mathbb{C}$, and let $e=\\left\\{e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{n}\\right\\}$ be a unitary basis of $\\mathfrak{g}^{1,0}$. Following [63], we will use\n\n$$\nC_{i k}^{j}=\\left\\langle\\left[e_{i}, e_{k}\\right], \\bar{e}_{j}\\right\\rangle, \\quad D_{i k}^{j}=\\left\\langle\\left[\\bar{e}_{j}, e_{k}\\right], e_{i}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nto denote the structure constants, or equivalently, under the unitary frame $e$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left[e_{i}, e_{j}\\right]=\\sum_{k} C_{i j}^{k} e_{k}, \\quad\\left[e_{i}, \\bar{e}_{j}\\right]=\\sum_{k}\\left(\\overline{D_{k j}^{i}} e_{k}-D_{k i}^{j} \\bar{e}_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular if and only if $\\operatorname{tr}\\left(a d_{x}\\right)=0$ for any $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}$, which is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{g} \\text { is unimodular } \\Longleftrightarrow \\sum_{r}\\left(C_{r i}^{r}+D_{r i}^{r}\\right)=0, \\forall i\n$$\n\nNext, let us denote by $\\nabla$ the Chern connection, and by $T, R$ its torsion and curvature tensor.

To verify Streets-Tian Conjecture for Lie-complex manifolds, we need the following characterization for Hermitian-symplectic metrics on such manifolds:\n\nLemma 2. Let $(\\mathfrak{g}, J, g)$ be a Lie algebra equipped with a Hermitian structure. The metric $g$ is Hermitian-symplectic if and only if for any given unitary frame $e$, there exists a skew-symmetric matrix $S$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\sum_{r}\\left(S_{r i} C_{j k}^{r}+S_{r j} C_{k i}^{r}+S_{r k} C_{i j}^{r}\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\sum_{r}\\left(S_{r k} \\overline{D_{r j}^{r}}-S_{r i} \\overline{D_{r j}^{k}}\\right)=-\\sqrt{-1} T_{i k}^{j}\n\\end{array} \\quad \\forall 1 \\leq i, j, k \\leq n\\right.\n$$\n\nProof. Let $\\varphi$ be the unitary coframe dual to $e$. By definition, $g$ will be Hermitian-symplectic if and only if there exists a $(2,0)$-form $\\alpha$ so that $\\Omega=\\alpha+\\omega+\\bar{\\alpha}$ is closed. This means that $\\partial \\alpha=0$ and $\\bar{\\partial} \\alpha=-\\partial \\omega$. Write $\\alpha=\\sum_{i, k} S_{i k} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\varphi_{k}$, where $S$ is a skew-symmetric matrix. Then we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\partial \\alpha & =2 \\sum_{r, k} S_{r k} \\partial \\varphi_{r} \\wedge \\varphi_{k}=-\\sum_{r, i, j, k} S_{r k} C_{i j}^{r} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\varphi_{k} \\\\\n& =-\\frac{1}{3} \\sum_{i, j, k}\\left\\{\\sum_{r}\\left(S_{r k} C_{i j}^{r}+S_{r j} C_{k i}^{r}+S_{r i} C_{j k}^{r}\\right)\\right\\} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\varphi_{j} \\wedge \\varphi_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo by $\\partial \\alpha=0$ we get the first identity in (9). Similarly, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{\\partial} \\alpha & =2 \\sum_{r, k} S_{r k} \\bar{\\partial} \\varphi_{r} \\wedge \\varphi_{k}=-2 \\sum_{r, i, j, k} S_{r k} \\overline{D_{r j}^{r}} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\bar{\\varphi}_{j} \\wedge \\varphi_{k} \\\\\n& =-\\sum_{i, j, k}\\left\\{\\sum_{r}\\left(S_{r k} \\overline{D_{r j}^{r}}-S_{r i} \\overline{D_{r j}^{k}}\\right)\\right\\} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\bar{\\varphi}_{j} \\wedge \\varphi_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n$$\n\\partial \\omega=\\sqrt{-1} \\tau \\wedge \\bar{\\varphi}=\\sqrt{-1} \\sum_{i, j, k} T_{i k}^{j} \\varphi_{i} \\wedge \\varphi_{k} \\wedge \\bar{\\varphi}_{j}\n$$\n\nso by comparing the above two lines we get the second identity in (9).

The almost abelian case reVisted \n\nIn order to make our proof of Proposition 3 more transparent, let us start with the almost abelian case first, in which case the result is known and due to Fino-Kasuya-Vezzoni [29, Theorem 1.4] and Fino-Paradiso [33, Proposition 6.1]:\n\nProposition 4 ([29, 33]). Let $M^{n}=G / \\Gamma$ be a compact complex manifold which is the quotient of a Lie group $G$ by a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$, where the complex structure $J$ of $M$ (when lifted onto $G)$ is left-invariant. Assume that the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ is almost abelian, namely, it contains an abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of codimension 1. If $M^{n}$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric, then it must admit a (left-invariant) K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra containing an abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of codimension 1 , and $(J, g)$ be a Hermitian structure on $\\mathfrak{g}$. We will follow the notations of [46]. Then $\\mathfrak{a}_{J}:=\\mathfrak{a} \\cap J \\mathfrak{a}$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-invariant ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$ of codimension 2 . A unitary basis $e$ of $\\mathfrak{g}^{1,0}$ is called an admissible frame for $(\\mathfrak{g}, J, g)$ if $\\mathfrak{a}_{J}$ is spanned by the real and imaginary parts of $e_{i}$ for $2 \\leq i \\leq n$, while\n\n$$\n\\mathfrak{a}=\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\left\\{\\sqrt{-1}\\left(e_{1}-\\bar{e}_{1}\\right) ;\\left(e_{i}+\\bar{e}_{i}\\right), \\sqrt{-1}\\left(e_{i}-\\bar{e}_{i}\\right) ; 2 \\leq i \\leq n\\right\\}\n$$\n\nLet $e$ to be an admissible frame from now on.

In summary, we have\nLemma 5. Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be an almost abelian Lie algebra with a complex structure J. Given any two Hermitian metrics $g, \\tilde{g}$ on $(\\mathfrak{g}, J)$, there exist admissible frames $e$ for $g$ and $\\tilde{e}$ for $\\tilde{g}$ related by (11), with the corresponding structure constants related by (12).\n\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 4, which by the averaging trick of Fino-Grantcharov is equivalent to the following\n\nProposition 5. Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a unimodular, almost abelian Lie algebra and $J$ a complex structure on $\\mathfrak{g}$. If $(\\mathfrak{g}, J)$ admits a Hermitian-symplectic metric, then it will admit a K\u00e4hler metric.\n\nProof. Let $(\\mathfrak{g}, J, g)$ be a unimodular, almost abelian Lie algebra with Hermitian structure. Assume that $g$ is Hermitian-symplectic. Let $e$ be an admissible frame. Then by Lemma 2, the structure constants $C$ and $D$ obey the two identities in Lemma 2 for some skew-symmetric $n \\times n$ matrix $S$. Write\n\n$$\nS=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -{ }^{t} u \\\\\nu & S^{\\prime}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $u \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ is a column vector and $S^{\\prime}$ is a skew-symmetric $(n-1) \\times(n-1)$ matrix. Plug the data (10) into the two identities of Lemma 2, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}+A^{*} S^{\\prime}=0 \\\\\n& A+A^{*}=0 \\\\\n& S^{\\prime} \\bar{v}+A^{*} u+\\lambda u=\\sqrt{-1} v\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{g}$ is assumed to be unimodular, by part (i) of Lemma 4 and (14) we know that $\\lambda=0$. So equation (15) becomes\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{v}-\\sqrt{-1} v=A u\n$$\n\nTaking the conjugate, and then mutiplying by $\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime}$ from the left, we get\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime} v-S^{\\prime} \\bar{v}=\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{A} \\bar{u}=\\sqrt{-1} A S^{\\prime} \\bar{u}\n$$\n\nNote that in the last equality we used (13) and (14). Add the above equality to (16), we get\n\n$$\n-\\sqrt{-1}\\left(I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}\\right) v=A\\left(u+\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{u}\\right)\n$$\n\nFrom (13) and (14), we have $S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}=A S^{\\prime}$. Taking conjugate, we get $\\bar{S}^{\\prime} A=\\overline{A S^{\\prime}}$. Hence\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime} A=S^{\\prime}\\left(\\overline{A S^{\\prime}}\\right)=\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}\\right) \\bar{S}^{\\prime}=A S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nSo $I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}$ commutes with $A$. Since $S^{\\prime}$ is skew-symmetric, $I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}>0$. Thus by (17) we get\n\n$$\nv=\\left(I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1} A\\left(\\sqrt{-1} u-S^{\\prime} \\bar{u}\\right)=-A\\left(I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{u}-\\sqrt{-1} u\\right)\n$$\n\nWrite $\\bar{a}=\\left(I-S^{\\prime} \\bar{S}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{u}-\\sqrt{-1} u\\right)$, the above equation tells us that $v=-A \\bar{a}$ belongs to the image space of $A$. Now let $\\tilde{e}_{1}=e_{1}+\\sum_{k=2}^{n} a_{k} e_{k}$ and $\\tilde{e}_{i}=e_{i}$ for $2 \\leq i \\leq n$. By using $\\tilde{e}$ to be the unitary frame, we get a new Hermitian metric $\\tilde{g}$ on $(\\mathfrak{g}, J)$, whose structure constants by Lemma 5 are given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\lambda}=\\lambda=0, \\quad \\tilde{A}=A \\text { is skew-Hermitian, and } \\tilde{v}=v+A \\bar{a}=0\n$$\n\nBy part (ii) of Lemma 4 we now know that the new Hermitian metric $\\tilde{g}$ is K\u00e4hler.

LIE ALGEBRAS WITH $J$-INVARIANT ABELIAN IDEAL OF CODIMENSION 2 \n\nIn this section, we will prove Proposition 3, which is the main technical result of this article.

Note that such $\\mathfrak{g}$ will always be solvable of step at most 3 , but in general it will not be 2 -step solvable. We should mention that 2 -step solvable groups form an interesting and rich class of study. In the beautiful recent papers [38],[39], Freiherrert and Swann studied the Hermitian geometry of such Lie groups, especially on balanced and pluriclosed (namely, SKT) structures.\n\nLet $(J, g)$ be a Hermitian structure on $\\mathfrak{g}$. Then the codimension of $\\mathfrak{a}_{J}:=\\mathfrak{a} \\cap J \\mathfrak{a}$ is either 2 or 4 , and it is 2 if and only if $J \\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{a}$. As mentioned before, the Hermitian structures in the $J \\mathfrak{a} \\neq \\mathfrak{a}$ case are much more complicated from the algebraic point of view, and in this article we will restrict ourselves to the easier case. We will assume $J \\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{a}$ from now on.\n\nFirst, let us follow the notations of [46] to select simple frames and write down the structure constants.

Rotate $\\left\\{e_{2}, \\ldots, e_{n}\\right\\}$ by a unitary matrix if necessary, we may assume that $\\tilde{e}$ given below is an admissible frame for $\\tilde{g}$ :\n\n$$\n\\tilde{e}_{1}=p_{1} e_{1}+\\sum_{k=2}^{n} a_{k} e_{k}, \\quad \\tilde{e}_{i}=p_{i} e_{i}, \\quad(2 \\leq i \\leq n)\n$$\n\nHere $p_{1}, p_{i}$ are positive constants, and $a_{i}$ are complex numbers. Scale $\\tilde{g}$ by a positive constant if necessary, we may always assume that $p_{1}=1$, which will simplify our writing below. The dual\n\ncoframes are related by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\varphi}_{1}=\\varphi_{1}, \\quad \\tilde{\\varphi}_{i}=\\frac{1}{p_{i}}\\left(\\varphi_{i}-a_{i} \\varphi_{1}\\right), \\quad(2 \\leq i \\leq n)\n$$\n\nFrom the structure equation (19), by a straight forward computation we get the following relations between the two sets of structure constants:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\tilde{\\lambda}=\\lambda, \\quad \\tilde{X}=P X P^{-1}, \\quad \\tilde{Y}=P^{-1} Y P, \\quad \\tilde{Z}=P^{-1} Z P \\\\\n\\tilde{v}=v-\\lambda \\bar{a}+P^{-1} Y \\bar{a}+P^{-1} Z a\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $P=\\operatorname{diag}\\left\\{p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{n}\\right\\}$. In summary, we have\nLemma 7. Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra with a left-invariant complex structure $J$, and $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}$ be a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of codimension 2. Suppose $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$ are both metrics on $\\mathfrak{g}$ compatible with $J$. Then there exist admissible frames $e$ for $g$ and $\\tilde{e}$ for $\\tilde{g}$ so that they are related by (22). Assuming that $p_{1}=1$, which can always be achieved by scaling $\\tilde{g}$, then the corresponding structure constants are related by formula (23).\n\nWith all these preparations at hand, now we are ready to prove Proposition 3 stated in the introduction.\n\nProof of Proposition 3: Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a unimodular Lie algebra with an abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of codimension 2 and with a Hermitian structure $(J, g)$. We assume that $J \\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{a}$ and let $e$ be an admissible frame. Assume that the metric $g$ is Hermitian-symplectic. Then the two identities in Lemma 2 hold for some skew-symmetric matrix $S$. Again write\n\n$$\nS=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & -{ }^{t} u \\\\\nu & S^{\\prime}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $S^{\\prime}$ is a skew-symmetric $(n-1) \\times(n-1)$ matrix. By plugging in the data (18), we get the following\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nX S^{\\prime}+S^{\\prime} X=0 \\\\\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}=\\sqrt{-1}(Y-X) \\\\\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{Y}+Y^{*} S^{\\prime}=\\sqrt{-1}\\left(Z-{ }^{t} Z\\right) \\\\\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{v}+Y^{*} u+\\lambda u=\\sqrt{-1} v\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe matrices $X, Y, Z$ also satisfy (20) and $\\lambda=\\operatorname{tr}(X-Y)$ by part (i) of Lemma 6. Starting with the equation (26), multiply by $\\bar{Z}$ on the right, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nZ \\bar{Z}-{ }^{t} Z \\bar{Z} & =-\\sqrt{-1}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{Y} \\bar{Z}+Y^{*} S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}\\right) \\\\\n& =-\\sqrt{-1}\\left\\{S^{\\prime}(\\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{Z}-\\bar{Z}) X\\right)+Y^{*} S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}\\} \\\\\n& =-\\sqrt{-1}\\left\\{\\lambda\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}\\right)-\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}\\right) X^{*}+Y^{*}\\left(S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}\\right)\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\lambda(Y-X)-(Y-X) X^{*}+Y^{*}(Y-X)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere at the second equality sign we used the second equation of (20) and at the fourth equality we used (25). Compare (28) with the first line of (20), we obtain the following\n\n$$\n{ }^{t} Z \\bar{Z}=\\lambda\\left(X+X^{*}\\right)-X X^{*}-Y^{*} Y+X^{*} Y+Y^{*} X\n$$\n\nor equivalently,\n\n$$\n{ }^{t} Z \\bar{Z}+(X-Y)^{*}(X-Y)=\\lambda\\left(X+X^{*}\\right)+\\left[X^{*}, X\\right]\n$$\n\nThe next step is to show that $\\lambda=0$. By (26), we know that $Z+\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{Y}$ is a symmetric matrix. Let us denote this matrix by $A$, so $Z=A-\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{Y}$. By (25), we have\n\n$$\nX-Y=\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{Z}=\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime}\\left(\\bar{A}+\\sqrt{-1} \\bar{S}^{\\prime} Y\\right)=S^{\\prime} S^{\\prime *} Y+\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}\n$$\n\nSince $S^{\\prime}$ is skew-symmetric and $A$ is symmetric, the trace of $S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}$ is zero, so we get\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\operatorname{tr}(X-Y)=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(S^{\\prime} S^{\\prime *} Y\\right)\n$$\n\nWrite $H=I+S^{\\prime} S^{\\prime *}>0$. Plug $X=H Y+\\sqrt{-1} S^{\\prime} \\bar{A}$ into (24), we get\n\n$$\nH Y S^{\\prime}+S^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} H=0\n$$\n\nThat is, $H Y S^{\\prime}=B$ is symmetric. Since ${ }^{\\prime} H=\\bar{H}=I+S^{\\prime *} S^{\\prime}$, we have $S^{\\prime}{ }^{\\prime} H=H S^{\\prime}$, hence $S^{\\prime *} H^{-1}$ is skew-symmetric, thus by (30) we get\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(S^{\\prime} S^{\\prime *} Y\\right)=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(S^{\\prime *} Y S^{\\prime}\\right)=\\operatorname{tr}\\left(S^{\\prime *} H^{-1} B\\right)=0\n$$\n\nsince $B$ is symmetric and $S^{\\prime *} H^{-1}$ is skew-symmetric. Now by taking trace on both sides of (29), we get $Z=0$ and $X=Y$, and $\\left[X^{*}, X\\right]=0$ as well. In summary, we have:\n\nFor a unimodular Hermitian Lie algebra $(\\mathfrak{g}, J, g)$ which contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of codimension 2, the metric $g$ will be Hermitian-symplectic if and only if $\\lambda=0, Z=0, X=Y$ is normal, and $v$ satisfies\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime} \\bar{v}+X^{*} u=\\sqrt{-1} v\n$$\n\nfor some column vector $u$ and skew-symmetric matrix $S^{\\prime}$.\nWe claim that condition (31) is equivalent to $v \\in \\operatorname{Im}(X)$, namely, $v$ belongs to the image space of $X$. To see this, since $X$ is normal, we may rotate our unitary basis $\\left\\{e_{2}, \\ldots, e_{n}\\right\\}$ to assume that $X$ is diagonal. Permute these $e_{i}$ if needed, we may assume that\n\n$$\nX=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nX_{1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $X_{1}$ is non-degenerate (and diagonal). By (24), $S^{\\prime}$ must be in corresponding block-diagonal form\n\n$$\nS^{\\prime}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nS_{1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwith $S_{1}, S_{2}$ being skew-symmetric. Now equation (31) becomes\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nS_{1} \\bar{v}_{1} \\\\\nS_{2} \\bar{v}_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nX_{1}^{*} u_{1} \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\sqrt{-1}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nv_{1} \\\\\nv_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nMultiplying $v_{2}^{*}$ from the left side on the lower block of the above line, we get $0=\\sqrt{-1}\\left|v_{2}\\right|^{2}$ as $S_{2}$ is skew-symmetric. This means that $v_{2}=0$ so $v$ is in the image space of $X$, namely, there exists a column vector $a$ so that $v=-X \\bar{a}$. Now for\n\n$$\n\\tilde{e}_{1}=e_{1}+\\sum_{k=2}^{n} a_{k} e_{k}, \\quad \\tilde{e}_{i}=e_{i}, \\quad 2 \\leq i \\leq n\n$$\n\nthen by Lemma 7 we know that the metric $\\tilde{g}$ on $(\\mathfrak{g}, J)$ with $\\tilde{e}$ being unitary would have structure constants\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\lambda}=0, \\quad \\tilde{Z}=0, \\quad \\tilde{X}=\\tilde{Y} \\text { is normal, } \\quad \\text { and } \\tilde{v}=0\n$$\n\nHence the new Hermitian metric $\\tilde{g}$ is K\u00e4hler by part (ii) of Lemma 6, and we have completed the proof of Proposition 3.\n\nAcknowledgments.

Streets-Tian Conjecture states\nthat a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be\nK\\\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\\\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be\ntrue in complex dimension $2$ but is still open in complex dimensions $3$ or\nhigher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of\ncompact Hermitian manifolds, including Chern K\\\"ahler-like manifolds,\nnon-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds, and compact quotients of\nLie groups whose Lie algebra contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of\ncodimension $2$. The last type is a natural generalization to (compact\nquotients of) almost abelian Lie groups. The non-balanced BTP case contains all\nVaisman manifolds and all Bismut K\\\"ahler-like manifolds as subsets. These\nresults extend some of the earlier works on the topic by Fino, Kasuya, Vezzoni,\nAngella, Otiman, Paradiso, and others. Our approach is elementary in nature, by\ngiving explicit descriptions of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on such spaces as\nwell as the pathways of deforming them into K\\\"ahler ones, aimed at\nillustrating the algebraic complexity and subtlety of Streets-Tian Conjecture.", "updated": "2025-04-04T13:08:46Z", "published": "2024-09-14T12:46:02Z"}
