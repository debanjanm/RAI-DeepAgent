The current investigation belongs to an extensive research program, which aims to advance our understanding of the compactness of singular integral operators on product spaces. The main reason why we study it comes from three aspects:\n\n- There exists very limited literature concerning the compactness of singular integrals, although the compactness of commutators has attracted a lot of interest recently and many new techniques have been developed, for example, $[3,5,32,33,35,37,61]$.\n- There is no a mature theory to research the compactness of bi-parameter singular integrals, except a compactness result by means of projection [6]. In terms of boundedness on product spaces, plenty of remarkable works have been done by $[34,45,46,48,53]$ for singular integrals and by $[30,54]$ for commutators. Extending boundedness to compactness arises naturally.\n- What is the precise dyadic structure behind compact bi-parameter Calder\u00f3nZygmund operators? The rapid development of dyadic analysis has leaded to a much better understanding of one-parameter and bi-parameter Calder\u00f3nZygmund operators. A modern thinking of singular integrals was given by Hyt\u00f6nen [31], who represented singular integral operators as an average of some natural dyadic model operators. The bi-parameter extension was obtained in $[45,48]$, while sparse domination $[40,42]$ provides a brand new perspective. All these make many problems in the weighted or/and bi-parameter setting more attainable. Inspired by the above, we explore the dyadic structure of compact bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators.\nBefore entering into a detailed discussion of the multi-parameter theory, we present the first main result of this paper.\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let $T$ be an m-linear bi-parameter singular integral operator (cf. Definition 3.4). Assume that $T$ satisfies the following hypotheses:\n(H1) $T$ admits the compact full kernel representation (cf. Definition 3.2),\n(H2) $T$ admits the compact partial kernel representation (cf. Definition 3.3),\n(H3) $T$ satisfies the weak compactness property (cf. Definition 3.5),\n(H4) $T$ satisfies the diagonal CMO condition (cf. Definition 3.6),\n(H5) $T$ satisfies the product CMO condition (cf. Definition 3.7).\nThen $T$ is compact from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in$ $(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=$ $\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nTo be explicit, let us recall the compactness of multilinear operators. Given quasinormed spaces $\\mathscr{X}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathscr{X}_{m}, \\mathscr{X}$, an $m$-linear operator $T: \\mathscr{X}_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathscr{X}_{m} \\rightarrow \\mathscr{X}$ is said to be compact if $T\\left(B_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times B_{m}\\right)$ is precompact in $\\mathscr{X}$ for all bounded sets $B_{j} \\subset \\mathscr{X}_{j}$, $j=1, \\ldots, m$, i.e., $\\overline{T\\left(B_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times B_{m}\\right)}$ is a compact subset of $\\mathscr{X}$.\n\nOn the technical level there is no existing approach to our result. First, the compactness of singular integrals originated in [66], where wavelet analysis was used. Even in the bilinear one-parameter situation, the complicated geometric relationship among cubes $I, J, K$ makes it impossible to obtain good localization and then readily parametrize the sums according to eccentricities and relative distances of cubes. Second, although the authors [6] successfully established weighted compactness of linear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators, the method of projection cannot be applied to the bilinear case. A main reason is that the projection operator $P_{\\mathcal{D}(N)}^{\\perp}$ in (2.7) depends on the dyadic grid $\\mathcal{D}$ so that the goodness of dyadic cubes in $\\mathcal{D}$ cannot be added into the summation, which leads to the disappearance of satisfactory local estimates involving three cubes $I, J, K \\in \\mathcal{D}$. Third, the theory of sparse domination is missing in the multi-parameter scenario, even for the boundedness. In the one-parameter setting, the authors in [57, Theorem 3.7] obtained a pointwise sparse domination to show weighted compactness. But it requires the weak $(1,1)$ boundedness, which is false in the multi-parameter case.\n\nOur result should be compared with [46, Theorem 1.2], which established the weighted boundedness of multilinear bi-parameter singular integral operator under less restrictive assumptions. Unfortunately, those assumptions are not sufficient to obtain compactness. Generally speaking, multilinear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators (cf. Definition 3.8) are not compact. To clarify this, recall the bilinear Riesz transform $\\mathcal{R}_{j}^{i}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}$ defined by\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{j}^{i}\\left(f_{1}, f_{2}\\right)(x):=\\text { p.v. } \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}} \\frac{(x-y)_{j}+(x-z)_{j}}{(|x-y|^{2}+|x-z|^{2})^{\\frac{2 n_{i} \\times 1}{2}} f_{1}(y) f_{2}(z) d y d z}\n$$\n\nwhere $(x-y)_{j}$ is the $j$-th coordinate of $x-y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}, j=1, \\ldots, n_{i}$. Let $\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{1}{p_{1}}+\\frac{1}{p_{2}}$ with $p_{1}, p_{2} \\in(1, \\infty)$. Then one can check that\n(1) $\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}$ satisfies the full kernel representation (cf. Definition 3.4);\n(2) $\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}$ satisfies the partial kernel representation (cf. Definition 3.4);\n(3) $\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}$ satisfies (H3), (H4), and (H5);\n(4) $\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}$ is bounded from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right) \\times L^{p_{2}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$;\n(5) $\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}$ is not compact from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right) \\times L^{p_{2}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$.\n\nIndeed, properties (1) and (2) are trivial, and property (3) is a consequence of that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{j_{i}}^{i}(1,1)=\\mathcal{R}_{j_{i}}^{i, 1 *}(1,1)=\\mathcal{R}_{j_{i}}^{i, 2 *}(1,1)=0=\\left\\langle\\mathcal{R}_{j_{i}}^{i}\\left(\\mathbf{1}_{I^{i}}, \\mathbf{1}_{I^{i}}\\right), \\mathbf{1}_{I^{i}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nfor all cubes $I^{i} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}$, and that $\\left(\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2}\\right)_{1,2}^{k_{1} *, k_{2} *}=\\mathcal{R}_{j_{1}}^{1, k_{1} *} \\otimes \\mathcal{R}_{j_{2}}^{2, k_{2} *}$ for all $k_{1}, k_{2} \\in$ $\\{0,1,2\\}$, where the adjoints of a bilinear bi-parameter operator are defined in Section 3 and the adjoints of a bilinear one-parameter operator $T$ are given by\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle T\\left(f_{1}, f_{2}\\right), f_{3}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle T^{1 *}\\left(f_{3}, f_{2}\\right), f_{1}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle T^{2 *}\\left(f_{1}, f_{3}\\right), f_{2}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThen property (4) follows from properties (1)-(3) and [46, Theorem 1.2]. Additionally, property (5) is a consequence of Lemma 2.17 and [4, Lemma B.13], where the latter implies that bilinear one-parameter Riesz transforms are not compact. Therefore,\n\nthe above indicates that one has to strengthen the assumptions in order to achieve compactness of bilinear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators.\n\nNext, let us turn to commutators. Let $T$ be an operator from $\\mathscr{X}_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathscr{X}_{m}$ into $\\mathscr{X}$, where $\\mathscr{X}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathscr{X}_{m}$ are some normed spaces and and $\\mathscr{X}$ is a quasi-normed space. Given $\\vec{f}:=\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right) \\in \\mathscr{X}_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathscr{X}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right)$ of measurable functions, and $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$, we define, whenever it makes sense, the first order commutator as\n\n$$\n[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{e_{j}}(\\vec{f}):=b_{j} T\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{j}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right)-T\\left(f_{1}, \\ldots, b_{j} f_{j}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $e_{j}$ is the basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the $j$-th component being 1 and other components being 0 . Then for any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_{+}$, we define the $k$-th order commutator of $T$ in the $j$-th entry of $T$ as\n\n$$\n[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{k e_{j}}:=\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, \\cdots\\left[\\boldsymbol{b},\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, T\\right]_{e_{j}}\\right]_{e_{j}} \\cdots\\right]_{e_{j}}\n$$\n\nwhere the commutator is performed $k$ times. Finally, for a multi-index $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{m}\\right) \\in$ $\\mathbb{N}^{m}$, we define\n\n$$\n[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}:=\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, \\cdots\\left[\\boldsymbol{b},\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, T\\right]_{\\alpha_{1} e_{1}}\\right]_{\\alpha_{2} e_{2}} \\cdots\\right]_{\\alpha_{m} e_{m}}\n$$\n\nIt is natural to wonder whether the commutator $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is compact for a biparameter singular integral operator $T$, for which the boundedness of $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ was established in $[30,46]$. A recent work [43] gave an interesting result, which asserts that the compactness of $[b, T]_{1}$ is equivalent to $b \\equiv$ constant when $T$ is a non-degenerate bi-parameter singular integral. This also indicates that for multi-parameter commutators $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ it is not meaningful to study finer properties of compactness, for example, the Schatten property. In view of these facts above, we would like to seek a property of $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ which is weaker than the compactness but stronger than the boundedness. More precisely, we introduce the following definition.\n\nDefinition 1.2. Given exponents $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m} \\in[1, \\infty]$ and weights $w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}$, a bounded $m$-linear operator $T: L^{p_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)$ is said to be mean continuous if\n\n$$\n\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0} \\sup _{\\substack{\\|f_{j} \\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(w_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)} \\leq 1 \\\\ j=1, \\ldots, m}}\\left\\|\\left[\\int_{B_{\\vec{n}}(0, r)}\\left|\\left(\\tau_{y}-\\tau_{y_{1}}-\\tau_{y_{2}}+I\\right) T(\\vec{f})\\right|^{a} d y\\right]^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)}=0\n$$\n\nfor some $a \\in(0,1]$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}, w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$,\n\n$$\nB_{\\vec{n}}(x, r):=\\left\\{y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}:|y-x|=\\left|y_{1}-x_{1}\\right|+\\left|y_{2}-x_{2}\\right|<r\\right\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(\\tau_{y}-\\tau_{y_{1}}-\\tau_{y_{2}}+I\\right) f(x):=\\tau_{y} f(x)-\\tau_{y_{1}} f(x)-\\tau_{y_{2}} f(x)+f(x) \\\\\n& =f\\left(x_{1}-y_{1}, x_{2}-y_{2}\\right)-f\\left(x_{1}-y_{1}, x_{2}\\right)-f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}-y_{2}\\right)+f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe second main result of this paper is formulated as follows.\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let $T$ be an m-linear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operator (cf. Definition 3.8). Then for any $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m} \\backslash\\{0\\}^{m}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{cmo}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)^{m}$, the commutator $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is mean continuous from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nThe mean continuity is extracted from Kolmogorov-Riesz theorems, which give necessary and sufficient conditions for a subset of a Lebesgue space to be compact (see Section 1.4 below). In the bi-parameter setting, we also establish similar compactness criterion, see Theorems 6.1-6.4, where the last one implies the mean continuity is indeed weaker than the compactness. It is worth mentioning that the form of mean continuity is suitable to weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^{p}(v)$ with general weights $v$ which are not necessarily invariant under translations.\n1.2. Outline of the proof of Theorem 1.1. Let us briefly outline how to prove Theorem 1.1. Definitions and notation needed are postponed to Section 3. The core of the proof is a compact $m$-linear bi-parameter dyadic representation as follows.\n\nTheorem 1.4. Let $T$ be an m-linear bi-parameter singular integral operator (cf. Definition 3.4). Assume that $T$ satisfies the hypotheses (H1)-(H5). Then $T$ admits a compact m-linear bi-parameter dyadic representation (cf. Definition 3.12).\n\nIt is the first time to introduce a compact dyadic representation in the bi-parameter setting in order to study (weighted) compactness of singular integrals on product spaces. It definitely states the dyadic structure of multilinear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3nZygmund operators. In contrast to pointwise or integral form domination, such representation has a great advantage to transfer smoothly initial problems to corresponding dyadic problems, for example, commutators estimates and compactness. Theorem 1.4 is based on our previous research in the bilinear case [4] and in the bi-parameter setting [6] (although no dyadic representation is established), and the general framework of multilinear bi-parameter dyadic operators in [46]. Besides, our compact dyadic operators (cf. Definitions 3.9-3.11) are much more complicated than those in [4], and carry much more subtle information than those in [46].\n\nThe usefulness of dyadic representation has been shown in other aspects. It can trace back to sharp weighted norm inequalities [55], where a representation was given for the Hilbert transform. Then it was refined in [31] to solve the well-known $A_{2}$ conjecture for general Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators. After that, the bi-parameter extension was given by [48] and the bilinear case was due to [44], while the multilinear multi-parameter representation was established in [45, 46], which can be applied to obtain genuinely multilinear weighted estimates for any multi-parameter Calder\u00f3nZygmund operators [46] and their commutators. Moreover, the bi-parameter representation in [48] has been used to two-weight commutators estimates [30] and higher order commutators [54]. Recently, the one-parameter representation in [31] has found its application to Schatten class property of noncommutative martingale paraproducts and operator-valued commutators [67].\n\nHaving presented a dyadic representation, we have to show weighted compactness of bi-parameter dyadic operators. For this purpose, we establish weighted compactness of the average of the family of dyadic operators, instead of treating one by one.\n\nTheorem 1.5. Suppose that the family $\\left\\{\\mathbf{T}_{\\omega}\\right\\}_{\\omega \\in \\Omega}$ is of the same type for any $\\mathbf{T}_{\\omega} \\in$ $\\left\\{\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}, \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{1, k}, \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{2, k}, \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{a}_{\\omega}}\\right\\}$ (cf. Definitions 3.9-3.11). Then $\\mathbb{E}_{\\omega} \\mathbf{T}_{\\omega}$ is compact from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{q_{1}}\\right) \\times$ $\\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{q_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in$ $A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nIn addition, we develop Rubio de Francia extrapolation of compactness on product spaces below.\n\nTheorem 1.6. Assume that $T$ is an m-linear operator such that\n(a) $T$ is compact from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(u_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(u_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(u^{p}\\right)$ for some $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in$ $[1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for some $\\vec{u}=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>$ 0 and $u=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} u_{j}$\n(b) $T$ is bounded from $L^{q_{1}}\\left(v_{1}^{q_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{q_{m}}\\left(v_{m}^{q_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{q}\\left(v^{q}\\right)$ for some $\\vec{q}=\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{m}\\right) \\in$ $[1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{q}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{q}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{q_{j}}$ and $v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}$\n\nThen $T$ is compact from $L^{r_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{r_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{r_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{r_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{r}\\left(w^{r}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in$ $(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nTheorem 1.6 is indispensable because quasi-Banach compactness can not be obtained directly from the dyadic representation above. Furthermore, extrapolation reduces what we want to unweighted compactness in Banach range, which is quite useful in practice. We should mention that Theorem 1.6 also holds for any $m$ parameter, which can be justified from its proof in Section 8. Its feasibility benefits from our significant work [5], where interpolation and extrapolation for multilinear compact operators were established systematacially. Beyond that, unlike to extrapolation of boundedness [46, Theorem 3.12], the case $p=p_{1}=\\cdots=p_{m}=\\infty$ cannot be used as the starting point of extrapolation of compactness. For example, even in one-parameter setting, it is very hard to show compactness in the case $p=p_{1}=\\cdots=p_{m}=\\infty$ because it needs $L^{1} \\times \\cdots \\times L^{1} \\rightarrow L^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\infty$ compactness (cf. [4, Section 9]), which is proved by means of $L^{q_{1}} \\times \\cdots \\times L^{q_{m}} \\rightarrow L^{q_{m}}$ compactness for some exponents $q, q_{1}, \\ldots q_{m} \\in(1, \\infty)$ (cf. [4, Section 8]).\n1.3. Outline of the proof of Theorem 1.3. Our basic proof strategy of Theorem 1.3 is to use bi-parameter dyadic representation in [46]. This allows us to reduce matters to showing mean continuity of bi-parameter dyadic operators.\n\nTheorem 1.7. Suppose that the family $\\left\\{\\mathbb{T}_{\\omega}\\right\\}_{\\omega \\in \\Omega}$ is of the same type for any $\\mathbb{T}_{\\omega} \\in$ $\\left\\{\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}, \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{1, k}, \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{2, k}, \\mathbb{F}_{\\mathbf{a}_{\\omega}}\\right\\}$ (cf. Definitions 3.9-3.11). Then for any $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m} \\backslash\\{0\\}^{m}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{cmo}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)^{m},\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, \\mathbb{E}_{\\omega} \\mathbb{T}_{\\omega}\\right]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is mean continuous from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times$\n\n$\\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in$ $A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nAs mentioned above, the biggest challenge in the multilinear setting is to obtain desired estimates in quasi-Banach range. Interestingly and unexpectedly, the mean continuity also enjoys the property of extrapolation as follows, which provides us with great convenience in practice.\nTheorem 1.8. Let $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m} \\backslash\\{0\\}^{m}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{bmo}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)^{m}$. Assume that $T$ is an m-linear operator such that\n(a) $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is mean continuous from $L^{p_{1}}\\left(u_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(u_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{p}\\left(u^{p}\\right)$ for some $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in[1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for some $\\vec{u}=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $u=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} u_{j}$\n(b) $T$ is bounded from $L^{q_{1}}\\left(v_{1}^{q_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{q_{m}}\\left(v_{m}^{q_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{q}\\left(v^{q}\\right)$ for some $\\vec{q}=\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{m}\\right) \\in$ $[1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{q}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{q}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{q_{j}}$ and $v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}$\n\nThen $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is mean continuous from $L^{r_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{r_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{r_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{r_{m}}\\right)$ to $L^{r}\\left(w^{r}\\right)$ for all $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\n\nThe formulation of Theorem 1.8 is inspired by Theorem 1.6. Theorem 1.8 enables us to extrapolate the mean continuity of $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ from just one unweighted space to the full range of weighted spaces, whenever an $m$-linear operator $T$ is bounded on weighted Lebesgue spaces. The proof of Theorem 1.8 contains three main ingredients: (i) interpolation of multiple weights (cf. Lemma 8.1); (ii) extrapolation of boundedness for commutators (cf. Theorem 8.21); (iii) interpolation on mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces (cf. [5, Theorem 3.5]).\n1.4. Historical overview. The multi-parameter theory of singular integrals was pioneered by Fefferman and Stein [18], who dealt with bi-parameter singular integral operators of convolution type. In the language of vector-valued Calder\u00f3nZygmund theory, Journ\u00e9 [50] formulated a $T 1$ theorem for bi-parameter singular integrals with general kernels. From a fresh viewpoint on kernels (full and partial kernel representations), Martikainen [48] introduced a class of bi-parameter singular integrals and proved a bi-parameter dyadic representation, and then obtained a bi-parameter $T 1$ theorem as a pleasant byproduct. Unexpectedly, full and partial kernel representations are actually equivalent to Journ\u00e9's vector-valued formulation, see [26]. Furthermore, the bi-parameter $T 1$ theorem was extended to non-homogeneous spaces in [36] using dyadic probabilistic methods and non-homogeneous analysis. See $[8,9,10,16,17,19]$ for more classical multi-parameter results and applications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a large number of literatures devoted to studying multilinear multi-parameter theory, which is more challenging than the multilinear one-parameter and linear multi-parameter theory of singular integrals. A typical example is bilinear bi-parameter Coifman-Meyer multipliers by Muscalu et al. [51],\n\nwhich appeared naturally in the Leibniz rule for fractional derivatives. They were proved in [45] to be bilinear bi-parameter Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators, and the usage of modern tools in $[45,46]$ greatly enriches the multi-parameter theory of multipliers by establishing novel commutators, weighted, and square function estimates. Moreover, some interesting investigations were carried out for variants of bilinear biparameter Coifman-Meyer multipliers, such as multilinear multi-parameter Hilbert transform [14], multilinear multi-parameter pseudo-differential operators [15], multilinear multi-parameter H\u00f6rmander multipliers [12], and so on.\n\nIn term of the compactness of commutators, Uchiyama [65] first established the equivalence between $b \\in \\operatorname{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ and $L^{p}$ compactness of commutators $[b, T]$ for any $p \\in(1, \\infty)$ and Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operator $T$ with smooth kernel, where $\\operatorname{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ denotes the closure in $\\operatorname{BMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ of infinitely differentiable functions with compact support. A weighted analogy was proved for Riesz transforms and fractional integrals in [69]. In addition, the unweighted compactness was extended by B\u00e9nyi and Torres [2] to the bilinear setting $L^{p_{1}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\times L^{p_{2}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ for $\\frac{1}{p}=\\frac{1}{p_{1}}+\\frac{1}{p_{2}}$ with $p, p_{1}, p_{2} \\in(1, \\infty)$, while a complete characterization of compactness without the restriction $p \\in(1, \\infty)$ was shown in [7] for certain homogeneous bilinear Calder\u00f3nZygmund operators. All results aforementioned were given for $b \\in \\operatorname{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$. However, some recent works have shown that a weaker assumption is sufficient to obtain weighted compactness of commutators. In fact, introducing a new space $\\operatorname{XMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ between $\\mathrm{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ and $\\mathrm{BMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$, Torres and Xue [62] obtained unweighted compactness of commutators of bilinear Fourier multipliers and bilinear pseudo-differential operators. It was improved to the weighted case in [60], where an equivalent characterization of $\\operatorname{XMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ and the fact $\\operatorname{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\subsetneq \\operatorname{XMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\subsetneq \\operatorname{VMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right) \\subsetneq \\operatorname{BMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ were demonstrated in the spirit of Uchiyama's proof, although the proof needs some essential novel techniques on dyadic cubes and delicate geometrical observations. The more general fractional variants were established in [61] recently.\n\nAs a classical compactness criterion, the celebrated Kolmogorov-Riesz theorem was first discovered by Kolmogorov in $L^{p}([0,1])$ for $p \\in(1, \\infty)$, which is a one-parameter version of Theorem 6.1 with $w \\equiv 1$ (the condition (b) holds automatically in this case). Soon after, it was expanded by Tamarkin [59] to the general situation $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which was further extended to the case $p=1$ by Tulajkov [64]. Simultaneously, Riesz [56] independently proved a result in the form of Theorem 6.2 for $w \\equiv 1$ and $p \\in[1, \\infty)$, which was improved to the setting $p \\in(0,1)$ by Tsuji [63]. Recently, these results aforementioned were refined on weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^{p}(w)$ for general weights $w$ and exponents $p \\in(0, \\infty)$ in [5]. Moreover, this theorem has been generalized to various function spaces, such as Banach function spaces [21, 24], metric measure spaces [22, 27, 38], variable Lebesgue spaces [23], Musielak-Orlicz spaces [49], and weighted Lorentz spaces [4]. Beyond that, it has found many applications to Harmonic Analysis such as compactness of commutators $[2,3,4,7,61,62,65]$ and extrapolation of compactness $[3,5]$, and to PDEs such as Poiseuille flow of nematic liquid crystals [11], Beltrami equations [13], time fractional PDEs [47], motion by mean curvature [58], and so on.\n\n1.5. Structure of the paper. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives preliminaries including notation, dyadic grids, Haar functions, and some useful estimates. In Section 3, we formulate the general framework of multilinear singular integrals on product spaces. After establishing some auxiliary results in Section 4, we prove the $m$-linear bi-parameter dyadic representation (cf. Theorem 1.4) in Section 5. Then Section 6 is devoted to showing weighted compactness of dyadic operators (cf. Theorem 1.5), while Section 7 aims to demonstrate the mean continuity of commutators (cf. Theorem 1.7). Finally, Section 8 contains the proof of extrapolation of compactness and mean continuity (cf. Theorems 1.6 and 1.8), and then shows Theorems 1.1 and 1.3. For completeness, we present all details of the proof of Uchiyama's characterization of $\\operatorname{CMO}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right)$ in Section A.", "tables": {}, "images": {}}, {"section_id": 3, "text": "# 2.

Dyadic grids. For each $i=1,2$, let $\\mathcal{D}_{0}^{n_{i}}$ be the standard dyadic grid on $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{0}^{n_{i}}:=\\left\\{2^{-k}\\left([0,1)^{n_{i}}+m\\right): k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n_{i}}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nLet $\\Omega_{i}:=\\left(\\{0,1\\}^{n_{i}}\\right)^{\\mathbb{Z}}$ and let $\\mathbb{P}_{\\omega_{i}}$ be the natural probability measure on $\\Omega_{i}$ : each component $\\omega_{i}^{j}$ has an equal probability $2^{-n_{i}}$ of taking any of the $2^{n_{i}}$ values in $\\{0,1\\}^{n_{i}}$, and all components are independent of each other.

Section 3). Otherwise a cube is called good. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega_{i}, \\text { good }}^{n_{i}}$ denote the family of good cubes in $\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega_{i}}^{n_{i}}$. Note that $\\pi_{\\text {good }}^{n_{i}}:=\\mathbb{P}_{\\omega_{i}}\\left(I+\\omega_{i}\\right.$ is good $)=\\mathbb{E}_{\\omega_{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\text {good }}\\left(I+\\omega_{i}\\right)$ is independent of the choice of $I \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}^{n_{i}}$. The appearing parameter $\\vartheta \\in \\mathbb{N}_{+}$is a large enough fixed integer so that $\\pi_{\\text {good }}^{n_{1}}>0$ and $\\pi_{\\text {good }}^{n_{2}}>0$. Moreover, given $I \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}^{n_{i}}$, the set $I+\\omega_{i}$ depends on $\\omega_{i}^{j}$ with $2^{-j}<\\ell(I)$, while the goodness of $I+\\omega_{i}$ depends on $\\omega_{i}^{j}$ with $2^{-j} \\geq \\ell(I)$.\n\nThe following lemma (see [44]) gives the existence of the common dyadic ancestor in two different situations.\n\nLemma 2.1.

Haar functions. Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be a dyadic grid on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Given a cube $I=I_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times I_{n} \\in$ $\\mathcal{D}$, define the Haar function $h_{I}^{\\eta}, \\eta=\\left(\\eta_{1}, \\ldots, \\eta_{n}\\right) \\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$, by\n\n$$\nh_{I}^{\\eta}:=h_{I_{1}}^{\\eta_{1}} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes h_{I_{n}}^{\\eta_{n}}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{I_{i}}^{0}=\\left|I_{i}\\right|^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\mathbf{1}_{I_{i}}$ and $h_{I_{i}}^{1}=\\left|I_{i}\\right|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\mathbf{1}_{I_{i}^{-}}-\\mathbf{1}_{I_{i}^{+}}\\right)$for every $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Here $I_{i}^{-}$ and $I_{i}^{+}$are the left and right halves of the interval $I_{i}$ respectively. If $\\eta \\neq 0$, the Haar function is cancellative : $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} h_{I}^{\\eta} d x=0$; in this case we usually suppress the presence of $\\eta$ and simply write $h_{I}=h_{I}^{\\eta}$.\n\nGiven $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $I \\in \\mathcal{D}$, let $\\mathcal{D}_{k}(I):=\\left\\{I^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}: I^{\\prime} \\subset I, \\ell\\left(I^{\\prime}\\right)=2^{-k} \\ell(I)\\right\\}$.

Additionally, in view of the cancellation of $h_{K^{1}}$ and $a_{K^{2}}$, the compact full kernel representation (cf.

Consequently, (4.13) follows from (4.14), (4.16), (4.17), and the fact that $F^{2}\\left(K^{2}, 3 K^{2}\\right) \\simeq F^{2}\\left(K^{2}, K^{2}\\right)$ by (4.3).\n\nLemma 4.18.

In the case $K^{1} \\cap I^{1}=\\varnothing$, the proof is much as that of Lemma 4.9. The only difference is that $\\mathscr{P}_{1}\\left(I^{1}, J^{1}, K^{1}\\right)$ is replaced by $\\mathscr{Q}_{1}\\left(I^{1}, J^{1}, K^{1}\\right)$. Then Lemma 4.5 gives the same estimates. The case $K^{1} \\cap J^{1}=\\varnothing$ is similar.\n\nLet $K^{1} \\cap J^{1} \\neq \\varnothing$ and $K^{1}=I^{1}$.

For the first term, the diagonal CMO condition (cf.

Weighted COMPACTNESS OF DyAdic OPERATORS \n\nThe goal of this section is to show Theorem 1.5, for which we have to first give characterizations of compactness in the bi-parameter setting.\n6.1. Compactness criterions. Let $\\tau_{v}$ be the translation operator, i.e., $\\tau_{v} f(x):=$ $f(x-v)$ for all $x, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}$.\nTheorem 6.1. Let $w \\in A_{p_{0}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ for some $p_{0} \\in(1, \\infty)$. Let $0<p<\\infty$ and $\\mathcal{K} \\subseteq L^{p}(w)$. Let $0<a<\\min \\left\\{p / p_{0}, 1\\right\\}$. Then $\\mathcal{K}$ is precompact in $L^{p}(w)$ if and only if the following are satisfied:\n(a) $\\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(w)}<\\infty$,\n(b) $\\lim _{A \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\left\\|f \\mathbf{1}_{B_{S}(0, A)^{c}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}(w)}=0$,\n(c) $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0} \\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\left\\|\\left(\\oint_{B_{S}(0, r)}\\left|\\tau_{y} f-f\\right|^{a} d y\\right)^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}(w)}=0$.\n\nProof. The proof is similar to that of [4, Theorem 1.5]. As argued there, by means of a rescaling argument, the core of the proof is Theorem 6.2 below.\nTheorem 6.2. Let $p \\in(1, \\infty), w \\in A_{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, and $\\mathcal{K} \\subset L^{p}(w)$.

This can be shown as [4, Theorem 4.1] together with the weighted boundedness of strong maximal operators (cf. [20, p. 453]).\n\nBesides, in the unweighted case, the following gives a slightly different characterization of precompactness, which contains quasi-Banach exponents.\n\nTheorem 6.3. Let $p \\in(0, \\infty)$ and $\\mathcal{K} \\subset L^{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$.

The proof is almost the same as that of [4, Theorem 1.3].\nIn terms of quasi-Banach exponents, we present a variation of Theorem 6.1.\nTheorem 6.4. Let $w \\in A_{p_{0}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ for some $p_{0} \\in(1, \\infty)$. Let $p \\in(0, \\infty)$, $\\mathcal{K} \\subseteq L^{p}(w)$, and $0<a \\leq p / p_{0}$. If $\\mathcal{K}$ is precompact in $L^{p}(w)$, then the following hold:\n(a) $\\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(w)}<\\infty$,\n(b) $\\lim _{A \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\left\\|f \\mathbf{1}_{B_{d}(0, A)^{c}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}(w)}=0$,\n(c) ${ }^{\\prime \\prime \\prime} \\lim _{r \\rightarrow 0} \\sup _{f \\in \\mathcal{K}}\\left\\|\\left[\\oint_{B_{d}(0, r)}\\left|\\left(\\tau_{y}-\\tau_{y_{1}}-\\tau_{y_{2}}+I\\right) f\\right|^{a} d y\\right]^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}(w)}=0$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $\\mathcal{K}$ is precompact in $L^{p}(w)$. Then $\\mathcal{K}$ is totally bounded. Given $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a finite number of functions $\\left\\{f_{k}\\right\\}_{k=1}^{N} \\subset \\mathcal{K}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{K} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}\\left\\{f \\in L^{p}(w):\\left\\|f-f_{k}\\right\\|_{L^{p}(w)}<\\varepsilon\\right\\}\n$$\n\nLet $f \\in \\mathcal{K}$ be an arbitrary function.

Let $r, r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m} \\in(1, \\infty)$ such that $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}$. Since our argument depends on whether $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}}$ and $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{2}}$ are cancellative or not, it suffices to treat two cases:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\text { Case 1: } \\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{1}} & \\text { or } \\quad \\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{2}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{2}} ; \\\\\n\\text { Case 2: } \\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{1}}^{0} & \\text { and } \\quad \\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{2}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{2}}^{0} .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFirst, in Case 1, by symmetry and similarly, we only focus on the case $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{1}}$ and $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{1}^{1}}=h_{I_{1}^{1}}$. By the orthogonality of Haar functions, it is easy to check that\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{Q^{i}}^{k_{i}^{i}} h_{I^{i}}=h_{I^{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{I^{i} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{k^{i}}^{i}\\left(Q^{i}\\right)\\right\\}}=h_{I^{i}} \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{Q^{i}=K^{i}\\right\\}}, \\quad \\forall I^{i} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{k^{i}}^{i}\\left(K^{i}\\right), \\quad i=1,2\n$$\n\nand then\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{m+1}^{1}}\\left(A_{K}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right)=A_{K}^{k}(\\vec{f}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{Q^{1}=K^{1}\\right\\}}=A_{K}^{k}\\left(\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{1}^{1}} f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich gives\n\n$$\n\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{m+1}^{1}}\\left(\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right)=A_{Q}^{k}(\\vec{f}) \\mathbf{1}_{\\left\\{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}\\right\\}}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, there holds\n\n$$\n\\left|A_{Q}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right| \\leq \\mathcal{F}_{0} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left(\\left|f_{j}\\right|\\right\\rangle_{Q} \\mathbf{1}_{Q}, \\quad \\text { for all } Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}\n$$\n\nThus, it follows from (2.10) and (6.16)-(6.18) that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left\\|\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}^{t}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{r}} & \\simeq\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left|\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{m+1}^{1}}\\left(\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\\\\n& =\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left|A_{Q}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\\\\n& =\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left|A_{Q}^{k}\\left(\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{1}^{1}} f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\mathcal{F}_{0}\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left\\langle\\left|\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{1}^{1}} f_{1}\\right|\\right\\rangle_{Q}^{2} \\prod_{j=2}^{m}\\left(\\left|f_{j}\\right|\\right\\rangle_{Q}^{2} \\mathbf{1}_{Q}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\mathcal{F}_{0}\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left|\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{1}^{1}} f_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\prod_{j=2}^{m} M_{\\mathcal{R}} f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\\\\n& \\leq \\mathcal{F}_{0}\\left\\|\\left(\\sum_{Q \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0}}\\left|\\Delta_{Q^{1}}^{k_{1}^{1}} f_{1}\\right|^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{1}}} \\prod_{j=2}^{m}\\left\\|M_{\\mathcal{R}} f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}} \\\\\n& \\lesssim \\mathcal{F}_{0} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the implicit constants are independent of $k, \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}$, and $\\vec{f}$.\nNext, let us handle Case 2. By the assumptions on $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{j}^{1}}$, in this case, there must exist $j_{0} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$ such that $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{0}^{1}}=h_{I_{j_{0}}^{1}}$. Set\n\n$$\nq=r_{j_{0}}^{\\prime}, \\quad q_{j_{0}}=2, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad q_{j}=r_{j}, \\quad j=\\{1, \\ldots, m\\} \\backslash\\left\\{j_{0}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen $\\frac{1}{q}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{q_{j}}$. Recall that $T^{j_{0} \\star}$ denotes the full adjoint of $T$ with respect to the $j_{0}$-th slot. Note that the shift $\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k, j_{0} \\star}$ contains the cancellative Haar function $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}}=h_{I_{m+1}^{1}}$, which is similar to Case 1. Since (2.10) holds for all exponents $p \\in(1, \\infty)$, as shown in (6.19), one can obtain\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k, j_{0} \\star}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{q}} \\lesssim \\mathcal{F}_{0} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{q_{j}}}\n$$\n\nwhere the implicit constant is independent of $k, \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}$, and $\\vec{f}$. By duality, (6.20) and (6.21) imply\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{r}} \\lesssim \\mathcal{F}_{0} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}}\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.\n6.3. Compact shifts. Let us start the proof of Theorem 1.5 for $\\mathbf{T}_{\\omega}=\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}$. Recall the weighted boundedness of shifts (cf. [46, Theorem 6.2]):\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\omega}\\left\\|\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{r}\\left(v^{r}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}\\left(v_{j}^{r_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and $\\vec{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}>0$ and $v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}$. In light of Theorem 1.6 and (6.22), it suffices to show that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\omega} \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}$ is compact from $L^{2 m} \\times \\cdots \\times L^{2 m}$ to $L^{2}$. Then by Theorem 6.3 and Minkowski's inequality, it is enough to prove the following\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\substack{\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2 m} \\leq 1 \\\\ j=1, \\ldots, m}}} \\sup _{\\omega}\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{2}} \\lesssim 1\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lim _{A \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sup _{\\substack{\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2 m} \\leq 1 \\\\ j=1, \\ldots, m}}} \\sup _{\\omega}\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f}) \\mathbf{1}_{B_{R}(0, A)^{c}}\\right\\|_{L^{2}}=0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\substack{|v| \\rightarrow 0}} \\sup _{\\substack{\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2 m} \\leq 1 \\\\ j=1, \\ldots, m}}} \\sup _{\\omega}\\left\\|\\tau_{v} \\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f})-\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{2}}=0\n$$\n\nThe inequality (6.23) follows from (6.22).\nRecall the operator $\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{D}_{0}}^{k}$ defined in Section 6.2. To demonstrate (6.24), we define\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k, N}(\\vec{f}):=\\sum_{Q \\notin \\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}(N)} A_{Q}^{k}(\\vec{f}), \\quad N \\in \\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nLemma 6.14 applied to $\\mathcal{D}_{0}=\\mathcal{D} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}(N)$ gives\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\omega}\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k, N}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{2}} \\lesssim \\mathcal{F}_{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2 m}}\n$$\n\nwhere the implicit constants are independent of $k, N$, and $\\vec{f}$. Let $A \\geq 2^{4}$ and $N:=\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{2} A\\right] \\geq 2$. Note that for any $\\omega=\\left(\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}\\right) \\in \\Omega_{1} \\times \\Omega_{2}$ and $I^{1} \\times I^{2} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}(N)$,\n\n$$\nI^{i} \\subset\\left\\{x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}}:\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\leq(N+2) 2^{N}\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\leq 2^{2 N}\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{\\left|x_{i}\\right| \\leq A\\right\\}, \\quad i=1,2\n$$\n\nHence, applying (6.26) and (6.27), we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k}(\\vec{f}) \\mathbf{1}_{B_{R}(0,2 A)^{v}}\\right\\|_{L^{2}}=\\left\\|\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{k, N}(\\vec{f}) \\mathbf{1}_{B_{R}(0,2 A)^{v}}\\right\\|_{L^{2}} \\lesssim \\mathcal{F}_{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{2 m}}\n$$\n\nwhere the implicit constant is independent of $\\omega, A$, and $\\vec{f}$.

Commutators of partial paraproducts. Next, we prove the mean continuity of $\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, \\mathbb{E}_{\\omega} \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{1, k}\\right] \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, and a symmetrical proof holds for $\\left[\\boldsymbol{b}, \\mathbb{E}_{\\omega} \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}_{\\omega}}^{2, k}\\right] \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$. We will adopt the same strategy as in Section 7.1, and also clarify the similarities and differences in the current scenario.\n\nFor any $k=\\left(k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{m+1}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m+1}$, a partial paraproduct $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{1, k}$ can be viewed as a shift $\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\mathbf{k}}$ of complexity $\\mathbf{k}=\\left(\\left(k_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(k_{m+1}, 0\\right)\\right)$. Indeed, by definition of partial paraproducts, there holds\n\n$$\n\\left|a_{\\left(I_{j}\\right), Q}\\right|:=\\left|a_{\\left(I_{j}^{1}\\right), Q}\\right| Q^{2}\\left|^{-\\frac{m}{2}}\\right| \\leq \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{m+1}\\left|I_{j}^{1}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\left|Q^{1}\\right|^{m}} \\frac{\\prod_{j=1}^{m+1}\\left|Q^{2}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\left|Q^{2}\\right|^{m}}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{1, k}(\\vec{f})=\\sum_{\\substack{Q=Q^{1} \\times Q^{2} \\in \\mathcal{D} \\\\ I_{j}^{1} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{k_{j}}^{1}\\left(Q^{1}\\right) \\\\ j=1, \\ldots, m+1}} a_{\\left(I_{j}\\right), Q} \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\langle f_{j}, \\widetilde{h}_{I_{j}^{1}} \\otimes \\widetilde{h}_{j, Q^{2}}\\right\\rangle \\widetilde{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}} \\otimes \\widetilde{h}_{m+1, Q^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere the functions $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{j}^{1}}$ and $\\widetilde{h}_{j, Q^{2}}$ satisfy the following: there exist two different indices $j_{0}, j_{1} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, m+1\\}$ so that $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{j_{0}}^{1}}=h_{I_{j_{0}}^{1}}, \\widetilde{h}_{I_{j_{1}}^{1}}=h_{I_{j_{1}}^{1}}$, and $\\widetilde{h}_{I_{j}^{1}} \\in\\left\\{h_{I_{j}^{1}}^{0}, h_{I_{j}^{1}}\\right\\}$ for every\n\n$j \\neq j_{0}, j_{1}$; there exists $j_{2} \\in\\{1, \\ldots, m+1\\}$ so that $\\widetilde{h}_{j_{2}, Q^{2}}=h_{Q^{2}}$ and $\\widetilde{h}_{j, Q^{2}}=h_{Q^{2}}^{0}$ for every $j \\neq j_{2}$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{1, k}$ coincides with a shift $\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{\\mathbf{k}}$ with $\\mathbf{k}=\\left(\\left(k_{1}, 0\\right), \\ldots,\\left(k_{m+1}, 0\\right)\\right)$.\n\nIn view of (7.37) and (7.38), we utilize (6.34) instead of (6.22) to reduce the mean continuity to the estimate (7.3). To this end, we perform the decomposition (7.10). The term $\\Gamma_{0}$ can be handled by means of (6.34). Due to (7.37), the estimates for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{4}$ are the same as in Section 7.1. Note that $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{5}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{6}$ are essentially symmetrical to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{3}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{4}$ respectively. Thus, it is enough to analyze $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{1}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{3}$.\n\nObserve that $\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{3} f\\right\\|_{L^{p}} \\leq 2\\left\\|\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{0}^{3} f\\right\\|_{L^{p}}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{0}^{3}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{1}^{3}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}^{3}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{3}^{3}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{4}^{3}$, where $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{1}^{3}$ is similar to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{4}$, and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{j}^{3}$ is similar to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,3}$ for each $j=2,3,4$.\n\nSince $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{1}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{1}^{1}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}^{1}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{3}^{1}$, where $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{1}^{1}$ is similar to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{2}$, and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{3}^{1}$ is symmetrical to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}^{1}$, in order to bound $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}^{1}$, it suffices to treat $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}^{1}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,2}^{1}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,3}^{1}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,4}^{1}$. By (7.37), the estimate for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,4}^{1}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,4}^{1,1}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,4}^{1,2}$ remain unchanged. Since $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,2}^{1}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,3}^{1}$ are similar to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1}$, the estimate for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2}^{1}$ is reduced to that for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,1}+\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2}$. Note that $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,1}=\\tau_{\\mathrm{v}} \\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,4}^{1}$ and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2}=\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,1}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,2}-\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,3}$, where $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,2}$ is identical to that in Section 7.1 because of the size estimate for $a_{\\left(I_{j}\\right), Q}(7.37)$, and $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,2}$ is symmetrical to $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,3}$. Consequently, it remains to dominate $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{2,1}^{1,2,3}$.\n\nBy changing variables, it just needs to consider\n\n$$\n\\Xi(\\vec{f})(x):=\\sum_{\\substack{Q^{1} \\in \\mathcal{D}^{1} \\\\\\ell\\left(Q^{2}\\right) \\leq\\left|v_{2}\\right|}} a_{\\left(I_{j}^{1}\\right), Q} b_{Q^{1}}\\left(x_{2}\\right) \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\langle f_{j}, \\widetilde{h}_{I_{j}^{1}} \\otimes \\bar{h}_{j, Q^{2}}\\right\\rangle \\bar{h}_{I_{m+1}^{1}} \\otimes \\bar{h}_{m+1, Q^{2}}(x)\n$$\n\nwhere $b_{Q^{1}}\\left(x_{2}\\right):=b\\left(c_{Q^{1}}, x_{2}+v_{2}\\right)-b\\left(c_{Q^{1}}, x_{2}\\right)$.\n\n- Case 1: $\\bar{h}_{m+1, Q^{2}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{1}_{Q^{2}}}{\\left|Q^{2}\\right|}$. Let $f_{m+1} \\in L^{p^{\\prime}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ with $\\left\\|f_{m+1}\\right\\|_{L^{p}} \\leq 1$. Following the proof of [46, Theorem 6.7], we treat the quantity $\\left|\\left\\langle\\Xi(\\vec{f}), f_{m+1}\\right\\rangle\\right|$, which contains the term\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left\\langle b_{Q^{1}} f_{m+1}, h_{Q^{1}}^{0} \\otimes \\frac{\\mathbf{1}_{Q^{2}}}{\\left|Q^{2}\\right|}\\right\\rangle\\right| \\leq|v|\\left\\|\\nabla b_{1}\\right\\|_{L^{\\infty}}\\left|Q^{1}\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}} M_{\\mathcal{D}} f_{m+1}(x), \\quad \\forall x \\in Q\n$$\n\nIn light of (7.39), the rest of the proof is the same as there.

We will modify the proof in Section 7.1 to the current situation.\n\nA full paraproduct $\\mathbb{F}_{\\mathbf{a}}$ can be viewed as a shift $\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathcal{D}}^{k}$ of complexity $k=((0,0), \\ldots,(0,0))$.

EXTRAPOLATION OF COMPACTNESS \n\nThis section is devoted to proving Theorems 1.6 and 1.8, which have been used in Sections 6 and 7 respectively. After that, we will conclude Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 from Theorems $1.4-1.8$.\n8.1. Interpolation of compactness. Let us first show Theorem 1.6 in the biparameter setting. Although the proof follows the scheme in [4], we present some details to clarify the main ingredients.\n\nFirst, we give an interpolation of multiple weights below, which allows us to use interpolation of compactness to show extrapolation of compactness.\nLemma 8.1. Let $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ with $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m} \\in(1, \\infty]$ and $\\frac{1}{s}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{s_{j}}$ with $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{m} \\in[1, \\infty]$. Assume that $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{s}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$. Then there exists $\\theta \\in(0,1)$ such that $\\vec{u} \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}, \\quad u=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} u_{j}, \\quad w_{j}=u_{j}^{1-\\theta} v_{j}^{\\theta}, \\quad \\frac{1}{p_{j}}=\\frac{1-\\theta}{r_{j}}+\\frac{\\theta}{s_{j}}, \\quad j=1, \\ldots, m\n$$\n\nProof. The proof heavily relies on the reverse H\u00f6lder inequality for $A_{p}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, which was proved by [20, p. 458] in the multi-parameter case. With this in hand, the proof is similar to that of [4, Lemma C.1].\n\nNext, let us recall extrapolation of boundedness in the bi-parameter case [46, Theorem 3.12], which extends the one-parameter extrapolation result in [52].\n\nTheorem 8.2. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $(m+1)$-tuples of non-negative functions. Assume that there exists some $\\vec{q}=\\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{m}\\right) \\in[1, \\infty]^{m}$ such that for all $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{q}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{L^{q}(\\mathbb{R}^{q})} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{q_{j}}\\left(v_{j}^{q_{j}}\\right)}, \\quad \\forall\\left(f, f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{F}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\frac{1}{q}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{q_{j}}$ and $v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}$. Then for all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$,\n\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(w_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)}, \\quad \\forall\\left(f, f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{m}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{F}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\nBeyond that, the core of the proof of Theorem 1.6 is an interpolation of multilinear compact operators below, which determines the range of exponents. The greatest difficulty of Theorem 8.3 is to obtain the quasi-Banach range of exponents, for which we use compactness criterion Theorem 6.1.\nTheorem 8.3. Let $0<p_{0}, q_{0}<\\infty$ and $1 \\leq p_{j}, q_{j} \\leq \\infty, j=1, \\ldots, m$. Let $u_{0}^{q_{0}}, v_{0}^{q_{0}} \\in$ $A_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $u_{j}, v_{j}$ be weights on $\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}, j=1, \\ldots, m$.

Let $u_{0}^{p_{0}}, v_{0}^{q_{0}} \\in A_{\\infty}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$.

[20, p. 453]) and (8.4), implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|\\left(f_{B_{\\mathcal{S}}(0, \\rho)}\\left|\\left(\\tau_{y} T-T\\right)(\\vec{f})|^{a} d y\\right)^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right|\\right|_{L^{p_{0}}\\left(u_{0}^{p_{0}}\\right)} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\left\\|M_{\\mathcal{R}}\\left(|T(\\vec{f})|^{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{0}}\\left(u_{0}^{p_{0}}\\right)}+\\|T(\\vec{f})\\|_{L^{p_{0}}\\left(u_{0}^{p_{0}}\\right)} \\\\\n& \\lesssim\\|T(\\vec{f})\\|_{L^{p_{0}}\\left(u_{0}^{p_{0}}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(u_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet $\\varepsilon>0$.

Moreover, by interpolation on mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces (cf.

Therefore, (8.6) follows from (8.14)-(8.16) and Theorem 6.1.\n8.2. Proof of Theorem 1.6. Fix $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ with $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}>0$. Let $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$. Recall that the assumption (a):\n\n$$\nT: L^{p_{1}}\\left(u_{1}^{p_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_{m}}\\left(u_{m}^{p_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{p}\\left(u^{p}\\right) \\text { compactly }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vec{u} \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$. Then by Lemma 8.1 applied to $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $\\vec{u} \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, there exists $\\theta \\in(0,1)$ such that $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{s}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{s_{j}}, \\quad v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}, \\quad w_{j}=v_{j}^{1-\\theta} u_{j}^{\\theta}, \\quad \\frac{1}{r_{j}}=\\frac{1-\\theta}{s_{j}}+\\frac{\\theta}{p_{j}}, \\quad j=1, \\ldots, m\n$$\n\nIn view of Theorem 8.2, the assumption (b) implies\n\n$$\nT: L^{t_{1}}\\left(\\sigma_{1}^{t_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{\\sigma_{m}}\\left(\\sigma_{m}^{t_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{t}\\left(\\sigma^{t}\\right) \\text { boundedly, }\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{t}=\\left(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{\\sigma}=\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{t}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{t_{j}}>0$ and $\\sigma=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\sigma_{j}$. Then (8.19) applied to $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{s}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ yields\n\n$$\nT: L^{s_{1}}\\left(v_{1}^{s_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{v_{m}}\\left(v_{m}^{s_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{s}\\left(v^{s}\\right) \\text { boundedly. }\n$$\n\nHence, it follows from (8.17), (8.18), (8.20), and Theorem 8.3 that\n\n$$\nT: L^{r_{1}}\\left(w_{1}^{r_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{r_{m}}\\left(w_{m}^{r_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{r}\\left(w^{r}\\right) \\text { compactly. }\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 1.6.\n8.3.

Then for any $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right) \\in$ $\\operatorname{bmo}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)^{m}$,\n\n$$\n\\|[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\|_{L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|b_{j}\\right\\|_{\\operatorname{bmo}}^{n_{j}}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(w_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$.\nProof. Fix $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}^{m}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m}\\right) \\in \\operatorname{bmo}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)^{m}$. Choose $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in$ $(1, \\infty)^{m}$ so that $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}<1$. In view of Theorem 8.2, the hypothesis (8.22) implies that\n\n$$\n\\|T(\\vec{f})\\|_{L^{r}\\left(u^{r}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}\\left(u_{j}^{r_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{u}=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $u=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} u_{j}$.\nIn the bi-parameter setting, recall the reverse H\u00f6lder inequality [20, p. 458] and the John-Nirenberg inequality [29, Section 5.6]. Using these two inequalities, as argued in [1, p. 84], one can show that for any $\\vec{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, there holds\n\n$$\n\\vec{u}=\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}\\right):=\\left(v_{1} e^{-\\operatorname{Re}\\left(z_{1}\\right) b_{1}}, \\ldots, v_{m} e^{-\\operatorname{Re}\\left(z_{m}\\right) b_{m}}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhenever $\\left|z_{j}\\right| \\leq \\eta_{j}$ for some $\\eta_{j}>0, j=1, \\ldots, m$. Then following the proof of [1, Theorem 4.13], we apply the Cauchy integral trick, (8.24), and (8.25) to deduce that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{r}\\left(v^{p}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|b_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathrm{bmo}}^{\\alpha_{j}}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}\\left(v_{j}^{r_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}$. Therefore, it follows from (8.26) and Theorem 8.2 that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{p}\\left(w^{p}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|b_{j}\\right\\|_{\\mathrm{bmo}}^{\\alpha_{j}}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(w_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}}>0$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$. This justifies (8.23).\n8.4. Proof of Theorem 1.8. Let $\\vec{r}=\\left(r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ with $\\frac{1}{r}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{r_{j}}>0$. Let $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $w=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} w_{j}$. Let $\\varepsilon>0$ be an arbitrary number. By the assumption (a), there exists some $\\rho_{0}=\\rho_{0}(\\varepsilon)>0$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\left[\\int_{B_{\\vec{a}}(0, \\rho)}\\left|\\left(\\tau_{y}-\\tau_{y_{1}}-\\tau_{y_{2}}+I\\right)[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\right|^{\\text {a }_{0}} d y\\right]^{\\frac{1}{s_{0}}}\\right\\|_{L^{p}\\left(u^{p}\\right)} \\leq \\varepsilon \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{p_{j}}\\left(u_{j}^{p_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nfor all $0<\\rho<\\rho_{0}$ and for some $a_{0} \\in(0,1]$. Recall that $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{r}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$ and $\\vec{u} \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$. Then invoking Lemma 8.1, one can find some $\\theta \\in(0,1)$ such that $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{s}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{s_{j}}, \\quad v=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} v_{j}, \\quad w_{j}=v_{j}^{1-\\theta} u_{j}^{\\theta}, \\quad \\frac{1}{r_{j}}=\\frac{1-\\theta}{s_{j}}+\\frac{\\theta}{p_{j}}, \\quad j=1, \\ldots, m\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, by the assumption (b) and Theorem 8.21,\n\n$$\n[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}: L^{t_{1}}\\left(\\sigma_{1}^{t_{1}}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{\\sigma_{m}}\\left(\\sigma_{m}^{t_{m}}\\right) \\rightarrow L^{t}\\left(\\sigma^{t}\\right) \\text { boundedly, }\n$$\n\nfor all $\\vec{t}=\\left(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty]^{m}$ and for all $\\vec{\\sigma}=\\left(\\sigma_{1}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{t}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $\\frac{1}{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{t_{j}}>0$ and $\\sigma=\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\sigma_{j}$. Hence, applying (8.29) to $\\vec{v} \\in A_{\\vec{s}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left\\|[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\right\\|_{L^{s}\\left(v^{s}\\right)} \\lesssim \\prod_{j=1}^{m}\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{s_{j}}\\left(v_{j}^{s_{j}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere the implicit constant is independent of $\\vec{f}$. In light of Theorem 2.13, there holds $v^{s} \\in A_{m s}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right) \\subset A_{s / a}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$, where $0<a \\leq \\min \\left\\{a_{0}, \\frac{1}{m}\\right\\}$.

As a consequence of (8.27) (which holds for $a$ in place of $a_{0}$ ), (8.28), (8.31), and [5, Theorem 3.5], we conclude that\n\n$$\n\\sup _{\\substack{\\left\\|f_{j}\\right\\|_{L^{r_{j}}\\left(w_{j}^{r_{j}}\\right)} \\leq 1 \\\\\\left.\\leq 1\\right\\|}}\\left\\|\\left[\\int_{B_{\\vec{a}}(0, \\rho)}\\left|\\left(\\tau_{y}-\\tau_{y_{1}}-\\tau_{y_{2}}+I\\right)[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}(\\vec{f})\\right|^{a} d y\\right]^{\\frac{1}{a}}\\right\\|_{L^{r}\\left(w^{r}\\right)} \\leq C_{0}^{1-\\theta} \\varepsilon^{\\theta},\n$$\n\nfor all $0<\\rho<\\rho_{0}$. This and (8.29) show Theorem 1.8.\n8.5. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Having established fundamental estimates above, let us demonstrate Theorem 1.1.\n\nPick $\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{m}\\right) \\in(1, \\infty)^{m}$ such that $\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{p_{j}} \\in(0,1)$. Let $\\vec{u}=$ $\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{m}\\right) \\in A_{\\vec{p}}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}\\right)$. Theorem 1.4 asserts that $T$ admits a compact $m$ linear bi-parameter dyadic representation.

In the scenario $\\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right) \\leq 4 \\ell(Q)$, observe that\n\n$$\n\\oint_{Q_{x}}\\left|f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right| d y \\lesssim \\varepsilon, \\quad \\forall x \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIndeed, for all $x \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$ and $y \\in Q_{x}$, we have $y \\in Q_{y}=Q_{x} \\subset Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$ and $g_{\\varepsilon}(y)=$ $\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{y}}=\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{x}}$, which imply $\\oint_{Q_{x}}\\left|f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right| d y=\\mathcal{O}\\left(f ; Q_{x}\\right) \\leq \\varepsilon$, provided (A.12). The condition $Q_{x} \\cap Q \\neq \\emptyset$ and $\\ell\\left(Q_{x}\\right) \\leq 4 \\ell(Q)$ implies $Q_{x} \\subset 9 Q$. Thus, by (A.14) and the disjointness of $\\left\\{Q_{x}\\right\\}$,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\right) \\leq 2 \\oint_{Q}\\left|f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right| d y \\leq \\sum_{Q_{x} \\cap Q \\neq \\varnothing} \\frac{2}{|Q|} \\int_{Q_{x}}\\left|f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right| d y \\lesssim \\frac{|9 Q|}{|Q|} \\varepsilon \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nIn the setting $\\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right)>4 \\ell(Q)$, note that\n\n$$\nQ \\cap Q\\left(2^{j_{0}}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\ell(Q)<2^{-j_{0}}\n$$\n\nIndeed, if $x_{0} \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{0}+1}\\right)$, then $\\ell(Q)<\\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right) / 4 \\leq 2^{-j_{0}+1} / 4<2^{-j_{0}}$; if $x_{0} \\in Q\\left(2^{j}\\right) \\backslash$ $Q\\left(2^{j-1}\\right)$ for some $j \\geq j_{0}+2$, then $Q_{x_{0}} \\subset Q\\left(2^{j}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j-1}\\right)$ and $\\ell(Q)<\\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right) / 4=$ $2^{j-2 j_{0}-2}$, which contradicts the fact $\\ell(Q) \\geq 2^{j-1}-2^{j_{0}}$ because $Q \\cap Q_{x_{0}} \\neq \\emptyset, Q \\cap$ $Q\\left(2^{j_{0}}\\right) \\neq \\varnothing$, and $2^{j-1}-2^{j_{0}}-2^{j-2 j_{0}-2}=2^{j-1}\\left[1-2^{-\\left(j-j_{0}-2\\right)-1}-2^{-2 j_{0}-1}\\right]>0$. Consequently, it follows from (A.10) and (A.15) that\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}(f ; Q) \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nIn addition, for any $x \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$ with $\\bar{Q}_{x} \\cap \\bar{Q}_{x_{0}} \\neq \\emptyset$, there holds $2 \\ell(Q) \\leq \\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right) / 2 \\leq$ $\\ell\\left(Q_{x}\\right) \\leq 2 \\ell\\left(Q_{x_{0}}\\right)$. This indicates\n\n$$\nQ \\subset \\bigcup_{x \\in \\Lambda} Q_{x} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad Q_{x} \\cap Q \\neq \\varnothing \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\# \\Lambda \\lesssim 1\n$$\n\nThen for all $x, y \\in Q$, one can a sequence $\\left\\{x_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N_{0}} \\subset \\Lambda$ such that $\\bar{Q}_{x_{i}} \\cap \\bar{Q}_{x_{i+1}} \\neq \\emptyset$, $i=0,1, \\ldots, N_{0}=N_{0}(x, y)$, where $x_{0}:=x$ and $x_{N_{0}+1}:=y$. Hence, by Lemma A.22,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\right) \\leq \\sup _{x, y \\in Q}\\left|g_{\\varepsilon}(x)-g_{\\varepsilon}(y)\\right| \\leq \\sup _{x, y \\in Q} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_{0}}\\left|g_{\\varepsilon}\\left(x_{i}\\right)-g_{\\varepsilon}\\left(x_{i+1}\\right)\\right| \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhich along with (A.16) yields\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\right) \\leq \\mathcal{O}(f ; Q)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\right) \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nFinally, to treat the case $Q \\cap Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right) \\neq \\emptyset$ and $Q \\cap Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)^{c} \\neq \\emptyset$, let $j_{2}>j_{1}$ be the smallest integer satisfying $Q \\subset Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)$. Then,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\right) \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon} ; Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\mathscr{I}_{1}+\\mathscr{I}_{2}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathscr{I}_{1} & :=\\frac{1}{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)\\right|} \\int_{Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\left|\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right)-\\left\\langle f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)}\\right| d y \\\\\n\\mathscr{I}_{2} & :=\\frac{1}{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)\\right|} \\int_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\left|\\left(f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right)-\\left\\langle f-g_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)}\\right| d y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe split\n\n$$\n\\left\\langle g_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)}=\\left[1-\\frac{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)\\right|}\\right]\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)}+\\frac{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{2}}\\right)\\right|}\\left\\langle g_{\\varepsilon}\\right\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhich together with (A.10) implies\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathscr{I}_{1} & \\leq \\mathcal{O}\\left(f ;

We first deal with the case $x, y \\notin Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)$. If $x, y \\notin Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$, then $g_{\\varepsilon}(x)=g_{\\varepsilon}(y)$. If $x, y \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)$, we have $Q_{x} \\cup Q_{y} \\subset Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right), \\ell\\left(Q_{x}\\right)=\\ell\\left(Q_{y}\\right)=2^{j_{1}-2 j_{0}}$, and\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|g_{\\varepsilon}(x)-g_{\\varepsilon}(y)\\right|=\\left|\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{x}}-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{y}}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq\\left|\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{x}}-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right|+\\left|\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{y}}-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\oint_{Q_{x}}\\left|f-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right|+\\oint_{Q_{y}}\\left|f-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq\\left[\\frac{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|Q_{x}\\right|}+\\frac{\\left|Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|Q_{y}\\right|}\\right] \\oint_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\left|f-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right| \\\\\n& =2^{2 n j_{0}+1} \\mathcal{O}\\left(f ; Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right) \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere (A.11) was used in the last step. If $x \\notin Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$ and $y \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)$, then the inequality (A.11) gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left|g_{\\varepsilon}(x)-g_{\\varepsilon}(y)\\right|=\\left|\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)}-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q_{y}}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq \\oint_{Q_{y}}\\left|f-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right|+\\oint_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)}\\left|f-\\langle f\\rangle_{Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)}\\right| \\\\\n& \\leq\\left(2^{(2 j_{0}+1) n}+2^{n}\\right) \\mathcal{O}\\left(f ; Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)\\right) \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA similar argument holds in the case $x \\in Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right) \\backslash Q\\left(2^{j_{1}-1}\\right)$ and $y \\notin Q\\left(2^{j_{1}}\\right)$.\nLet us turn to the situation $\\bar{Q}_{x} \\cap \\bar{Q}_{y} \\neq \\varnothing$.

The first main result is a compact\n$T1$ theorem for multilinear Calder\\'{o}n--Zygmund operators on product spaces.\nMore specifically, we prove that a multilinear singular integral operator $T$\non product spaces can be extended to a compact multilinear operator from\n$L^{p_1}(w_1^{p_1}) \\times \\cdots \\times L^{p_m}(w_m^{p_m})$ to $L^p(w^p)$ for\nall exponents $\\frac1p = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\frac{1}{p_j}>0$ with $p_1, \\ldots, p_m\n\\in (1, \\infty]$ and for all weights $\\vec{w} \\in A_{\\vec{p}}(\\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^{n_2})$ if the following hypotheses are satisfied: (H1) $T$\nadmits a compact full kernel representation, (H2) $T$ admits a compact partial\nkernel representation, (H3) $T$ satisfies the weak compactness property, (H4)\n$T$ satisfies the diagonal $\\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, and (H5) $T$ satisfies the\nproduct $\\mathrm{CMO}$ condition. This is a multilinear compact extension of\nJourn\\'{e}'s $T1$ theorem on product spaces. The second main result establishes\nthe mean continuity of commutators $[\\boldsymbol{b}, T]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$\non weighted Lebesgue spaces as above, which can be viewed as a substitution of\ncompactness because the compactness of $[\\boldsymbol{b},\nT]_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}$ is equivalent to $\\boldsymbol{b} \\equiv\n\\text{constant}$ when $T$ is a non-degenerate bi-parameter singular integral.\nOur main tools include multilinear bi-parameter dyadic representation,\nmultilinear extrapolation, multilinear interpolation, and Kolmogorov--Riesz\ncompactness criterion.", "updated": "2025-03-19T08:38:07Z", "published": "2024-10-14T09:05:55Z"}
